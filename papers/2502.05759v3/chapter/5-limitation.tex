\section{Limitations}
While RLEdit demonstrates promising results in lifelong editing tasks, several limitations should be acknowledged. Our evaluation methodology follows conventional datasets from existing model editing literature, primarily focusing on factual knowledge modifications without exploring other data domains. Furthermore, the capability of post-edited LLMs in processing multi-hop information remains unexplored in our current study. Although achieving robust lifelong editing capabilities continues to pose significant challenges, our future work will extend these experiments, potentially providing valuable insights for advancing research in lifelong editing.
