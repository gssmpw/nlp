\section{Content of DDPs provided by YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram.}
\label{appendix:DDP}
Table \ref{Tab: DDPInformation} presents an overview of the content included in the DDPs offered by these three platforms. Note that although Instagram has cookies field it just shows the last four digits of the cookie name and no other details.

\subsection{Awareness about the GDPR right of access}
\label{appendix: Awareness}
%\ad{Another candidate to get into appendix.}
\textbf{Survey setup}: In the first component, we first tried to educate our participants about Article 15 of the GDPR and how they can request their data from online platforms. 
% Ingmar: Could the example of a DDP not be embedded in the survey? Was it embedded? Did they have to click to look at it? -- If they only "could" see, but might not actually see, then this could be problematic 
We also provided a link to a Google Drive folder where they could see an example of a DDP. 
At this stage, we asked our participants three questions regarding (1) whether they were aware of such right before taking our survey, (2) whether they had exercised this right by requesting their data, and (3) if they had exercised their rights, then why.
We designed this part of the survey to understand the general awareness of the participants and make them aware of the said right. 
% \sz{u can also put the full survey in the appendix or supplementary material in case the reviewers want to have a look (e.g., to see the specific phrasing of these questions)}

%We recruited 400 participants in total, 100 each from France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Table \ref{Tab: Demographics} shows the user demographics. 
\noindent
\textbf{Observations}: Out of the 400 participants, nearly $72\%$ participants responded that they were aware of the right of access to data before participating in our survey.
At the same time, only $29.2\%$ of them answered in affirmation when it comes to exercising their rights by requesting the data on some platform. 
Although there is a massive gap between awareness and exercise of the data requests, the numbers are surprisingly high.
We also asked our participants to provide reasons for exercising their data requests in free-form tex.
Through manual annotations the responses were characterized into four groups. 
% \iw{Including the "requested data for a study", there are four groups listed below. this needs clarification}
Almost half of the participants (51\%) mentioned \textit{curiosity}, knowing what information platforms collect about them, to be the primary reason for their data request.
Further, 18\% mentioned \textit{seeking specific information}, e.g., identifying a song they had listened to earlier, cross-checking specific details, or determining the amount of time spent on the platform, etc., as the primary reason for their requests.
Finally, 11\% of our participants made their requests to \textit{keep a backup}.% of their personal data.

Interestingly, one-fifth of the participants (20\%) mentioned that they requested data from several platforms for participating in some research study. 
Note that several recent studies--for understanding social media-- use data donations from users on Prolific (\cite{yang2024coupling}, \cite{vombatkere2024tiktok}) and other crowd-sourcing platforms as their primary data source.
% \sz{put refs?}
This observation likely explains the surprisingly high percentage of awareness and exercise statistics that we reported above.
