\section{Open science}
\label{sec:open_science}

We comply with standard open science guidelines to the fullest extent permitted by the terms and conditions outlined in the ERB approval that we obtained.
To this end, we publicly share multiple materials that we utilized to carry out our research project in~\Cref{Sec:Appendix}.
Specifically, we provide details on the surveys which we conducted in~\Cref{appendix:survey}.
These details include the exact questions and choices that we gave to our participants.
Moreover, we present details on the prompts we fed to the LLM and the responses that we got from the LLM also in~\Cref{appendix:survey}.

As previously stated in~\Cref{sec:ethics}, according to the terms outlined in our approved ERB proposal, we would remove all the DDPs that we collected in~\Cref{Sec: Reliability} from our database after the completion of our research project.
Therefore, we cannot make these anonymized DDPs publicly available.
