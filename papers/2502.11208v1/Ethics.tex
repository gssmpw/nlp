\section{Ethics considerations}
\label{sec:ethics}
\vspace*{-9pt}
We placed the highest priority on ensuring that our research project adheres to standard ethical guidelines.
To this end, and before initiating our study, we acquired approval from the Ethical Review Board (ERB) of our University.
Before surveying a participant or obtaining their DDPs, we provided them with an online consent form and asked them to meticulously review the outlined terms in the consent form and explicitly provide us with their consent to these terms.
We refrained from collecting any PII from our participants who took part in our surveys and donated us their DDPs.
Specifically, we removed any available PII inside the DDPs at the front-end and also anonymize them before they are sent to our back-end server.
Furthermore, according to the stated terms and conditions in the ERB approval, we took stringent measures to protect the privacy of our participants.
In particular, we would not share their donated anonymized DDPs with any third parties, and we would completely remove these DDPs within a specified time after the conclusion of our study.\\
When conducting our surveys, we ensured that the questions did not pose any potential risks to our participants.
Specifically, when surveying our participants on different representations of the DDPs, we filled out data categories based on sample DDPs that our research team obtained from their own personal accounts on the studied platforms.
Moreover, we checked the contents of these data categories and verified that they do not endanger our participants in any way. We utilized bot accounts that exclusively interacted with publicly available content on the platforms to carry out one part of our experiments in~\Cref{Sec: Reliability}.
We took multiple steps to minimize the inadvertent consequences of running these bot accounts.
To this extent, we intentionally distributed the incurred overhead of our experiment over multiple short browsing sessions to prevent causing any sort of disruptions to the short-format video platforms.
Specifically, on a single day of our experiment, a bot account had only one video browsing session and viewed up to a maximum of 25 short-format videos.
Moreover, although our bot accounts tangibly engaged with some videos by liking them, we used only three bot accounts across all the platforms, so we do not foresee any potential harm resulting from these activities.
Furthermore, although the Terms of Service of the studied platforms prohibit the usage of automated bots, the benefits of our study outweigh any potential risks associated with the activities conducted by our bot accounts. Finally, we affirm that we fully conformed to ethical research standards throughout our work~\cite{rivers2014ethical}.
This includes but is not limited to, presenting our findings in aggregate form and guaranteeing the anonymity of all our participants.
