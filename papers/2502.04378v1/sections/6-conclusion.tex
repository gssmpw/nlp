\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, the synergy of captioning, LLM-driven counterfactuals, and control-conditioned diffusion effectively reveals model weaknesses and increases robustness. Future work will compare with additional baselines and explore prioritization of the generated test cases.
