Metamorphic testing has emerged as an effective approach to test DL-based systems without explicit test oracles~\cite{DBLP:conf/icse/ZhouLKGZ0Z020, DBLP:journals/pacmse/ChenJYGZC24}.
Notably, DeepTest~\cite{DBLP:conf/icse/TianPJR18} applies a simple image transformations, such as brightness and contrast adjustments, translations, rotations, and blurs, to generate synthetic images that represent real-world conditions. DeepRoad~\cite{DBLP:conf/kbse/ZhangZZ0K18} is a metamorphic testing approach that generates various driving conditions (foggy and snowy) using complex computer vision techniques such as GAN.
DeepXplore~\cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/PeiCYJ19} employs a white-box testing approach, with the aim of increasing neuron coverage and uncovering inconsistent behaviors in different models under the same input conditions. 
Existing approaches either rely on simple transformations that may not replicate real-world effects or use complex methods like GANs, which require extensive training and scenario-specific data collection. In contrast, \approach generates diverse and realistic test cases without the need for ad-hoc training, significantly improving the scope and applicability of metamorphic testing.

Data augmentation~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2407-04103} is commonly used during training to improve model robustness by generating various variations of existing data. Recent advances in language-guided and diffusion-based methods have enabled sophisticated augmentations, often preserving spatial structure and semantic consistency~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2409-13661,DBLP:conf/icst/LambertenghiS24}. For example, Dataset Interfaces~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2302-07865} alter minor aspects such as backgrounds to simulate distribution shifts while maintaining class relevance. ALIA~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/DunlapUZYGD23} combines image captioning and language models to create semantic integrity-targeted augmentations for robust training. While Dataset Interfaces focus on shifting contextual factors and ALIA operates on sets of images to augment training data, \approach takes a more granular approach by captioning each image individually. This allows \approach to explore modifications customized to the specific context of each image.
