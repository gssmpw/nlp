\section{Additional Qualitative Results}

\subsection{Results on Monocular Datasets}
While 4D dynamic scene editing typically relies on multiview video datasets to sufficiently capture spatio-temporal information, we evaluate our method on the DyCheck~\cite{ref_72_dycheck} and HyperNeRF~\cite{ref_73_hypernerf} datasets to explore its potential applicability to monocular video inputs. For these monocular datasets, we cannot obtain edited multiview supervision images for editing canonical 3D Gaussians. Therefore, we skip Stage 1 (described in Sec.~\ref{subsec::4.2}) and only apply Stage 2, the score-based temporal refinement (described in Sec.~\ref{subsec::4.3}). Figure~\ref{fig:suppl_dycheck} presents a comparison between Instruct 4D-to-4D (\emph{baseline}) and Instruct-4DGS (\emph{ours}) on the DyCheck dataset, while Fig.~\ref{fig:suppl_hypernerf} shows qualitative results of our method on the HyperNeRF dataset. Our Instruct-4DGS produces plausible dynamic scene editing results even on monocular datasets, and we expect the performance to further improve as techniques for reconstructing 4D Gaussians from monocular videos and editing with the SDS mechanism continue to advance.


\subsection{Results with Varying Camera Poses}
To further assess the spatial consistency and quality of our edited 4D Gaussian representations, we render the edited dynamic scenes from the DyNeRF~\cite{ref_37_neural3dvideo} dataset under various camera poses. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:suppl_dynerf}, the results produced by our Instruct-4DGS maintain plausible geometry and appearance across different viewpoints.
