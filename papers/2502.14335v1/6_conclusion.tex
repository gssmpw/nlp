Product reviews contain a wealth of information that has been mined only shallowly over the years. 
We introduce a broad typology of information types that we show is quite useful for multiple popular downstream tasks on review data.
Thanks to an effective LLM-based predictor, our large-scale experiments and analyses can assist future endeavours to maximally benefit from the many available product reviews on the web. 
The revealed \taxtypes{} can also be used as-is for filtering information according to particular needs of customers or vendors, such as only showing descriptions of the product, or only suggesting improvements.

We advocate pursuing similar broad-ranged research on other domains, elaborating on our initial review-focused typology, enabling informed approaches for even more downstream applications. 


%Using our typology and simple annotation method, a study of persuasion and usefulness can be held at both a scale and granularity that until today have been hard to conduct.
%Over the years in which the Internet has been pervasive, culture has shifted and with it perhaps readers' notion of what they find relevant to their decision-making process.
