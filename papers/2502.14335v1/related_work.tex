Categorizing texts into classes or taxonomies has been researched extensively across domains and on different lengths of texts.

Sentence-level taxonomies:
\citep{core1997dialog_annotation, jurafsky1997discourse_structure} define annotation scheme for communicative acts in dialog, part of which addresses the form and content. \citep{khoo2006email_classification} on intents and communicative forms in emails.

\citep{yu2012product_title_categories} product title classification to the product category.

\citep{li2002question_classification} question multi-label classification into a taxonomy of answer types as adopted from TREC (6 classes).

\citep[SST][]{socher2013finegrained_sentiment} fine-grained (5-class) sentiment analysis of movie review phrases.

\citep{pang2004subjective_reviews} subjective/objective sentence or phrases in movie reviews.

\citep{guo2019sentence_classification_dl} use augmented CNNs and LSTMs to solve sentence classification on several benchmarks and domains.

\citep{chai2020rl_classification} yse RL across benchmarks and domains for single-label and mlti-label.

\citep{go2009sentiment_distant} use distant supervision for sentiment analysis on micro-blog posts.

\citep{Brack2022classification_transfer} use a hierarchical transformer-based \citep{beltagy2019scibert} model and show how to effectively train the model so that it transfers across domain for sentence classification.

Product insights:
\citep{hirsch2021producttips} product tips from reviews. Also talk about different kinds of sentences (short, enthusiactic, listing-specific, personal) that are usually not tips, and use lexical match heuristically to find these.


\citep{yin2019zeroshot_classification} study zero-shot text classification and propose an NLI-based framework for it.

\citep{zhang2021zeroshot_classification} zero-shot event and argument classification using SRL tools and a pre-trained LM.

\citep{Tesfagergish2022zeroshot_classification} zero-shot emotion classification using pre-trained language models that were trained on different nli tasks.

\citep{wiebe2005opinionAnnotation} annotation of opinions, emotions, sentiments, speculations, evaluations and other private states in language, in the news domain.

\citep{chen2022argumentMiningForHelpfulness} annotate arguments in reviews at the level of opinions/facts and evidence, and show its relation to helpfullness of a review.

\citep{liu2017argsForHelpfullness} inject argument features to predict a review's helpfulness.
