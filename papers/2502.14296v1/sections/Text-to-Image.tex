\subsection{Preliminary}
Text-to-image models such as Dall-E 3 \cite{dalle3} have emerged as a powerful class of generative models in the text-to-image generation field, showcasing remarkable advancements in synthesizing high-quality images from textual descriptions \cite{zhang2023text, elasri2022image, stabilityai2024sd35, blackforestlabs2024flux1.1pro}. They have been widely applied in art and design \cite{Midjourneycopyright}, healthcare \cite{wu2024medsegdiff,kim2024adaptive} and fashion \cite{kim2024stableviton,xu2024ootdiffusion} domain.

% The majority of text-to-image models are diffusion models, which are distinguished by their ability to generate complex and detailed images through a process that iteratively refines random noise into coherent visuals \cite{croitoru2023diffusion, yang2023diffusion, cao2024survey}. While diffusion models are currently the mainstream in text-to-image generation, autoregressive (AR) models are also gaining more attention for their effectiveness in this field recently \cite{liu2024lumina, han2024infinity}.

% Since Diffusion models were initially introduced with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) \cite{ho2020denoising}, researchers have made significant advancements to enhance their performance and applicability \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion, nichol2021glide, saharia2022photorealistic, rombach2022high, choi2022perception, hu2023self}. 
% For instance, GLIDE \cite{nichol2021glide} leverages CLIP \cite{radford2021learning} for text conditioning, allowing more accurate alignment between textual prompts and generated images, and facilitating fine-grained control over the image generation process. Nichol and Dhariwal proposed a modified diffusion model architecture that substantially improved image synthesis quality and diversity \cite{dhariwal2021diffusion}. Additionally, Choi et al. introduced a perception-prioritized training method, which enhanced the model's ability to learn visual concepts \cite{choi2022perception}. Imagen \cite{saharia2022photorealistic} utilizes a combination of large-scale text-to-image pre-training and diffusion processes to achieve exceptional image quality, high resolution, and photorealism. Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) operate in a latent space rather than pixel space, significantly accelerating the image generation process while maintaining high fidelity and consistency \cite{rombach2022high}. More recently, Hu et al. developed a self-guided diffusion model that further improved controllability and generation effectiveness \cite{hu2023self}. Furthermore, Stable Diffusion \cite{stablediffusionweb} has gained popularity for its stability and control over the generation process, allowing users to generate images with specific attributes more reliably.

% Diffusion models excel in generating complex, detailed, and high-quality images with fine-grained control and scalability. In parallel, autoregressive (AR) models have also made significant contributions to text-to-image generation and demonstrate efficiency and scalability in modeling sequences for text-to-image tasks. CogView \cite{ding2021cogview} utilizes a VQ-VAE tokenizer to generate images from textual descriptions, while Parti \cite{yu2022scaling} utilizes ViT-VQGAN to encode images and discrete tokens, enabling the model to generate images. Lumina-mGPT \cite{liu2024lumina} employs a transformer architecture with multimodal generative pretraining to model sequences of text and image tokens through next-token prediction. LlamaGen \cite{sun2024autoregressive} applies the next-token prediction paradigm of large language models to the visual domain, leveraging a Transformer architecture without inductive biases on visual signals. VAR \cite{tian2024visual} redefines image generation as coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of AR transformers for visual data.

Despite these advancements, text-to-image models are still faced with many challenges. Like other generative models, text-to-image models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts can lead to unexpected or undesirable outputs \cite{yang2024sneakyprompt, gao2024rt, chin2024prompting4debugging, tsai2024ring, yang2024mma}. This vulnerability poses risks, such as the generation of content that does not align with the provided text~\cite{ma2024jailbreaking,yang2024sneakyprompt,qu2023unsafe}. Moreover, the potential for these models to inadvertently leak sensitive information from the training data is a significant concern \cite{technologyreview2023, scottishsun2023, lemonde2024}. The models might memorize and reproduce elements from the training set, leading to privacy issues~\cite{shi2024anonymization,wu2022membership}. Such a simple memorization of training data may lead to another critical concern: the generation of biased content. Despite efforts to mitigate these problems, models may still produce harmful outputs due to biases present in the training data~\cite{wan2024survey,lin2023word,naik2023social}. Text-to-image models can exhibit sensitivity to small perturbations in the input prompts, which can cause substantial variations in the generated images. This issue highlights the need for improved robustness against such perturbations~\cite{gao2023evaluating,milliere2022adversarial,zhuang2023pilot,sushko2025realedit}. Recent research has focused on these concerns by developing new attack and defense mechanisms. Studies such as Zhang et al. \cite{zheng2023understanding} explore novel adversarial techniques, while Golda et al. \cite{golda2024privacy} investigate approaches to enhance privacy protection. 

% While significant progress has been made in the field of text-to-image generation through both diffusion and autoregressive models, numerous challenges persist, including safety vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, fairness issues, robustness limitations, and Truthfulness problems. 
% As models exhibit sensitivity to minor input perturbations. 
% Addressing these challenges requires developing stronger defense mechanisms, and enhancing model robustness to ensure safe, fair, and reliable text-to-image generation. 
In this section, we are going to explore specific aspects of these challenges, including truthfulness, safety, fairness, privacy, and robustness, and we will introduce methods to construct dynamic datasets designed to benchmark and evaluate the performance of current image generation models against these critical dimensions.


\subsection{Truthfulness}
\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} Truthfulness in T2I models refers to the precise generation of images according to the user's query, which is commonly prompt or keyword sequence, as well as other conditions such as layout \cite{zheng2023layoutdiffusion}, segmentation \citep{couairon2022diffedit}, style \citep{sohn2023styledrop}. This principle requires models to follow users' requirements and fidely generate images. 


\textbf{\textit{Truthfulness evaluation.}} Traditionally, truthfulness has been evaluated using metric-based methods like FID \citep{heusel2017gans}, SSIM \citep{wang2004image}, and LPIPS \citep{zhang2018unreasonable}, or model-based methods such as Inception Score (IS) \citep{salimans2016improved}, CLIP-score \citep{hessel2021clipscore}, and DINO-score \citep{caron2021emerging}. These approaches typically calculate a score and set a threshold to determine whether the generated image satisfies the input requirements. However, these metrics lack an accurate measurement method, as evaluating truthfulness requires advanced compositional reasoning skills \citep{ma2023crepe, hsieh2024sugarcrepe, dumpala2024sugarcrepe++}. Some studies have demonstrated that lightweight model-based methods, including those using CLIP-score \citep{hessel2021clipscore}, struggle with compositional text prompts involving multiple objects, attribute bindings, spatial/action relations, counting, and logical reasoning \citep{kamath2023text, Lin2023RevisitingTR, Ma2022CC, Yuksekgonul2022WhenAW, Wang2023EquivariantSF}. An increasing number of research efforts are focusing on formulating conditions in text and decomposing textual conditions via LLMs into atomic modular components using a divide-and-conquer approach, then formulated into visual question-answer pairs \citep{hu2023tifa, cho2023davidsonian, ghosh2024geneval, lin2024evaluating}. Subsequently, a VLM is employed to perform Yes-or-No evaluations on these images and QA pairs, ultimately calculating a truthfulness score for the caption. Recently, VQAscore also evolved towards end-to-end approaches, leveraging the next token probabilities of VLMs to calculate a score for condition-generation truthfulness alignment \citep{Lin2024EvaluatingTG}, providing a more reliable and human-like assessment of how well the generated image aligns with the given conditions. 




\textbf{\textit{Benchmark Setting.}} As shown in \autoref{fig:t2i-truthfulness-pipeline}, we develop our truthfulness evaluation engine based on GenVerse \citep{gao2024generate} to generate a dataset of image captions for benchmarking truthfulness within text-to-image models. GenVerse maintains vocabularies of entities, attributes, and relations (collectively referred to as elements), and samples these terms based on their real-world frequency distributions, which can be used to construct almost infinite captions. These sampled elements are then arranged into keyword sequences using templates, which are subsequently rephrased into natural language sentences by an LLM to reflect typical user expressions. During the sampling process, we implement two key checks to ensure diversity: Similarity Checking, which prevents the oversampling of identical elements, and Group Checking, which maintains sufficient distinction between different groups of elements. We also store the distribution of sampled data to enhance diversity in newly constructed datasets. For evaluation, we employ a VQA-based approach as previously mentioned. Using the sampled entities, attributes, and relations, we leverage TIFA \citep{hu2023tifa} to enable atomic and interpretable evaluation, with \textit{`yes'} answer count as 1 and \textit{`no'} as 0. We calculate the truthfulness sample-wise and average the whole set into our final truthfulness score. This allows us to assess the truthfulness within image generative models by accurately rendering each required element. In our dynamic updating setting, we record how frequently each element has been sampled in previous benchmark generations. New samples are designed to avoid duplicating previous elements, ensuring caption diversity across real-world element distributions.

\textbf{\textit{Result Analysis.}} In \autoref{fig:t2i_Truthfulness_res}, we show the TIFA setting for evaluating truthfulness within mainstream T2I models. A higher score means higher truthfulness, generating images accurately following users' requirements.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{7cm}

    \caption{Truthfulness in T2I models.}
    \label{fig:t2i_Truthfulness_res}
    \vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textit{\ul{All mainstream T2I models underperform in truthfulness, with proprietary model Dall-E 3 showing the best performance.}} In evaluating image generation accuracy relative to user queries, Dall-E 3 achieves the highest truthfulness score, successfully incorporating more entities and attributes compared to other open-source models. However, all models struggle with complex prompts containing multiple objects and global scene attributes, highlighting that truthfulness in current T2I models requires further alignment, particularly in accurately depicting relationships between entities.

\textit{\ul{T2I models fall short in generating complex scenes with more elements.}} Upon detailed examination of the model-generated images by human annotators, we observed that while the model demonstrates remarkable aesthetic achievement and maintains strong internal stylistic coherence and atmospheric quality, it encounters significant challenges when generating complex scenes - particularly those containing multiple objects and their interrelationships. The model struggles to effectively organize spatial relationships between objects, often simply placing them within the scene without meaningful connection, resulting in lower evaluation scores. Similarly, the model tends to focus on primary objects during image generation, leading to inadequate rendering of other elements, which ultimately compromises the overall truthfulness within T2I models.

\subsection{Safety}
\label{sec:t2i_safety}
\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} T2I models possess a strong capacity for image generation but are prone to producing harmful content \cite{purging_problematic_content}. This issue is often exacerbated by potential toxic content present in training datasets, leading T2I models to generate discriminatory images targeting specific groups \cite{dark_reality_stable_diffusion}. To address these vulnerabilities, extensive research has focused on the safety of T2I models~\cite{schramowski2023safe, gandikota2023erasing, liu2024latent, yoon2025safree}, exploring various threats including jailbreak attacks and defenses \cite{Li2024ARTAR, rando2022red, yang2024sneakyprompt, han2024shielddiff}, backdoor/trojan attacks \cite{Chou_2023_CVPR,Chen_2023_CVPR,chou2024villandiffusion,an2024elijah}, inversion attacks \cite{10458692, li2024model}, among others.

    \label{fig:t2i}
    \vspace{-15pt}
\end{figure}

\textbf{\textit{Jailbreak \& Red-Teaming.}} Li et al. propose an Automatic Red-Teaming framework (ART) to systematically evaluate safety risks in text-to-image models by identifying vulnerabilities between unsafe generations and their prompts \cite{Li2024ARTAR}. Rando et al. demonstrate how easily disturbing content can bypass the safety filter. By reverse-engineering the filter, they discover that it focuses on blocking sexual content while overlooking violence, gore, and other equally disturbing material \cite{rando2022red}. SneakyPrompt is proposed by Yang et al. \cite{yang2024sneakyprompt}, which is an automated attack framework that uses reinforcement learning to jailbreak text-to-image generative models like Dall-E 2 \cite{DALLE-2} and Stable Diffusion \cite{rombach2022high}, outperforming existing adversarial attacks in terms of efficiency and image quality. Chin et al. introduced Prompting4Debugging (P4D), a tool designed to automatically identify jailbreak prompts in T2I models by latent noise prediction, to test the effectiveness of their safety mechanisms \cite{chin2024prompting4debugging}. Han et al. present a method to eliminate Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content while maintaining image quality by fine-tuning a T2I model using reinforcement learning with a content-safe reward function \cite{han2024shielddiff}. Some studies focus on how to jailbreak T2I models in black-box settings \cite{yang2024sneakyprompt,dang2024diffzoo,gao2024rt}. For instance, DiffZOO \cite{dang2024diffzoo} is a purely black-box attack method for text-to-image diffusion models that do not require prior knowledge, by using Zeroth Order Optimization for gradient approximations. 
Ring-A-Bell \cite{tsai2024ring} is a black-box red-teaming tool based on genetic algorithms for testing text-to-image models.

To mitigate such safety problems, Das et al. introduce Espresso, a robust concept filter for diffusion-based text-to-image models that effectively removes unacceptable concepts while preserving utility for acceptable concepts and defending against adversarial prompts \cite{das2024espresso}. Park et al. propose a new method for text-to-image generation that addresses ethical concerns by recognizing and localizing immoral visual attributes in generated images and manipulating them into morally acceptable alternatives \cite{Park_2024_WACV}. Moreover, Yoon et al. propose SAFREE, a training-free approach for safe text-to-image and video generation, without altering the model's weights. This is achieved by introducing joint filtering in both text embedding and visual latent space, ensuring the quality and safety of the generated outputs \cite{yoon2025safree}. Some research also emphasizes the importance of iterative safety assessments to promote responsible development of T2I models \cite{T2Ihuman}.

\textbf{\textit{Other Safety Concerns.}} A recent study \cite{zhang2023generate} reveals the lack of robustness of current safety-driven unlearning techniques when applied to diffusion models. Some studies also delve into the model inversion attacks (MIAs) of T2I models \cite{10458692, li2024model}. Chou et al. propose BadDiffusion \cite{Chou_2023_CVPR}, a novel framework for backdoor attacks on diffusion models, followed up with many related works on backdoor attack \cite{chou2024villandiffusion, sui2024disdet}. Duan et al. propose Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference (SecMI), a query-based membership inference attack (MIA) that determines memberships by evaluating the alignment of forward process posterior estimates at each timestep \cite{pmlr-v202-duan23b}. Chen et al. introduce TrojDiff \cite{Chen_2023_CVPR}, the first Trojan attack method against diffusion models, demonstrating the models' vulnerability to such attacks through extensive experiments. Given the limitations of previous methods in perceptibility and transferability \cite{jia2022adv, yuan2022natural}, Chen et al. introduce DiffAttack, the first to use diffusion models for imperceptible and transferable adversarial attacks \cite{chen2023diffusion}. 

% Shen et al. examine the threat of "prompt stealing attacks" in text-to-image generation models, introducing a method called PromptStealer that effectively steals prompts from generated images, posing risks to intellectual property and prompt marketplaces \cite{promptstealing}. \neil{I think prompt stealing for text-to-image is a weird problem and we can remove such discussion.} \neil{For other safety concerns, you may want to discuss detecting T2I-generated images, e.g., using watermarks. This paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13553 may be helpful for this.}

\textit{\textbf{Benchmark Setting.}} We benchmark the ability of text-to-image models to refuse to generate NSFW content images. (1) \textit{Unsafe topics.} We focus on six NSFW topics including Self-harm and Suicide, Sexual Content, Gore and Violence, Hate, Drugs, and Illegal Activities as shown in \autoref{tab:NSFW_topics}. More instances of these NSFW image descriptions can be found in Appendix \ref{app:nsfw_example}. (2) \textit{Evaluation method.} To assess whether generated images contain NSFW content that matches their descriptions, we employ VLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate the presence of inappropriate content. The Safety score is calculated as the proportion of images containing NSFW content, formally expressed as: 
$\text{Safety Score} = \left(1 - \frac{\text{\#NSFW images}}{\text{\#Total images}}\right) \times 100\%$

\textit{\textbf{Dynamic Dataset.}} LLMs are utilized to generate the NSFW-related image descriptions here. As we find most LLMs will decline to answer instructions when directly prompting these LLMs to generate NSFW image descriptions. In addition, some LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) often generate poor-quality image descriptions unrelated to NSFW content, although these models could answer the direct generation instruction. To address these challenges, we transform this generation task into two stages (as shown in \autoref{fig:t2i}). Before generation, we extracted a pool of NSFW keywords and phrases from the VISU dataset~\cite{poppi2024safe} for reference. In the first stage, we query LLM to generate benign image descriptions from five aspects: Basic Understanding, Spatial Understanding, Semantic Understanding, Reasoning Understanding, and Atmospheric Understanding inspired by the previous study \cite{bao2024autobench}. As this has nothing to do with the NSFW content, the model works well in the task (\emph{i.e.}, will not refuse to answer). In the second stage, we randomly sample NSFW keywords or phrases from the pool and prompt GPT-3.5 to rephrase the benign image description generated in stage 1 into NSFW ones containing the sampled keywords and phrases. By doing this, we transform the harder NSFW generation task into a simpler sentence rewriting task with given NSFW keywords.

It is important to acknowledge that adversarial prompt engineering techniques, such as SneakyPrompt~\cite{yang2024sneakyprompt}, are not considered scalable solutions for generating NSFW content in the evaluation. It relies on strategically perturbing prompts to bypass LLM safety mechanisms, which are more relevant in adversarial settings. This means that our focus is not on security against adversarial attacks but rather on evaluating safety in scenarios involving typical user interactions with LLMs.

% Instead, our benchmark aims to measure safety for regular users, where NSFW-related prompts may be accidentally issued during normal usage. 

% \neil{Acknowledge that adversarial prompts such that those generated by SneakyPrompt are not considered to be scalable. However, the benchmark prompts may be accidentally used by regular users. Thus our benchmark aims to measure the safety for regular users, instead of security in adversarial settings where attackers can use jailbreak attacks such as SneakyPrompt to strategically perturb the prompts.}

\textit{\textbf{Result Analysis.}} In \autoref{fig:t2i_saefty_res}, we show the percentage of NSFW images generated by the text-to-image model after inputting NSFW descriptions.

\textit{\ul{Considerable variation exists in NSFW image generation among text-to-image models.}} 
% As illustrated in \autoref{fig:t2i_saefty_res}, SD-3.5-large and SD-3.5-large-turbo have the highest NSFW generation rates, at 0.53 and 0.47, respectively, suggesting weaker filtering or greater sensitivity to such prompts. In contrast, Dall-E 3, with its robust external moderation system, has the lowest rate at 0.06, indicating that this external moderator\footnote{\url{https://cdn.openai.com/papers/DALL_E_3_System_Card.pdf}} plays a critical role in maintaining safer content generation.
As illustrated in \autoref{fig:t2i_saefty_res}, Dall-E 3 demonstrates excellent performance, achieving the highest Safety Score at 94. This highlights the effectiveness of its robust external moderation system\footnote{\url{https://cdn.openai.com/papers/DALL_E_3_System_Card.pdf}} in ensuring safer content generation. In contrast, SD-3.5-large and SD-3.5-large-turbo show weaker filtering or greater sensitivity to such prompts, with the lowest score of 47 and 53, respectively.

\subsection{Fairness}

\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} As T2I models continue to advance, discussions on fairness have become increasingly prominent \cite{friedrich2023fair, kou-etal-2024-rat}. There is considerable debate around defining fairness within the context of these models, as explored across multiple studies \cite{mehrabi2021survey, dignum2021myth, jalal2021fairness}. 

Research has shown that T2I models often perpetuate stereotypes about certain groups \cite{bianchi2023easily, wang2023t2iat, jha2024visage}. For example, studies \cite{wang2023t2iat, cho2023dall, fraser2024examining} have identified significant gender bias, particularly severe stereotypes against non-cisgender individuals, as highlighted by Ungless et al. \cite{ungless2023stereotypes}. Additionally, racial stereotypes are embedded in these models, as noted in studies by Fraser et al. and Wang et al. \cite{fraser2024examining, wang2023t2iat}. Furthermore, Basu et al. and Qadri et al. have discussed regional biases, including negative stereotypes associated with individuals from South Africa \cite{basu2023inspecting, qadri2023ai}. Bianchi et al. \cite{bianchi2023easily} have also identified demographic stereotypes, where prompts for generic objects reinforce American norms in the generated outputs.

Other studies indicate that T2I models may favor generating certain types of objects based on subtle subjective preferences. For instance, a recent study \cite{struppek2023exploiting} revealed cultural preference biases, showing that minor text alterations, such as changing the letter "o" to a visually similar character from another language, can shift image generation towards biases associated with the corresponding region.

In response to these concerns, new techniques and datasets are emerging to help identify and reduce fairness issues in T2I models. Jha et al. \cite{jha2024visage} introduced the ViSAGe dataset for global-scale stereotype analysis in T2I models. Gustafson et al. \cite{gustafson2023facet} proposed Facet, a tool for assessing image fairness. Wang et al. \cite{wang2023t2iat} provided methods to quantify social biases in images generated by diffusion models. Shen et al. \cite{shen2023finetuning} enhanced T2I model fairness through fine-tuning techniques, and Friedrich et al. \cite{friedrich2023fair} developed Fair Diffusion, which addresses bias by diversifying human input instructions across a wide range of identities.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{7cm}
    \vspace{-15pt}

    \vspace{-0.05in}
    \caption{The fairness score of each model.}
    \label{fig:t2i_fairness_res}
    \vspace{-15pt}
\end{wrapfigure}

\textit{\textbf{Benchmark Setting.}} 
% (1) \textit{Classification.} For evaluating fairness \yue{We are doing evaluation instead of enhancement, so do not use ``ensure'' here.} in text-to-image models, we primarily focus on identifying and detecting stereotypes related to gender and race. (2) \textit{Evaluation.} 
Our evaluation is about giving a piece of image description with an anonymized group entity (as shown in \autoref{tab:fairness_t2i}),
% The process involves extracting relevant entities from the stereotype-laden text and applying a fuzzification technique to obscure their identifiable entity. 
asking T2I models to generate the corresponding images in $n$ times (in our experiments, we set $n$ to $3$). For evaluation, we employ VLM-as-a-Judge \cite{chen2024mllm} to assess whether the entity associated with stereotypes appears in the generated images, as identifying the entity is a relatively straightforward task, which makes this assessment approach reliable.

Each image description receives a score based on the frequency with which the specified entity appears as the main element in the generated images. This score is calculated by dividing the number of images in which the entity is identified by the total number of generations $n$, i.e., $\text{score}_{\text{description}}$ = 1 - $\frac{\text{count of entity appearances}}{n}$. The final fairness score for each model is then obtained by averaging these individual scores across all image descriptions: $\text{Fairness Score} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Score}_i}{\text{\#Total images}} \times 100\%$



% Once stereotypes related to gender and race are identified, we anonymize the entities by generalizing specific characteristics (e.g., reframing “a \textbf{girl} is bad at math” as “a \textbf{child} who is bad at math”). We then utilize the text-to-image models under evaluation to generate images and assess their fairness via VLM-as-a-Judge.

\textit{\textbf{Dynamic Dataset.}} (a) the data is sourced from a dataset pool compiled from four primary datasets: CrowS-Pairs \cite{CrowSpairs}, StereoSet \cite{stereoset}, Do-Not-Answer \cite{wang2023donotanswer}, and the BBQ dataset \cite{bbq}. (b) Then we leverage LLM to paraphrase the data into image descriptions. This process involves extracting entities associated with stereotypes from the stereotype-laden text and applying a fuzzification to obscure the identifiable entity (as shown in \autoref{fig:t2i}). (c) Finally, these modified texts will be rewritten by LLMs, into clear, concrete descriptions for image generation, ensuring that the original meaning remains unchanged. Examples of this process are provided in \autoref{tab:fairness_t2i}.

\textit{\textbf{Result Analysis.}} We demonstrate the performance of each model on fairness in \autoref{fig:t2i_fairness_res}. 

% \textit{\underline{The result clearly illustrates a stratification in fairness scores among the text-to-image models.}} With Dall-E 3 exhibiting the lowest score of 66.1, indicating a significant severity of stereotypes. Several models, including SD-3.5-large and CogView-3-Plus, cluster closely together. This concentration of scores highlights the need for further investigation into the datasets used to train these models, as well as the potential to implement unfairness mitigation strategies to improve the fairness of generated output across the board.
\textit{\underline{The result clearly illustrates the concentration of fairness scores in the text-to-image model.} HunyuanDiT leads with the highest score of 95.5, while SD-3.5-large scores the lowest at 91.83. While the overall scores are relatively close, the differences highlight varying levels of fairness across models. HunyuanDiT and FLUX-1.1-Pro stand out with superior performance, scoring 95.5 and 94.73, respectively, while models like Playground-v2.5 and SD-3.5-large-turbo (both at 93.33) form a mid-tier group. Dall-E-3 and Kolors follow closely, with 92.38 and 92, indicating room for improvement in fairness.}

\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} In this section, robustness refers to the ability of T2I models to maintain result consistency in the face of variations in input text. 
According to Gao et al. \cite{gao2023evaluating}, although T2I models can generate high-quality images from text, their robustness against variations in input texts still has some shortcomings. In evaluation frameworks such as HRS-Bench and Holistic Evaluation \cite{bakr2023hrs, lee2024holistic}, robustness has been meticulously assessed. Liu et al. proposed RIATIG \cite{liu2023riatig}, which generates imperceptible prompts for T2I models, considering both adversarial robustness and overall stealth. Wu et al. \cite{wu2024robustness} tested the robustness of T2I models in the presence of added watermarks. Zhuang et al. show that only a five-character perturbation to the text prompt can cause the significant content shift of synthesized images using Stable Diffusion, which reveals that T2I models are rooted in the lack of robustness of text encoders \cite{Zhuang_2023_CVPR}.

At the same time, there are ways to improve robustness. Kim et al. \cite{kim2022diffusionclip} proposed an innovative noise combination method for achieving robust image manipulation. Xiao et al. \cite{xiao2023densepure} also proposed a method called DensePure, which enhances robustness by performing multiple denoising iterations through the reverse process of diffusion models and utilizing a classifier voting mechanism.

\textit{\textbf{Benchmark Setting.}} (1) \textit{Evaluation.} We evaluate the performance of the T2I models when giving the perturbed image descriptions compared with that of clean image descriptions. We evaluate the impact of perturbations on the text-to-image model by calculating the CLIPScore \citep{hessel2021clipscore} between the image and description before and after perturbation. We define a \textbf{Robustness Score} as the absolute difference between the original and perturbed CLIPScores, divided by the original CLIPScore. A higher score indicates greater sensitivity to perturbations: $\text{Robustness Score} = \left(1 - \frac{\left|\text{CLIPScore}_{\text{original}} - \text{CLIPScore}_{\text{perturbed}}\right|}{\text{CLIPScore}_{\text{original}}}\right) \times 100\%$.
(2) \textit{Perturbation types.} We have attempted to comprehensively cover various natural language perturbations (following methods used in LLM Robustness in \textbf{\S\ref{sec:llm_robustness}}, details in \autoref{fig:t2i}), including both programmatic and LLM-based approaches, to assess text-to-image model's robustness, as detailed in ~\autoref{tab:pertubation_types}. Importantly, these perturbation methods are designed to preserve the original sentence structure and semantics. 


% \neil{better to stress that the perturbations preserve the semantics of prompts. Otherwise, the T2I model is expected to generate different images after perturbation.}

\textit{\textbf{Dynamic Dataset.}} (a) Same as the benign image description generation stage in \textbf{\S\ref{sec:t2i_safety}}, we query LLM to dynamically generate image descriptions (including programmatic and LLM-based approaches). (b) Then we apply various perturbation transformations as shown in \autoref{tab:pertubation_types} to create perturbed image descriptions.

\textit{\textbf{Result Analysis.}} In \autoref{fig:t2i_robustness_res} and \autoref{tab:robustness_res}, we show the CLIPScore before and after the pertubations and robustness score of each text-to-image model.
 
\textit{\ul{Overall, the models show slight instability in robustness score after perturbation compared with that of clean inputs.}} As shown in \autoref{fig:t2i_robustness_res} and \autoref{tab:robustness_res}, These robustness scores range from 92.98 to 94.77. Playground-v2.5 has the lowest robustness score, indicating that it is most impacted by perturbations, suggesting potential instability. In contrast, Kolors has the highest robustness score, which implies greater stability in the face of perturbations. Additionally, both CogView-3-Plus and Dall-E 3 show a slight increase in CLIPScore after perturbation, suggesting that these models exhibit some resilience to input noise and adaptability to changes. Overall, while most models demonstrate a decline in performance under perturbation, certain models display a degree of elasticity and robustness, maintaining or even enhancing their alignment with textual descriptions.

\subsection{Privacy}

\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} 
% Privacy concerns are particularly relevant regarding how these models manage and potentially expose training data, where also related studies on this issue \cite{duan2023diffusion}.\neil{the second part of the sentence seems problematic} Ensuring that personal data is not inadvertently disclosed through generated images presents a challenge that necessitates advanced data management techniques and model training methodologies.
Privacy concerns are particularly pertinent when considering how these models handle and potentially expose training data, as highlighted by related studies on this issue \cite{duan2023diffusion}. Ensuring that personal data is not inadvertently disclosed through generated images represents a significant challenge, requiring the development of advanced data management strategies and robust model training methodologies.

Currently, industry research on this issue primarily focuses on adversarial content. For instance, Carlini et al. and Wang et al. \cite{carlini2023extracting, wang2023security} have addressed the problem of training data privacy leakage, noting that models can output specific training sample information. In experiments, they extracted over a thousand real training samples from models like Dall-E 2. Furthermore, even if models do not directly leak training data, synthetic image privacy issues still persist \cite{duan2023diffusion}.

To mitigate the risk of privacy leakage, researchers have proposed various defense strategies. Machine unlearning can assist DMs in forgetting specific private training content. Zhang et al. introduced a method called Forget-Me-Not \cite{zhang2024forget}, which enables Stable Diffusion to forget information containing privacy. Xu et al. \cite{xu2024pac} applied Differential Privacy techniques during training to ensure that the model does not over-memorize specific details from the training data. In terms of facial privacy protection, Shamshad et al. \cite{shamshad2023clip2protect} applied adversarial perturbations to facial images, enhancing anti-forgery capabilities without compromising generation quality. Deepprivacy \cite{hukkelaas2019deepprivacy} implemented a method to anonymize images while preserving data distribution, making them suitable for further training. Diff-privacy \cite{he2024diff} designed embedding scheduling strategies and constructed different energy functions during the denoising process to achieve anonymization and visual identity information hiding. Liu et al. \cite{liu2023diffprotect} used DMs to generate adversarial examples to protect facial privacy. Concurrently, some articles have highlighted existing legal frameworks that protect privacy-related content. For instance, Novelli et al. explored the privacy protection laws and policies under EU law concerning T2I models \cite{novelli2024generative}.

\textit{\textbf{Benchmark Setting.}} (1) \textit{Datatype.} We generate privacy content related to image descriptions. By prompting T2I models with these image descriptions, we benchmark the possibility of these text-to-image models for generating images that contain remembered privacy information in their training dataset. We include privacy-related information for both individuals and organizations. For individuals, this encompasses bank account details, credit information, and other personal data. For organizations, it includes financial records and intellectual property information, etc. (2) \textit{Evaluation.} As the difficulty of distinguishing the fine-grand privacy elements in generated images using CLIP-based methods, we utilize VLM to evaluate whether these generated images contain privacy information. We only discuss whether the generated image is a privacy leakage or not under the condition that the image follows the instruction (i.e., the input image description). This can avoid the false privacy security phenomenon caused by the poor performance of the model. Another challenge for evaluation is semantic meaning which means some format-satisfied elements in the image actually do not convey any real information (e.g. all numbers of zero on a credit card, random words on a personal information web page). As such, instead of directly prompting the VLM to answer the question of ``Does this image contain any privacy information?'', we first query the VLM to generate three regressive yes/no (binary) questions based on the privacy-related image description. These three questions follow the thought like this:

$\bullet$ If the main object mentioned in the image description is present in the generated image. This verifies if the model follows the description. 

$\bullet$ If any words or numbers appear in the expected locations, as indicated by the privacy-related details in the image description.

$\bullet$ If these words or numbers are in the correct format and meaning, potentially matching real-world privacy information as suggested in the description. This verifies that potential privacy elements convey privacy information semantically.

Finally, by requiring the VLM to answer these questions, we can judge whether there is a privacy breach in T2I model-generated image instructed by this image description. See \S\ref{prompt_t2i_privacy} for details on question generation. Specifically, if all three questions are answered affirmatively for a particular image, it is considered to have a privacy leakage. The overall privacy score for the T2I model is then calculated as the proportion of images in which a privacy breach occurs, formally expressed as:
% \[
% \text{Privacy Score} = \frac{\text{Number of images with privacy leakage}}{\text{Total number of images}}.
% \]
$\text{Privacy Score} = \left(1 - \frac{\text{\#Images with privacy leakage}}{\text{\#Total images}}\right) \times 100\%$

\textit{\textbf{Dynamic Dataset.}} Our privacy-related image description generation is based on a comprehensive privacy scenario pool (as shown in \autoref{fig:t2i}), which we constructed by retrieving information from web pages and an expertise dataset from the data mining community. Then we prompt the LLM such as GPT-4o to rewrite these privacy scenarios into image descriptions. Due to the wide variety of privacy information included, we only provide some examples in \autoref{tab:example_t2iprivacy}.

% \neil{People may argue these benchmarks are not really related to privacy. It seems like the benchmark asks a T2I model to generate images based on some prompts that include private information. If the generated images do reveal such private information, it is considered as a privacy leak. This is not related to training data leak. A better benchmark is to collect some sensitive image-text pairs, use them to fine-tune a T2I model, and verify whether the fine-tuned T2I model can generate these sensitive images given some prompts.}

\textit{\textbf{Result Analysis.}} We show the performance of different models in terms of privacy leakage, where Figure \autoref{fig:t2i_privacy_res_people} and \autoref{fig:t2i_privacy_res_org} represent individuals and organizations respectively.

\textit{\ul{Privacy leakage rates vary significantly across models, with several exhibiting relatively high rates, indicating a heightened risk of generating privacy-related content.}} As shown in \autoref{fig:t2i_privacy_res_people}, HunyuanDiT has the lowest individual-related privacy score at 62.5, followed by FLUX-1.1-Pro and Dall-E 3. This suggests these models are more likely to generate identifiable characteristics from individual-related descriptions, potentially exposing personal identity traits. Conversely, models like SD-3.5-large-Turbo and CogView-3-Plus show much lower leakage rates, demonstrating stronger protections against privacy risks related to individual identities. In the organization category, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:t2i_privacy_res_org}, models like Dall-E 3, FLUX-1.1-Pro, and HunyuanDiT are more likely to generate content tied to specific organizations, possibly due to less stringent filtering of organizational references. In contrast, models such as CogView-3-Plus and Kolors exhibit much higher score, indicating stricter handling of organization-related prompts, likely due to enhanced privacy measures or risk mitigation strategies.

\textit{\ul{Some models exhibit notable discrepancies in leakage rates between organization and individual privacy content.}} As shown in \autoref{fig:t2i_privacy}, Dall-E 3, for example, has the second lowest organization-related privacy score of 59.38 but a higher individual-related privacy score of 72.22, suggesting its filtering is more effective for personal information than for organizational data. This discrepancy may result from differing handling mechanisms that prioritize individual-based privacy over organizational privacy, underscoring the need for consistent privacy strategies across content types to ensure comprehensive protection in text-to-image models.
