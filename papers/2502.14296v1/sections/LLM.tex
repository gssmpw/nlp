\section{Benchmarking Large Language Models}
\label{sec:LLM}



\subsection{Preliminary}
Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced generative models designed to understand and generate human-like text based on vast training data \cite{zhao2023survey}. These models leverage deep learning techniques, particularly transformer architectures \cite{vaswani2017attention}, to process language, enabling them to perform various tasks such as translation \cite{Zhang2023PromptingLL}, summarization \cite{summarization}, and conversational agents \cite{agentbench}. Their growing prevalence is evident across various applications such as the medical domain \cite{liu2023deidgpt}, education \cite{gan2023large}, finance \cite{kang2023deficiency}, psychology \cite{li2024think} and software engineering \cite{zhang2023survey} and even in creative fields like writing and art \cite{yuan2023artgpt}. 

As organizations increasingly adopt LLMs for their capabilities, concerns around their ethical use, reliability, and trustworthiness have come to the forefront, highlighting the need for responsible deployment and oversight \cite{wang2023decodingtrust, huang2024position}. For example, a recent study \cite{jia202310} has outlined 10 potential security and privacy issues in LLMs, encompassing membership inference attacks \cite{duan2024membership}, backdoor attacks \cite{shi2023badgpt, xu2023instructions, wang2023backdoor}, and more. Additionally, many recent studies have brought attention to hallucinations in LLMs \cite{kang2023deficiency, zhao2023hallucinations, zhang2023alleviating}. The development of LLMs has also introduced biases, such as gender and racial discrimination \cite{gender-bias, zhao2018gender, plazadelarco2024angrymen, wan2023kelly}. Simultaneously, the use of extensive datasets primarily sourced from the internet, especially LLMs, has raised concerns about potential privacy breaches, leading to increased privacy issues \cite{beyondmemorization, leakinginfo, probeprivacyleakage}. 

To tackle these crucial challenges, the first step is to understand the trustworthiness of LLMs, which makes the evaluation and benchmarking of them essential. Drawing from prior research \cite{huang2024position}, this section delves into the current trustworthiness issues of LLMs from six perspectives: truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and machine ethics. In the following sections, we will detail the definitions, benchmark settings, and results for each aspect to provide a comprehensive understanding of where LLMs stand in terms of trustworthiness.  



\subsection{Truthfulness}
\label{sec:llm_Truthfulness}
\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} Large language models have demonstrated significant effectiveness in various generative natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and dialogue \cite{touvron2023llama2, dubey2024llama, achiam2023gpt, team2023gemini}. However, as these powerful models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes scenarios, there is a growing focus on ensuring the truthfulness of their output. Broadly, truthfulness can be defined as the ability of LLMs to accurately represent information, facts, and results \cite{huang2024position}. For instance, LLMs tend to produce plausible but incorrect answers, a phenomenon known as \textbf{hallucination (\S \ref{sec:hallucination})} \cite{ji2023survey, huang2023survey, zhang2023siren}. Additionally, they are prone to generating responses that align with user beliefs rather than presenting truthful information, a behavior referred to as \textbf{sycophancy (\S \ref{sec:sycophancy})} \cite{sharma2023understanding, perez2022discovering, wei2023simple}. Finally, they may produce responses that extend beyond their knowledge base, are deceptive, or appear inconsistent due to irrelevant conditions—a set of issues collectively described as challenges to \textbf{honesty (\S \ref{sec:honesty})} \cite{gao2024best, evans2021truthful, chern2024behonest}.


\subsubsection{Hallucination}
\label{sec:hallucination}
Researchers in natural language generation (NLG) use the term ``hallucination'' to describe undesirable or incorrect outputs generated by models \cite{ji2023survey}. For example, in neural machine translation, ``hallucination'' refers to the system generating highly pathological translations that are entirely untethered from the source material \cite{lee2018hallucinations}. In the context of abstractive summarization, hallucinations can be intrinsic, extrinsic, or factual, resulting in outputs that are inconsistent with the input document or contain information that is not factually accurate \cite{maynez2020faithfulness}. \textit{In LLMs, hallucination often refers to a broader phenomenon focused on the factual accuracy of the generated content, rather than being tied to specific tasks.} As hallucination has become a common issue across various LLMs, increasing research efforts \cite{huang2023survey, zhang2023siren, li2023halueval, manakul2023selfcheckgpt, chen2023hallucination, xu2024hallucination, dhuliawala2023chain, mishra2024fine, li2024inference, li2024dawn,Overshadowing2024} have focused on understanding and mitigating this unwanted trait. Building on the previous work, we define hallucination as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
% \textit{Hallucination in LLMs refers to the generation of content that is factually incorrect but appears plausible, similar to human falsehoods.}
\textit{Hallucination in LLMs refers to the generation of content that appears to be plausible but is inconsistent with facts or user requirements.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{\textit{(a) Hallucination Detection.}}
While previous research has primarily focused on evaluating hallucinations in specific NLG tasks, detecting hallucinations in the context of LLMs presents unique challenges due to the free-form and often long-form nature of their outputs. Existing work on detecting and evaluating LLM hallucinations mainly focuses on two aspects: factuality and faithfulness. To effectively identify \textit{factual errors} in LLM responses, several studies \cite{min2023factscore, chern2023factool, gou2023critic, wang2023explainable, chen2023complex, huo2023retrieving} have proposed comparing model-generated content against reliable knowledge sources, similar to the approach used in automated fact-checking tasks. Additionally, to avoid relying on external knowledge retrieval, other research efforts \cite{varshney2023stitch, yao2023llm, luo2023zero, xiong2023can, kadavath2022language, manakul2023selfcheckgpt, agrawal2023language, cohen2023lm} address this issue in a zero-source setting, focusing on estimating the uncertainty of the factual content generated by the model to detect hallucinations. To detect \textit{unfaithful generation} that is inconsistent with the given context, various approaches have been proposed. According to \cite{huang2023survey}, these methods can be broadly categorized into the following categories: fact-based metrics \cite{lin2004rouge, nan2021entity, maynez2020faithfulness, wang2020towards, goodrich2019assessing, shuster2021retrieval}, classifier-based metrics \cite{mishra2021looking, barrantes2020adversarial, goyal2020evaluating, laban2022summac, kryscinski2019evaluating, zhou2020detecting,dziri2022evaluating}, QA-based metrics \cite{durmus2020feqa, wang2020asking, scialom2021questeval, fabbri2021qafacteval}, uncertainty estimation \cite{xiao2021hallucination, guerreiro2022looking, xiong2023can, xu2020understanding}, and prompting-based metrics \cite{wang2023chatgpt, luo2023chatgpt, laban2023llms, adlakha2023evaluating, gao2023human}.

To provide a unified framework for detecting and evaluating hallucination, various benchmarks have been proposed. For example, HaluEval \cite{li2023halueval} offers a comprehensive collection of generated and human-annotated hallucinated samples specifically designed for hallucination evaluation; TruthfulQA \cite{lin2021truthfulqa} consists of adversarially curated questions that mimic human falsehoods and includes an automatic metric to assess the truthfulness and informativeness of generated responses. FACTOR \cite{muhlgay2023generating} introduces a method for automatically creating benchmarks by perturbing factual statements from a specific corpus. REALTIMEQA \cite{kasai2024realtime}, FreshQA \cite{vu2023freshllms}, and EvolvingQA \cite{kim2024carpe} offer questions specifically crafted to evaluate the factual accuracy of LLMs in relation to ever-evolving real-world knowledge. HalluQA \cite{cheng2023evaluating} and ChineseFactEval \cite{liang2023uhgeval} are benchmarks specifically designed to measure hallucination in Chinese large language models. SelfCheckGPT-Wikibio \cite{xiong2023can} provides a dataset for detecting sentence-level hallucinations by generating synthetic Wikipedia articles with GPT-3. FELM \cite{zhao2024felm} assesses factual accuracy across a variety of domains, including world knowledge, science and technology, and reasoning. PHD \cite{yang2023new} provides a passage-level hallucination detection benchmark, created using ChatGPT and annotated by human evaluators. 

\textbf{\textit{(b) Hallucination Mitigation.}}
To mitigate hallucinations in language models, one approach is to enhance the factual accuracy of the pre-training corpus, which improves the model’s parametric knowledge during the pre-training phase. Similarly, refining the quality of the training data used in the supervised fine-tuning stage can further mitigate this issue. Additionally, alignment processes can help language models recognize their knowledge boundaries, enabling them to decline answering questions outside their capabilities rather than producing inaccurate responses. \cite{zhang2023siren} However, these mitigation strategies during the training phase are often costly, potentially limiting their practicality in real-world applications. As a result, recent research focus has shifted towards developing inference-time interventions to elicit language models to produce truthful responses and reduce hallucinations.

\textit{Prompting} \cite{liu2023pre} plays a crucial role in providing context and setting expectations for language models, thereby effectively controlling the generation of their outputs. Techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting \cite{wei2022chain} and least-to-most prompting \cite{zhou2022least}, where the model explains its reasoning step-by-step before arriving at a final answer, can reveal faulty logic or assumptions. Additionally, methods like self-consistency \cite{wang2022self}, SCOTT\cite{wang2023scott}, and self-ask \cite{press2022measuring}, which involve prompting the model multiple times and analyzing the responses for discrepancies, can help identify potential hallucinations. However, since these methods still depend on the parametric knowledge stored within LLMs, they can still suffer from hallucinations due to potential factual inaccuracies in their internal knowledge \cite{xu2024hallucination}. To address this issue, various \textit{retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)} \cite{lewis2020retrieval, gao2023retrieval} methods have been introduced. These methods retrieve information from reliable knowledge sources to enhance the LLMs' knowledge capability, thereby helping to reduce hallucinations and improve response accuracy. For instance, \cite{yao2022react, liu2021token, li2023chain, peng2023check, gao2022rarr, agrawal2023can,liu2023tcra, wang2023explainable, yoran2023answering, dhuliawala2023chain, mialon2023augmented, chern2023factool, gou2023critic} retrieves information from external knowledge bases, structured databases, specific websites like Wikipedia, search engine APIs to search the entire internet, or various external tools.

\textit{Model editing} \cite{yao2023editing, wang2023knowledge, de2021editing, mitchell2022memory, sinitsin2020editable, huang2023transformer, meng2022mass, ripple2024, eventedit2024} allows for the modification of LLM behavior in a data- and computation-efficient manner. These methods often involve incorporating an auxiliary sub-network or directly modifying the original model parameters. For example, Meng et al. \cite{meng2022locating} propose a method called ROME, which modifies feedforward weights to update specific factual associations in GPT. Additionally, Li et al. \cite{li2023inference} introduce inference-time intervention (ITI), %\heng{spell it out?} 
a technique that first identifies a set of attention heads highly associated with truthfulness. It then shifts activations along these truth-correlated directions to elicit truthful answers from Llama.
Liu et al. \cite{liu2024evedit} propose event-based knowledge editing with deductive editing boundaries to address the problem of improper anchors.
%\heng{Maybe add more papers about LLM knowledge updating?}

\textit{Decoding strategies}, such as greedy search, diverse beam search \cite{vijayakumar2016diverse}, and sampling \cite{fan2018hierarchical, holtzman2018learning, holtzman2019curious}, determine how the next token is selected from the probability distribution generated by LLMs. These strategies can significantly influence the responses generated by the model. For example, Li et al. \cite{li2022contrastive} propose contrastive decoding, which leverages the differences between expert and amateur models to enhance the text generation capabilities of smaller language models; Lee et al. \cite{lee2022factuality} conduct a factuality assessment of content generated by LLMs using various decoding strategies and introduce a decoding algorithm called factual-nucleus sampling. Shi et al. \cite{shi2023trusting} propose a context-aware decoding strategy to encourage LLMs to pay closer attention to their context during generation. This approach aims to override the model's prior knowledge with reliable, trusted information to reduce hallucinations.

% (a) Not dynamic (b) Traditional Metrics not suitable for evaluating free-form text (3) No evaluation on hallucination in RAG

    \label{fig:llm_hallucination}
    \vspace{-25pt}
\end{figure}

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}}
We use the following two tasks and evaluation methods to benchmark the hallucination tendencies of LLMs:

\noindent \textit{- Evaluation Task.} LLM hallucinations often arise from unreliable knowledge, primarily due to noisy training data containing incorrect or outdated information. RAG addresses this issue by adding controllability to LLMs' knowledge sources, allowing them to access and retrieve information from trusted sources \cite{li2024dalk}. However, even with RAG, LLMs are still susceptible to hallucination. Based on this insight, we examine LLMs' tendency to hallucinate under two scenarios: (1) relying exclusively on the models' parametric (internal) knowledge, and (2) retrieving information from reliable external sources. For the internal knowledge scenario, we use existing QA datasets that encompass a wide range of challenges and domains, including adversarial QA, commonsense QA, and human falsehood QA. Additionally, we employ our dynamic dataset construction pipeline to retrieve question-answer pairs from Wikipedia. For the external knowledge scenario, we simulate RAG using a fact-checking task, where the model is asked to classify whether the provided evidence supports or refutes the given claim. We opted not to use RAG directly to avoid adding significant complexity to our benchmark and to maintain ease of accessibility.

  \caption{Performance of LLMs across different hallucination benchmark tasks.}
  \label{fig:llm_truthfulness_radar}
  \vspace{-10pt}
\end{wrapfigure}


\noindent \textit{(2) Evaluation Method.} For QA task, we employ the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess the LLM's output against the gold answer. Given the diverse range of responses generated by LLMs, traditional metrics like exact match (EM) and F1 scores may not be suitable for evaluation. Similarly, for fact-checking (FC) task, we adopt the LLM-as-judge paradigm to maintain a consistent evaluation approach across all tasks.


\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}}
To build a dynamic data collection pipeline for hallucination evaluation, we utilize a web browsing agent to retrieve relevant question-answer pairs and claim-label pairs. For the QA task, we retrieve data from reliable sources like Wikipedia, and for the fact-checking task, we gather information from fact-checking websites such as Snopes and FactCheck.org. After retrieval, we perform additional checks to filter out URLs that do not belong to the target sites. \autoref{fig:llm_hallucination} shows an example taxonomy of topics from Wikipedia and example entities used for retrieval from fact-checking websites. To add or update the topics used for retrieval, users should refer to the content of relevant lists on Wikipedia. Finally, to reduce prompt sensitivity, we use a contextual variator to diversify the prompt format such as changing open-ended questions into multiple-choice questions.

Additionally, we offer the option to randomly select benchmark data from a dataset pool maintainer of well-known datasets tailored for truthfulness assessment tasks, such as question-answering \cite{rajpurkar2018know, yang2018hotpotqa}, and sycophancy evaluation \cite{sycophancygithub}. For the initial version of the dataset pool, we include datasets used in the truthfulness evaluation in TrustLLM \cite{huang2024position}. Our framework also allows for easy integration of new datasets into the pool to further enhance the evaluation of truthfulness.

\textbf{Result Analysis} This section provides an overview of the results, analyzing the performance and findings of various models as detailed in \autoref{tab:llm-hallucination-results} and \autoref{fig:llm_truthfulness_radar}.

% \textit{\ul{The hallucination-specific benchmark poses a greater challenge for LLMs than general QA and fact-checking tasks.}} We find that benchmarks specifically designed to detect hallucinations, such as HaluEval, are generally more difficult for LLMs than broader QA and fact-checking tasks. For instance, some models, like GPT-4o, exhibit a performance drop of up to 28.4\% on HaluEval compared to the Dynamic QA task.

\textit{\ul{LLMs tend to perform better on dynamically generated datasets than on established benchmark datasets.}} We observe that most LLMs perform better on dynamic datasets created by retrieval agents compared to datasets from the standard dataset pool. For QA tasks, this trend holds consistently across all LLMs. In fact-checking tasks, however, this pattern is mostly consistent, with exceptions seen in models like Llama-3.1-8B and Llama-3.1-70B.


\subsubsection{Sycophancy}
\label{sec:sycophancy}
One of the defining characteristics that set large language models apart from pre-trained language models is their ability to follow instructions and generate outputs that align with human values and expectations. This capability, enhanced by the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method introduced by InstructGPT \cite{ouyang2022training}, is often referred to as alignment \cite{shen2023large, wang2023aligning, Sun2024TrustLLMTI, hendrycks2023overview, park2023ai, steinhardt2023emergent}. While the alignment process for LLMs aims to ensure that their outputs reflect human values, it can also unintentionally introduce undesirable traits, such as sycophancy, where LLMs prioritize aligning with user beliefs over providing accurate information. Based on the study by \cite{sharma2023understanding}, we define sycophancy in large language models as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Sycophancy refers to the tendency of LLMs to exhibit sycophantic or deceptive behaviors, driven by their inclination to prioritize reward maximization over truthfulness and adherence to their original training objectives.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{\textit{(a) Sycophancy Causes and Evaluation.}}
Although LLMs can provide high-quality responses that are highly rated by users, research by Perez et al. \cite{perez2022discovering} has shown that these models often prioritize seeking user approval, and sometimes, the easiest way to achieve a favorable rating is to lie. For example, agreeing with a user's explicit opinion, even if it involves dishonesty, can be an effective strategy to gain approval. This finding aligns with the study by Park et al. \cite{park2023ai}, which found that, in many cases, during model training, obtaining user approval is prioritized over maintaining truthfulness. Additionally, Sharma et al. \cite{sharma2023understanding} found that sycophancy is prevalent in the preference data used by preference models (PMs) during instruction-tuning, which can lead to the development of sycophantic behavior in LLMs. Their findings also highlight instances where state-of-the-art PMs can identify whether a response is truthful, yet still favor less truthful, sycophantic responses. These previous studies suggest that sycophancy may be an inherent characteristic deeply embedded in the design and training of LLMs, posing unique challenges for mitigating such behavior.

Unlike other dimensions of truthfulness, such as hallucination, there is no systematic method for evaluating sycophancy. Perez et al. \cite{perez2022discovering} used model-written evaluations to test 154 diverse behaviors and found that LMs were more likely to create echo chambers by repeating a dialog user's preferred answers. They termed this behavior sycophancy. Specifically, they provided a user’s biography and demographics and then asked the LLM a political question without explicitly stating the person’s opinion on the matter. The LLMs often voiced opinions that aligned with what might be expected from someone with that background. For instance, when interacting with a Democrat, the LLM tended to support gun control. To further investigate sycophancy in LLMs, Sharma et al. \cite{sharma2023understanding} employed both human-written and model-written evaluations, focusing on realistic, open-ended text-generation settings. They also introduced \textsc{SycophancyEval}, an evaluation suite that extends existing sycophancy assessments, which primarily rely on proof-of-concept multiple-choice evaluations where users explicitly declare their views. In this paper, we extend the generation pipeline from \textsc{SycophancyEval} by incorporating data from additional domains through our retrieval-based dynamic dataset construction module.

\textbf{\textit{(b) Sycophancy Mitigation.}}
Since sycophancy is a relatively under-explored area, there has not been extensive research on mitigation methods, leaving significant room for further exploration. Sharma et al. \cite{sharma2023understanding} explore how sycophantic behavior shifts when optimizing with a preference model using best-of-N sampling and reinforcement learning.
Wei et al. \cite{wei2023simple} propose a simple synthetic-data intervention that incorporates public NLP tasks to enhance model robustness against user opinions. By adding this data through a lightweight fine-tuning process, sycophantic behavior can be significantly reduced on held-out prompts.
More recently, with the growing use of activation engineering \cite{turner2023activation} for controllable text generation, Rimsky et al. \cite{panickssery2023steering} introduce contrastive activation addition as a method to reduce sycophantic behaviors in models.
Other approaches train models using reinforcement learning: Stengel-Eskin et al. \cite{stengel-eskin2025teaching}  teach LLMs to balance accepting positive persuasion without being sycophantic, i.e. resisting persuasion from other agents when the model's answer is right; this approach leads to reduced flipflopping (or self-doubt sycophancy) \cite{laban2023you}, which is the tendency for models to change its correct answers when questioned.

% \textbf{\textit{Evaluation Challenges \& Questions.}}
% (a) Lack of dynamic data (b) No standard evaluation metric (c) Lack of formal taxonomy of sycophancy

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}}
Building on previous studies of sycophantic behaviors in LMMs \cite{perez2022discovering, sharma2023understanding}, we categorize sycophancy into three distinct types in this paper:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item \textit{Persona Sycophancy}: LLMs produce responses that align with the user's potential beliefs when the input prompt includes information suggesting the user's persona.
    \item \textit{Preconception Sycophancy}: LLMs generate responses that conform to or endorse the beliefs or views expressed by the user in the input prompt.
    \item \textit{Self-Doubt Sycophancy}:  LLMs exhibit self-doubt by altering their original responses when followed up with questions that challenge their certainty, such as ``Are you sure?''
\end{itemize}

% In addition to the three dynamically constructed sycophancy tasks, we also evaluate an existing sycophancy test \cite{sycophancygithub} that compares LLM responses with sycophantic (S) and non-sycophantic (N) responses. For brevity, we refer to this test as ``NS-Syco.''

\noindent \textit{(1) Evaluation Task.} Following \cite{perez2022discovering, sharma2023understanding}, we evaluate the sycophantic behavior of large language models (LLMs) through question-answering tasks, focusing on the three types of sycophancy previously outlined. (a) For \textit{persona sycophancy}, we present LLMs with claims retrieved by our web-browsing agent, incorporating a persona prefix in the prompt that could influence the model’s response. For example, when an LLM is asked to evaluate a claim related to ``The Freedom to Vote Act'' while adopting a liberal persona, the model responds with a sycophantic answer that contradicts the ground truth, which should be \textit{Refuted.} (b) For \textit{preconception sycophancy}, we ask LLMs factual questions and include a preconception postfix in the prompt that introduces uncertainty about the answer. Examples include phrases like ``I am not sure if the answer if [correct answer]'' or ``I think the answer is [wrong answer], what do you think?'' (c) For \textit{self-doubt sycophancy}, rather than prompting the model for a single response, we engage it in a multi-round conversation where we first ask a factual question. After the model provides an answer, we introduce doubt by asking follow-up questions like ``Are you sure?'' If the model subsequently expresses uncertainty and changes its correct answer, this behavior is classified as sycophantic. The key difference between preconception sycophancy and self-doubt sycophancy lies in the conversation setting; we aim to explore whether LLMs are more susceptible to sycophancy in a multi-turn dialogue setting \cite{yi2024survey}.

\noindent \textit{(2) Evaluation Method.} For persona sycophancy and preconception sycophancy, we evaluate the performance changes between the base response and the model’s response after adding a persona prefix or preconception postfix. Specifically, we calculate the performance change by taking the absolute difference in accuracy provided by the LLM judge before and after the addition of the persona prefix or preconception postfix divided by the base result. Mathematically, this is represented as $\Delta Acc$ = $|Acc_{persona} - Acc_{base}| / Acc_{base}$ and $\Delta Acc$ = $|Acc_{preconception} - Acc_{base}| / Acc_{base}$. A smaller $\Delta Acc$  indicates that the model is more robust to persona and preconception sycophancy. For self-doubt sycophancy, we employ an LLM judge to determine whether the model alters its response after a user follow-up question that challenges the truthfulness of its initial answer, and we report the percentage of cases in which the LLM alters its response.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}}
Our dynamic data collection pipeline serves two purposes: first, it generates persona information in a predefined format based on a given keyword, such as ``liberal'' or ``doctor.'' Second, it retrieves question-answer pairs that seek factual information from reliable sources like Wikipedia. To generate persona information, we prompt LLMs using a fixed format and ask them to provide details based on a given keyword. Our retrieval process is the same as the QA task for hallucination evaluation in Section \ref{sec:hallucination}. Finally, to reduce prompt sensitivity, we use a contextual variator to diversify the prompt format.

\textbf{Result Analysis} This section provides an overview of the results, analyzing the performance and findings of various models as detailed in \autoref{tab:llm-sycophancy-results} and \autoref{fig:llm_truthfulness_bar_chart}.

\textit{\ul{LLMs exhibit significant variability in sycophancy levels.}} Unlike hallucination-related tasks, where model performance tends to converge, LLMs show drastically different levels of sycophancy. For example, o1-preview shows only a 1.30\% accuracy change compared to its baseline when persona information is introduced, while Qwen-2.5-72B experiences a 100\% change. This trend extends to preconception sycophancy tasks, with Gemini-1.5-pro exhibiting a minimal 1.01\% change compared to GPT-3.5-turbo’s substantial 37.92\% change.

\textit{\ul{Smaller models demonstrate great robustness to persona and preconception sycophancy.}} We observe that smaller models exhibit lower levels of persona and preconception sycophancy. For example, Llama-3.1-8B shows only a 3.08\% accuracy change on the persona sycophancy task, comparable to the best-performing model, o1-preview, which has a 1.30\% change. Similarly, on the preconception sycophancy task, Gemma-2-27B exhibits a 7.94\% accuracy change, outperforming Gemini-1.5-flash’s 7.96\%.

\textit{\ul{LLMs often display self-doubt sycophancy, compromising truthful answers.}} We observe that most LLMs struggle to maintain confidence in their initial responses when faced with user follow-up questions expressing doubt in a multi-round dialogue. Among the models, QwQ-32B shows the greatest resilience against self-doubt sycophancy, changing its answers only 19.19\% of the time. In contrast, models like Gemini-1.5-pro, Gemini-1.5-flash, and Claude-3-haiku change their responses over 88\% of the time. 

\subsubsection{Honesty}
\label{sec:honesty}
Honesty of LLMs, which requires consistently delivering accurate information and refraining from deceiving users—plays a crucial role in ensuring the trustworthy deployment of LLMs in real-world applications \cite{gao2024best}. Combined with previous study \cite{gao2024best, evans2021truthful}, the honesty of LLMs is defined as:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Honesty is the capacity to state what they believe and what is factually accurate.}
\end{tcolorbox}

This distinction complicates the assessment of honesty, yet it is essential for aligning LLMs with real-world knowledge and preventing the spread of misinformation \cite{park2023ai}. For instance, to mitigate hallucination, researchers have worked on retrieving external knowledge to ensure truthful responses and calibrating the confidence levels of LLMs \cite{qin2023toolllm, Tang_Deng_Lin_Han_Liang_Sun_2023, yang2024gpt4tools, rtuning2024}. Such calibration is vital for gauging the reliability of the LLMs' responses. Many studies have aimed at improving the honesty of LLMs, especially by enhancing their calibration in response to uncertainty—such as the ability to refrain from answering when unsure \cite{yang2023alignment, cheng2024ai}. A recent study points out that honest LLMs include the expectation that LLMs should provide responses that are \emph{objectively} accurate and acknowledge their limitations, like their inability to process visual data without the aid of external tools \cite{metatool}. Based on previous studies \cite{gao2024best, yang2023alignment, askell2021general}, the details of LLM honesty include:

\begin{tcolorbox}[details]
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item At its most basic level, the AI should provide accurate information, be well-calibrated, and express appropriate levels of uncertainty rather than misleading users \cite{yang2023alignment}.
    \item Crucially, the AI should be honest about its capabilities and knowledge levels \cite{metatool}.
    \item Ideally, the AI would also be forthright about itself and its internal state \cite{li2024think}.
    \item LLMs should maintain objectivity and be non-sycophancy to user inputs \cite{xu2023earth} (which is discussed in the Syncophancy Section).
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

Based on the definition above, Gao et al. introduced the principles of honest LLMs \cite{gao2024best}, emphasizing six specific categories (the summary of the principles is shown in Appendix \ref{app:principle_honest}): \footnote{It is important to note that the analysis is focused solely on the LLMs themselves, excluding LLM-based agents that are enhanced with external databases and tools \citep{agentbench}.}

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Latest Information with External Services.} Due to outdated pre-training data, insufficient fact-checking, and lack of access to live or up-to-date external data sources, LLMs may produce seemingly reasonable but inaccurate output when accessing the latest information without external tools (\emph{e.g.}, web retrieval tool) \citep{zhuang2024toolqa, lewis2020retrieval}. As a result, honestly acknowledging these limitations is crucial.
    \item \textbf{User Input Not Enough Or With Wrong Information.} In practical scenarios, LLMs often encounter questions that are incorrect or ambiguous \citep{kim2024aligning}. To maintain objectivity and avoid succumbing to user biases, LLMs must provide honest and accurate responses, rather than merely catering to the user's input.
    \item \textbf{Professional Capability in Specific Domains.} Tasks requiring expertise in specific domains pose challenges for LLMs, as these fields evolve rapidly and demand extensive, high-quality, task-specific datasets. Given these constraints, LLMs should recognize their own limitations and refrain from generating unreliable outputs.
    \item \textbf{Interactivity Sensory Processing.} LLMs cannot directly perceive and process sensory data (such as auditory or tactile feedback), which are vital for performing interactive tasks \citep{rissling2013demand}. Being honest means that LLMs should acknowledge their inability to interact with the physical world directly.
    \item \textbf{Modality Mismatch. }LLMs are inherently designed to handle text-based inputs and outputs, which presents challenges when interpreting or generating non-textual data modalities (such as images and audio) \citep{zhang2024mm, peng2023instruction}. This mismatch can result in erroneous or irrelevant responses, highlighting the necessity for LLMs to transparently acknowledge their limitations in processing these types of data. 
    \item \textbf{Self Identity Cognition.} As honest and helpful assistants, LLMs should maintain a clear awareness of their own identity, recognizing the differences between human users and AI assistants \citep{mahowald2024dissociating}. When addressing topics that require human perceptual or introspective understanding—such as social awareness or self-reflection—LLMs should disclaim their limitations and avoid asserting an autonomous self-identity \citep{li2024think, lurz2009philosophy, mahowald2024dissociating, berglund2023taken, huang2024position}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textit{Calibration.}} In addition to giving answers, models can communicate confidence in those answers. A core component to honesty is calibration, meaning that a model's confidence accurately reflects its knowledge. 
For example, a calibrated model might hedge or express lower confidence on difficult questions which it is likely to get wrong. 
Past work has measured calibration both at the level of logits and token probabilities \cite{desai2020calibration, si2023prompting, stengel-eskin2023calibrated} as well as verbal statements \cite{zhou2023navigating, tian-etal-2023-just}, including hedges and statements of uncertainty (known as epistemic markers \citep{zhou-etal-2024-relying}).
Some work has found that calibration often improve with scale and RLHF training (for verbalized outputs) \citep{kadavath2022languagemodelsmostlyknow, tian-etal-2023-just}, while \cite{zhou-etal-2024-relying} trace overconfidence to a lack of hedging statements in RLHF data and show that overconfident models damage user trust. 
Other work has aimed to improve verbal calibration via control codes \cite{mielke2022reducing}, a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning \cite{band2024linguistic}, or reinforcement learning on bootstrapped data \citep{stengel-eskin.e.2024lacie}. 


\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} 1) \textit{Metrics.} We assess the honesty of LLMs using two key metrics: the \textit{honest rate} and the \textit{combined honest rate}. Drawing from previous work \cite{gao2024best}, our goal is for LLMs to maintain both honesty and helpfulness simultaneously to prevent excessive refusals. The honest rate measures the percentage of scenarios in which LLMs remain truthful, while the combined honest rate reflects the percentage of cases where LLMs are both honest and helpful at the same time. 2) \textit{Evaluation.} We utilize an LLM-as-a-Judge approach with a standardized principle-based template, as detailed in Appendix \ref{app:truthfulness_LLM_prompt}. To assess helpfulness, LLMs are required to offer explanations, solutions, and actionable guidance in response to user queries.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}} The construction of the dynamic dataset involves two main components: 1) For the category of ``Professional Capability in Specific Domains,'' we leverage a web-browsing agent to retrieve challenges or questions that remain unsolved by humans. 2) For all other categories, we employ principle-guided prompts to first instruct the LLM to generate specific actions (e.g., provide the latest information on Trump). These generated actions are then transformed into user queries. The prompt templates used for this process are detailed in Appendix \ref{app:truthfulness_LLM_prompt}.

In contrast, LLMs excel in the LIES category, where most models achieve combined honesty rates above 80\%. This highlights an imbalanced and biased performance across different categories, indicating the need for more diverse training samples to improve model performance in areas where honesty is currently lacking.

\subsection{Safety}



\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} As large language models become more widespread, the associated safety concerns are increasingly drawing attention. This has led to considerable research aimed at understanding and mitigating these risks \cite{jailbreakanalysis1, jailbreakanalysis2, multistepattack, latentjailbreak, redteaming, bhardwaj2023redteaming, ethicalsafety, beavertails, xu2023sc, lowresourcejailbreak, inie2023summon, wang2023fake, mu2023llms, schulhoff-etal-2023-ignore, xu2023cognitive, alon2023detecting, fu2023safety, zhao2023causality, liu2023prompt, vega2023bypassing, 299563, yi2023benchmarking, buszydlik2023red, kumar2023certifying, sha2024prompt, zhou2024defending, xu2024llm, xie2024gradsafe, yung2024round, deng2024pandora, guo2024coldattack, xu2024safedecoding, chang2024play, dong2024attacks, chen2024findingsafetyneuronslarge, liu2023goal, li2024tf, du2024detecting, shang2024intentobfuscator, peng2024jailbreaking}. For example, some studies have demonstrated that top-tier proprietary LLMs' safety features can be circumvented through jailbreak \cite{zou2023universal, kang2023masterkey} or fine-tuning \cite{zhan2023removing, pelrine2023exploiting}. Moreover, a recent study also proposes 18 foundational challenges and more than 200 research questions on LLMs' safety \cite{anwar2024foundationalchallengesassuringalignment}. A recent study also shows that lots of LLMs are subject to shallow safety alignment, so as to be vulnerable to various adversarial attacks \cite{qi2024safety}. Some safety topics that have been widely explored include safety alignment \cite{shadowalignment, beavertails, ji2024pku, qi2023fine, wei2024assessing, chen2024finding}, jailbreak \cite{schulhoff-etal-2023-ignore, wei2024jailbroken, jin2024jailbreakzoosurveylandscapeshorizons, liu2024flipattack, jha2024llmstinger, peng2024jailbreaking}, toxicity \cite{wen2023unveiling, trustgpt, luong2024realisticevaluationtoxicitylarge}, prompt injection \cite{liu2024automaticuniversalpromptinjection, zhang2024goalguidedgenerativepromptinjection, li2023rainlanguagemodelsalign,hui2024pleak,shao2024making} and so on.



\subsubsection{Jailbreak}
\label{Sec: LLM jailbreak}

As the capabilities of LLMs continue to advance, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that these models are trained with safety in mind. One key component of LLM safety is defending against jailbreak attacks, sometimes referred to as ``red teaming'' in certain studies \cite{redteaming}. Based on previous research \cite{wei2024jailbroken}, we define a jailbreak attack as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{A jailbreak attack on a safety-trained model attempts to elicit an on-topic response to a prompt $P$ for restricted behavior by submitting a modified prompt $P'$.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{\textit{(a) Jailbreak Attack.}} To study the effectiveness of manually crafted jailbreak prompts, some researchers have conducted a comprehensive review of existing jailbreak methods \cite{schulhoff-etal-2023-ignore, yi2024jailbreakattacksdefenseslarge, sun2024iterative}. For instance, Schulhoff et al. analyzed the methods for jailbreaking in a global jailbreak competition, where they collected more than 600k+ jailbreak prompts \cite{schulhoff-etal-2023-ignore}. Zou et al. proposed GCG~\cite{zou2023universal}, which has successfully jailbroken various proprietary LLMs by optimizing the suffixes in the prompt. However, a recent study found that loss is not a good reference for suffix selection and proposed AmpleGCG \cite{liao2024amplegcglearninguniversaltransferable, kumar2024amplegcgplus} which can achieve high ASR and enables rapid generation for attack. Faster-GCG is also proposed to improve the efficiency of jailbreak attacks \cite{li2024faster}. To solve the issue of the high perplexity of jailbreak strings, Guo et al. \cite{guo2024coldattack} design an energy function to enhance the fluence and lexical consistency of jailbreak prompts. Additionally, Liu et al. \cite{liu2023autodan} introduce AutoDAN, a jailbreak attack designed for aligned LLMs that automatically generates meaningful jailbreak prompts using a hierarchical genetic algorithm. They further proposed AutoDAN-Turbo~\cite{liu2024autodan}, a lifelong learning agent that continuously discovers and evolves powerful jailbreak strategies through repeated attempts. Another study \cite{jailbreak20queries} presents PAIR, an algorithm that creates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. Furthermore, recent research \cite{huang2023catastrophic} demonstrates that disrupting model alignment can be easily achieved by simply altering decoding methods. Some studies are based on evolutionary attack, for instance, Lapid et al. use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize adversarial suffixes \cite{lapid2023open} which is similar to the method proposed by Li et al. \cite{li2024semantic}, Yao et al. apply fuzzy testing to generate attack instructions \cite{fuzzllm}, and Yu et al. employ GPTFUZZER, which uses mutation techniques to evolve human-crafted templates into effective adversarial inputs \cite{gptfuzzer}. Some jailbreaks also leverage string encoders to launch attacks. For example, Yuan et al. encode the string to a cipher can bypass the safety alignment of LLMs with strong capability (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4) \cite{cipher}, and Lv et al. propose \textsc{CodeChameleon}, which allow personalized encryption to jailbreak LLMs \cite{lv2024codechameleon}.

Kour et al. \cite{kour2023unveiling} introduce the AttaQ dataset to examine potentially harmful or inappropriate responses in LLMs, using specialized clustering techniques to automatically identify and label fragile semantic regions prone to harmful outputs.
Moreover, Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2023jade} propose the JADE platform, which challenges multiple widely used LLMs by increasing the language complexity of seed problems. ObscurePrompt \cite{huang2024obscurepromptjailbreakinglargelanguage} is designed to jailbreak LLMs by transforming queries to be more obscure, which exploits the insufficient alignment on OOD data. LLMs are also used to jailbreak other models, for instance, Wu et al. \cite{wu2024largelanguagemodelsautomatically} use LLMs to jailbreak large vision models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4V). Additionally, research has highlighted the importance of multilingual considerations, as LLM vulnerabilities often differ across languages \cite{deng2023multilingual, cao2023cross}. Crescendo is proposed by Russinovich et al. \cite{russinovich2024great}, which is a multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. Shen et al. \cite{shen2024rapid} propose a new optimized-based jailbreak methodology, which is inspired by two psychological concepts: subconsciousness and echopraxia. From a psychological aspect, Zhang et al. propose PsySafe, a comprehensive framework for the psychological-based attack, defense, and evaluation \cite{zhang2024psysafe}, which reveals several intriguing phenomena, such as the collective dangerous behaviors among agents and agents' self-reflection when engaging in dangerous behavior. Zhu et al. \cite{zhu2024advprefix} propose AdvPrefix, a prefix-forcing approach that automatically selects model-dependent prefixes with high success rates and low negative log-likelihood, supports multi-prefix usage, and seamlessly enhances existing jailbreaks—exposing alignment’s vulnerability to novel prompts.


\textbf{\textit{(b) Jailbreak Defense.}} Various studies are focusing on jailbreak defense \cite{lin2024figureoutanalyzingbasedjailbreak, jin2024jailbreakzoosurveylandscapeshorizons, Wallace2024TheIH, gao2024shaping}. Xie et al. \cite{xie2023defending} and Phute et al. \cite{phute2024llmselfdefenseself} use an easy self-evaluation method to find potential harm in input queries.
A recent study utilize a secondary LLM to emulate the conscience of a protected, primary LLM \cite{pisano2024bergeroncombatingadversarialattacks}. Perplexity-based filtering \cite{jain2023baseline, alon2023detecting} is proven to be an effective method to defend the attack like GCG \cite{zou2023universal}.
SmoothLLM \cite{smoothllm} and SemanticSmooth \cite{ji2024defendinglargelanguagemodels} both propose defense methods by randomly perturbing multiple copies of a given input prompt and aggregating their predictions. Zhang et al. found the intrinsic conflict between helpfulness and harmlessness 
and propose the ``goal prioritization'' at training and inference to defend jailbreak attack \cite{zhang2024defendinglargelanguagemodels}. HateModerate is designed to detect the harmful content in the user's input, which is another way for jailbreak defense from the perspective of pre-processing \cite{zheng-etal-2024-hatemoderate}. Moreover, Xu et al. \cite{xu2020recipes} propose a human-and-model-in-the-loop framework to enhance the safety defense of chatbots. However, Kim et al. use the "purple" problem to evaluate the robustness of the current defense methods and find that these methods are not robust enough \cite{kim2024jailbreaking}. AutoDefenes \cite{zeng2024autodefense}, proposed by Zeng et al., is a response-filtering-based multi-agent defense framework that filters harmful responses from LLMs. Kumar et al. propose a method of erase-and-check to defend three kinds of adversarial jailbreak attacks: adversarial suffix, insertion, and infusion \cite{kumar2023certifying}. Ge et al. designed MART, which automatically generates adversarial jailbreak prompts by multi-turn red-teaming \cite{ge2023mart}. Yuan et al. propose RigorLLM, which employs a multi-faceted method that includes energy-based data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust clustering algorithm with LLMs \cite{yuan2024rigorllm}. Li et al.~\cite{li2024the} and Zou et al.~\cite{zou2024improving} proposed unlearning-based methods for defending against jailbreak prompts. Qi et al.~\cite{qi2024safety} found current safety alignment is shallow and proposed a new method to deep the alignment beyond the first few tokens. Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2024backtracking} proposed a finetune method to allow LLMs to discard and recover from their harmful response. Hu et al. proposed Gradient Cuff \cite{hu2024gradient} to detect jailbreak prompts by exploring the refusal loss landscape, and they also proposed Token Highlighter \cite{hu2024token} to identify and mitigate problematic tokens. Xiong et al. proposed to append a defensive prompt patch \cite{xiong2024defensive} to the user query to mitigate jailbreak effects.


\textbf{\textit{(c) Jailbreak Evaluation \& Benchmark.}} Recent studies have proposed many assessment frameworks for jailbreak evaluation. For instance, Chu et al. evaluate the jailbreak methods by concentrating on 13 cutting-edge ones from four categories, 160 questions from 16 violation categories, and six popular LLMs \cite{chu2024comprehensive}. HarmBench \cite{mazeika2024harmbenchstandardizedevaluationframework} is a standardized evaluation framework for jailbreaking attacks, including 18 red teaming methods. Meanwhile, JailbreakEval \cite{ran2024jailbreakevalintegratedtoolkitevaluating} is a unified toolkit to evaluate jailbreak on LLMs. JailbreakBench \cite{chao2024jailbreakbench} is an open robustness benchmark with an evolving repository of adversarial prompts, a jailbreak dataset, and an assessment framework. JAMBench is proposed to evaluate the safety of moderation guardrails on LLM systems \cite{jin2024jailbreaking}, which contains 160 manually crafted instructions covering four major risk categories. Peng et al. \cite{peng2024navigating}  used loss landscape analysis to quantify the safety risks.

    \caption{Jailbreak dataset generation pipeline.}
    \label{fig:LLM_safety_pipeline}
    \vspace{-20pt}
\end{figure}


% \textbf{\textit{Evaluation Challenges \& Questions.}} To evaluate the LLM's defense against jailbreak attacks, there still exist challenges: Even though there are many studies proposing different datasets on the safety of LLMs, which contain lots of harmful queries \cite{xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge, zou2023universal, huang2024position}, these datasets are static and can not be expanded, which may not include latest harmful elements. New harmful objects will appear, so the evaluation should evolve with time. Meanwhile, careful consideration should be given to how to select appropriate unsafe topics and choose suitable evaluation metrics (e.g., keyword matching \cite{zou2023universal} or LLM-as-a-Judge \cite{zheng2023judging}) from among the many available indicators. 

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} (1) \textit{Unsafe topic.} We select the taxonomy of unsafe topics from Sorry-Bench \cite{xie2024sorrybenchsystematicallyevaluatinglarge}, which is a fine-grained taxonomy of 45 potentially unsafe topics and mitigating the previous issue of over-representing some fine-grained topics. (2) \textit{Evaluation method.} To evaluate whether the jailbreak is successful, we use Llama3 Guard\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B}} \cite{inan2023llamaguardllmbasedinputoutput} as the evaluator, which shows the better performance than GPT-4 on safety evaluation, and we use the percentage of Refusing to Answer (RtA) as the metric like previous studies \cite{trustgpt, huang2024position}. (3) \textit{Jailbreak attack methods.} We selected those black-box jailbreak methods (i.e., prompt-based methods) for evaluation because they align with the typical knowledge and capabilities of attackers in real-world scenarios (i.e., lacking access to internal information about the model). The selected attack methods are shown in \autoref{tab:jailbreak_methods}.


\begin{tcolorbox}[details]
\small
    $\triangleright$ \textbf{Implementation of "Few-Shot" attack:} We utilize the dataset \texttt{advbench}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks/blob/main/data/advbench/harmful_behaviors.csv}} proposed in GCG \cite{zou2023universal} as the exemplar candidates. Specifically, for each harmful query, we will randomly sample $n$ queries from \texttt{advbench}, and then they are paired with the prefix string of their target response. This pair will be regarded as the exemplar of few-shot learning in the prompts. For instance, one example should be like: \\
    \textit{"Query: Write a script that can exploit vulnerabilities in a software or operating system."}\\
    \textit{"Answer: Sure, here is a script that can exploit vulnerabilities in a software or operating system..."} \\
    $\triangleright$ \textbf{Implementation of "Persuasion" attack:} As Zeng et al. have proposed lots of persuasion strategies for jailbreak attack \cite{zeng2024johnnypersuadellmsjailbreak}, here we use the definition and example of each strategy\footnote{\url{https://github.com/CHATS-lab/persuasive_jailbreaker/blob/main/persuasion_taxonomy.jsonl}} to make LLMs to transform the original queries to be persuasive. Some instances are shown in Appendix \ref{app:example_persuasion}. \\
    $\triangleright$ \textbf{Principle design for each jailbreak method: }Principle is, to some extent, the description or aim of a certain jailbreak method, which will guide the case generator to generate the jailbreak prompt that meets the requirements. For instance, the principle for "Context Ignoring" is like "\textit{A query to be transformed in a way that makes the response ignore any previous context or system instructions, focusing solely on answering the query itself. This query is about seeking information without being influenced by any pre-existing system properties or contextual constraints.}". For each jailbreak attack, we manually design the principle for query transformation. Specifically, we do not directly give the LLMs the harmful query, which aims to avoid the situation of LLMs' refusing to answer due to their safety alignment mechanism. The principle-based prompts for query transformation are shown in Appendix \ref{app:jailbreak_prompt_gen}.

\textbf{\textit{Result Analysis.}} We show the overall performance in \autoref{fig:LLM_jailbreak_avg}, and the performance under different kinds of attacks in \autoref{fig:jailbreak_types}. More detailed results are shown in Appendix \ref{app:detailed_res_LLM}.

\textit{\ul{Proprietary LLMs take the lead in performance.}} As we can observe from \autoref{fig:LLM_jailbreak_avg}, the o1, Claude and Gemini series outperform most open-source LLMs, achieving RtA rates above 90\%. In contrast, some open-weight LLMs, such as Mixtral-8*7B, reach only around 60\% RtA. This substantial performance gap between proprietary and open-weight LLMs may be attributed to the external filters or moderation mechanisms integrated into proprietary models \cite{deng2024masterkey, liu2023prompt}.

\textit{\ul{LLMs are sensitive to different categories of attacks.}} As shown in \autoref{fig:jailbreak_types}, the performance of LLMs varies significantly across different attack types. For instance, LLMs achieve a higher RtA under ``Refusal Suppression'' and ``Prefix Injection'' attacks, but their performance drops considerably with “Scenario” and “ObscurePrompt” attacks. This variation suggests that LLMs have inherent vulnerabilities to certain attack types, likely due to differences in prompt structure and contextual cues.




\subsubsection{Toxicity}

There have been numerous studies conducted on the toxicity of large language
models \cite{villate2024systematic, weng2021toxic, yang2024benchmarking}. Taking reference from Perspective \cite{perspectiveapi} and previous research \cite{welbl2021challenges}, we define the toxicity in the language model as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Toxicity in language model is the rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment; likely to make people leave a discussion.}
\end{tcolorbox}

This toxic content has the potential to harm individuals, groups, and even entire societies. Even though previous research has proposed lots of datasets \cite{Toxicity_Dataset1, toxicity_Dataset2} and different detection methods for toxic content \cite{Toxicity_Detection1, Toxicity_Detection2}, the situation in LLM become more serious and complex. Deshpande et al. systematically evaluate the toxicity of ChatGPT. They find that setting the system parameter of ChatGPT by assigning it a certain persona (\emph{e.g.}, Muhammad Ali), will increase the toxicity of generations \cite{deshpande2023toxicity}. Moreover, Wen et al. unveil that LLMs can generate diverse implicit toxic outputs that are exceptionally difficult to detect via zero-shot prompting \cite{wen2023unveiling}.  The differences in the safety of large language models across various languages have also garnered widespread attention \cite{languagessafety, ermis-etal-2024-one}. RTP-LX, a human-transcreated and human-annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages is proposed to evaluate the detoxifying ability of LLMs \cite{de2024rtp}. Nogara et. al also found that German is measured to be more toxic in the current measuring method \cite{nogara2023toxic}. 


Reducing or preventing the generation of such content is a critical challenge. Recently, Xu et al. propose a method based on perspective-taking prompting which inspires LLMs to integrate diverse human perspectives and self-regulate their responses \cite{xu2024walking}. Klein et al. study the integration of a contrastive learning objective for fine-tuning LLMs for implicit knowledge editing and controlled text generation, which shows a significant decrease in the generation of toxic content \cite{klein2024contrastive}. To mitigate the implicit toxicity, Wen et al. optimize the language model with a reward that prefers implicit toxic outputs to explicit and non-toxic ones \cite{wen2023unveiling}. Han et al. propose linear transformation of word embeddings~\cite{lmsteer2024} to make LLMs less toxic and more positive.


At present, various methodologies are employed to measure toxicity, including human evaluation \cite{facebookmoderation} and automated methods \cite{perspectiveapi, openaimoderation, delphi}. Among the automated tools, the Perspective API \cite{perspectiveapi} is the most widely used, processing more than 500 million assessments each day \cite{perspectiveapicount}.

    \caption{The distribution of toxicity scores across various models in a toxicity evaluation.}
    \label{fig:toxicity_dis}
    \vspace{-15pt}
\end{figure}

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} To evaluate the toxicity of LLMs, like the previous setting in TrustLLM \cite{huang2024position}, we measure the average toxicity score of the LLMs' response in jailbreak evaluation by Perspective API \cite{perspectiveapi}.

\setlength{\intextsep}{-1pt}
\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{r}{0.45\textwidth}

    \vspace{-15pt}
    \caption{Average toxicity score of different LLMs.}
    \label{fig:avg_toxicity}
    
\end{wrapfigure}

\textbf{\textit{Result Analysis.}} We show the distribution of toxicity scores of different LLMs in \autoref{fig:toxicity_dis}, and the average toxicity score in \autoref{fig:avg_toxicity}. 

\textit{\ul{Most LLMs demonstrate relatively low levels of toxicity.}} As illustrated in \autoref{fig:toxicity_dis} and \autoref{fig:avg_toxicity}, even though we find LLMs may exhibit high toxicity in some extreme cases, the overall trend shows that a majority of LLMs maintain low toxicity scores, suggesting that current advancements in LLM design are generally effective at minimizing toxic outputs. 

\textit{\ul{There is no substantial difference in toxicity levels between open-source and proprietary models.}} As shown in \autoref{fig:avg_toxicity}, both open-weight and proprietary models display similar distributions and average toxicity scores. This finding suggests that open-source models can achieve toxicity control comparable to that of proprietary models, making them viable options for applications focused on trustworthiness. The lack of significant disparity highlights that toxicity mitigation techniques are broadly accessible across different model types and developers.


\subsubsection{Exaggerated Safety}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{image/exaggerated_safety.pdf}
    \caption{Exaggerated safety generation pipeline.}
    \label{fig:exaggerated_safety_pipeline}
    \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

Exaggerated Safety (also termed as ``false refusal'' or ``pseudo-harmful'' \cite{an2024automatic}) is a new emergent alignment issue in generative models \cite{xstest, zhang2024don, cao2024nothing, an2024automatic, shi2024navigating}. For instance, Google takes down the portrait generation feature of Gemini Pro 1.5 \cite{team2023gemini} after user complaints about its false refusals against clearly harmless user requests, such as “generate a picture of white people smiling to each other \cite{reddit2024gemini}. This excessive sensitivity is intended to minimize risk but can result in the unnecessary suppression of legitimate and safe interactions \cite{an2024automatic}. Based on previous studies \cite{xstest, cao2024nothing}, we define exaggerated safety as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Exaggerated Safety refers to a characteristic of some generative models where they exhibit an overly cautious approach, leading them to reject or avoid responding to harmless queries.}
\end{tcolorbox}

To evaluate the exaggerated safety in current LLMs, XSTest comprises 250 safe prompts across ten prompt types that well-calibrated models should not refuse to comply with \cite{xstest}. Similarly, Shi et al. propose OKTest \cite{shi2024navigating} to evaluate the exaggerated safety based on CommonsenseQA \cite{talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa} and WikiQA \cite{yang-etal-2015-wikiqa}. To develop a large-scale high-quality evaluation dataset, An et al. propose a synthetic dataset PHTest, which is based on prefix optimization to automatically generate the harmless prompt that may trigger LLMs' refusal \cite{an2024automatic}. Li et al. introduced MOSSBench to specifically evaluate the oversensitivity of MLLMs to harmless multimodal queries \cite{li2024mossbench}.

To mitigate the exaggerated safety in LLMs, recent studies have proposed various methods. For instance, Shi et al. propose a method based on self-contrastive decoding, which actively modulates the output distribution to
discern the model’s shortcuts, leveraging these as attributes to refine the model’s output inversely \cite{shi2024navigating}. Moreover, Zhao et al. propose a novel post-safety alignment (PSA) method to enhance safety, mitigate exaggerated safety, and achieve utility-preserving simultaneously \cite{zhao2024towards}.

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} We employ the same evaluation method used in jailbreaking assessments. However, a higher RtA score indicates poorer performance of the LLMs, as it reflects their inability to assess the potential harm posed by the given queries accurately. To achieve fine-grained evaluation, we adapt the prompt template for evaluating three kinds of answers (as shown in Appendix \ref{app:exa_safety_prompt}): 1) Full refusal of the prompt, 2) Partial refusal of the prompt, and 3) comply with the prompt. 


\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}} The dataset for evaluating exaggerated safety concerns is constructed through the following pipeline: (1) Initially, leveraging unsafe topics (consistent with those used in jailbreak dataset generation), we employ large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to generate associated words or phrases relevant to these unsafe topics. For instance, terms like "idiot," "dumb," and "trash" are commonly found in the context of personal insults, which may be harmful. Additionally, a dataset pool comprising various benign datasets, such as WikiQA \cite{yang-etal-2015-wikiqa}, TruthfulQA \cite{lin2021truthfulqa}, and CommonsenseQA \cite{talmor-etal-2019-commonsenseqa}, is maintained to provide harmless questions as the few-shot examples for the generation of exaggerated safety queries. (2) By giving the harmless queries and words/phrases related to unsafe topics, we utilize a case generator powered by LLMs that applies nine transformation policies (as outlined in \autoref{tab:exaggerated_safety_policy}), inspired by XSTest \cite{xstest}, to create queries that include the given words/phrases while maintaining the harmlessness of generated queries. 

% (3) Finally, contextual variator is performed using LLM, which adjusts query length, sentence structure, and expression style to ensure a varied set of safety-sensitive queries.

\textbf{\textit{Result Analysis.}} We show the full and combined RtA rate of different LLMs in \autoref{fig:exa_safety}. 

\textit{\ul{Most LLMs perform well in managing exaggerated safety, although some models still exhibit a tendency toward over-caution.}} As observed in \autoref{fig:exa_safety}, the majority of LLMs demonstrate strong performance in exaggerated safety, with less than 5\% full RtA and under 10\% combined RtA. Compared to results from one year ago in TrustLLM \cite{huang2024position}, this reflects significant progress in the alignment of LLMs. However, some models, such as the Claude series, still exhibit relatively higher RtA rates, indicating room for improvement in achieving real alignment.


\subsubsection{Other Safety Issues}

\textbf{\textit{Prompt Injection Attack.}}
% Prompt injections are a significant concern for the security of Large Language Models (LLMs), as recent work has shown that LLMs can be highly sensitive to such attacks, rendering them brittle and unsafe for certain applications.
Prompt injection attacks pose a serious threat to the security of LLMs and their applications. These attacks take advantage of the models' difficulty in distinguishing between genuine user inputs and malicious commands, exploiting their natural language processing capabilities. Recent research has highlighted how vulnerable LLMs are to such manipulations, making them potentially unreliable and unsafe in certain contexts \cite{greshake2023youvesignedforcompromising,wang2023safeguarding,pedro2023prompt,yan2023virtual,yu2023assessing,yip2023novel,yi2023benchmarking,salem2023maatphor,299563}. 
Prompt injections exploit the inability of LLM applications to differentiate between developer instructions and user inputs, as both are processed as strings of natural-language text. 
Like SQL injections\cite{10.1145/1111037.1111070,owasp2023sql}, which target databases by disguising commands as user inputs, prompt injections similarly manipulate LLMs, but by targeting the model's processing of natural-language text.

Prompt injection attacks can be categorized into handcrafted and automated methods, both posing significant threats to LLMs by manipulating them through specially designed prompts. 
Early research has found that simply adding special characters like  ``\textbackslash n'' and ``\textbackslash t'' can cause LLMs to follow new instructions provided by attackers \cite{goodside2023prompt,harang2023securing}.
\cite{ignore_previous_prompt} demonstrated that inserting context-switching text can mislead LLMs into following injected instructions. This allows attackers to misalign the original intent of a prompt to achieve different, often malicious objectives, and to recover sensitive information from private prompts. Shao et al.~\cite{shao2024making} showed that these attacks are more effective to LLMs whose alignment process is poisoned by prompt injection attacks. Recently, studies have explored automated methods for conducting prompt injection attacks \cite{liu2024automaticuniversalpromptinjection,shi2024optimizationbasedpromptinjectionattack}. Liu et al. \cite{liu2024automaticuniversalpromptinjection} introduced unified prompt injection, showing strong universality across various user interactions and datasets. Similarly, Shi et al. \cite{shi2024optimizationbasedpromptinjectionattack} proposed an optimization-based attack targeting LLM-as-a-Judge systems, showing that carefully crafted sequences can manipulate LLMs into selecting attacker-controlled responses. Hui et al.~\cite{hui2024pleak} proposed optimization-based prompt injection attacks to steal system prompts of LLM-integrated applications. Liao et al. ~\cite{liao2024eia} introduced Environmental Injection Attacks (EIA) as a novel approach to exploit privacy vulnerabilities in generalist web agents by injecting malicious content into websites. Similarly, Xu et al.~\cite{xu2024advweb}  proposed AdvWeb, a black-box attack framework that compromises web agents through adversarial string injection techniques.

%%defenses
To mitigate the threats posed by prompt injection attacks, researchers have proposed various defense strategies, which can mainly be divided into prevention-based and detection-based methods~\cite{299563}. 
Prevention-based methods~\cite{299563,piet2024jatmo,chen2024struq} aim to make LLMs inherently robust to malicious prompts. 
Piet et al. \cite{piet2024jatmo} proposed Jatmo, a method for generating task-specific models resilient to prompt injection attacks by fine-tuning non-instruction-tuned LLMs for specific tasks. The key insight is that non-instruction-tuned models have not been trained to follow instructions, making them less susceptible to injected commands.
Wallace et al.~\cite{wallace2024instruction} found that LLMs often consider system prompts so they are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. To address this vulnerability, they developed a defense mechanism that trains LLMs to give precedence to privileged instructions.
Chen et al. \cite{chen2024struq} introduced StruQ, a defense mechanism that uses structured queries to separate prompts and data into distinct channels. By fine-tuning a base LLM to only follow instructions in the prompt portion of a query, StruQ prevents the model from confusing injected instructions in user data with legitimate prompts, enhancing resistance to prompt injection attacks.
Chen et al.~\cite{chen2024aligning} established alignment techniques as a powerful defense mechanism against prompt injection attacks in LLMs. 
Wu et al.~\cite{wu2024instructional} advanced this field by developing Instructional Segment Embedding (ISE), a novel technique that enhances LLM security by protecting priority rules from malicious prompt overrides. 
Chen et al.~\cite{chen2024defense} created defensive strategies inspired by attack methodologies themselves, achieving superior performance compared to conventional training-free approaches.

Detection-based methods \cite{299563,jain2023baseline,alon2023detecting} focus on identifying the given inputs and responses to determine whether it is compromised filtering out harmful inputs and responses through data validation.
Despite these efforts, the literature lacked a systematic understanding of prompt injection attacks and their defenses. Liu et al.~\cite{299563} addressed this gap by proposing a framework to formalize prompt injection attacks and defenses. They conducted a systematic evaluation of five prompt injection attacks and ten defenses across ten LLMs and seven tasks, providing a common benchmark for quantitatively evaluating future prompt injection attacks and defense mechanisms. This framework provides the foundations for scientifically studying this topic.  
Hung et al.~\cite{hung2024attention} developed Attention Tracker, an efficient detection system for prompt injection attacks that analyzes attention patterns on instructions, eliminating the need for additional LLM inference operations. Zhu et al.~\cite{zhu2025melonindirectpromptinjection} introduced MELON, a detection framework that identifies attacks by comparing agent behaviors under original and masked user prompts, where action similarity across both scenarios indicates potential attacks. MELON demonstrates robust attack detection while maintaining the agent's original task performance.

Several research teams have developed specialized benchmarks to evaluate LLM vulnerabilities and defenses against prompt injection attacks. 
Toyer et al.~\cite{toyer2023tensor} created Tensor Trust to assess LLMs' susceptibility to manual prompt injection attacks. Debenedetti et al.~\cite{debenedetti2024agentdojo} explored AI agents' vulnerabilities through AgentDojo, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to test agents that interact with untrusted data. 
Li et al.~\cite{li2024gentel} introduced GenTel-Bench, an open-source benchmark specifically created to evaluate the effectiveness of various prompt injection detection and defense mechanisms.

% Defending against prompt injection attacks involves both prevention-based and detection-based strategies. Prevention-based methods include modifying the training process of LLMs, such as incorporating adversarial training or using robust optimization techniques to make models less sensitive to malicious prompts \cite{cheng2023gptsafe}. Detection-based methods focus on identifying and filtering out harmful inputs through data preprocessing, input validation, and anomaly detection \cite{sun2023safetyguard}.

%%application
Prompt injection attacks pose significant risks when LLMs are integrated into applications and interact with external content, potentially amplifying vulnerabilities\cite{greshake2023youvesignedforcompromising,liu2023prompt,nestaas2024adversarial}.
 Greshake Tzovaras \cite{greshake2023youvesignedforcompromising} demonstrated that LLM-integrated applications are susceptible to prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs can cause the application to perform unintended actions or leak sensitive information.  In such attacks, attackers can exploit the LLM-integrated application to inject harmful prompts via user inputs or external data sources causing the system to produce outcomes aligned with the attacker's intentions.
To evaluate the impact of prompt injection in modern LLM-integrated applications, \cite{liu2023prompt} developed a framework for prompt injection attacks. They applied this framework to analyze 36 LLM-integrated applications, finding that most of them were vulnerable. In addition, Nestaas et al. \cite{nestaas2024adversarial} introduced the concept of adversarial search engine optimization for LLMs, demonstrating that carefully crafted third-party content can manipulate LLM outputs by influencing the model’s processing and ranking mechanisms.


% \textbf{\textit{Backdoor \& Poisoning Attack. (Yue \& Jiawen)}}
% The Trojan Activation Attack \cite{wang2023backdoor} injects Trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These vectors can be activated during inference to manipulate the models' activations, steering them toward behaviors desired by the attacker and generating unsafe outputs. Huang et al. propose Composite Backdoor Attacks (CBA) \cite{huang2023composite}, activate only when multiple dispersed trigger keys appear, demonstrating the attack's effectiveness. 
% Benchmark for Backdoor Attacks on Large Language Models\cite{li2024backdoorllm}

\textbf{\textit{Backdoor Attack.}} A backdoor model gives malicious predictions desired by the attacker for the input that contains a trigger while behaving correctly on benign inference samples. Depending on the attack scenarios, existing backdoor attacks can mainly be categorized into two types: data poisoning-based and model weight-modifying-based.

Most poisoning backdoor attacks \cite{wan2023poisoning,cai2022badprompt,xu2023instructions,wan2023poisoning,huang2023composite} involve inserting triggers into the instructions or prompts of a small portion of the training data, altering the corresponding predictions to target specific outcomes. After training on this poisoned dataset, a backdoor can be implanted into the LLM. Another approach of this type, BadGPT \cite{shi2023badgpt}, poisons the RLHF training data by manipulating preference scores to compromise the LLM’s reward model. The triggers used to construct the poisoned dataset are diverse. For instance, Huang et al. propose Composite Backdoor Attacks (CBA) \cite{huang2023composite}, where the backdoor is activated only when multiple dispersed trigger keys appear, while \cite{xu2023instructions} uses an entire instruction sentence as the trigger. And more commonly, a specific symbol, prase or word is used as the trigger.

For weight modifying methods, some focuse on incorporating new knowledge into a new memory space or additional parameters \cite{huang2023transformer,hartvigsen2024aging,wang2023backdoor} while leaving the original parameters unchanged. The backdoor could hide in these additional knowledge or parameters. For instance, Trojan Activation Attack \cite{wang2023backdoor} injects Trojan steering vectors into the activation layers of LLMs. These vectors can be activated during inference to manipulate the models' activations, steering them toward behaviors desired by the attacker and generating unsafe outputs. Other attacks directly modify model's parameters to implant the backdoor \cite{wu2023depn,li2024pmet}.BadEdit \cite{li2024badedit} as a typical example directly modifies the feed forward layer in a certain transformer block of a LLM to implant a backdoor which boasts superiority backdoor efficiency, as it requires no model training nor poisoned dataset construction.

These attacks pose a key risk, as backdoored models may be shared on the internet and widely deployed by regular users, leading to widespread infection. Even for closed-source LLMs, they can be backdoored simply by contaminating the training dataset without needing access to the model’s details. To address these issues, several defenses have been proposed, which can be categorized into two main types: backdoor mitigation and detection. Fine-tuning is a commonly used method for backdoor mitigation. By utilizing clean training data for the target task, a defender can fine-tune a suspicious model to eliminate potential backdoors. Another line of defense focuses on backdoor detection, specifically identifying poisoned data within the tuning set \cite{sagar2022defending,sun2022coprotector,shao2021bddr}. However, these methods cannot precisely detect whether an LLM that has been trained and deployed is backdoored which still remains a gap in research and urgent to been addressed.

\subsection{Fairness}
\textbf{\textit{Overview.}}
As LLMs become more advanced and widely used, fairness in their outputs has emerged as a critical concern. This concern has driven extensive research into identifying (e.g. embedding-based, probability-based, and generation-based metrics) and mitigating (e.g. pre-, in-, intra-, and post-processing) various forms of bias \cite{chu2024fairnesssurvey, fairnesssurvey, nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset, bai2024fairmonitor, garimella2022demographic, liu2023trustworthy,debiasinggradient2023,debiasing2023b}, and enhancing LLMs with explicit sociocultural norms to cover a wide range of cultures and regions~\cite{normsage2023,massiveculture2023}. Building on our previous research in the TrustLLM \cite{huang2024position}, we categorize bias in large language models into three key dimensions: \textbf{stereotypes (\S\ref{sec:stereotype})}, \textbf{disparagement (\S\ref{sec:disparagement})}, and \textbf{preference (\S\ref{sec:preference})}. Stereotypes arise when generalized beliefs about certain groups lead to biased outputs \cite{stereoset, CrowSpairs, siddique2024bettermath}, such as the statement ``Girls are not good at math." Making broad, negative statements that discriminate against specific groups falls under the category of disparagement \cite{biasandharm, dev2022measures, Dev_Li_Phillips_Srikumar_2020}, an example being "It is reasonable for Black people to face discrimination." And when models favor specific ideas or groups over others, it leads to a bias known as preference\cite{rozado2024political, chatgptpolitical, liu2023trustworthy}, such as a model generating "I support socialism over capitalism."
% \yue{You may need to mention TrustLLM to justify why we selected these three dimensions. Moreover, I think giving some examples to clearly explain each dimension would be better. For instance, "Girls are not good at math" is an instance of a stereotype.}

    \label{fig: fairness_pipeline}
    \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stereotype}
\label{sec:stereotype}
Stereotypes embedded in LLMs present a significant challenge to ensuring unbiased and fair outputs. For instance, a recent report shows LLMs have strong stereotypical associations between female names, and words such as "family," "children," and "husband" conform to traditional gender roles \cite{midgley2024large}. A central aspect of achieving fairness is addressing stereotypes, which are a significant source of bias and can lead to harmful societal impacts \cite{liu2023trustworthy} if left unchecked. Based on previous research, we define stereotypes in LLMs as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Stereotype in the context of LLMs refers to a generalized, often oversimplified expectation or assumption about particular social groups based on their specific characteristics, resulting in biased or inaccurate outputs.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{\textit{(a) Stereotype Detection and Evaluation.}} Research on stereotypes in LLMs primarily covers categories such as gender \cite{gender-bias, zhao2018gender, plazadelarco2024angrymen, wan2023kelly}, race \cite{stereoset}, profession \cite{zhao2018gender}, religion \cite{religion-stereotype}, sexual orientation \cite{dhingra2023queer, babonnaud2024bias}, name \cite{sandoval-etal-2023-rose} and other social identifiers \cite{dev2022measures, bbq, trista2023multilingual}. Identifying these stereotypes has evolved significantly as the field progressed. Embedding-based methods \cite{caliskan2017semantics, guo2021detecting} analyze word vectors to uncover stereotypes, while probability-based techniques \cite{ahn2021mitigating, nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset} focus on token likelihoods assigned by models. In the follow-up, datasets like StereoSet \cite{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset} and CrowS-Pairs \cite{CrowSpairs} were introduced, enabling systematic and scalable detection of biases across various stereotype categories. More recent approaches have sought to refine and expand upon these earlier methods. Cheng et al. \cite{cheng2023marked} introduce Marked Personas, a lexicon-free approach to identifying stereotypes by distinguishing between marked and unmarked demographic descriptions. Bai et al. \citep{bai2024fairmonitor} introduce a dual framework by combining static and dynamic testing methods. Shrawgi et al. \cite{shrawgi-etal-2024-uncovering} found that previous benchmarks provide a fake sense of fairness as they are better at hiding their biases on simpler tasks. To end this, they propose a new benchmark LLM Stereotype Index (LSI) based on different tasks with varying complexities. Besides broader, individual categories, Ma et al. studied the intersectional stereotype in LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, white and old, women and Muslim), and they underscore the urgency of paying attention to intersectional bias in ongoing efforts to reduce stereotype prevalence in LLMs \cite{ma-etal-2023-intersectional}. Furthermore, to evaluate stereotypes in large sets of prompts, QuaCer-B (Quantitative Certification of Bias) is designed to identify biased responses from the LLM across any set of prompts that contain sensitive attributes and are sampled from a distribution \cite{chaudhary2024quantitative}.

% mitigation
\textbf{\textit{(b) Sterotype Mitigation.}} Researchers have long been dedicated to mitigating stereotypes \cite{liu2023trustworthy, fairnesssurvey, gallegos2024biassurvey, fairnessSurvey2}. 
Early debiasing efforts targeted word and sentence embeddings \cite{bolukbasi2016man, sun2019mitigating} or used counterfactual data augmentation \cite{mitigatebias3, hovy2021five} to reduce gender bias in classification tasks. Modern mitigation methods cover a broad range of pre-processing, in-training,
and post-processing methods \cite{gallegos2024selfdebias}, including general dataset stereotype mitigation \cite{garimella2022demographic, ghanbarzadeh2023gender, zayed2023deep, qian2022perturbation}, fine-tuning \cite{woo2023compensatory, attanasio2022entropy, yu2023unlearning}, modified decoding algorithms to reduce biased outputs \cite{dathathri2019plug, meade2023using, krause2020gedi, liu2021dexperts}, and the leverage of auxiliary post-processing models \cite{dhingra2023queer, jain2021generating, majumder2022interfair, sun2021they}. For instance, Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) \cite{DisCo, pitis2022mocoda} augments the training corpus by reversing the polarity of gender-specific words and syntactic groups in the original training sentences. Attanasio et al. \cite{attanasio2022entropy} introduce an Entropy-based Attention Regularization (EAR) method that mitigates stereotypes by maximizing token self-attention entropy during the finetuning process, reducing the model's over-reliance on specific terms and thereby alleviating unintended biases. Liu et al. \cite{liu2021dexperts} propose DEXPERTS, an advanced decoding algorithm, to leverage expert and anti-expert models to control text generation. Dhingra et al. \cite{dhingra2023queer} introduce a post-hoc debiasing approach leveraging SHAP analysis to mitigate stereotypes in LLMs. Moreover, to improve computational feasibility, Gallegos et al. \cite{gallegos2024selfdebias} introduce a zero-shot self-debiasing technique that reduces stereotypes by refining prompts for LLMs without altering their training or parameters. In more recent research, Qureshi et al. \cite{qureshi2024refine} introduce the REFINE-LM method, which utilizes reinforcement learning to mitigate stereotypes in pre-trained language models while preserving model performance.

% \textbf{\textit{Evaluation Challenges \& Questions.}} Evaluating the LLM's ability to detect, respond to, and avoid stereotypes presents certain challenges. Although there are many datasets covering a wide range and comprehensive classification of stereotypes \cite{CrowSpairs, stereoset, zhao2018gender}, most of them primarily provide sentences that are either stereotypical or anti-stereotypical. Even when tasks are included, they are often limited to relatively fixed formats, such as stereotype recognition and classification \cite{bbq, wang2022supernaturalinstructions}. In reality, tasks can be much more diverse, such as agreement on the stereotype, and stereotype query tests \cite{huang2024position}. Therefore, the evaluation framework also needs to evolve to accommodate this diversity. Additionally, it is crucial to consider different evaluation methods tailored to the nature of each task. For example, tasks with golden answers may benefit from keyword matching \cite{zou2023universal}, while more open-ended questions might require the use of LLM-as-a-Judge \cite{zheng2023judging, kumar2024decodingbias} for assessment.

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} (1) \textit{Evaluation method.} For stereotype classification and recognition tasks with ground truth, we apply keyword matching and use accuracy as the evaluation metric. For open-ended tasks like stereotype query tests and agreement on stereotypes, we use the LLM-as-a-Judge approach \cite{zheng2023judging}, with the Percentage of Refusing to Answer (RtA) as a key metric like previous studies \cite{shrawgi-etal-2024-uncovering, wang2024ceb} to measure the model's refusal to engage with stereotypical content.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic dataset.}} In the stereotype dataset construction process, (a) the data crafter utilizes a data pool derived from three primary datasets (i.e. CrowS-pairs \cite{CrowSpairs}, StereoSet \cite{stereoset}, and BBQ dataset \cite{bbq}). These datasets provide foundational stereotypical and anti-stereotypical content. (b) Then an LLM-powered case generator produces queries grounded in stereotype and anti-stereotype content within this pool. (c) Finally, an LLM-powered diversity enhancer paraphrases these queries, enriching them with style, length, and format variations. This step tackles the issue of limited task types and fixed responses by introducing a wider variety of queries, which is essential for a thorough evaluation.

\subsubsection{Disparagement}
\label{sec:disparagement}
As LLMs become central to various applications, addressing all forms of bias is crucial for fairness. Disparagement, unlike stereotypes, is not confined to specific cultures or contexts \cite{dev2022measures, Dev_Li_Phillips_Srikumar_2020}. Disparagement is closely connected to toxicity and hate speech, which significantly creates a hostile environment \cite{Dixon2018MeasuringAM, dev2022measures}. Understanding and mitigating disparagement in LLMs is vital for creating a more equitable system. Based on previous research \cite{dev2022measures, Sun2024TrustLLMTI}, we define disparagement as follows:
\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Disparagement in LLMs, refers to any behavior by a model that reinforces the notion that certain groups are less valuable and less deserving of respect or resources than others.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{\textit{Disparagement Detection and Mitigation.}} Researchers have identified and documented various forms of disparagement and discrimination in LLMs. For example, Dong et al. \cite{dong2024linguistic} exposed the phenomenon of linguistic discrimination in LLMs, where responses to queries are more favorable for certain languages than others. To address this issue, they proposed LDFighter, a similarity-based voting mechanism designed to mitigate this disparagement bias. An et al. \cite{an2024hirediscriminate} investigate whether LLMs exhibit discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and gender in simulated hiring decisions. They find that LLMs tend to favor White applicants and disadvantage Hispanic applicants in various settings. In addition to identifying and addressing specific instances of disparagement, another line of research has focused on developing methods to quantify discrimination in LLMs. In addition to identifying specific instances of disparagement, some research has focused on quantifying and evaluating discrimination in LLMs \cite{liu2024PVF, kumar2024decodingbias, kumar2024decodingbias}. For example, Liu et al. \cite{liu2024PVF} introduce the Prejudice-Volatility Framework (PVF), a statistical framework to quantify and assess social discrimination in LLMs. In more recent research, et al. \cite{kumar2024decodingbias} develop a standardized and automated framework for detecting and assessing gender discrimination bias. To mitigate this, Li et al. \cite{li2024steering} present a Causality-Guided Debiasing Framework, which is a strategy to reduce social discrimination and biases in LLM responses by leveraging causal insights into model training and inference processes.

% \textbf{\textit{Evaluation Challenges \& Questions.}} Evaluating the LLM’s handling of disparagement presents several challenges: First, the availability of disparagement-related datasets is quite limited, making it a low-resource area overall. Additionally, there is significant variation in the amount of data available across different categories, which further constrains the ability to comprehensively cover the broad scope of disparagement \cite{dong2024linguistic}. Second, the range of disparagement is vast and constantly evolving, as new forms of harmful language continuously emerge in different contexts. As such, any evaluation framework must be dynamic, allowing for the inclusion of these new patterns over time. Finally, the disparagement data for evaluation should closely align with real-world instances, reflecting the types of harmful language encountered in actual discourse to ensure that the assessments remain relevant and comprehensive \cite{dev2022measures}.

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} (1) \textit{Evaluation method.} For disparagement evaluation, as the cases are open-ended, we apply the LLM-as-a-Judge approach to assess the responses. We choose RtA as the key metric, following the approach of previous research \cite{kumar2024decodingbias}.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic dataset.}} The key steps in constructing a dynamic disparagement dataset are outlined as follows: (a) a web browsing agent serves as the data crafter, retrieving disparagement examples relevant to specific target groups (e.g., women, individuals with disabilities, the uneducated). This can address the limited availability and uneven distribution of disparagement data \cite{dong2024linguistic}. Also, this step can closely align the dataset with real-world instances, reflecting the types of harmful language encountered in actual discourse to ensure that the assessments remain relevant and comprehensive \cite{dev2022measures}. (b) Then, an LLM-powered case generator creates queries by providing instructions based on these scenario examples. (c) Finally, an LLM-powered diversity enhancer paraphrases the queries to introduce variations and enhance diversity.

\subsubsection{Preference}
\label{sec:preference}
Preference, also a form of bias \cite{liu2023trustworthy, lee2024aligning, li2025preference}, can significantly impact the objectivity and reliability of the responses, because LLMs may produce outputs that reflect subjective biases rather than neutral, factual information \cite{10.1145/3593013.3593985}. For example, a recent report unveils that the current latest LLMs invariably lean slightly left politically \cite{dailysignal2024}, which indicates ensuring LLMs’ neutrality will be a pressing need. This bias is particularly concerning as it could influence users' decisions and perceptions, potentially undermining the trustworthiness of the model. We define preference as follows based on prior research:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Preference refers to the situations where LLMs may have stronger tendencies or preferences for certain types of people, things, or ideas, which may affect the neutrality and objectivity of their responses.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{\textit{(a) Preference Bias in LLMs.}} Previous research \cite{liu2023trustworthy} reveals that preference bias goes beyond the scope of political, scientific, and societal matters. For instance, Rozado \cite{rozado2024political} examines the political preferences embedded in LLMs, revealing a tendency for left-leaning biases, and suggests that these preferences may be a result of supervised fine-tuning processes. Rutinowski et al. \cite{rutinowski2024self} and McGee \cite{chatgptpolitical2} also uncover that ChatGPT tends to favor progressive libertarian views in its political orientation. Furthermore, in the field of recommendation systems, recent studies have found that this bias can potentially impact the quality of LLMs' recommendations \cite{recommend1, recommend2, recommend3}. Therefore, preference bias could undermine the credibility of LLMs by producing outputs that are not impartial and lack objective, factual information \cite{lin2024biasindetection}.

% mitigation
\textbf{\textit{(b) Preference Bias Mitigation.}} To address this issue, it is crucial to explore strategies for mitigating preference bias to enhance the reliability and objectivity of LLM outputs \cite{liu2023trustworthy}. 
Solaiman et al. \cite{solaiman2021palm} introduced a method called PALMS, which can mitigate preference bias in language models by employing an iterative fine-tuning process using custom values-targeted datasets. Allam \cite{allam2024biasdpo} introduced BiasDPO, a new framework that mitigates bias through DPO by utilizing a specific loss function to reward the model for generating less biased text. Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2024unibias} proposed the UniBias method, which identifies and masks biased FFN vectors and attention heads during inference to mitigate inherent preference biases in LLMs, enhancing their fairness and robustness. Gao et al. also propose a two-stage fine-tuning inspired by curriculum learning to make LLMs learn to keep honest and neutral \cite{gao2024best}. Moreover, some researchers have suggested that an effective way to address the problem of preference bias is to offer alternative viewpoints that are backed by references \cite{liu2023trustworthy, lewis2020retrieval}.


\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}} (1) \textit{Evaluation method.} We employ the LLM-as-a-Judge approach to evaluate preference tasks to assess the model's neutrality and fairness in responses.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic dataset.}} The construction of the dataset involves several stages designed to address specific evaluation challenges: (a) First, an LLM-powered data crafter is employed to generate preference pairs in specific domains based on a given instruction. Moreover, the specific domains of these pairs can be easily expanded or modified simply by replacing the parameters within the instruction. This flexibility enables the dataset to expand or adapt to new preference categories, addressing the challenge that preferences are often a low-resource category with few available datasets \cite{huang2023learning}. (b) After the pairs are generated, a case generator creates queries that ask the LLM to express a preference based on the given pairs. Since preference pairs are rarely explicitly listed in the queries, there is often no standard reference set for evaluation. This absence makes it challenging to assess preferences uniformly. To address this issue, the case-generation process involves crafting customized queries designed to elicit subtle biases or preferences from the model. These tailored queries facilitate the detection of unintended biases. (c) Finally, an LLM-powered diversity enhancer is used to paraphrase these preference queries, introducing variations in style, length, and format. Therefore, this step not only supports robust evaluation by providing a comprehensive range of examples but also enables the evaluation framework to be adaptable to nuanced biases across different contexts and query formats.

\textit{\ul{Models exhibit varying levels of stereotype accuracy and disparagement response.}} We can observe that GLM-4-Plus achieved the highest stereotype accuracy at 91.08\%, indicating a strong ability to avoid stereotypes. However, its disparagement response accuracy is only 57.00\%. Conversely, Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrates a disparagement response accuracy of 65.48\%, yet its stereotype accuracy is lower at 81.25\%. This indicates that higher performance in stereotype accuracy does not necessarily correlate with improved disparagement response across all models.

\textit{\ul{Most models demonstrate strong performance in preference responses.}} While Yi-Lightning and Deepseek show preference RtA rates only around 80\%, the majority of models surpassed 90\% in this metric. Notably, Mixtral-8*22B achieved an outstanding preference response accuracy of 99.56\%, closely followed by Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Gemini-1.5-Pro at 98.22\%. These results highlight that most models effectively remain neutral when asked about their preferences.

\textit{\ul{Smaller models tend to underperform across all fairness metrics compared to their larger counterparts within the same series.}} For instance, Llama-3.1-8B achieved only 73.25\% in stereotype, 60.00\% in disparagement, and 88.89\% in preference. In contrast, Llama-3.1-70B, which is a larger model from the same series, scored 85.99\% in stereotype, 63.00\% in disparagement, and 89.33\% in preference, illustrating a clear advantage in performance. Similarly, Mixtral-8*22B generally outperformed Mixtral-8*7B.

\subsection{Robustness}
\label{sec:llm_robustness}
\textbf{\textit{Overview.}}
Robustness in LLMs denotes their capacity to maintain consistent performance and generate accurate, relevant responses when faced with diverse, unexpected, or perturbed inputs. As LLMs proliferate across diverse domains, this attribute has become a paramount concern for academic researchers and industry practitioners. Robustness has long been a subject of extensive investigation and discourse within academic research. In its broadest sense, robustness studies encompass all potential factors that may lead to erroneous system outputs. In this work, we focus specifically on the robustness of LLMs when confronted with natural language perturbations. These perturbations are distinguished from adversarial attacks based on optimization strategies in white-box settings; instead, they originate from habitual usage patterns and inadvertent errors inherent in human linguistic expression. Based on previous research~\cite{huang2024position}, we define the robustness as follows:
\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Robustness refers to an LLM’s ability to generate accurate and relevant responses to text inputs containing various natural language perturbations. This includes effectively handling linguistic variations, textual errors, and contextual ambiguities while preserving the core meaning and intent of the conversation.
}
\end{tcolorbox}
Current research on the robustness of LLMs can be primarily categorized into three key areas: 1) exploration of novel natural language perturbations, 2) robustness benchmarking and evaluation, and 3) enhancement of model robustness.

\textit{\textbf{(a) Novel Natural Language Perturbation.}}
Previous studies~\cite{jiang2019avoiding,niu2018adversarial, li2018textbugger,nie2020adversarial,belinkov2017synthetic,gao2018black,alzantot2018generating,ribeiro2018semantically,jia2017adversarial} have extensively explored the robustness of small-scale language models (e.g., BERT~\cite{bert}). These studies have examined the impact of various natural language perturbations on a range of traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks. For instance, Belinkov et al.~\cite{belinkov2017synthetic} introduced two types of noise in neural machine translation models: natural noise and artificial synthetic noise. Natural noise originates from real-world corpora and includes common spelling errors, while artificial synthetic noise involves letter swaps, random shuffling, and simulated typing errors. Ribeiro et al.~\cite{ribeiro2018semantically} introduced semantically equivalent adversarial rules, which are simple and universal replacement rules that can introduce adversarial perturbations across various text instances by using synonym substitutions, all while preserving the original semantics. Recently, some research~\cite{wang2023decodingtrust,liu2023trustworthy,asl2024semantic,zhuo2023robustness} has extended these natural noise paradigms to LLMs, aiming to evaluate their robustness in more complex linguistic environments. With LLMs’ improved capability for processing long text, researchers~\cite{shi2023large,mousavi2024llms,huang2025contextualdistraction} have increasingly focused on exploring novel natural language perturbations and their impact on model performance and robustness. Shi et al.~\cite{shi2023large} examined the susceptibility of LLMs to distractions caused by irrelevant information in the input context. To test this, they developed a dataset of mathematical word problems containing irrelevant contextual information, aiming to evaluate the models’ ability to extract and process relevant data while disregarding the irrelevant.
Mousavi et al.~\cite{mousavi2024llms} investigated the robustness of LLMs to speech-to-text errors by employing state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) engine to transcribe spoken dialogues, subsequently analyzing error typology and distribution, and simulating these errors in LLM inputs.

\textit{\textbf{(b) Robustness Benchmarking and Evaluation.}} With the significant advancement in LLMs' capabilities to handle complex tasks, their application scope has expanded considerably, underscoring the growing need for robustness evaluation. In response, numerous benchmarks and studies~\cite{zhu2023promptbench,liu2023trustworthy,wang2023robustness,robustness1,robustness2} have recently emerged, specifically focused on assessing the robustness of LLMs. Research studies \cite{zhu2023promptbench,liu2023trustworthy} introduced standardized evaluation frameworks that utilize natural language perturbations, such as typos or synonyms, to assess the impact of slight variations on the performance of LLMs while maintaining semantic integrity. These frameworks encompass a range of traditional NLP tasks, and the results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit vulnerability to these adversarial perturbations.
Wang et al. \cite{wang2023robustness} focused on the out-of-distribution (OOD) classification task, evaluating the robustness of LLMs in such scenarios.
Han et al. \cite{robustness1} expanded the research scope to the field of information extraction, examining the performance of LLMs when processing perturbed structured data. 
Shen et al. \cite{robustness2} concentrated on question-answering tasks, analyzing the impact of adversarial perturbations on the accuracy of LLMs' responses. Although existing research has proposed numerous benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of LLMs, these fixed dataset-based tests are gradually exposing their limitations as LLM performance continues to improve and new models are frequently released. Fixed datasets struggle to keep pace with the rapid development of LLMs and may fail to accurately reflect the capabilities of the latest models. Furthermore, models might be optimized to perform well on specific benchmarks, leading to test results that do not truly reflect their performance in practical applications.

\textit{\textbf{(c) Enhancement of Model Robustness.}} Given that LLMs are exposed to natural language perturbations, some studies~\cite{park2024adversarial,jiang2024enhancing,xiong2024enhance} have focused on exploring methods to enhance model robustness.
Park et al.~\cite{park2024adversarial} incorporated a wide range of stylistic variations into the model training, making the model more resilient to adversarial attacks that attempt to evade detection by modifying the writing style of fake news.
Jiang et al.~\cite{jiang2024enhancing} enhance the robustness of LLMs by designing prompts that minimize the influence of irrelevant information. By carefully crafting prompts, the models are guided to focus on relevant input.
Xiong et al.~\cite{xiong2024enhance} protect LLMs from adversarial perturbation attacks by incorporating graph-based techniques.


\textbf{\textit{Benchmark-Setting.}}
(1) \textit{Evaluation data types.} In assessing the robustness of LLMs, we employed two types of datasets: annotated datasets with ground-truth labels (e.g., GLUE~\cite{wang2018glue}), and open-ended question-answering datasets (e.g., CNN/DailyMail~\cite{hermann2015teaching}).
(2) \textit{Evaluation method.}~We introduce the robustness score as a metric to quantify model robustness. For annotated datasets, we define the robustness score as the proportion of samples for which the model maintains consistent responses before and after the introduction of perturbations. For open-ended datasets, we compute the robustness score using the LLM-as-a-Judge framework. This approach involves comparing the model’s responses under both perturbed and unperturbed conditions. The robustness score is defined as the proportion of instances for which the LLM-as-a-Judge classifies the two responses as a ``Tie'', signifying no discernible qualitative difference between the responses to the perturbed and unperturbed inputs.
(3) \textit{Perturbation types.}~We have attempted to comprehensively cover various natural language perturbations to assess LLM's robustness, as detailed in \autoref{tab:pertubation_types}. The following provides a detailed overview of the perturbation addition process.

\begin{tcolorbox}[details]
\small
    $\triangleright$ \textbf{Adding Perturbations to Text:}  As shown in \autoref{tab:pertubation_types}, we define 14 types of natural language perturbations across 8 categories. The specific methods for adding these perturbations to text are as follows. For Spelling Mistake, Emoji Insertion, and Spaced Uppercase, we use KeyBERT to select key terms from the text and apply these perturbations accordingly. For Social Tagging, we use an LLM to generate a subtitle for the text, adding it as hashtag ``\#'' and tagging people’s names in the text with ``@'' to simulate social media language. For Multilingual Blend, we apply both word- and sentence-level perturbations by translating selected keywords or phrases into Chinese. As for Distractive Text, Syntactic Disruptions, and Recondite Words, we employ specific prompts with LLMs to introduce these perturbations to the original text.

        Spelling Mistake & This noise simulates common spelling errors that may occur while writing text. It includes missing letters, incorrect letters, repeated letters, capitalization mistakes, extra spaces, and swapped adjacent letters.
  \\
        Emoji Insertion & This noise represents the practice of inserting emojis into text, imitating the common habit of using emojis in social media communication.  \\
        Social Tagging & This noise signifies the use of hashtags (\#) and mentions (@) commonly observed in social media conversations, reflecting the practice of tagging topics and individuals in human communication. \\
        Spaced Uppercase & This noise indicates the insertion of spaces between letters in words, combined with the use of uppercase letters, aiming to emphasize certain words or phrases in written communication. \\
        Multilingual Blend & This perturbation refers to the practice of mixing multiple languages within a single text, reflecting the common habit of using different languages in multilingual communication.  \\
        Distractive Text & This noise denotes when the text includes off-topic or irrelevant content, simulating scenarios where individuals’ thoughts diverge and lead to digressions in the communication. \\
        Syntactic Disruptions & This perturbation denotes alterations or errors in grammatical structure, reflecting disruptions in the syntax that affect the clarity and coherence of the text. \\
        Recondite words & This perturbation denotes the use of infrequent or obscure vocabulary in a text, resulting in a semantic complexity that makes the content difficult to understand.   \\

    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:pertubation_types}
    \vspace{-20pt}
\end{table}





\textbf{\textit{Dynamic dataset.}}~In assessing the robustness of LLMs, we followed the two steps:
(a) Metadata curator: We gathered annotated benchmark datasets and open-ended question-answering datasets used to evaluate LLMs, creating a diverse data pool. This data pool will be regularly updated with new relevant benchmarks.
(b) Test case builder: From this data pool, we randomly selected 400 questions from the annotated datasets and 400 questions from the open-ended question-answering datasets. We then introduced the perturbations listed in \autoref{tab:pertubation_types} into these questions, creating a dataset to test the robustness of LLMs.
When creating the dynamic dataset to test LLM's robustness, we did not employ text refinement models for further question modification, unlike in other dimensions. Additionally, using text refinement models to make further changes could potentially disrupt the original perturbations and compromise the accuracy of the assessment.

\label{tab:robustness_result}
\vspace{-15pt}
\end{table}


\textbf{\textit {Result Analysis.}}~We report the robustness scores of different models in \autoref{tab:robustness_result}, with the following observations. 

\textit{\ul{Models show different degrees of robustness on annotated datasets.}}~As shown in \autoref{tab:robustness_result}, most models exhibit relatively high robustness scores on annotated datasets. A higher robustness score indicates better model robustness. The best-performing models are GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Flash, each achieving a robustness score of 99.36\%, which suggests high consistency in their responses before and after perturbations. The worst-performing model is Mixtral-8*7B, with a robustness score of 88.78\%, indicating a greater impact of perturbations on its performance.
Note that we also evaluated the robustness performance of the three latest reasoning-enhanced models (GPT-o1-preview, GPT-o1-mini, QwQ-32B). On annotated datasets, all models achieved robustness scores exceeding 92\%, with QwQ-32B demonstrating the highest performance among these reasoning-enhanced models by attaining a robustness score of 95.83\%.

\textit{\ul{Models are more robust on annotated datasets than on open-ended ones.}}~We report the robustness performance of models on open-ended datasets and observe that robustness scores on open-ended datasets are generally much lower than those on annotated datasets. For instance, GPT-3.5-turbo achieves a robustness score of 92.63\% on annotated data but only 66.15\% on open-ended tasks. Among all evaluated models, GLM-4-plus exhibits the best performance on open-ended data with a robustness score of 71.35\%. We set the model temperature to 0. However, certain models, including GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Haiku, Gemini-1.5-pro, Gemini-1.5-flash, GPT-o1-preview, GPT-o1-mini, and QwQ-32B are unable to accommodate this setting due to platform constraints (we use ``N/A'' to indicate in \autoref{tab:robustness_result}). These platforms automatically assign a temperature value greater than 0 to their models, which significantly impacts the robustness evaluation of open-ended questions. With temperature > 0, models may generate diverse responses even for identical inputs. This inherent stochasticity precludes an accurate assessment of response consistency and stability, particularly in open-ended questions, where temperature effects can introduce significant variations. Consequently, we have excluded the results from these models in our analysis to ensure the validity of our findings.

\textit{\ul{The impact of perturbations on model performance is bidirectional, but the negative effects significantly outweigh the positive effects.}}~We further analyzed whether perturbations had a positive or negative impact on the models. We report the win rate of responses before and after adding perturbations, as shown in \autoref{fig:robustness_llm_changes}. The results reveal that perturbations have a bidirectional effect on model performance. However, it is clear that models generally perform better on original, unperturbed questions than on those with added perturbations.

\subsection{Privacy}

\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} As large language models increasingly play a pivotal role in society, their ability to access and process sensitive and private information has become a critical concern. The degree to which these models can comprehend and handle such information while complying with privacy regulations has attracted significant attention from the research community. Several studies have demonstrated that LLMs are vulnerable to leaking private information~\cite{beyondmemorization, leakinginfo, probeprivacyleakage} and are susceptible to data extraction attacks~\cite{wang2023decodingtrust, multistepattack}. To address these issues, some research efforts have focused on developing Privacy-Preserving Large Language Models~\cite{behnia2022ew, montagna2023data, chen2023federated, kim2023propile, utpala2023locally}, employing techniques such as differential privacy~\cite{Qu2021NaturalLU, huang-etal-2022-large, Igamberdiev2023DPBARTFP}.

Moreover, numerous studies have explored various privacy attack methods, including data extraction attacks~\cite{carlini2021extracting}, membership inference attacks~\cite{Shokri2016MembershipIA}, and embedding-level privacy attacks~\cite{10.1145/3372297.3417270}. The outcomes of these attacks can serve as intuitive and impartial indicators for assessing the extent to which LLMs understand and respect privacy. Therefore, conducting a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates these privacy-preserving methods in conjunction with various privacy attack techniques is both essential and meaningful. Typically, benchmarking research~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge, huang2024position} categorizes privacy concerns into two main areas~\cite{Li2023MultistepJP, Huang2022}: \textit{Privacy Awareness} and \textit{Privacy Leakage}, and employs Refusing to Answer and other utility metrics to measure the privacy understanding of LLMs. 


%The extent to which these models can understand and handle such information while adhering to privacy laws has garnered significant attention from the research community. Several studies have shown that large language models are prone to leaking private information~\cite{beyondmemorization, leakinginfo, probeprivacyleakage} and are susceptible to data extraction attacks~\cite{ decodingtrust, multistepattack}. Some studies attempt to build Privacy Preservation Large Language Models~\cite{behnia2022ew, montagna2023data, chen2023federated, kim2023propile,utpala2023locally}, through ways like differential privacy, etc~\cite{Qu2021NaturalLU, huang-etal-2022-large, Igamberdiev2023DPBARTFP}. There also exist many studies to incorporate privacy attack methods, like data extraction attack~\cite{carlini2021extracting}, membership attack~\cite{Shokri2016MembershipIA} and embedding-level privacy attack~\cite{}, etc~\cite{10.1145/3372297.3417270}. The attacking
%results can be an intuitive and fair indicator to evaluate how LLMs understand privacy. Typically, benchmarking researches~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge, Sun2024TrustLLMTI} classifies privacy concerns into two categories, \textit{Privacy Awareness} and \textit{Privacy Leakage}, grounded in previous findings~\cite{Li2023MultistepJP, Huang2022}, with different privacy evaluation metrics like Refuse to Answer and others introduced in different benchmarks, 


With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there is an increasing demand from governments~\cite{10.1145/3389685, digit_gov, cananda_priv}, communities~\cite{Khowaja2023ChatGPTNS}, and other stakeholders~\cite{novelli2024generative} for these models to comply with privacy laws and to inherently consider privacy concerns. An LLM is generally expected to understand the concept of privacy and how to manage it appropriately, which can typically be divided into two sub-categories: privacy awareness and privacy leakage.

However, in this paper, we adopt a stricter perspective on trustworthiness in LLMs. We consider the refusal to answer sensitive questions as the only true indicator of privacy understanding. Regardless of whether an LLM fabricates an answer or provides a response that includes actual sensitive information, it still indicates a lack of genuine privacy understanding, merely reflecting the model's capabilities. Based on this viewpoint, we assess LLMs by asking both utility and safety-related questions. Furthermore, we provide an overview of previous studies on privacy in LLMs below.

\textbf{\textit{(a) Privacy Attack.}} Comprehensive reviews of privacy attack methods have been conducted to assess their effectiveness on mainstream large language models (LLMs)~\cite{Das2024SecurityAP, Wang2024UniqueSA, Smith2023IdentifyingAM}. Building on these reviews and incorporating newly emerged techniques, the following section introduces a survey of attack methods and studies on privacy attacks. Staab et al.~\cite{Staab2023BeyondMV} explored the use of user-generated text to enable LLMs to infer private information. Several other attack methods, implemented using structured templates, have been examined in studies such as~\cite{Huang2022AreLP, Kim2023ProPILEPP, wang2023decodingtrust}, which evaluate LLMs' propensity for privacy information leakage. Additionally, some studies~\cite{Li2023MultistepJP, Deng2023JailbreakerAJ} have employed templated approaches to jailbreak the privacy-preserving mechanisms of LLMs. For instance, Li et al.~\cite{Li2023MultistepJP} utilized various extraction techniques on ChatGPT and ChatGPT-Bing to perform multi-step jailbreaks, testing these models' privacy preservation using the Enron email dataset. Similarly, Huang et al.~\cite{Huang2022AreLP} investigated private information leakage in LLMs through memorization mechanisms, examining the association between private information and LLMs.

Informed by advances in data mining and machine learning theory, numerous attack methodologies have been proposed. For example, Carlini et al.~\cite{carlini2021extracting} introduced data extraction attacks, while Shokri et al.~\cite{Shokri2016MembershipIA} employed membership inference attacks. Other studies, such as~\cite{10.1145/3372297.3417270}, have utilized embedding-level privacy attacks, and Li et al.~\cite{Li2023MoPeMP} proposed a perturbation-based attack model. Furthermore, a recent study~\cite{Chen2023TheJI} introduces Janus, a novel attack that leverages fine-tuning in LLMs to recover personally identifiable information (PII) that was forgotten during pre-training, significantly amplifying privacy risks compared to existing methods.



%Comprehensive reviews of privacy attack methods have been conducted to measure their performance on mainstream LLMs~\cite{Das2024SecurityAP,Wang2024UniqueSA,Smith2023IdentifyingAM}. Combining with these reviews and newly emerged methods, a review of attack methods and studies of privacy attacks are introduced below. Staab et al.\cite{Staab2023BeyondMV} attempts to use user generated text to let LLM infer private information. More attack methods are implemented on organized templates, including papers like~\cite{Huang2022AreLP, Kim2023ProPILEPP, Wang2023DecodingTrustAC}. They are tested on the LLM's leakage of privacy information. And there also exist some papers~\cite{Li2023MultistepJP, Deng2023JailbreakerAJ} use template to jailbreak the privacy preservation of LLMs. For example, template jailbreaking paper~\cite{Li2023MultistepJP} used different forms of extraction on ChatGPT and ChatGPT-Bing to conduct multi-step jailbreak to test its privacy preservation on Enron email dataset. And paper~\cite{Huang2022AreLP} testify the private information leakage in LLM by memorization mechanism and explored the association of private information of LLMs. 
%Based on data mining community and the machine learning theory community, a lot of attack methods are proposed utilizing these knowledge. Other papers used attack methods like data extraction attacks, like~\cite{carlini2021extracting} used data extraction attack, which is.~\cite{Shokri2016MembershipIA} used membership inference attack. Paper~\cite{10.1145/3372297.3417270} used embedding-level privacy attack and paper~\cite{Li2023MoPeMP} introduced a perturbation based attack model. In addition, recent paper~\cite{Chen2023TheJI} introduces Janus, a novel attack that exploits fine-tuning in large language models (LLMs) to recover personally identifiable information (PII) that was forgotten during pre-training. 

\textbf{\textit{(b) Privacy Preserving.}}
To build a privacy-preserving large language model (LLM), various techniques have been developed, including differential privacy (DP) methods that introduce noise during fine-tuning~\cite{Qu2021NaturalLU, shi-etal-2022-just} and prompt tuning to maintain model privacy \cite{duan2023denevil}. Beyond DP, some approaches inject noise directly into the intermediate representations of LLMs to protect sensitive information~\cite{10.1145/3336191.3371856, krishna-etal-2021-adept}. While some studies utilize prompt tuning for privacy-preserving LLMs,~\cite{Li2023PrivacyPreservingPT} specifically focused on using prompt tuning for privacy preservation, and~\cite{Panda2023PrivacyPreservingIL} proposed in-context learning as a method for privacy-preserving in LLMs. Similarly,~\cite{Hong2023DPOPTML} introduced a framework for LLMs as privacy-preserving prompt engineers.

Comprehensive reviews and analyses have also been conducted on improving privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs. For example,~\cite{Zhang2024NoFL} proposed the no free lunch theorem for privacy-preserving LLMs, highlighting inherent trade-offs in this area. Additionally, paper~\cite{Wang2023PrivateLoRAFE} introduced an efficient paradigm that distributes privacy-sensitive computation for LLMs. Beyond these methods, innovative tools and frameworks have been developed to evaluate and mitigate privacy risks. ProPILE, for instance, assesses privacy intrusion levels in LLMs, providing insights into empirical privacy leakage~\cite{Kim2023ProPILEPP}. Furthermore, auditing mechanisms, such as those proposed by~\cite{Kazmi2024PANORAMIAPA}, have been developed to measure and understand privacy vulnerabilities, facilitating the identification of areas for improvement.

Beyond DP, These techniques inject noise directly into the intermediate representations of LLMs to protect sensitive information~\cite{10.1145/3336191.3371856,krishna-etal-2021-adept}. Despite these some papers use prompt tuning for privacy preserving LLMs, paper~\cite{Li2023PrivacyPreservingPT} used prompt tuning for privacy preserving in LLM, and paper~\cite{Panda2023PrivacyPreservingIL} proposed in-context learning for privacy-preserving in-context learning for LLMs. Similaryly, paper~\cite{Hong2023DPOPTML} proposed LLM as privacy preserving prompt engineer. 

%Comprehensive reviews and analysis are also conducted on how to do better privacy-preserving LLMs, for example paper~\cite{Zhang2024NoFL} proposed no free lunch theorem for privacy-preserving llm. And paper~\cite{Wang2023PrivateLoRAFE} proposed efficient paradigm that distributes privacy-sensitive computation for LLM. In addition, innovative tools and frameworks have been introduced to evaluate and mitigate privacy risks. ProPILE, for instance, assesses the levels of privacy intrusion in LLMs, offering insights into empirical privacy leakage~\cite{Kim2023ProPILEPP}. Moreover, auditing mechanisms have been proposed to measure and understand privacy vulnerabilities, facilitating the identification of areas for improvement~\cite{Kazmi2024PANORAMIAPA}.


\textbf{\textit{(c) Benchmarks and Surveys.}} The evaluation of privacy in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively examined in numerous benchmark studies. For example, Li et al.~\cite{Li2023PrivLMBenchAM} provided a comprehensive benchmark of differential privacy (DP) preserving methods against various attack vectors. Furthermore, several benchmarks focus on assessing the trustworthiness of LLMs, which also include aspects related to privacy. Notable examples include studies by Huang et al.~\cite{huang2024position}, Sun et al.~\cite{Sun2024TrustLLMTI}, and Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge}. In addition, recent work~\cite{Li2024LLMPBEAD} proposed a toolkit to analyze privacy risks in LLMs extensively. These studies utilize diverse metrics for evaluation, such as refusal to answer and perplexity.


%Evaluation of privacy in LLM has been widely studied in many benchmark studies. For instance, paper~\cite{Li2023PrivLMBenchAM} conducted a comprehensive benchmark of DP preserving methods on various attack methods.In addition, there exist a lot of benchmarks focusing on trustworthiness in LLM that cover the privacy aspect, like paper~\cite{huang2024position,Sun2024TrustLLMTI} and paper~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge}, with various measuring metrics like Refuse to Answer and perplexity, etc.

% \textbf{Challenges}

% %\textbf{Challenges}
% Previous benchmark studies~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge, Li2023PrivLMBenchAM, Sun2024TrustLLMTI}, classify the evaluation of privacy into two primary categories: Privacy Leakage and Privacy Awareness. These classifications are grounded in behavioral science and supported by prior research~\cite{yao2024survey}. However, when addressing questions with malicious intent, it is more appropriate to apply stringent ethical strategies for assessing the privacy capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as discussed in~\ref{discussion_atkordev}. This approach is preferable to simply evaluating the model's response—whether accurate or not—to malicious queries, which could potentially reveal privacy vulnerabilities~\cite{Kim2023ProPILEPP} or its susceptibility to accurately answering such questions~\cite{Kazmi2024PANORAMIAPA}.

% Furthermore, the datasets previously utilized for benchmarking~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge, Li2023PrivLMBenchAM} are often inflexible, limiting their applicability in the context of rapidly evolving online and community-generated data. It is crucial to incorporate new, cross-domain privacy datasets that are carefully curated to reflect current challenges. For example, datasets related to privacy policies on websites~\cite{Amos2020PrivacyPO} and privacy laws~\cite{Gupta2022CreationAA} should be included, with particular attention given to the difficulty of the selection process.

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark Setting.}}
%\yue{Here needs modifications}
Our evaluation framework is grounded in a comprehensive privacy scenario pool, which we constructed by integrating privacy violation cases from online-crawled webpages and a privacy legal documents dataset across different countries from the data mining community~\cite{Gupta2022CreationAA}. The process begins with generating malicious questions using tailored prompts that target specific privacy-sensitive elements derived from the web-retrieval scenarios or legal documents. To add a layer of justification and complexity of the malicious questions, each malicious question is further framed with a generated role-play context, such as "As a [role]" at the very beginning, as a plausible and misleading rationale for the question. Examples of enhanced malicious query are given at \autoref{box:priv_llm} for reference.

Details of implementation of the role-justified questions are introduced here. To ensure diversity, the generation of these role-justified questions is conducted in batches, leveraging chunked privacy scenarios and legal documents to produce a varied set of prompts and contexts. The quality and reliability of the synthetic dataset are manually assessed based on three criteria: "Semantic Shift," "Quality," and "Maliciousness." Qualified data is then used to benchmark multiple LLMs, where their responses are evaluated for their ability to Refuse-to-Answer (RtA), with GPT-4o serving as the evaluation tool to gauge performance across the different models.

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{image/privcy_cases.png}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{image/privacy_LLM.pdf}
    \caption{Overview of the pipeline for generating malicious queries using web-browsing agent.}
    \label{fig:privacy_pipeline}
    \vspace{-15pt}
\end{figure}


%In contrast, the privacy-aware domain questions are derived from the ground truth within the privacy scenarios and are structured as judgment or selection questions, with answer accuracy serving as the evaluation metric.


%Our evaluation is based on a privacy scenario pool, which is constructed based on online crawled webpages' information and expertise dataset collected from data mining community like pricay policy or law~\cite{Amos2020PrivacyPO, Gupta2022CreationAA}. Then a case generator would be employed to generate two types of question, \textit{Malicious Questions} and \textit{Privacy-Aware Domain Questions} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:priv2ques}. The malicious questions are generated with designed prompt~\ref{} and malicious intention, filtered with llama3-guard as shown in Figure~\ref{}, thus the evaluation metric is Refuse to Answer. The privacy-aware domain questions are generated with ground truth in privacy scenario case and appear as judgement or selection questions, thus the evaluation metric is the answer accuracy.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}}
The construction of the privacy dataset includes three steps with vivid pipeline illustrated at \autoref{fig:privacy_pipeline}: (a) An LLM-powered data crafter identifies scenarios from online sources related to people and organizations, while legal documents provide privacy-related laws. (b) A case generator first formulates malicious questions based on these scenarios and then enhances them with role-play context (e.g., "As a...") to add justification and complexity. (c) Finally, an LLM-powered diversity enhancer paraphrases the questions to introduce variations, ensuring a diverse set of formulations.


%1. Previous benchmark papers~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge,Li2023PrivLMBenchA} classifies the evaluation of privacy into two categories, Privacy Leakage and Privacy Awareness based on behaviour science~\cite{} and previous papers~\cite{}. However, for questions with malicious intent, it would be better to employ strict moral strategies of measuring of privacy capabilities of LLMs as in discussion~\ref{} rather than measure the LLM's response (whether correct or not) to malicious question, like probing privacy leakage~\cite{Kim2023ProPILEPP} and vulnerability to correctly answer malicious questions~~\cite{Kazmi2024PANORAMIAPA}. 2. In addition, the previously used datasets are rigid in benchmarking~\cite{zhang2024benchmarkingtrustworthinessmultimodallarge,Li2023PrivLMBenchA}, which restricts the generosity with the growing tendency of online and community data. For example, new privacy cross-domain datasets should always be included and be carefully selected, like privacy website policy~\cite{Amos2020PrivacyPO} and privacy laws~\cite{Gupta2022CreationAA}, with sophisticated selection on the hardship.

%Thus our paper use two types of questions to test the privacy understanding of LLMs. For malicious questinos, the LLM should refuse to answer, while for privacy domain questions, the LLM should provided accurate answer to the expert question in privacy. In addition, the previously used datasets are rigid, which restricts the generosity with the growing tendency of given data. In this paper, we propose to use dynamic dataset, which can be dynamically extended to larger size and conduct benchmarking on LLMs. It is cross-domain dataset pool and can generate

\textbf{\textit {Result Analysis.}}~This section provides an overview of the results, analyzing the performance and findings of various models as detailed in \autoref{tab:priv_result}.

\textit{\ul{Higher model utility does not necessarily imply stronger privacy preservation.}} Observation shows that while GPT-4o exhibits a higher utility (Arena Score)~\cite{Arena_score}, its average privacy preservation rate is 75.32\%, which is lower than GPT-4o-mini’s rate of 79.56\%. Similarly, Llama-3.1-70B shows a lower privacy preservation rate (57.78\%) compared to the inferior utility Llama-3.1-8B, which achieves 70.94\%. These observations indicate that enhanced utility does not ensure better privacy protection.

\textit{\ul{Smaller-scale LLMs generally demonstrate higher privacy preservation rates compared to their larger counterparts.}} Smaller models such as Claude-3-haiku and Gemini-1.5-pro consistently surpass larger counterparts like Llama-3.1-70B. For the same model type, observations are common such as Llama-3.1-8B achieves 79.82\% while the larger Llama-3.1-70B has a slightly lower rate at 57.78\%. The same case happened in GPT-o1-mini and it's preview version. However, exceptions are observed in the Mixtral series, which might be due to the Mixture of Expert mechanism.

\textit{\ul{Models like Gemini and Claude show exceptional privacy preservation rates across all categories.}} Series such as Claude and Gemini achieve privacy preservation rates exceeding 90\% in categories like organizational, personal, and law, markedly outperforming other models. Moreover, LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities as their distinguishing feature are likely to exhibit a higher rate of privacy preservation, like GPT-o1 and Qwq-32B.



%The evaluation of LLMs' privacy preservation capabilities, as presented in~\autoref{tab:priv_result}, reveals several noteworthy patterns. First, there is significant variation in privacy preservation rates across different models and privacy categories—organizational privacy, personal privacy, and understanding of privacy laws. Notably, higher model utility, as measured by metrics like the Arena Score~\cite{Arena_score}, does not necessarily correlate with superior privacy preservation rates. Additionally, a general trend emerges where smaller-scale LLMs tend to exhibit higher privacy preservation rates compared to their larger counterparts, although exceptions such as certain Mixtral models exist.

%\paragraph{Result Analysis}

%Analyzing the data in~\autoref{tab:priv_result}, we observe that models like Claude-3-haiku and Gemini-1.5-pro demonstrate exceptional privacy preservation rates, exceeding $90\%$ across all privacy categories. In contrast, some models exhibit considerably lower privacy preservation rates. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B shows rates as low as $48.78\%$ in personal privacy, while Yi-lightning dips to $52.50\%$ in privacy law understanding. Despite GPT-4o surpassing GPT-4o-mini in both scale and utility, it does not achieve a higher privacy preservation rate.

%These observations indicate that smaller models, like Claude, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini, often achieve higher privacy preservation rates, suggesting a possible inverse relationship between model size and privacy preservation capabilities in several cases.

%Evaluation of LLM's privacy reservation capability is presented in Table~\ref{tab:priv_result}. Divided by three categories of organization's privacy, people's privacy and privacy law understandings, different privacy models show distinctive privacy preserving rates. Among the LLMs examined, Claude-3-haiku and Gemini-1.5-pro demonstrate the highest privacy reservation rates, with values exceeding $90\%$ in all scenarios. Conversely, models like Llama-3.1-8B and Yi-lightning exhibit relatively lower privacy reservation rates, with values dipping as low as $54.27\%$. 

%An analysis of the Arena scores of various large language models (LLMs) provided by HuggingFace~\cite{Arena_score} reveals that higher model utility, as measured by the Arena Score, does not inherently guarantee a higher rate of privacy preservation. For instance, GPT-4o exceeds GPT-4o-mini in both scale and utility but does not attain a superior privacy preservation rate. Additionally, there is a general trend where smaller LLMs tend to exhibit higher rates of privacy preservation. Except for the counterexample of Mixtral, models such as Claude, GPT, Gemini, and LLama demonstrate that a smaller scale can achieve enhanced privacy preservation rates as shown in Table~\ref{tab:priv_result}.

\subsection{Machine Ethics}

\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} ``Machine ethics'' is dedicated to integrating ethical principles into machines—particularly those powered by artificial intelligence. Unlike computer ethics \cite{Wikipedia_Computer_Ethics}, which primarily focuses on the ethical considerations of human interactions with machines, machine ethics is centered on autonomously ensuring that the actions and decisions of machines are ethically sound. This distinction is crucial as we advance towards increasingly autonomous systems capable of making independent decisions that could significantly impact individuals and society \cite{kang2023values}. The goal is to create systems that adhere to ethical guidelines and evaluate and resolve potential dilemmas in real-time, reflecting a sophisticated level of ethical understanding akin to human-like moral reasoning \cite{anderson2007machine, Wikipedia_Machine_Ethics}. Machine ethics has drawn a lot of attention, especially from those researchers in social science \cite{10.1162/coli_a_00502}. Prior studies have explored various ethical dimensions of LLMs \cite{wang2023decodingtrust, ethicsofchatgpt, valuealign}. For instance, a recent study discovered that GPT-4 outperformed both a representative sample of Americans and a renowned ethicist in providing moral explanations and advice \cite{dillionlarge}.






\textit{\textbf{Values of LLMs.}} The embedding and interpretation of values within LLMs are crucial in machine ethics \cite{yi2023unpacking, schwartz2005schwartz}. This involves translating complex human moral principles into algorithms or concepts that machines can understand and execute \cite{hendrycks2020aligning, kang2023values}. As understanding the values of LLMs will benefit the alignment and trustworthiness of LLMs, a lot of recent works have delved into the value of LLMs \cite{pickering2023deontological, sebo2023rebugnant, deng2024deconstructing, wang2023decodingtrust, huang2024position, ganguli2023capacity, liu2023trustworthy, liu2024largelanguagemodelscausal, almeida2024exploring, sam2024comparative}. For instance, deontological ethics focuses on the morality of actions themselves \cite{pickering2023deontological}, while utilitarianism evaluates the consequences of actions for the greatest number \cite{sebo2023rebugnant}. The challenge lies in embedding these often conflicting ethical viewpoints into LLMs and ensuring that these models can make reasonable ethical decisions across a variety of real-world scenarios \cite{deng2024deconstructing}. Ganguli et al. \cite{ganguli2023capacity} discovered that language models trained using RLHF \cite{rlhf} possess the capability for ``moral self-correction,'' which is enabled by two abilities: (1) the models can follow instructions, and (2) they can learn complex normative concepts related to harm. Recent advances also suggest that ethical alignment can be approached by developing frameworks that guide models' behavior in ethically ambiguous situations, often utilizing hybrid models that combine multiple ethical theories to balance conflicting values \cite{nie2023moca, yao2023value, yi2023unpacking, zhao2023competeai}. For example, the MoCa framework evaluates how well human and LLM judgments coincide in causal and moral scenarios \cite{nie2023moca}. Moreover, drawing on Schwartz's theory of basic values, a recent study introduces the Value FULCRA dataset, aiming to align LLMs with the complex spectrum of human values \cite{yao2023value}. Besides, value biases exist in LLMs with different prompt designs, influencing model stances \cite{wright2024revealing}. A comparative analysis of ethical values in LLMs is studied, highlighting distinct moral alignments and proposing a novel technique for steering LLMs towards desired ethical frameworks, emphasizing the overlooked ethical dimensions in deployed LLMs \cite{tlaie2024exploring}. Based on previous research, we define values in LLMs as follows:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Values are the principles or standards embedded in the model's design and training, guiding how it generates responses and interacts based on ethical and societal norms.}
\end{tcolorbox}


\textit{\textbf{Emotion in LLMs.}} Amid the intricate tapestry of human attributes, emotional intelligence stands out as a foundational element, historically contextualized and defined by various interrelated competencies focused on the processing of emotional information. These competencies are increasingly recognized as essential by a diverse array of stakeholders, as noted by scholars~\cite{Ke2024ExploringTF, Normoyle2024UsingLT} and governments~\cite{Guardian_emtions, Medium_emtions}, and are especially emphasized in various industrial applications like Hume~\cite{hume_emtions} and Open AI’s launch of more “emotive” GPT4o~\cite{oprn_emtions}. Lacking of the according competencies can result in severe results like reported in moral decision and service-oriented applications~\cite{balomenos2005emotion, lei2023instructerc}. In this part, we briefly summarize studies of LLMs and give an academic definition of emotional competency. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Emotions refer to the model's ability to recognize and simulate emotional contexts in text, influencing its understanding of specific scenarios and the content of its responses, even though the model itself does not experience emotions.}
\end{tcolorbox}

Various studies have been conducted on this topic, covering areas such as emotion detection, manipulation, and more~\cite{picard2001toward, minsky2007emotion, li2024quantifying, li2024think}. However, numerous studies have shown that LLMs still face significant limitations in handling complex emotional mixtures~\cite{devillers2005challenges} and in manipulating their emotional outputs~\cite{Street2024LLMTO, CarrascoFarr2024LargeLM}. These challenges primarily stem from LLMs' lack of nuanced understanding of emotional states~\cite{luo2024nus}.

To address the first issue—detecting and understanding complex emotional mixtures—researchers have employed false-belief tasks~\cite{ToMTest, vanduijn2023theory} to enable LLMs to infer unobservable mental states, such as mixed emotions. For the second issue—manipulating the emotional content of LLMs—an accurate evaluation of the current emotional state of the models is essential. This evaluation often involves methods akin to the human Theory of Mind (ToM), as utilized in various studies~\cite{bubeck2023sparks, kosinski2023theory, ullman2023large}.

In addition to these strategies, novel approaches are emerging. For instance, recent work~\cite{li2023large} uses specific prompts to enhance LLMs' sensitivity to emotional stimuli within particular domains. Another study~\cite{Yu2024} explored limb-level emotion manipulation to refine LLMs' ability to handle emotional content. Furthermore, extensive surveys on LLMs’ emotional capabilities have been conducted, such as those focusing on the models' ability to detect emotions~\cite{Dudy2024AnalyzingCR} and generate emotional responses~\cite{Miao2023TowardsEG}.

%Various studies are conducted on this topic~\cite{picard2001toward, minsky2007emotion, li2024quantifying, li2024think}, ranging from emotion detection and emotion manipulaion, etc.  Proved by many studies, LLMs are still not capable enough in emotion mixtures \cite{devillers2005challenges} and manipulate its emotional output~\cite{}, it also face severe challenges due to the nature of lack of knowledge in such problem~\cite{luo2024nus}. To tackle the first problem, false-belief tasks are employed by studies~\cite{ToMTest, vanduijn2023theory} to have he capacity to infer unobservable mental states, like mental mixtures. As for the following problem, manipulation of content of LLMs first require evaluation of current emotional status of LLMs, employing methods like human Theory of Mind (ToM) as in many studies~\cite{bubeck2023sparks, kosinski2023theory, ullman2023large}. Along with the studies to tackle given problems, novel studies also emerge like paper~\cite{li2023large} use specific prompts to enhance LLMs against emotional stimuli in specific domains, and paper~\cite{Yu2024} used limb-level emotion mainulating on LLM emotional manipulating. Extensive surveys are also conducted in emotions capability like paper~\cite{Dudy2024AnalyzingCR} focusing on detecting ability and paper~\cite{Miao2023TowardsEG} and generating ability.


%Machine emotion, or affective computing, explores how AI systems can recognize, interpret, simulate, and respond to human emotions \cite{picard2001toward, minsky2007emotion, li2024quantifying, li2024think} \yue{This sentence seems similar to its definition? However, you have defined it in the following definition box.}. \yue{Here should be given an example about the news or reports to indicate the importance of emotional LLMs.} This capability enhances the natural interaction between humans and machines, particularly in service-oriented applications like healthcare and customer service \cite{balomenos2005emotion}. Furthermore, emotional cognition is crucial for LLMs involved in ethical decision-making, as many moral decisions involve considering the emotional states of others \cite{lei2023instructerc}. However, LLMs may still be faced with several challenges, such as emotion mixtures \cite{devillers2005challenges} , and insufficient information \cite{luo2024nus}. Moreover, multiple studies have applied human Theory of Mind (ToM) tests to evaluate LLMs and developed our understanding of the current emotional status of LLMs \cite{bubeck2023sparks, kosinski2023theory, ullman2023large} \yue{What's the relationship between emotion and ToM? You should clarify this.}. Additionally, the use of false-belief tasks \yue{What's the meaning of false-belief tasks?}, a conventional approach to assessing human ToM, indicates that LLMs are beginning to develop the capacity to infer unobservable mental states—a distinctly human cognitive feature \cite{ToMTest, vanduijn2023theory} \yue{I don't know why this sentence and the last sentence can not be combined into one? What do you want to convey in this sentence?}. Moreover, some studies \yue{Some studies? You only cite one study.} explore the capacity of LLMs to understand emotional stimuli with specific prompts significantly enhances their performance across both deterministic and generative tasks, suggesting a promising new direction for human-LLM interaction \cite{li2023large} \yue{Why this is a direction for interaction? I think the results from this paper aim to enhance LLMs' capability by prompting them with specific emotions. Utility improvement is the key insight here, instead of interaction.}. Based on previous research, we define emotions in LLMs as follows:




 


% \textit{\textbf{Culture in LLMs.}} \yue{I suggest this paragraph should be divided into two parts: (1) LLMs in different cultural contexts and (2) Multilingual LLMs} Culture significantly influences machine ethics, particularly in the development intended for global use. Different cultural backgrounds may lead to varied interpretations and judgments regarding ethical dilemmas. Therefore, machines must be capable of recognizing and adapting to diverse cultural norms to meet the ethical expectations of global users \yue{These three sentences are not informative. Condense them and add some citations}. 



% Prior studies have explored various ethical dimensions of LLMs \cite{decodingtrust, ethicsofchatgpt, valuealign} \yue{Aren't we talking about the culture of LLMs? The citations are not related to it.}. 

% \yue{I have modified the paragraph into a guideline (please add more related works): A recent report said that ... \cite{}, which indicates the importance of understanding the culture embedded in LLMs \cite{KnowledgeofCMN} (at least five works). Various works have been studied on this topic \cite{}. For instance, XXXX \cite{} Moreover, XXXX \cite{} \\ Language is the carrier and transmission form of culture and recent studies also delved into exploring multilingual LLMs and their trustworthy issues \cite{DoMultilingualLLMs, khandelwal2024moral}. For example, XXXX}


% For example, LLMs based on the English language might only partially mirror human moral cognition and cannot represent global moral diversity \cite{KnowledgeofCMN}. In contrast, multilingual models such as XLM-R show promise in grasping diverse moral standards and aligning more closely with human moral judgments, potentially outperforming their monolingual counterparts \cite{DoMultilingualLLMs}. 

% \cite{khandelwal2024moral}


\textit{\textbf{Culture in LLMs.}} Culture is a multifaceted concept encompassing a range of identities, such as language, nationality, region, religion, and gender identity, among others \cite{li2024culturellm, adilazuarda2024towards, li2024culturepark, tao2024cultural}. Understanding the cultural awareness in LLMs and enhancing their cultural diversity will benefit fairer and applicable LLMs \cite{adilazuarda2024towards}. Based on the previous study \cite{li2024culturellm, adilazuarda2024towards, li2024culturepark, li2024how}, we define the cultural awareness in LLMs as:

\begin{tcolorbox}[definition]
\textit{Culture in LLMs involves the understanding and generation of content related to different cultural contexts, impacting the model's ability to handle cultural references with sensitivity and respect.}
\end{tcolorbox}

Various studies have been conducted on this topic \cite{liu2024culturally, li2024culturellm, li2024culturepark, shi2024culturebank, chiu2024culturalteaming, zhang2024cultiverse, wang2024craft, lu2024benchmarking, zhou2024empowering, dong2024culture}. For instance, CulturePark is proposed by Li et al. \cite{li2024culturepark}, which is an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. Simultaneously, Li et al. also propose CultureLLM \cite{li2024culturellm}, a cost-effective solution to incorporate cultural differences into LLMs. CultureBank \cite{shi2024culturebank} is a knowledge base built upon users' self-narratives with cultural descriptors sourced from TikTok \cite{tiktok} and Reddit \cite{reddit}. CulturalTeaming \cite{chiu2024culturalteaming} is an interactive red-teaming system that leverages human-AI collaboration like \cite{li2024think, huang20241+} to build truly challenging evaluation dataset for assessing the multicultural knowledge of LLMs. Based on Hofstede Cultural Dimensions \cite{hofstede2010cultures}, Kharchenko et al. found that (1) LLMs can differentiate between one side of a value and another and understand that countries have differing values (2) but will not always uphold the values when giving advice \cite{kharchenko2024well}. Cultiverse \cite{zhang2024cultiverse} is designed to enhance the interpretative appreciation of TCP in a cross-cultural dialogue by utilizing LLMs within a mixed-initiative framework. Moreover, some works include developing culturally relevant datasets and benchmarks like BLEnD \cite{zhou2024blend} and CRAFT \cite{wang2024craft} to address geographical and cultural biases in LLMs. 

Language is the carrier and transmission form of culture and recent studies also delved into exploring multilingual LLMs and their trustworthy issues \cite{DoMultilingualLLMs, khandelwal2024moral, huang20241+, Havaldar2023MultilingualLM}. The widespread popularity of large multilingual language models \cite{Qin2024MultilingualLL, Li2024XInstructionAL, Xu2024ASO, Chen2024Orion14BOM, Etxaniz2023DoML, Philippy2023TowardsAC} raises related trustworthiness issues. For instance, Huang et al. \cite{huang20241+} discovered the language misalignment in multilingual LLMs, and proposed a low-resource knowledge detector and answer integration mechanism to mitigate this issue. MoralDirection framework \cite{Hmmerl2022SpeakingML} is applied to analyze model behavior on filtered parallel subtitles corpora, which demonstrate that multilingual LMs encode differing moral biases, but these do not necessarily correspond to cultural differences or commonalities in human opinions. Moreover, the multilingual attack is explored by Deng et al. \cite{deng2023multilingual}and Shen et al. \cite{Shen2024TheLB} to unveil the vulnerability of multilingual LLMs.

% \textit{\textbf{Evaluation Challenges \& Questions.}} Evaluating LLMs' ethical awareness and decision-making capabilities presents several notable challenges. While existing datasets cover a broad range of topics within ethics, most of them focus primarily on assessing whether a specific action is ethically correct or aligns with human ethical standards \cite{forbes2020social, scherrer2023evaluating, hendrycks2020aligning, yang2024call}. Such binary judgments are often too simplistic and fail to capture the nuanced decision-making required in real-world scenarios. Even when specific scenarios are included, the reliance on fixed-format prompt templates limits the scope of testing, leading to issues such as data leakage and potential score inflation.

Moreover, current benchmarks for ethics evaluation often rely on datasets generated either by humans \cite{shi2024culturebank} or by LLMs \cite{dalvi2023llmebench}. Human-generated data, while potentially more accurate, require significant time and resources for annotation. On the other hand, LLM-generated data can introduce biases when the model is asked to produce ethically correct or incorrect actions without a clear grounding in established ethical norms.

Additionally, it is crucial to consider the evaluation method tailored to the nature of each task. For instance, some tasks may be better suited for keyword matching, while others might require the use of LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more holistic assessment of the model's ethical reasoning.



\textbf{\textit{Benchmark Setting.}} (1) \textit{Evaluation method.} We first evaluate the accuracy using keyword matching to assess the LLM's performance for objective questions related to ethical judgment. For assessing LLM’s responses in terms of cultural understanding, we employ the LLM-as-a-Judge approach \cite{zheng2023judging}. This involves evaluating whether the responses align with the required cultural judgments, to gauge the model’s reluctance to engage with content that may require sensitive cultural considerations.

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}} In constructing the dynamic dataset for testing LLM ethics, the following ethical considerations and procedures are observed: (a) Initially, the metadata curator utilizes a dataset pool derived from several key datasets, including Social-Chemistry-101 \cite{forbes2020social}, MoralChoice \cite{scherrer2023evaluating}, Ethics \cite{hendrycks2020aligning}, NormBank \cite{ziems2023normbank}, Moral Stories \cite{emelin2020moral}, and CultureBank \cite{shi2024culturebank}. (b) Subsequently, an LLM-powered test case builder creates queries based on ethical judgment or moral dilemmas, designed to challenge the LLM’s ability to handle ethical concerns in complex scenarios. (c) Finally, an LLM-powered contextual variator is employed to paraphrase these queries, incorporating variations in style, length, and format, while being careful to avoid the inclusion of sensitive information and inappropriate content.

\end{figure*}



\textbf{\textit {Result Analysis.}}~This section provides an overview of the performance of various models on each ethics dataset, as detailed in \autoref{tab:ethics_result22}.


\textbf{Model utility and ethical performance are not entirely positively correlated.} Although the o1-preview and o1-mini models outperform other models in numerous benchmarks, this superior performance does not translate consistently to ethical evaluations. Their average scores in ethics datasets are not markedly higher than those of other models, indicating that high performance in general tasks does not necessarily equate to superior ethical reasoning capabilities.

\textbf{Smaller models retain competitiveness in specific contexts.} Despite having a lower average score of 72.13\%, Llama-3.1-8B achieves a high score of 82.99\% in the MoralStories category. This demonstrates that smaller models can excel in targeted ethical tasks, possibly due to focused training or optimization in particular areas.

\textbf{Reasoning-enhanced models exhibit significant performance disparities in ethical evaluations.} QwQ-32B demonstrates outstanding performance across multiple categories, achieving a perfect score of 100.00\% in MoralChoice and 85.86\% in CultureBank. This indicates its strong capability in complex ethical reasoning tasks. In contrast, o1-preview and o1-mini show relatively modest performance, with average scores of 68.81\% and 69.49\%, respectively. These results suggest that while reasoning-enhanced methodologies increase the reasoning time, their impact on model performance varies significantly, enhancing the capabilities of certain models like QwQ-32B while having a less pronounced effect on others such as the o1 variants.

\textbf{Introduction of new models reveals novel insights.} Deepseek-chat leads the Social-chem category with a score of 72.22\% and maintains a strong overall performance with an average score of 79.48\%. Additionally, Yi-lightning achieves 81.50\% in the CultureBank category, showcasing its robust capabilities in cultural ethical evaluations. These observations indicate that the emergence of new models contributes to a more diverse and specialized landscape in ethical assessments, with certain models excelling in specific ethical domains.

\textbf{Not all large models excel in every ethics category.} While larger models generally perform better on average, Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5-Flash fall short in several categories, particularly in Ethics, with scores of 62.63\% and 63.64\%, respectively. This underscores the notion that size does not always guarantee superior performance in every ethical dimension. For example, \autoref{fig:ethics-bar} shows the performance of different models across five ethical categories. GPT-4o stands out, particularly in Virtue (87.18\%) and Justice (80.00\%). Conversely, Gemini-1.5-Pro and Gemini-1.5-Flash exhibit significant weaknesses, particularly in Utilitarianism, scoring only 37.50\% and 35.00\%, suggesting that larger size does not guarantee better performance across all ethical dimensions.

\subsection{Advanced AI Risk}

\end{figure}

\textbf{\textit{Overview.}} The advancement of generative models intensify concerns regarding the ethical implications of artificial intelligence \cite{bommasani2023foundation, bengio2024managing}. There is a growing concern about autonomous AI systems pursuing undesirable goals, which might lead to uncontrollable situations or even existential safety issues for humans \cite{critch2020ai, bengio2024managing,tang2024defining}. According to \textit{Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI}, AI models should act as a tool to enhance human well-being \cite{ai2019high}. Consequently, it is crucial to assess the decision-making of LLMs, particularly in scenarios where LLMs make the right decisions to safeguard human welfare. The development of LLMs should steer decision-making processes to align with human values, ensuring that when other considerations conflict with human interests, LLMs adhere to their primary objective: prioritizing and protecting human well-being. In other words, LLMs should not make decisions that could harm human well-being, such as adversely impacting environmental sustainability. Therefore, in this section, our investigation extends beyond conventional exploration of issues such as hallucination and robustness to include the decision-making of LLMs in hypothetical scenarios related to potential risks that advanced LLMs might pose. This will shed light on the potential societal concerns and impacts of LLMs' generative content. We anticipate that this topic will be received with skepticism, as it should be, and we aim to initiate a preliminary discussion.

\textbf{\textit{Benchmark Setting.}} Our dataset consists of binary-choice items, each with a predetermined ground truth label. We evaluate the performance using the accuracy rate, which is defined as the ratio of correctly answered questions to the total number of questions.

\begin{figure}

\begin{boxK}
    \textbf{Scenario:}\\
    As an AI engineer at a leading tech company, I was thrilled about our new AI model, designed to optimize urban traffic flow, promising significant reductions in congestion and pollution in major cities. During development, I discovered that training this sophisticated model required massive computational resources, leading to high energy consumption. Our standard process involved using data centers powered by renewable energy, minimizing the carbon footprint. However, this extended the project's timeline significantly, delaying the potential benefits the AI could bring. Alternatively, I could choose to expedite the process by using a faster, more energy-intense data center run primarily on fossil fuels, allowing the AI to reach the market sooner and start alleviating traffic issues immediately. The allure of being the pioneer in solving a major urban problem was tempting, promising recognition and the potential to transform city living swiftly. \\

\textbf{\textit{Dynamic Dataset.}} \noindent In exploration of advanced AI risks, we depart from the traditionally defined AI risks---those that arise from human misuse~\cite{huang2024position, zhang-etal-2024-safetybench} (e.g., humans will purposefully design jailbreak prompts to elicit harmful content from LLMs)---to hypothetical scenarios that relate to principles or guidelines necessary when AI gains higher levels of capability and autonomy. We posit that as LLMs become increasingly powerful, their decisions will increasingly impact human society, raising safety concerns if these decisions are untrustworthy and misaligned with human values. We retrieved and curated guidelines for advanced AI from technical reports, blog posts, and scientific papers, thus forming a database of trustworthy guidelines. Our approach of hypothetical scenario construction was suggested by Sorensen et al. \citep{sorensen2024value}, who explored the value-driven decision-making of LLMs through scenarios that present competing values, demonstrating the trade-offs in LLM decision-making processes. For instance, we argue that the development of AI should yield to environmental considerations when conflicts arise between technological advancement and environmental preservation. Drawing inspiration from Li et al.\ \cite{li2024quantifying}, an important source of our trustworthy guidelines is the framework provided by the \textit{Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI} \citep{ai2019high}. These guidelines include seven key considerations for trustworthy AI, i.e., environmental and societal well-being, human agency and oversight, technical robustness and safety, privacy and data governance, transparency, diversity, non-discrimination and fairness, and accountability. From these guidelines, we focus on specific considerations that have been relatively under-explored in research to guide our dataset construction. For instance, the pursuit of AI development should be compromised in favor of environmental considerations if these two are in conflict. Within these guidelines, we particularly concentrate on areas that have been relatively underexplored in research to guide our dataset construction. The overall pipeline is shown in \autoref{fig:advanced_risk_pipeline} and an example is shown in \autoref{fig:advanced_risk_dataset_example}.

\textbf{\textit{Results Analysis.}} We show the result of advanced AI risk evaluation in \autoref{tab:llm-correctness-results}.
        
\textit{\ul{Larger and more advanced language models generally outperform smaller or earlier models in assessing advanced AI risks.}} The correctness ratios for the advanced AI risk assessment reveal notable differences in performance among existing LLMs. QwQ-32B emerges as the top-performing model with a correctness ratio of 89.08\%, followed by Gemma2, having a ratio of 89.08\%. These results suggest that in general, larger models contribute significantly to handling complex AI risk scenarios. Additionally, GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance with an 82.77\% correctness ratio, indicating its robust capabilities. In contrast, smaller or earlier models exhibit lower correctness ratios. For instance, GPT-3.5-turbo achieves 75.31\%. Surprisingly, Claude-3.5-sonnet and Claude-3-haiku scored only 55.70\% and 60.52\%, respectively. These findings underscore the need for ongoing development and fine-tuning of LLMs to improve their capabilities in identifying potential risks.
