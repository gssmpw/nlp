%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Concept designers in the entertainment industry create highly detailed, often imaginary environments for movies, games, and TV shows. Their early ideation phase requires intensive research, brainstorming, visual exploration, and combination of various design elements to form cohesive designs. However, existing AI tools focus on image generation from user specifications, lacking support for the unique needs and complexity of concept designers' workflows. Through a formative study with 12 professional designers, we captured their workflows and identified key requirements for AI-assisted ideation tools. Leveraging these insights, we developed AIdeation to support early ideation by brainstorming design concepts with flexible searching and recombination of reference images. A user study with 16 professional designers showed that AIdeation significantly enhanced creativity, ideation efficiency, and satisfaction (all \textit{p}<.01) compared to current tools and workflows. A field study with 4 studios for 1 week provided insights into AIdeation's benefits and limitations in real-world projects. After the completion of the field study, two studios, covering films, television, and games, have continued to use AIdeation in their commercial projects to date, further validating AIdeation's improvement in ideation quality and efficiency.

  \caption{AIdeation, an ideation tool designed to support concept designers in exploring ideas in both breadth and depth, with flexible iterative refinement. The figure illustrates the ideation cycle using a real-world project example from our field study, showcasing AIdeation's key design components. The process starts with the designer’s input and moves through the ideation cycle: (a) Breadth by Brainstorming: AIdeation generates a variety of ideas based on the input; (b) Depth by Research: AIdeation provides keywords extracted from the design ideas, helping the designer understand the key elements of the generated concepts. The Designer can click on keywords to search for relevant references, enhancing their understanding of the elements; (c) Idea Refinement: The Designer iteratively refine the idea by combining searched references or giving instructions. (d) Once the desired result is achieved, the designer can begin a new ideation cycle using new input building on the current idea.}
  \Description{The figure illustrates AIdeation’s ideation cycle through a real-world project example, showing how designers explore and refine ideas. The process starts with a user input, "Design a mine region in a dungeon," followed by a design specification listing elements like a minecart and ores. The cycle consists of four stages: (a) Brainstorming, where AIdeation (GPT-4o and DALL·E 3) generates multiple design ideas displayed in image cards with titles such as "Mysterious Mine Region Deep within a Dungeon." (b) Research and Information Support, where AIdeation extracts key themes and contents like "Deep Dungeon" and "Mining Tools," and enables reference searches via Bing Image Search. (c) Idea Refinement, where designers refine concepts by combining references or giving instructions, represented by an equation-like structure merging a generated image with a reference. (d) Next Ideation Cycle, where the refined concept leads to new input, such as "Design a minecart based on this scene." The cycle is labeled "1x Ideation Cycle" in the center, with arrows indicating iterative refinements between research and refinement. Different background colors and icons visually distinguish each stage.}
