\section{CONCLUSION}
AIdeation, as an idea exploration tool, offers a unique blend of traditional and AI-driven approaches, providing broad exploration through diverse references while generating new outputs based on user input. This enables designers to efficiently gather inspiration and produce a wide range of unique ideas. In addition, AIdeation streamlines the entire workflow by integrating research, brainstorming, reference gathering, and design refinement into one cohesive process, with the added flexibility of iterating design ideas easily. Our study with 16 professional concept designers revealed that AIdeation improved both the breadth and depth of idea exploration, significantly enhanced creativity, and increased efficiency in generating more diverse ideas of comparable quality to their original workflows. A field study conducted in four design studios further demonstrated that AI-driven ideation could potentially improve project efficiency, particularly for complex design tasks.
