\subsection{Moving forward to Tensor Core Era: what is different?}
Moving from CPU to GPU with CUDA was successful. Might we copy the success by moving from CUDA Core to Tensor Core? We summarize the differences as follows:
\subsubsection{Simultaneously Execution}
In CUDA Era, GPU and CPU can run simultaneously. However, in current GPU design, Tensor Core and CUDA Core can not run simultaneously at their peak performance due to Dark Silicon Effect~\cite{9460517}. 
\subsubsection{Architecture Abstraction}
In CUDA Era, GPU was an accelerator. But now Tensor Core is a co-processor for CUDA Core. The overhead of moving data between Tensor Core and CUDA Core is negligible comparing with moving data in between CPU and GPU. 
\subsubsection{Bottleneck}
GPU was designed for throughput, which is different from CPU that designed for latency. However, Tensor Core is purely designed for computation. This design is aimed for Deep Learning. However, in the field of HPC, most workloads are memory-bound~\cite{austinsystem}, that might not directly benefit from tensor core.
