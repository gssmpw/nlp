\caption{Availability and discriminative capability of individual features, as used for constructing the ensemble feature sets. Features are colored by their categorization. For each feature we fit a depth-2 decision tree classifying all confinement states to get a general overview. Additionally, to identify features of interest w.r.t. regions far from the discriminative boundary, we compute the optimal threshold for a feature where at least 99\% of the timeslices are in L-mode or H-mode, and take the fraction of data subject to this threshold as the metric value. Lastly, we report the fraction of data where the signal is available.}\label{tab:features}
