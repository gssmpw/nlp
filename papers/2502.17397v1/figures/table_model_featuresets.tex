\caption{All \textit{(model + feature set)} configurations, with features colored by category. The order is based on Cohen's kappa coefficient when using the individual feature to predict the confinement state using a shallow decision tree, unless specified otherwise. The feature sets between the two models are identical except for the emission-related features, where only the FNOLSTM-based models use the raw photodiode signals. These signals are not very informative when considering the absolute value because they are not absolutely calibrated, however, confinement state-related patterns are clearly visible in their dynamics. For this reason, the `raw' values are selected only for the dynamic models, since these models can detect the temporal patterns.}\label{tab:model_featuresets}
