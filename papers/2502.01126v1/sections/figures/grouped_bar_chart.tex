    \caption{\textbf{Selective Classification AUC Across Models.} For each model, we plot the selective classification AUC averaged across the 14 tasks for each confidence estimation method. The absolute confidence estimation baselines---direct prompting (Direct) and self-consistency (Hybrid SC)---are indicated in blue, while relative confidence estimation with different rank aggregation methods is in green (Elo Rating, TrueSkill, Bradley-Terry). For Llama 3.1 405B, GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o, relative confidence estimates outperform both the direct and hybrid SC absolute confidence baselines. For Claude 3.5 Sonnet, relative confidences outperform direct prompting but slightly underperform self-consistency prompting.
