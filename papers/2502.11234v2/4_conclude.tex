\section{Conclusion}


We have presented a discrete flow matching framework for flexible long video generation, leveraging frame-level masking during training to enable flexible, efficient sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach can generate high-quality videos beyond 10$\times$ the training window length, while substantially reducing sampling cost through MGM-style unmasking. Notably, our models can seamlessly switch between timestep-dependent (flow matching) and timestep-independent (MGM) sampling modes without additional training, offering a unified solution that supports both full-sequence rollout and fully autoregressive generation. We believe discrete tokens have great potential for scalable visual generation.
