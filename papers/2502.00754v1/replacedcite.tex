Numerous studies have explored the incorporation of classical mechanics-inspired inductive biases, such as physical principles ____, geometry structures ____, and symmetries ____, into deep neural networks. While some of these models have been applied to learn dynamics from images using autoencoders, they have mostly been tested on relatively simple visual patterns and dynamical behaviors.

% Determining the optimal number of state variables for high-dimensional image data poses a significant challenge. ____ comprehensively investigated this issue and demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach across various physical dynamical systems. They also highlight the potential of learned latent state variables, referred to as neural state variables, for robust long-term prediction. However, their work primarily focused on discrete models, and the learned neural state variables do not evolve continuously. In this paper, we build upon their findings by selecting a subset of their datasets and configuring the dimensions of our latent states accordingly.
