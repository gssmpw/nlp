\section{Related work about evolving Fuzzy Systems}
The evolving fuzzy rule-based model was introduced by **Zhang, "Evolving Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems"**, this system has shown a notorious advantage compared to pure neural networks models, presenting evident and explainable results (**Gomathi et al., "A Novel Approach for Evidential Reasoning Using Evolving Type-2 Fuzzy Systems"**). **Rodriguez et al. developed the Sequential Adaptive Fuzzy Inference System that uses an extended Kalman filter to update the fuzzy rules (SAFIS)**. To overcome the limitations of SAFIS such as the complexity of the rule's influence and the difficulty to cope with high-dimensional input spaces, **Rocha et al. proposed the extended version of SAFIS (ESAFIS)**. **Gomathi created the Flexible Fuzzy Inference Systems (FLEXFIS), an algorithm that uses a linear polynomial to exploit the Takagi–Sugeno model, this model demands low computational cost and is adequate for online operations** (____). **Rocha presented a model that optimizes the consequent parameters and sparses out the unimportant rules, the Sparse Fuzzy Inference Systems (SparseFIS), using a numerical optimization mechanism to define a compact ruleset** (____).

**Zhang implemented a model to deal with highly noisy data, the evolving Gustafson–Kessel Possibilistic c-Means clustering (eGKPCM)**. **Rodriguez developed the evolving Possibilistic Fuzzy Modeling approach (ePFM), which uses the Gustafson–Kessel (GK) clustering algorithm to identify clusters with different shapes and orientations while processing the data recursively**. Also, this model uses utility measure to evaluate the quality of the current cluster structure. These implementations make the model robust to modeling volatility dynamics and nonlinear volatility forecasting with jumps.

**Zhang detailed a model with self-learning parameters, the Self-evolving Fuzzy System (SEFS), this method improves the model’s accuracy by auto-adjusting the rule’s adding speed, reducing underfitting or overfitting**. **Rodriguez created the evolving Optimal Granular System (eOGS), making it possible to trade off multiple objectives**. **Gomathi implemented the Set-Membership (SM) and the Enhanced Set-Membership (ESM) in the ePL-KRLS (____) model, the objective of the membership is to update the rate of change of the arousal index and control the rule creation speed, enhancing the performance of the models**. Finally, **Rocha presented a model with self-learning thresholds, the evolving Fuzzy System Self-learning/adaptive Thresholds (EFS-SLAT)**.
