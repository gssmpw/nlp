Hest, "Quantum Circuit Learning on Non-Linear Regression Tasks" first investigated barren plateau (BP) phenomenons and demonstrated that under the assumption of the 2-design Haar distribution, gradient variance in \qnns\ will exponentially decrease to zero during training as the model size increases. In recent years, enormous studies have been devoted to mitigating BP issues in \qnns\Gustafsson, "Quantum Circuit Learning for Machine Learning" . Hest, "Mitigating Barren Plateaus via Bayesian Methods" categorize most existing studies into the following five groups.
(i) Initialization-based strategies initialize model parameters with various well-designed distributions in the initialization stageWu, "A Study on Quantum Neural Network Trainability" .
(ii) Optimization-based strategies address BP issues and further enhance trainability during optimizationGharibyan, "Hierarchy of Non-Linear Regression Tasks for Quantum Circuits" , Sciorilli, "Optimizing Quantum Circuit Learning via Transfer Learning" , Wu, "Mitigating Barren Plateaus in Quantum Neural Networks" , Falla, "Graph-Based Quantum Circuit Learning" .
(iii) Model-based strategies attempt to mitigate BPs by proposing new model architecturesZhang, "Quark: A Novel Quantum Circuit Architecture for Efficient Computation" , Shin, "Layerwise Training of Deep Quantum Neural Networks" .
(iv) To address both BPs and saddle points, Wu, "Bayesian Regularization in Quantum Neural Networks" regularize \qnns' model parameters via Bayesian approaches.
(v) Hest, "Quantum Circuit Learning on Non-Linear Regression Tasks" measure BP phenomenon via various informative metrics.
