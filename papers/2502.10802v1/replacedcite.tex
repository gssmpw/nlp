\subsection{Enhancing Code Generation Accuracy with Test Case}

The integration of test cases has emerged as a pivotal strategy for improving the quality of code generated by LLMs. 
Numerous studies leverage test cases to filter, evaluate, and refine generated programs, leading to higher-performing and more reliable code. 
Below, we provide an overview of notable methodologies in this domain.


Li et al. ____ introduce a Sampling+Filtering approach, 
where a large set of candidate programs is sampled and scored based on performance against a provided test set.
Chen et al. ____ propose a framework in which both code and test cases are generated by LLMs simultaneously, using a dual agreement metric to identify and select better programs. 
Shi et al. ____ assess semantic similarity by executing generated programs on test cases and leveraging the execution results to guide program selection.

Beyond evaluation, test cases play a critical role in iterative repair and refinement of generated code. 
Execution outcomes from test cases can be used to repair faulty programs. 
For instance, Shinn et al. ____ introduce the Reflexion framework, 
where failure messages from test executions are converted into verbal feedback for program repair. 
Similarly, Olausson et al. ____ evaluate LLMs' capabilities to repair programs using failed test feedback. 
Zhang et al. ____ allow LLMs to analyze test execution results to revise erroneous code.
Zhong et al. ____ extend this idea by enabling step-by-step debugging.
Huang et al. ____ adopt a chain-of-thought prompting ____ approach that generates code and tests sequentially, iteratively improving the code based on test feedback.
Zhang et al. ____ introduce a pair programming framework where test feedback informs repair strategies and planning.

The generation of test cases differs across these methodologies.
For example, CodeT ____ and CodeCoT ____ rely entirely on LLMs to generate test cases, 
whereas Reflexion employs LLMs primarily for simple programming tasks. 
Most other methods, however, assume pre-defined test cases as part of their evaluation frameworks, 
leveraging them for filtering, refinement, and program selection.

Meyerson et al. ____ demonstrated the use of few-shot prompting with LLMs to generate offspring in evolutionary algorithms, enabling a general crossover operator by concatenating parent solutions into a single prompt, which can adapt to various domains.
Similarly, Romera et al. ____ integrated LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to create context-aware program mutations, eliminating the need for manually defined mutation operators. 
Ye et al. ____ proposed ReEvo, which combines evolutionary search with LLM-driven reflections to generate optimization heuristics, efficiently exploring heuristic spaces while offering verbal gradients for optimization. 
Lastly, AutoTest ____ combines automated test case generation with code execution in an evolutionary framework, utilizing LLMs to co-generate code solutions and their corresponding test cases for enhanced optimization.
