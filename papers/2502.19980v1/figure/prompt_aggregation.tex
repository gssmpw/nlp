    \caption{Illustration of the three types of prompt aggregation proposed in this paper: \textit{1) Concatenation} – where prompts from clients are directly concatenated; \textit{2) Summarization} – where a large language model (LLM) is employed to summarize the prompts provided by the clients; \textit{3) Summarization with UID (SUM w/ UID)} – where the summarization process is enhanced by applying uniform information density principles.}
