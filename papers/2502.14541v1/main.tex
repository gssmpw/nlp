% The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled zero-shot recommendation without conventional training. However, most approaches rely solely on purchase histories, overlooking the rich information in user-generated texts. We propose \myalg{}, an LLM-based framework that builds evolving user profiles by extracting and summarizing key information from reviews. \myalg{} combines \emph{Review Extractor}, \emph{Profile Updater}, and \emph{Recommender} to deliver personalized suggestions while managing token limitations. To evaluate \myalg{}, we introduce a novel continuous sequential recommendation task, which more realistically reflects real-world scenarios by updating predictions incrementally as new reviews arrive. Experiments on Amazon data show that \myalg{} significantly improves performance over existing LLM-based methods.
The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in recommender systems by enabling zero-shot recommendation without conventional training. Despite their potential, most existing works rely solely on users' purchase histories, leaving significant room for improvement by incorporating user-generated textual data, such as reviews and product descriptions. Addressing this gap, we propose \myalg{}, a novel LLM-based recommendation framework that builds and maintains evolving user profiles by systematically extracting and summarizing key information from user reviews. \myalg{} consists of three core components: a Review Extractor for identifying user preferences and key product features, a Profile Updater for refining and updating user profiles, and a Recommender for generating personalized recommendations using the most current profile. To evaluate \myalg{}, we introduce a continuous sequential recommendation task that reflects real-world scenarios by adding reviews over time and updating predictions incrementally. Our experimental results on Amazon datasets demonstrate that \myalg{} outperforms existing LLM-based methods, effectively leveraging long-term user information while managing token limitations.
% The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the field of recommender systems, enabling more sophisticated and personalized predictions. However, most existing LLM-based recommender systems rely primarily on users' purchase history, overlooking the valuable insights embedded in user-generated reviews. In this paper, we propose \myalg{}, a novel framework that integrates user reviews into the recommendation process, addressing the challenges posed by LLMs' token limitations. Our approach systematically extracts and stores key information from user reviews, ensuring scalability as user-generated data grows, while retaining only the most relevant content for accurate and efficient recommendations. We further introduce a realistic sequential recommendation setup, where reviews are incrementally added over time, enabling the model to dynamically update user profiles and predict the next purchase based on evolving user preferences. Our experimental results demonstrate that \myalg{} outperforms existing LLM-based recommendation methods that are train-free on Amazon datasets, validating the effectiveness of our approach in providing more accurate and scalable recommendations.
