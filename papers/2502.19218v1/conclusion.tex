\section{Conclusion and future work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This letter introduces a novel manipulation framework that uses a CPG-based motion generator to enable manipulation motions on a multi-module origami robotic surface. It also presents a simulation-based optimization method to find the best CPG parameters for various manipulation goals. The optimized manipulation motions are evaluated using both dynamic simulations and prototype experiments. This letter also showcases a series of demonstration experiments using the optimal CPG motions to manipulate objects of different sizes, shapes, and stiffness, highlighting robust and versatile manipulation across a wide range of objects.

In future work, reconfigurable module layouts will be investigated to enhance the platform's versatility. This improvement aims to expand the range of objects that can be effectively manipulated. Additionally, we plan to explore hybrid frameworks that combine learning-based methods with CPG to balance adaptability and control efficiency. Furthermore, we plan to explore hybrid frameworks that combine learning-based methods with CPG to enable more dynamic and complex manipulation tasks while maintaining control efficiency.
