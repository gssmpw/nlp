% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
We thank 
Hoifung Poon,
Chenglong Wang, and
% TODO
as well as members of the NLP and Deep Learning group at Microsoft Research for helpful discussions. 
%This work was partially supported by [any academic funding for Shirley]
\end{comment}

%\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
%the paper submitted for blind review.

%If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
%usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
%should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
%that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
%include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
%who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
%sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}

TODO

%Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
%broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
%societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
%section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
%the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
%and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
%the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
%are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
%substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
%as the following will suffice:

%``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
%Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
%of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

%The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
%encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
%warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
%paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
