\section{Conclusion}
Multiturn human-LLM collaborations are increasingly prevalent in real-world applications. We believe future foundation models should act as collaborators rather than passive responders, actively uncovering user intents in open-ended and complex tasks---an area where current LLMs fall short. The key insight of \name{} is making LLMs more multiturn-aware by using forward sampling to estimate the long-term impact of responses. Through extensive simulated and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that \name{} is highly effective, efficient, and engaging, while also generalizing well to new tasks and interactions, advancing the frontiers of human-centered LLMs.
