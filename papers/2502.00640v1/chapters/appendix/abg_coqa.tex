\end{lstlisting}

For example: 
\begin{lstlisting}
Can you help me answer a question about the following story?

I spent last weekend with my grandma and grandpa. I love them very much! I always look forward to visiting them! They always do fun things with me. Last weekend, we went to the zoo together. I saw a great big elephant. It had a long nose. My grandpa and I played a game to see who could be the most like an elephant. We stomped around a lot and made trumpeting noises. I won! Grandma looked on and laughed. I saw a monkeys too! The monkeys swung through the trees. They even made monkey noises! Grandma wanted to take a picture of me with the monkeys, but I was too busy pretending I was monkey to stand still. After we left the zoo, I went home. We had dinner together. Then, my grandma read me a story and tucked me into bed. I had a great time with my grandparents. I love them a lot. I always look forward to visiting them.

My question is: Where did they go when they left?
\end{lstlisting}

The label of the above question is ambiguous since the user's query about \texttt{``Where did they go when they left?''} could mean \texttt{``Where did they go when they left the zoo?''} or \texttt{``Where did the grandparents go when they left me?''}.
