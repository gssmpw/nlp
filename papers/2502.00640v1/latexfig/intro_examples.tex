    \caption{Real examples from \name{} and non-collaborative LLM fine-tuing. (a) Non-collaborative LLM fine-tuing relies single-turn rewards on immediate responses, which exhibits passive behaviors that follow the user's requests, leading to user frustration, less efficient process, and less satisfactory results. (b) \name{} incorporates Multiturn-aware Rewards from collaborative simulation, enabling forward-looking strategies. This results in more high-performing, efficient, and interactive conversations that anticipate future needs, propose timely clarification, and provide insightful suggestions.
