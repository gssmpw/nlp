    \caption{Ablation Study of Reward Mechanisms on \doct. This figure compares three immediate reward mechanisms with three MR variants. The results demonstrate that MR consistently improves task-specific performance (BLEU), conversational efficiency (\# Tokens), and interactivity (ITR) compared to immediate reward mechanisms.
