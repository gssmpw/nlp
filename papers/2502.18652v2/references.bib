abstract = {Studies on travel and life satisfaction in vulnerable Global South contexts are scarce. This paper contributes by addressing how travel satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, and social capital relate to life satisfaction among a low-income community in Bogotá (Colombia) as a case study. Building on the available literature, we propose six hypotheses to understand such relationships before and after a cable car implementation, considering control and treatment groups. We defined seven latent variables and three objective indicators. We tested the hypotheses using a multiple-cause multiple-indicator modeling approach, which allowed us to identify how the comprehensive cable car intervention impacts perceptions and life satisfaction. Results showed that the principal factors associated with life satisfaction were neighborhood satisfaction as well as leisure activity participation, while travel time and transport affordability had negative effects. Positive changes in satisfaction regarding the travel experience can trigger significant improvements in life satisfaction in low-income communities in Latin America.}

abstract = {This paper examines the effects of transport accessibility on residential satisfaction and moving intention when travel mode choice is limited. It uses the case of Yangon City in Myanmar, where bus is the dominant transport mode, automobile dependence is low, and the use of two-wheel vehicle is restricted in some areas of the city. These characteristics altogether indicate that the potential bias arising from the unobserved differences in people’s travel mode preferences can be minimized. Based on a sample of about 5,200 residents living close to bus stops, structural equation modeling is used to test the effects of objective and subjective measures of bus stop accessibility on residential satisfaction and moving intention. The results show that high perceived bus stop accessibility—not short distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop—is associated with high residential satisfaction, and neither measures of bus stop accessibility is associated with moving intention. These findings indicate that the perception of bus stop accessibility matters for residential satisfaction rather than the actual distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop, and the low satisfaction with bus stop accessibility is not expected to induce households to consider moving to a new residence or location. The actual distance between the residence and the nearest bus stop has the strongest influence on perceived bus stop accessibility, followed by the satisfaction with neighborhood’s safety and security, holding household characteristics constant. From a policy perspective, the findings underscore the relevance of including subjective measures of accessibility in designing or improving the accessibility of transport systems. To aid planning, there is a need to explore the objective factors that underlie people’s satisfaction with transport accessibility. Moreover, an integrated housing and transport policy could bring significant gains to residents, as desirable neighborhood features are associated with not only high perceived bus stop accessibility but also high residential satisfaction and low moving intention.}

abstract = {While the relationship between commuting satisfaction (CS) and subjective well-being (SWB) has been extensively studied, less attention is given to explaining how CS affects SWB via satisfaction with non-travel-related life domains. Failure to account for these spillover effects of life domains other than commuting has certainly led to an overestimation of the impact from CS to SWB. This study aims to address this gap and examine the recent changes in commuting practices/working conditions, particularly the increase in working from home (WFH) due to the pandemic. A structural equation model is employed to examine differences in WFH frequencies and their impact on the relationship between CS, satisfaction with other life domains and SWB. The results suggest that hybrid teleworkers exhibit highest SWB and occasional WFH individuals have the lowest levels of SWB. Moreover, the effect of CS on SWB is mediated first by time satisfaction (TUS) and then by other life domains, highlighting the dominance of TUS on the relationship between CS and SWB regardless of WFH frequency. These findings help to identify not only areas where employee SWB can be improved, but also how.}

Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), a classic parametric modeling approach to time series, and nonparametric regression models have been proposed as well suited for application to single point short-term traffic flow forecasting. Past research has shown seasonal ARIMA models to deliver results that are statistically superior to basic implementations of nonparametric regression. However, the advantages associated with a data-driven nonparametric forecasting approach motivate further investigation of refined nonparametric forecasting methods. Following this motivation, this research effort seeks to examine the theoretical foundation of nonparametric regression and to answer the question of whether nonparametric regression based on heuristically improved forecast generation methods approach the single interval traffic flow prediction performance of seasonal ARIMA models.}

abstract = {Accurate traffic prediction is important for efficient traffic operation, management, and user convenience. It enables traffic management authorities to allocate traffic resources efficiently, reducing traffic congestion and minimizing travel time for commuters. With the increase in data sources, traffic prediction methods have shifted from traditional model-based approaches to more data-driven methods. However, accurately predicting traffic under unforeseen events, such as crashes, adverse weather conditions, and road works, remains a challenging task. Hybrid traffic prediction models that combine data-driven and model-based approaches have emerged as promising solutions, considering the advantage of the model-based approach that can replicate unobserved scenarios. This paper proposes a hybrid traffic prediction framework named SMURP (Simulation and Machine-learning Utilization for Real-time Prediction), which overcomes the limitations of the existing methods. The SMURP is a framework that can be applied to any data-driven prediction method. When an event is detected during prediction, the SMURP complements the prediction outcomes with an additional predictor that uses simulated traffic data. The proposed framework is applied to various data-driven prediction models and evaluated in the actual road section. The results show that applying the SMURP to data-driven prediction methods can improve prediction accuracy.}

abstract = {Accurately predicting the highway traffic speed can reduce traffic accidents and transit time, which is of great significance to highway management. Three essential elements should be considered in the long-term highway traffic speed prediction: (1) adaptability to speed fluctuation, (2) exploring the spatio-temporal correlation effectively, and (3) prediction of non-error propagation. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal generative inference network (STGIN) driven by data and long-term prediction. STGIN consists of three parts; semantic enhancement, spatio-temporal correlation extraction block (ST-Block), and generative inference. Semantic enhancement is first used to model the contextual semantics of traffic speed, improving the adaptability to speed fluctuations. The ST-Block is then used to extract the spatio-temporal correlations of the highway network. Finally, generative inference is used to pay attention to the correlation between historical- and target-sequences to generate the target hidden outputs rather than a dynamic step-by-step decoding way; it avoids long-term prediction error propagation in the spatial and temporal dimensions. The evaluation experiments use the monitoring data of highway in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, China. For long-term highway speed prediction, the experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the baseline methods.}

abstract = {Traffic volume is an indispensable ingredient to provide fine-grained information for traffic management and control. However, due to the limited deployment of traffic sensors, obtaining full-scale volume information is far from easy. Existing work on this topic focuses primarily on improving the overall estimation accuracy of a particular method and ignores the underlying challenges of volume estimation, thereby having inferior performance in some critical tasks. This paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic volume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by fully undetected paths that can allow arbitrary volume values without violating the conservation law, where using local side information is insufficient to tackle, and (2) nonequilibrium traffic flows arise when traffic flows vary in density over space and time due to congestion propagation delay, which produce time-shifted volume readings to varying degrees. Here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that offers a data-driven, equation-free, and correlation-adaptive approach to address the above issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation. Particularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear speed-volume relationships for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a speed pattern-adaptive adjacency matrix based on graph attention is developed and integrated into the graph convolution process, to capture nonlocal correlations between volumes. To measure the impacts of nonequilibrium flows, a temporal masked and clipped attention combined with a gated temporal convolution layer is customized to capture time-asynchronous correlations between upstream and downstream sensors under varying impacts of congestion delay. We then evaluate our model on a real-world highway traffic volume dataset and compare it with several benchmark models. It is demonstrated that the proposed model achieves high estimation accuracy even under 20% sensor coverage rate and outperforms other baselines significantly, especially on underdetermined and nonequilibrium flow locations. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative model analysis is also carried out to justify the model designs. The source code and datasets are publicly available at: .}

abstract = {This paper proposes a new data-driven impact area vulnerability analysis approach that considers both the probability of impact of incidents and their resulting effects on an impact area. Multi-year observed travel time and incident data are deployed to investigate the underlying traffic propagation dynamics. These datasets contain a wealth of information that reflects the occurrences of link closure/disruption by space and time and the network-wide impacts stemming from these disruptions. A novel approach is developed to identify the resulting spatial and temporal impacts of non-recurrent incidents. Rather than focusing solely on the travel time changes of the link subject to incident, this approach captures all aspects of the impacts of incidents by monitoring the dynamic propagation of congestion patterns in the set of links that are in the vicinity of the link subject to incident (i.e., impact area). These spatial and temporal dimensions of the impacts are subsequently used in a new vulnerability analysis. The performance of the developed approach was examined using historical travel time and incident data from the City of Calgary, Canada. The results indicate that the recorded temporal impact of incidents is not representative enough of the true impact of incidents because the dynamic spatial propagation of the effect of incidents on the impact area is overlooked. The proposed approach is capable of capturing the enduring spatiotemporal impact of incidents in a large-scale road network. The primary improvement of the developed vulnerability index is its ability to model multi-dimensional aspects of non-recurrent travel delays caused by non-current incidents in a road network.}

abstract = {In recent years, the collection of spatio-temporal data that captures human movements has increased tremendously due to the advancements in hardware and software systems capable of collecting person-specific data. The bulk of the data collected by these systems has numerous applications, or it can simply be used for general data analysis. Therefore, publishing such big data is greatly beneficial for data recipients. However, in its raw form, the collected data contains sensitive information pertaining to the individuals from which it was collected and must be anonymized before publication. In this paper, we study the problem of privacy-preserving passenger trajectories publishing and propose a solution under the rigorous differential privacy model. Unlike sequential data, which describes sequentiality between data items, handling spatio-temporal data is a challenging task due to the fact that introducing a temporal dimension results in extreme sparseness. Our proposed solution introduces an efficient algorithm, called SafePath, that models trajectories as a noisy prefix tree and publishes ϵ-differentially-private trajectories while minimizing the impact on data utility. Experimental evaluation on real-life transit data in Montreal suggests that SafePath significantly improves efficiency and scalability with respect to large and sparse datasets, while achieving comparable results to existing solutions in terms of the utility of the sanitized data.}
