\section{Conclusion}
Based on the finding in this paper there are several interesting questions arising for future research.
For the Budgeted Santa Claus Problem, a naturally arising question is whether the approximation factor of
$O(\log n)$ can be improved. Notably, the special case of restricted assignment (without a budget constraint)
admits a constant approximation due to Feige~\cite{Feige08}.
We are not aware of any hardness
results indicating that such a result cannot hold for our problem. As an intermediate question,
one could look at the bi-criteria approximation that approximates both the minimum player value and the cost by a constant. This would still generalize the aforementioned algorithm for restricted assignment.

Another intriguing question is whether a dependent rounding scheme exists for rounding matroid bases that simultaneously guarantees cost preservation and Chernoff-type concentration 
like \textsc{SwapRounding}~\cite{ChekuriVZ10} does. 
It seems likely that the techniques from this paper
transfer at least to a limited
class of matroids, namely strongly base-orderable
matroids, because
these have very strong decomposition properties for the
symmetric difference of two bases.
It might, however, require other ideas to generalize to
arbitrary matroids.
