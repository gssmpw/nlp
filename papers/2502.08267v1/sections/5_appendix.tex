\subsection{Santa Claus Problem where all resources need to be assigned}
\label{subsec:appendix-santa-claus-with-all-resources-assigned}
In the following, we show that the Budgeted Santa Claus Problem with the requirement that all items need to be assigned is not harder than the variant we study. 
For each resource $j$, adjust the cost of assigning $j$ to any player $i$ to $c_{ij}' = c_{ij} - \min_{i \in \mathcal{P}} c_{ij}$. This reduces the total budget by the sum of these minimum values across all resources, $C' = C - \sum_{j \in \mathcal{R}} \min_{i \in \mathcal{P}} c_{ij}$. Then we solve the reduced problem without enforcing that all the resources have to be assigned. If some resources remain unassigned, we allocate them to the players with zero cost (i.e., players $i \in \cP$ with $c_{ij}'  = 0$). This ensures that all resources are assigned without exceeding the original budget, as the reduced budget $C'$ already accounted for these assignments. This reduction maintains the approximation ratio of the solution, as values remain the same and costs are not approximated.
