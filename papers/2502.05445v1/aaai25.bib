abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

abstract="Sparse-view cone-beam CT (CBCT) reconstruction is an important direction to reduce radiation dose and benefit clinical applications. Previous voxel-based generation methods represent the CT as discrete voxels, resulting in high memory requirements and limited spatial resolution due to the use of 3D decoders. In this paper, we formulate the CT volume as a continuous intensity field and develop a novel DIF-Net to perform high-quality CBCT reconstruction from extremely sparse ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}le {\$}{\$}≤10) projection views at an ultrafast speed. The intensity field of a CT can be regarded as a continuous function of 3D spatial points. Therefore, the reconstruction can be reformulated as regressing the intensity value of an arbitrary 3D point from given sparse projections. Specifically, for a point, DIF-Net extracts its view-specific features from different 2D projection views. These features are subsequently aggregated by a fusion module for intensity estimation. Notably, thousands of points can be processed in parallel to improve efficiency during training and testing. In practice, we collect a knee CBCT dataset to train and evaluate DIF-Net. Extensive experiments show that our approach can reconstruct CBCT with high image quality and high spatial resolution from extremely sparse views within 1.6 s, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/DIF-Net.",
