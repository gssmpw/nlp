\section{Related Work}
We combine multi-objective Bayesian optimization (\textsc{mobo}) and techniques from causal inference to achieve multi-objective causal Bayesian optimization.
Developments in \textsc{mobo} range from single-point methods ____ and batch methods ____ to the derivations of efficient acquisition functions ____. 
Most relevant for our work is \textsc{dgemo} ____, a well-established \textsc{mobo} algorithm that employs a novel batch selection strategy emphasizing on sample diversity in the input space.

Leveraging tools from causal inference to make causally-informed decisions is a field called causal decision-making. Within this field, there is a growing body of research specifically focused on advancing \textsc{cbo} ____. These advancements include extensions such as constrained \textsc{cbo} ____, dynamic \textsc{cbo} ____, and various other variants ____. They are all designed to optimize a single target variable, rendering them infeasible for applications with multiple outcomes.
