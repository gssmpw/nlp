abstract = {Geospatial knowledge graphs have emerged as a novel paradigm for representing and reasoning over geospatial information. In this framework, entities such as places, people, events, and observations are depicted as nodes, while their relationships are represented as edges. This graph-based data format lays the foundation for creating a ‚ÄúFAIR‚Äù (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) environment, facilitating the management and analysis of geographic information. Key concepts in knowledge graphs along with their associated standardization and tools are introduced. Their application in geography and environmental sciences is emphasized by their role in bridging symbolic and subsymbolic GeoAI to address cross-disciplinary geospatial challenges. New research directions related to geospatial knowledge graphs are outlined.}

title = "SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System Reference",
abstract = "This document defines the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a common data model for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via the Web.Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar structure, and are used in similar applications. SKOS captures much of this similarity and makes it explicit, to enable data and technology sharing across diverse applications.The SKOS data model provides a standard, low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web. SKOS also provides a lightweight, intuitive language for developing and sharing new knowledge organization systems. It may be used on its own, or in combination with formal knowledge representation languages such as the Web Ontology language (OWL).This document is the normative specification of the Simple Knowledge Organization System. It is intended for readers who are involved in the design and implementation of information systems, and who already have a good understanding of Semantic Web technology, especially RDF and OWL.For an informative guide to using SKOS, see the [SKOS-PRIMER].",
