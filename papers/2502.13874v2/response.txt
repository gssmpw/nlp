In this section, we discuss the role of spatial data infrastructures and (geo)portals in facilitating the development and deployment of geospatial knowledge graphs. We focus on how existing geospatial knowledge graphs compare with KnowWhereGraph. Finally, we discuss several key concepts, methodologies, and conventions used in this paper.

\subsection{Spatial Data Infrastructures}
\label{ssec:sdi}
%%%%%
Central to discussions of geospatial data is the concept of Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), which encompasses the fundamental physical and organizational structures that enable the use of spatial data by multiple stakeholders **Bishr, "Spatial Data Infrastructure for Europe"**. Typical definitions invoke some combination of components---e.g., technology, standards, systems, people, policies, and data---aiming at facilitating data acquisition, storage, and sharing, assisting policy-making, and enhancing business operations **Goodchild et al., "Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Validation Techniques and the Assessment of DEM Quality"**. The five most typical activities performed within SDIs are identified as data discovery, access, registration, processing, and visualization. However, these activities often encounter semantic challenges, such as missing or unclear metadata, which can stem from both the original data and the processes involved **Zlatanova et al., "Semantic Modeling for Multidimensional and 3D Geographic Data"**. To overcome these challenges and extend the capabilities of SDIs, Linked Data, a term synonymous with knowledge graphs, has been proposed to semantically empower SDIs. Linked Data is increasingly recognized as the cornerstone of next-generation SDIs **Bizer et al., "The R2RML Mapping Language"**. KnowWhereGraph, presented in this paper, is one such initiative aiming at building a cross-disciplinary SDI using Linked Data technology.

\subsection{(Geo)portals}
\label{ssec:gp}
%%%%%
The key activities identified within SDIs have driven the development of (geo)portals, defining the essential tasks these platforms are expected to perform. (Geo)portals are web-based geospatial resources that enable searching and accessing integrated geographic information **Craglia et al., "Next-Generation Geoportals for Europe"**. By following the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards, (geo)portals have achieved functionalities such as metadata cataloging, data discovery, data visualization, data sharing, and data downloading. To address the challenge of topic heterogeneity resulting from multiple metadata standards, **Hill et al., "Towards a Geospatial Linked Data Cloud"** proposed Linked Data--driven (geo)portals with enhanced interoperability. Furthermore, **Zlatanova et al., "A Framework for Creating and Sharing 3D City Models"** provided a summary and highlighted remaining challenges in existing (geo)portals, such as data updating, harmonization, and the need to address multidisciplinary demands in the era of big data.

(Geo)portals remain crucial for data sharing, visualization, and online management, especially within government agencies and research institutions. However, there is a growing need for (geo)portals to transition toward more comprehensive geospatial knowledge graphs, i,e., \textit{making data smart}, not applications **Gladwin et al., "Semantic Web Technologies for Geospatial Data"**. Such graphs provide more advanced analysis across domains to better manage the ever-growing volume of geospatial data. In this paper, we outline the strategies and methods employed by KnowWhereGraph to build an open and user-friendly platform. A key focus is on bridging the gap between data from different themes and sources that are typically stored separately in conventional (geo)portals.

\subsection{Geospatial Knowledge Graphs}
\label{ssec:gkg}
%%%%%
With the availability of large-scale encyclopedic knowledge graphs like DBpedia **Bizer et al., "DBpedia - A Multilingual Knowledge Base"** and YAGO **Suchanek et al., "YAGO: A Large Ontology from Wikipedia and WordNet"**, there is an increasing need to link rich geospatial datasets for improved data discovery, integration, and knowledge extraction **Hill et al., "Towards a Geospatial Linked Data Cloud"**. Previous efforts, such as the LinkGeoData project **Lieberle et al., "LinkGeoData - An Ontology-Based Approach for Integrating Spatial Data"**, have focused on transforming OpenStreetMap (OSM) data into a graph structure, linking it with DBpedia, GeoNames, and other datasets. YAGO2 **Suchanek et al., "YAGO2: A Core ontology at its best"** adds spatio-temporal dimensions to YAGO by including \emph{time} and \emph{location} in its original subject–property–object triples representation. YAGO2geo **Lieberle et al., "YAGO2Geo - Enriching YAGO with Geographic Information"** further extends YAGO2 by incorporating more detailed geospatial information, such as administrative data from three countries, geometries of administrative regions from the Global Administrative Areas dataset (GADM), and geographic features like lakes and streams from OSM. These advancements, for instance, representing cities with multipolygons instead of simple coordinates, significantly enhanced geospatial knowledge graph capabilities.
