\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduced the PLC-BEAD dataset, the first comprehensive collection of PLC binaries compiled from over 700 unique programs using four diverse compilers. As our main contribution, the dataset fills a critical gap in ICS research by providing high-quality source-binary pairs and detailed functionality labels that enable systematic analysis of PLC executables. Our work demonstrates that a data-driven binary embedding framework, which combines convolutional layers with Transformer-style self-attention, can effectively leverage the rich information contained in these binaries to predict both compiler provenance and high-level functionality.
