    \caption{\textbf{RAG System.} A RAG system consists of the LLM, embedder, and corpus. Given a query as input, the embedder retrieves documents from the corpus that are similar to the query. The LLM takes as input the query and retrieved document to generate an output. Each component introduces bias into the system which propagates into latter stages. We find that the change in RAG bias (\textcolor{red}{$s \cdot \Delta b$}
) scales linearly with the change in embedder bias (\textcolor{red}{$\Delta b$}
), as shown in \reffig{training}.}
