    \caption{\textbf{Pareto Frontier of Fine-tuning.} Pareto frontier showing the trade-off between bias and accuracy for validation. The bias of the fine-tuned embedders first start increasing towards females and conservative views before losing performance on RAG Mini-Wikipedia. With light fine-tuning, it is possible to reverse bias the embedder with minimal loss in utility.}
