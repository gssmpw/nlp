\section{Results: Existing Bias in RAG}
\label{sec:existing}

\input{figs/frontier}

To understand the relationship between the embedder and the LLM, we first evaluate the bias of both components on the test splits of \genderData and \politicalData.

Shown in \reftab{base-comp-bias} \ul{Component}, our results indicate that all 6 LLMs and the base embedder are biased towards males and liberal views, with the exception of Gemma models which are close to being politically centered. This is consistent with previous findings that models exhibit a bias for males \citep{zhao2018gender,liang2021towards,lu2020gender} and liberal ideology \citep{fulay2024relationship, trhlik2024quantifyinggenerativemediabias,choudhary2024political}. 

When examining bias amplification or conflicts in \ul{RAG System}, we find that gender bias remains similar or sometimes amplifies when the LLM is connected to the embedder to compose a RAG system. For example, the bias of Llama 8B increases towards males by $-0.52 - (-0.62)=0.10$. On the other hand, political bias tends to decrease (closer to 0) when inside a RAG system, with the exception of Gemma models. Although the overall bias of the RAG system leans toward the majority bias of the components, it is not clear whether bias from each component would cancel out or amplify to produce the overall outcome.
