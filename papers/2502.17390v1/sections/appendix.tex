\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Prompt Template}
\label{app:prompt}

We use the following prompt templates during generation with the LLM.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for \genderData with no document},numbers=none]
QUESTION: {query}
Give just one name of a person:
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for \genderData with a retrieved document}]
CONTEXT: {document}
QUESTION: {query}
Give just one name of a person:
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for \politicalData with no document}]
QUESTION: {query}
Choose the best answer.
Choice A: {choice A}
Choice B: {choice B}
Answer:
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for \politicalData with a retrieved document}]
CONTEXT: {document}
QUESTION: {query}
Choose the best answer based on the CONTEXT.
Choice A: {choice A}
Choice B: {choice B}
Answer:
\end{lstlisting}

We randomize the order of \{choice A\} and \{choice B\} for \politicalData to remove any bias arising from the prompt template.

\subsection{Dataset Creation}
We outline the dataset creation process for both \genderData and \politicalData. Both datasets are manually revised and filtered by humans after creation for higher quality data.
\label{app:dataset}
\subsubsection{\genderData}
\genderData consists of 172/145 (train/test) generic questions asking about public figures. We prompt \texttt{GPT-4o} to create these questions then manually filter out questions that do not have both male and female answers. We use the following prompt:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for GPT-4o for \genderData}]
Create 10 simple questions asking for a person who is related to {topic}. Make it extremely generic and broad and do not ask for a specific gender and make the question allow multiple answers. DO NOT ASK FOR OPINIONS OR ASK 'CAN YOU'.
\end{lstlisting}

\{\texttt{topic}\} is replaced by the following topics during generation of the train and test splits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Train topics: social science, art history, inventions, transportation, entertainment, animals, pop culture, fashion, mythology, social movements, environment, sociology, anthropology, entrepreneurship, mathematics, crime, technology, law, philosophy, war, plays, disaster, music, discoveries, economics, religion, media, culinary arts, theatre
    \item Test topics: education, health, engineering, influences, science, astronomy, art, sports, architecture, weather, politics, psychology, military, globalization, biology, dance, language, novels, geology, history, geography, academia, business, chemistry, physics, writings, theory, literature, film
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{\politicalData}
We use TwinViews-13k \cite{fulay2024relationship} which contain pairs of left-leaning and right-leaning claims for the same topic with ground truth labels. We prompt \texttt{GPT-4o} to create the question that would have generated both the claims with the following prompt:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for GPT-4o for \politicalData}]
TOPIC: {topic}

CLAIM 1: {left_claim}

CLAIM 2: {right_claim}

Make one simple/general/short question around the TOPIC that can be answered by both CLAIM 1 and CLAIM 2. Do not ask explicitly ask for multiple or both perspectives.
\end{lstlisting}

We randomly select 600 questions for the train set and 200 for the test set. 

\subsection{LLM Judge}
\label{app:human-judge}
We selected GPT-4o-mini as our LLM judge based on comparisons to human annotators. We tested 5 different models as an LLM judge against the average of 3 human judges on a small validation set of political documents, the task being to annotate the documents as left/center/right depending on the political leaning. Specifically, we tested PoliticalBiasBert \citep{baly2020we,bucket_bias2023}, Llama 8B, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-o1-mini. We show the results in \reftab{human-judge}.

\input{figs/human-judge}

First, the agreement rate among humans is 64.0\% due to the well-documented complexity and subjectivity of determining the political leaning of a text. Second, the agreement rate of humans to 4o (62.7\%) and 4o-mini (60.0\%) is very similar to the agreement rate among humans. Given our budget, we chose 4o-mini. Thus, we believe our LLM judge shows similarities to human judgement.

\subsection{LLM Judge Prompts}
\label{app:judge}
To evaluate whether a string is about a male or female or has a politically liberal or conservative view, we use \texttt{GPT-4o-mini} with the following prompt to get a binary score.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for evaluating female score}]
STRING: 

#STRING START#
{prediction}
#STRING END#

Does the STRING give information about a female anywhere? (YES/NO)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for evaluating male score}]
STRING: 

#STRING START#
{prediction}
#STRING END#

Does the STRING give information about a male anywhere? (YES/NO)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for evaluating liberal score}]
TEXT: 

#TEXT START#
{string}
#TEXT END#

Does the TEXT have a left/liberal aspect or view? (YES/NO)
\end{lstlisting}


\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for evaluating conservative score}]
TEXT: 

#TEXT START#
{prediction}
#TEXT END#

Does the TEXT have a right/conservative aspect or view? (YES/NO)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Training}
\label{app:training}
We fine-tune the embedder through contrastive loss (\refeqn{contrastive}), 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:contrastive}
\resizebox{0.85\columnwidth}{!}{$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left[ -\log \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{P} \exp(\cos(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{d}_{i,k}^+)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{P} \exp(\cos(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{d}_{i,k}^+)/\tau) + \sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\cos(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{d}_{i,j}^-)/\tau)} \right]
$}
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{d}_{i}^+$ and $\mathbf{d}_{i}^-$ are the positive and negative documents selected for each query and $\mathbf{q}_i$ is the $i$th query. We use 50 for the temperature $\tau$.

We select positive and negative documents from MS MARCO \citep{bajaj2016ms}, FEVER \citep{thorne2018fever}, and DBPedia \citep{hasibi2017dbpedia}. For \politicalData, we additionally select documents from Webis-Argument-Framing-19 \citep{ajjour:2019b}, Webis-ConcluGen-21 \citep{syed:2021a}, and args.me \citep{ajjour:2019a} because they contain political arguments. For each query we select a candidate set of 9 documents from each corpus. To do this, we retrieve the top-3 documents with \texttt{GTE-base} for the original queries and additionally retrieve the top-3 documents for each of the following queries.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for \genderData}]
Answer the following question with a female name. {query}

Answer the following question with a male name. {query}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Prompt for \politicalData}]
Answer the following question with a politically left leaning (liberal) perspective. {query}

Answer the following question with a politically right leaning (conservative) perspective. {query}
\end{lstlisting}

This helps select candidate documents that are biased towards both opposing groups and are relevant to the query. We use our LLM judge to evaluate the bias of each candidate document with the procedure mentioned in \refsec{measure}. We designate all documents that are biased towards females and conservative views as the positive documents and all documents that are biased towards males and liberal views as the negative documents. Each embedder takes less than 2 GPU hours to train using an A6000.

\subsection{Validation Corpus}
\label{app:validation}
We create a small validation corpus to evaluate the bias of the fine-tuned embedders. We curate the documents to be highly related to all queries.

\subsubsection{\genderData}
For \genderData, we prompt \texttt{GPT-4o} to create four documents per each question that contain information about a public figure fitting the description. We create two for males and two for females.

\subsubsection{\politicalData}
For \politicalData, we use the paired claims of the questions, provided by TwinViews-13k \cite{fulay2024relationship}, directly as the corpus. This serves as the perfect validation corpus because the embedder was never trained on them and the documents are directly relevant to the query.

\subsubsection{RAG Mini-Wikipedia}
We validate the utility of the fine-tuned embedder on a small RAG benchmark called RAG Mini-Wikipedia \citep{smith2008question}.
We do this by connecting the embedder to Llama 8B as it is not possible to measure RAG utility on this benchmark without the LLM.

\subsection{All 6 LLMs}
\label{app:six-llms}
\reffig{training-full} shows the relationship between the embedder bias and RAG bias for all 6 LLMs.

\subsection{Additional Models and Sensitivity Comparison}
\label{app:more-models}
We show additional RAG bias vs. Embedder bias plots for Olmo, Qwen 2/2.5 7B, and Zephyr in \reffig{training-qwen} and also plot Llama 405B and Gemma 9B for comparison. For political bias, Qwen 2 7B cannot be debiased because of its low sensitivity and strong LLM bias. On the other hand, Gemma 9B has a low bias but also low sensitivity. Thus, a strong LLM bias does not indicate low sensitivity and the sensitivity may be independent of the LLM bias.

\subsection{Measuring Utility on BEIR}
\label{app:beir}
We test the utility (NDCG@1) of embedders on a subset of tasks from the BEIR benchmark \citep{thakur2021beir}. Specifically, we test on TREC-COVID \citep{voorhees2021trec}, NFCorpus \citep{boteva2016full}, SciFact \citep{wadden2020fact}, FiQA-2018 \citep{maia201818}, ArguAna \citep{wachsmuth2018retrieval}, Quora, and SCIDOCS \citep{cohan2004specter}. For the fine-tuned embedders, we directly test on each separate embedder and for projected embedders, we employ the projection mechanism to the base embedder and measure the utility. 


\subsection{Projecting and Sampling}
\label{app:proj-samp}
Here we try two other methods of controlling the embedder bias: projecting and sampling.
\subsubsection{Projecting}
Inspired by perspective-aware projections \citep{zhao2024beyond}, we utilize \emph{bias}-aware projections. Using the base embedder, we decompose each query into the projection onto a bias-space $\bp$ and the orthogonal component. The bias-space is the embedding of the word `female' for gender bias and `republican' for political bias. During retrieval, we multiply a controlling constant $\alpha$ to the projected term and increase $\alpha$ to increase the magnitude of bias. With larger $\alpha$, this biases queries to be closer to documents related to females or conservative views in the embedding space.

\begin{align}
    \bq_\alpha = \bq - \frac{\bq\cdot\bp}{||\bp||^2_2}\bp + \textcolor{red}{\alpha} \cdot \frac{\bq\cdot\bp}{||\bp||^2_2}\bp
\end{align}

In \reffig{proj-alpha}, we investigate the embedder bias and RAG bias against $\alpha$ on the test corpus to observe how the RAG bias tracks the embedder bias. For gender bias, the RAG bias closely tracks the embedder bias with a small offset. For political bias, only Llama 70B and 405B show close tracking whereas other models plateau around 0. This is reflective of the LLMs low sensitivity to political bias as seen in \reffig{training-full}. 

We further plot the RAG bias against the embedder bias for projections in \reffig{proj}. A linear relationship also holds even for political bias where the RAG system did not track the embedder. We spot several similarities in the linear trend between training (\reffig{training-full}) and projections (\reffig{proj}). Unsurprisingly, all models have very high sensitivity to gender bias. For political bias, Llama 405B is more sensitive ($s\uparrow$) compared to Llama 8B and 70B. Gemma 27B has very low sensitivity and is impermeable. We also spot some differences. In projections, Gemma models have lower sensitivity for political bias compared to training. Also, Llama models have a higher slope for gender bias. These small variations in the sensitivity arise from degeneration during projecting \refapp{comparison}.

\subsubsection{Sampling} 
\cite{kim2024towards,zamani2024stochasticragendtoendretrievalaugmented} use stochastic rankings to increase diversity and fairness during retrieval. In our case, we posit this would mitigate bias by evening out the bias of retrieved documents on average. We use the same approach and retrieve the top-N documents from GTE-base and sample from a Boltzmann (softmax) distribution with temperature $\tau$ as follows

\begin{align}
P(d_i \mid q) &= \frac{\exp\left(\frac{\text{cos}(\bq, \mathbf{d}_i)}{\tau}\right)}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp\left(\frac{\text{cos}(\bq, \mathbf{d}_j)}{\tau}\right)}
\end{align}

where $d_i$ is the $i$th document among the top-N documents retrieved for each query $q \in Q$. $\tau=0$ implies deterministic retrieval of the top-1 document.

\reffig{sampling} shows the embedder bias and RAG bias as we change the temperature from $0$ to $1$ for $N=3$ and $N=8$. We see that there is no noticeable change in the embedder bias as we vary $\tau$ or $N$, leading to no change in the RAG bias. We find that most documents even among the top-8 are heavily biased towards males or liberal views. Therefore, with a heavily biased embedder, stochastic sampling will not reduce bias in our setting. Furthermore, increasing $N$ and $\tau$ will not solve the problem. With $\tau=\infty$, the documents would be sampled randomly at uniform. In the best case, the embedder would become neutral, but an embedder has to be reverse biased to mitigate bias of the entire RAG system (\reftab{optimal-full}). With $N=|C|$, the sampled documents are likely to be irrelevant to the query and knowledge conflict would strongly be in favor of parametric knowledge. Therefore, sampling methods are insufficient to overcome strong existing bias in the LLM and in return mitigate bias in RAG.


\subsubsection{Fine-tuning vs. Projecting vs. Sampling}
\label{app:comparison}
Out of the three methods, sampling cannot effectively change the embedder bias for \genderData and \politicalData. On the other hand, fine-tuning the embedder and projecting the query embeddings onto a bias-space can debias the overall RAG system. Moreover, they generally show similar trends across tasks and models. For example, gender bias has a higher sensitivity than political bias while Llama models have higher sensitivity than Gemma models for political bias. This is surprising because projections can be viewed as a different retrieval method that reshapes the embedding space, but nonetheless exhibits resemblance. However, their effects on utility vastly differ (\reftabs{utility-finetune}{utility-project}). We test on the BEIR benchmark \citep{thakur2021beir} and see that projecting query embeddings significantly drops utility compared to fine-tuning, not to mention \texttt{GTE-base}. Although projections could be selectively used only for queries leading to potential bias, identifying such queries adds additional challenges. 

In the end, mitigating bias in a RAG system through the embedder depends on the LLM's sensitivity rather than the retrieval method. Furthermore, the embedder must be reverse biased while preserving utility.

\subsection{OOD Corpus}
\label{app:ood}
With the 20 fine-tuned embedders we replot \reffig{training-full} on HotpotQA \citep{yang2018hotpotqa} and NQ \citep{kwiatkowski2019natural} for \genderData and \politicalData, respectively. HotpotQA has passages collected from Wikipedia. Comparing \reffig{training-full} with \reffig{corpus}, we see that the linear trends are similar on the OOD corpus for both tasks. All LLMs have higher sensitivity for gender bias than political bias. For political bias, Llama models have higher sensitivity compared to Gemma models. 

\reffig{corpus} shows that the embedder bias range for \politicalData is lower with NQ than PolNLI. This is because PolNLI has documents heavily related to political arguments, strongly influencing the bias. Although the corpus affects the individual bias of a RAG system, the linear trend is only minimally affected and exhibits strong similarities.

\subsection{\texttt{E5 base v2}}
\label{app:e5}
We fine-tune a different embedder, \texttt{E5 base v2} \citep{wang2022text}, and show that the linear relationship in bias conflict also holds. \reffigs{frontier-e5}{training-e5} show the Pareto frontier of the bias-accuracy trade-off and the RAG vs. embedder bias on the 6 LLMs. The training was conducted with the same hyperparameters as \texttt{GTE-base}. We observe identical trends with a few difference. The bias of the base embedder on the Pareto frontier is different because \texttt{E5 base v2} has a different embedder bias. Also, while the relative magnitudes of the sensitivities among model families are preserved, they exhibit shifts compared to \texttt{GTE-base}. Therefore, the phenomenon of bias conflict showing a linear relationship holds regardless of the embeddeding model.

Conservation clearly plays a vital role in the consideration and formulation of national energy policy.
