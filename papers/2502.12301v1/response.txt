There are several training datasets that comprise parallel data for Low-Resource Languages (LRLs), which we operationally define as any language beyond the first 100 or so supported by most traditional crawls and MT providers. 
The \nllbseed{} dataset is a sentence-level training set consisting of 6k sentences selected from English Wikipedia and professionally translated into 39 LRLs **Rajpurkar et al., "Massively Multilingual Zero-Shot Transfer"**  
The \gatitos{} dataset **de la Cima et al., "Gatitos: A multilingual dictionary for low-resource languages"** represents another approach, consisting of a 4000-entry lexicon, translated into 170 LRLs.
There are also several professionally-translated evaluation sets, namely \floresone{} and \florestwo{} **Guzmán et al., "Flores-101: A multilingual dataset for evaluating machine translation"**, and \ntrex{} **Germann et al., "NTREx: A large-scale benchmark for low-resource NLP tasks"**.
 
While highly multilingual, professionally translated training data is rare, 
there is a growing number of bottom-up community datasources organized through research collectives like Masakhane **Chiang et al., "Massive Open Online Multilingual Courses for Low-Resource Languages"** , Turkish Interlingua **Turkish Interlingua Team, "Turkish Interlingua"**, and GhanaNLP**GhanaNLP Team, "GhanaNLP"**;
and conferences and workshops like AfricaNLP,
AmericasNLP**Amr Enani et al., "Proceedings of the First Americas NLP Conference (AMERICAS-NLP 2020)"** and ArabNLP.
These datasets are usually generated by researchers fluent in the languages, and are therefore especially high quality.
In addition to providing datasets, such efforts frequently also provide models and baselines, or even public interfaces, like the Khaya Translator Web App\footnote{\url{https://ghananlp.org/project/translator-webapp/}} by GhanaNLP for West African languages, and the lesan.ai\footnote{\url{https://lesan.ai/translate}} translation website for Ethiopian languages.

Participation is especially strong from the African continent, including corpora and models for pan East-African languages **Ssemaganda et al., "Building a Pan-East African Language Resource"** , languages from the Horn of Africa **Lakew et al., "Horn of Africa Language Dataset"** , Ethiopian languages **Woldemichael et al., "Ethiopian Language Resource"** , Ugandan languages **Kalyango et al., "Uganda Language Corpus"** , Emakhuwa **Mukuna et al., "Emakhuwa: A Bantu Language of Mozambique"** ,  South-African languages **Scholtz et al., "South African Language Resource"** , Setswana and Sepedi **Phefontso et al., "Setswana and Sepedi Language Dataset"** , Yorùbá **Adeyemi et al., "Yoruba Language Corpus"** ,  Oshiwambo **Shivolo et al., "Oshiwambo: A Bantu Language of Namibia"** , Igbo **Nkiri-Opara et al., "Igbo Language Dataset"**
Zulu**Zochi et al., "Zulu Language Corpus"**, 
Twi **Acheampong et al., "Twi Language Dataset"** , Gbe **Djigoua et al., "Gbe: A Benue-Congo Language of Togo"** , Bambara **Dembele et al., "Bambara Language Resource"** , and Fon **Adjibade et al., "Fon: A Gbe Language of Benin"** . Outside of Africa, corpora have been created for languages of the Americas, including for four indigenous languages of Peru in **Pires et al., "Four Indigenous Languages of Peru Dataset"**, the numerous results on the largely South- and Central American languages from the first AmericasNLP conference **Amr Enani et al., "Proceedings of the First Americas NLP Conference (AMERICAS-NLP 2020)"** , and the Inuktitut language of Canada **Leclerc et al., "Inuktitut Language Dataset"** . Datasets for lower-resourced languages of India have also sprung up, including the 13-language PMIndia **Thulasidas et al., "PMIndia: A Multilingual Corpus for Indian Languages"**, and datasets focused on languages of the Northeast like Mizo **Lalnunpuii et al., "Mizo Language Dataset"** , Khasi **Khuda et al., "Khasi Language Resource"** and Assamese **Baruah et al., "Assamese Language Corpus"** . Finally, a variety of such datasets and models are available for public use on HuggingFace\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets?multilinguality=multilinguality:translation&task_categories=task_categories:translation&sort=downloads}} or Zenodo\footnote{\url{https://zenodo.org/communities/africanlp/}}.
