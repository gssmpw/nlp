    abstract = "Modern machine translation models and language models are able to translate without having been trained on parallel data, greatly expanding the set of languages that they can serve. However, these models still struggle in a variety of predictable ways, a problem that cannot be overcome without at least some trusted bilingual data. This work expands on a cheap and abundant resource to combat this problem: bilingual lexica. We test the efficacy of bilingual lexica in a real-world set-up, on 200-language translation models trained on web-crawled text. We present several findings: (1) using lexical data augmentation, we demonstrate sizable performance gains for unsupervised translation; (2) we compare several families of data augmentation, demonstrating that they yield similar improvements, and can be combined for even greater improvements; (3) we demonstrate the importance of carefully curated lexica over larger, noisier ones, especially with larger models; and (4) we compare the efficacy of multilingual lexicon data versus human-translated parallel data. Based on results from (3), we develop and open-source GATITOS, a high-quality, curated dataset in 168 tail languages, one of the first human-translated resources to cover many of these languages."

We discuss the limitations revealed by self-auditing MADLAD-4 0 0, and the role data auditing had in the dataset creation process. We then train and release a 10.7B-parameter multilingual machine translation model on 250 billion tokens covering over 450 languages using publicly available data, and find that it is competitive with models that are significantly larger, and report the results on different domains. In addition, we train a 8B-parameter language model, and assess the results on few-shot translation. We make the baseline models available to the research community. https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/madlad_400},
