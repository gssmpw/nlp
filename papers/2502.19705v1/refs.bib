abstract="We present FEAR, a family of fast, efficient, accurate, and robust Siamese visual trackers. We present a novel and efficient way to benefit from dual-template representation for object model adaption, which incorporates temporal information with only a single learnable parameter. We further improve the tracker architecture with a pixel-wise fusion block. By plugging-in sophisticated backbones with the abovementioned modules, FEAR-M and FEAR-L trackers surpass most Siamese trackers on several academic benchmarks in both accuracy and efficiency. Employed with the lightweight backbone, the optimized version FEAR-XS offers more than 10 times faster tracking than current Siamese trackers while maintaining near state-of-the-art results. FEAR-XS tracker is 2.4x smaller and 4.3x faster than LightTrack with superior accuracy. In addition, we expand the definition of the model efficiency by introducing FEAR benchmark that assesses energy consumption and execution speed. We show that energy consumption is a limiting factor for trackers on mobile devices.

abstract="In recent years, target tracking has made great progress in accuracy. This development is mainly attributed to powerful networks (such as transformers) and additional modules (such as online update and refinement modules). However, less attention has been paid to tracking speed. Most state-of-the-art trackers are satisfied with the real-time speed on powerful GPUs. However, practical applications necessitate higher requirements for tracking speed, especially when edge platforms with limited resources are used. In this work, we present an efficient tracking method via a hierarchical cross-attention transformer named HCAT. Our model runs about 195 fps on GPU, 45 fps on CPU, and 55 fps on the edge AI platform of NVidia Jetson AGX Xavier. Experiments show that our HCAT achieves promising results on LaSOT, GOT-10k, TrackingNet, NFS, OTB100, UAV123, and VOT2020. Code and models are available at https://github.com/chenxin-dlut/HCAT.",

title="Ocean: Object-Aware Anchor-Free Tracking",
booktitle="ECCV",
year="2020",
pages="771--787",
abstract="Anchor-based Siamese trackers have achieved remarkable advancements in accuracy, yet the further improvement is restricted by the lagged tracking robustness. We find the underlying reason is that the regression network in anchor-based methods is only trained on the positive anchor boxes (i.e., {\$}{\$}IoU{\backslash}ge 0.6{\$}{\$}IoUâ‰¥0.6). This mechanism makes it difficult to refine the anchors whose overlap with the target objects are small. In this paper, we propose a novel object-aware anchor-free network to address this issue. First, instead of refining the reference anchor boxes, we directly predict the position and scale of target objects in an anchor-free fashion. Since each pixel in groundtruth boxes is well trained, the tracker is capable of rectifying inexact predictions of target objects during inference. Second, we introduce a feature alignment module to learn an object-aware feature from predicted bounding boxes. The object-aware feature can further contribute to the classification of target objects and background. Moreover, we present a novel tracking framework based on the anchor-free model. The experiments show that our anchor-free tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, including VOT-2018, VOT-2019, OTB-100, GOT-10k and LaSOT.

Our benchmark provides the first evaluation of many state-of-the-art and popular trackers on 123 new and fully annotated HD video sequences captured from a low-altitude aerial perspective. Among the compared trackers, we determine which ones are the most suitable for UAV tracking both in terms of tracking accuracy and run-time. The simulator can be used to evaluate tracking algorithms in real-time scenarios before they are deployed on a UAV ``in the field'', as well as, generate synthetic but photo-realistic tracking datasets with automatic ground truth annotations to easily extend existing real-world datasets. Both the benchmark and simulator are made publicly available to the vision community on our websiteto further research in the area of object tracking from UAVs.

abstract="The problem of arbitrary object tracking has traditionally been tackled by learning a model of the object's appearance exclusively online, using as sole training data the video itself. Despite the success of these methods, their online-only approach inherently limits the richness of the model they can learn. Recently, several attempts have been made to exploit the expressive power of deep convolutional networks. However, when the object to track is not known beforehand, it is necessary to perform Stochastic Gradient Descent online to adapt the weights of the network, severely compromising the speed of the system. In this paper we equip a basic tracking algorithm with a novel fully-convolutional Siamese network trained end-to-end on the ILSVRC15 dataset for object detection in video. Our tracker operates at frame-rates beyond real-time and, despite its extreme simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple benchmarks.",

To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical feature embedding model which separately learns the instance and category information, and progressively embeds them.",
