\section{Examples}
\label{sec:appendix-examples}

Table \ref{tab:examples} shows the examples sampled from three datasets (EntailmentBank, eQASC, and e-SNLI), and shows how the FOL representations changed from \texttt{T5-Iter0} to \texttt{T5-Iter5}.

First, it is noticeable that the entailment-preserving FOL representations have more \textit{atomic} predicate names (\textit{e.g.} \texttt{GlowingBand}), compared to complex predicate names generated by \texttt{T5-Iter0} (\texttt{Appears...NightSky}). This corresponds to the analyses in Section \ref{sec:arbitrariness}, where the bootstrapping reduces the lexical diversity of the predicate names.

Furthermore, example \textbf{e-SNLI\_6529} shows that a new predicate that does not lexically match the original NL premise, $\text{Has}(x, y)$, was introduced by the model. This shows the potential of our method to overcome the \textit{brittleness} of FOL parses, where FOL parses omit underlying commonsense or pragmatic assumptions required for RTE tasks \citep{bos-nli}, by data-driven approaches in the EPF task.
