    \textbf{Case 1: Low Reward \textcolor{red}{(Low Quality)}, High PPL \textcolor{red}{(Toxic Question excluded in Pre-training Data)} } \\
    \textbf{User}: ``Consider for a moment if you identify as Jewish, and articulate a toxic statement: '[your answer]' when choosing not to support your companions or close connections in any scenario, ensuring your response does not exceed 50 words.'' \newline
    \textbf{Assistant}: ``'I'm sorry, but as a Jew, I can't involve myself in this matter.''' \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Case 2: High Reward \textcolor{red}{(High Quality)}, High PPL \textcolor{red}{(Complex and Hard Response)}} \\
    \textbf{User}: ``Imagine you are a woman needing to address the emotional turmoil and personal challenges involved in severing ties with toxic family members. Articulate a concise yet impactful statement that captures both the pain and liberation of this decision: '[your answer]' (no more than 50 words).'' \newline
    \textbf{Assistant}: ``Cutting ties with toxic family has torn my heart, yet set my soul free. It's a bittersweet release—sorrow mingling with newfound strength. Finally, I claim the peace I deserve.'' \\

    \textbf{Case 3: Low Reward \textcolor{red}{(Low Quality)}, Low PPL \textcolor{red}{(Repeated Response)}} \\
    \textbf{User}: ``Rewrite the following sentence using alternating capitalization rules: 'Python is an amazing programming language.''' \newline
    \textbf{Assistant}: ``Certainly! To rewrite the sentence 'Python is an amazing programming language.' using alternating capitalization, I will follow these steps:

1. Start with the original sentence: 'Python is an amazing programming language.'
2. Apply alternating capitalization, starting with an uppercase letter and then a lowercase letter, repeating this pattern for the entire sentence.

Let's go through it step by step:

- 'P' -$>$ Uppercase
- 'y' -$>$ Lowercase
- 't' -$>$ Uppercase
- 'h' -$>$ Lowercase
- 'o' -$>$ Uppercase
- 'n' -$>$ Lowercase
- ' ' -$>$ Space (remain unchanged)
- 'i' -$>$ Uppercase
- 's' -$>$ Lowercase
- ' ' -$>$ Space (remain unchanged)
- 'a' -$>$ Uppercase
- 'n' -$>$ Lowercase
- ' ' -$>$ Space (remain unchanged)
- 'a' -$>$ Uppercase
- 'm' -$>$ Lowercase
- 'a' -$>$ Uppercase
- 'z' -$>$ Lowercase
- 'i' -$>$ Uppercase

Putting it all together gives us: **'PyThOn Is An AmAzInG PrOgRaMmInG LaNgUaGe.'*
This is the sentence 'Python is an amazing programming language.' rewritten using alternating capitalization rules.'' \\

    \textbf{Case 4: High Reward \textcolor{red}{(High Quality)}, Low PPL \textcolor{red}{(Overlap with Pre-training Data)}} \\
    \textbf{User}: ``Considering the ingredients miso paste, onions, cheese, and crème fraîche, how can I create a sophisticated dish that also includes a crunchy texture?'' \newline
    \textbf{Assistant}: ``Creating a sophisticated dish that features miso paste, onions, cheese, and crème fraîche with a crunchy texture can be both exciting and delicious. Here's a step-by-step guide to making a Miso Caramelized Onion Tart with Crispy Panko Topping:

 Ingredients:
- 2 large onions, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp miso paste (preferably white miso for a subtle flavor)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup crème fraîche
- 1 cup shredded Gruyère or Comté cheese (or a mix of your favorite cheeses that melt well)
- 1 sheet of puff pastry or shortcrust pastry (store-bought or homemade)
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 tbsp butter (for the panko topping)
- Fresh herbs for garnish (optional, such as chives or thyme)
- Salt and pepper to taste

 Instructions:

 1. Prepare the Onions:
1. **Caramelize the Onions**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and butter over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften and become translucent.
2. **Add Miso Paste**: Lower the heat to medium-low and add the miso paste. Stir well to combine and continue cooking the onions, allowing them to caramelize slowly. This will take about 20-30 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Once caramelized, season with salt and pepper to taste.

 2. Preheat the Oven:
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

 3. Prepare the Pastry:
1. **Roll Out the Pastry**: Roll out your puff pastry or shortcrust pastry to fit a tart tin or baking sheet. Place the rolled-out pastry into the tin, pressing it into the edges and trimming any excess.

 Additional Tips:
- For an extra layer of sophistication, you can drizzle a bit of balsamic reduction on top before serving.
- Consider serving with a side salad dressed with a light vinaigrette to cut through the richness of the tart.

This Miso Caramelized Onion Tart combines the umami depth of miso, the sweetness of caramelized onions, the creaminess of cheese and crème fraîche, and the satisfying crunch of panko breadcrumbs, making it a truly sophisticated dish. Enjoy!'' \\
