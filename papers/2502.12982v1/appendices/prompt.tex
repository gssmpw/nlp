\begin{tcolorbox}[title={The Prompt used for Translation}]
You are a highly skilled translator tasked with translating various types of content from English into \{\{ language \}\}. Follow these instructions carefully to complete the translation task.

You will receive a user-bot conversation in XML format. Please follow a three-step translation process:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Initial Translation:} Translate the input content into \{\{ language \}\}, preserving the original intent and keeping the original paragraph and text format unchanged. Do not delete or omit any content, and ensure that all original Markdown elements (e.g., images, code blocks) are preserved.
  \item \textbf{Reflection and Feedback:} Carefully review both the source text and your translation. Provide constructive criticism and specific suggestions to improve the translation in terms of:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
      \item \textbf{Accuracy:} Correct errors of addition, mistranslation, omission, or untranslated text.
      \item \textbf{Fluency:} Apply \{\{ language \}\} grammar, spelling, and punctuation rules while avoiding unnecessary repetitions.
      \item \textbf{Style:} Ensure that the translation reflects the style of the source text and considers any relevant cultural context.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Refinement:} Based on your reflections, refine and polish your translation.
  \item \textbf{Fallback:} If you are not confident in translating the conversation, please return ``\texttt{<stop></stop>}''.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
\textbf{Output:}

For each step of the translation process, output your results within the appropriate XML tags as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
<step1_initial_translation>
[Insert your initial translation here]
</step1_initial_translation>

<step2_reflection>
[Insert your reflection on the translation, including a list 
of specific, helpful, and constructive suggestions for 
improvement. Each suggestion should address a specific 
part of the translation.]
</step2_reflection>

<step3_refined_translation>
[Insert your refined and polished translation here]
</step3_refined_translation>
\end{verbatim}

Ensure that your final translation in step 3 accurately reflects the original meaning while sounding natural in \{\{ language \}\}.
