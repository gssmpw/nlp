{\centering \textit{Serving the Underserved in Southeast Asia with Open LLMs. -- Sailor2 Spirit} \par}


Large language model (LLM) technology has driven significant innovations but remains predominantly focused on major languages like English and Chinese, leaving many others underrepresented. 
As a linguistically diverse region with 11 countries and 675 million people, Southeast Asia presents a unique opportunity for advancing multilingual NLP research. 
In this paper, we introduce Sailor2, a contribution to the advancement of language technology in the SEA region. Sailor2 offers improved open models, open tools, a transparent training recipe, and valuable insights to drive progress in multilingual LLMs.

To optimize Sailor2, we apply the following techniques:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rigorous data deduplication with six layers.
    \item Model expansion to mitigate language degeneration.
    \item Two-stage continual pre-training with varying language compositions.
    \item Two-stage instruction tuning with reward-aware and ppl-aware data selection.
    \item Preference tuning on both off-policy and on-policy data.
\end{itemize}


We devoted significant effort to evaluation, which includes: (1) few-shot evaluation for the base model, (2) chat performance comparison with GPT-4, and (3) cultural understanding about SEA cuisine and traditions.
The results indicate that Sailor2 excels at both basic language tasks (e.g., question answering and translation) and advanced tasks (e.g., mathematics and creative writing).


Overall, the Sailor2 project contributes to the following outcomes:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textbf{A family of open models},  optimized for Southeast Asian (SEA) languages.
    \item \textbf{A comprehensive cookbook} detailing the process of building multilingual LLMs, covering data curation, model training, and thorough evaluation. 
\end{itemize}
