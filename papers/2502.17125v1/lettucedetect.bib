    abstract = "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a main technique for alleviating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Despite the integration of RAG, LLMs may still present unsupported or contradictory claims to the retrieved contents. In order to develop effective hallucination prevention strategies under RAG, it is important to create benchmark datasets that can measure the extent of hallucination. This paper presents RAGTruth, a corpus tailored for analyzing word-level hallucinations in various domains and tasks within the standard RAG frameworks for LLM applications. RAGTruth comprises nearly 18,000 naturally generated responses from diverse LLMs using RAG. These responses have undergone meticulous manual annotations at both the individual case and word levels, incorporating evaluations of hallucination intensity. We not only benchmark hallucination frequencies across different LLMs, but also critically assess the effectiveness of several existing hallucination detection methodologies. We show that using a high-quality dataset such as RAGTruth, it is possible to finetune a relatively small LLM and achieve a competitive hallucination detection performance when compared to the existing prompt-based approaches using state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4. Furthermore, the finetuned model can effectively mitigate hallucination in LLM responses."

However, a significant challenge in deploying these systems in industry applications is the detection and mitigation of hallucinations - instances where the model generates information that is not grounded in the retrieved context. Addressing this issue is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) in industry settings. Current hallucination detection techniques fail to deliver accuracy, low latency, and low cost simultaneously. We introduce Luna: a DeBERTA-large encoder, fine-tuned for hallucination detection in RAG settings. We demonstrate that Luna outperforms GPT-3.5 and commercial evaluation frameworks on the hallucination detection task, with 97{\%} and 91{\%} reduction in cost and latency, respectively. Luna`s generalization capacity across multiple industry verticals and out-of-domain data makes it a strong candidate for guardrailing industry LLM applications."

They provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, enabling them to act as a natural language layer between a user and textual databases, thus reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is challenging due to several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages faithfully, and the quality of the generation itself. With RAGAs, we introduce a suite of metrics that can evaluate these different dimensions without relying on ground truth human annotations. We posit that such a framework can contribute crucially to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs."

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)."

abstract = {Position encoding has recently been shown to be effective in transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in the self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer.}

By integrating up-to-date information not available during their initial training, RAG greatly enhances the practical utility of LLMs in real-world applications. However, even with RAG, LLMs can still produce inaccurate outputs, such as distorting or misinterpreting source content, posing risks in high-trust scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach called Hallucination Aware Tuning (HAT). This method involves training hallucination detection models that generate detection labels and provide detailed descriptions of the detected hallucinations. Utilizing these detection results{---}particularly the hallucination descriptions{---}GPT-4 Turbo is employed to correct any detected hallucinations. The corrected outputs, free of hallucinations, along with the original versions, are used to create a preference dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training. The fine-tuning through DPO leads to LLMs that exhibit a reduced rate of hallucinations and deliver improved answer quality."

As a starting point, we use a deterministic retrieval system and then focus on common LLM failure modes that arise during this approach to text generation, namely hallucination and coverage errors. We propose and evaluate three methods to detect such errors based on (1) word-overlap, (2) salience, and (3) LLM-based classifiers. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based classifiers, even when trained only on synthetic errors, achieve high error detection performance, with ROC AUC scores of 95.3{\%} for hallucination and 90.5{\%} for coverage error detection on unambiguous error cases. We show that when no training data is available, our other methods still yield good results on hallucination (84.0{\%}) and coverage error (85.2{\%}) detection."

However, these approaches are not focused on developing an enterprise RAG system; they do not consider latency, train or evaluate on production data, nor do they handle non-verifiable statements such as small talk or questions. To address this, we leverage the customer service conversation data of four large brands to evaluate existing solutions and propose a set of small encoder models trained on a new dataset. We find the proposed models to outperform existing methods and highlight the value of combining a small amount of in-domain data with public datasets."

Existing fact-checking approaches either require access to the output probability distribution (which may not be available for systems such as ChatGPT) or external databases that are interfaced via separate, often complex, modules. In this work, we propose {\textquotedblleft}SelfCheckGPT{\textquotedblright}, a simple sampling-based approach that can be used to fact-check the responses of black-box models in a zero-resource fashion, i.e. without an external database. SelfCheckGPT leverages the simple idea that if an LLM has knowledge of a given concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by using GPT-3 to generate passages about individuals from the WikiBio dataset, and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate that SelfCheckGPT can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii) rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several baselines and show that our approach has considerably higher AUC-PR scores in sentence-level hallucination detection and higher correlation scores in passage-level factuality assessment compared to grey-box methods."

Our key idea is that an incorrect claim is likely to result in inconsistency with other claims that the model generates. To discover such inconsistencies, we facilitate a multi-turn interaction between the LM that generated the claim and another LM (acting as an examiner) which introduces questions to discover inconsistencies. We empirically evaluate our method on factual claims made by multiple recent LMs on four benchmarks, finding that it outperforms existing methods and baselines, often by a large gap. Our results demonstrate the potential of using interacting LMs for capturing factual errors."

abstract = {Financial sentiment analysis is critical for valuation and investment decision-making. Traditional NLP models, however, are limited by their parameter size and the scope of their training datasets, which hampers their generalization capabilities and effectiveness in this field. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive corpora have demonstrated superior performance across various NLP tasks due to their commendable zero-shot abilities. Yet, directly applying LLMs to financial sentiment analysis presents challenges: The discrepancy between the pre-training objective of LLMs and predicting the sentiment label can compromise their predictive performance. Furthermore, the succinct nature of financial news, often devoid of sufficient context, can significantly diminish the reliability of LLMs’ sentiment analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce a retrieval-augmented LLMs framework for financial sentiment analysis. This framework includes an instruction-tuned LLMs module, which ensures LLMs behave as predictors of sentiment labels, and a retrieval-augmentation module which retrieves additional context from reliable external sources. Benchmarked against traditional models and LLMs like ChatGPT and LLaMA, our approach achieves 15\% to 48\% performance gain in accuracy and F1 score.},

We first introduce a text encoder (base size) enhanced with RoPE and unpadding, pre-trained in a native 8192-token context (longer than 512 of previous multilingual encoders). Then we construct a hybrid TRM and a cross-encoder reranker by contrastive learning. Evaluations show that our text encoder outperforms the same-sized previous state-of-the-art XLM-R. Meanwhile, our TRM and reranker match the performance of large-sized state-of-the-art BGE-M3 models and achieve better results on long-context retrieval benchmarks. Further analysis demonstrate that our proposed models exhibit higher efficiency during both training and inference. We believe their efficiency and effectiveness could benefit various researches and industrial applications."

This advancement has led to more fluent and coherent NLG, leading to improved development in downstream tasks such as abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, and data-to-text generation. However, it is also apparent that deep learning based generation is prone to hallucinate unintended text, which degrades the system performance and fails to meet user expectations in many real-world scenarios. To address this issue, many studies have been presented in measuring and mitigating hallucinated texts, but these have never been reviewed in a comprehensive manner before.In this survey, we thus provide a broad overview of the research progress and challenges in the hallucination problem in NLG. The survey is organized into two parts: (1) a general overview of metrics, mitigation methods, and future directions, and (2) an overview of task-specific research progress on hallucinations in the following downstream tasks, namely abstractive summarization, dialogue generation, generative question answering, data-to-text generation, and machine translation. This survey serves to facilitate collaborative efforts among researchers in tackling the challenge of hallucinated texts in NLG.}, journal = {ACM Comput.

However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points."
