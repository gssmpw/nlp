\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose Visual Perception Tokens to enable MLLM to autonomously controls its visual perception process. MLLM can generate these Visual Perception Tokens in a manner similar to generating natural language and use them to convey information to the visual perception process. 
Experiments validate the effectiveness of Visual Perception Token over various tasks.
