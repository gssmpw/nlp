   \caption{Examples collected from the testing sets. The responses were generated by the 7B model and the 2B+VPT model. During the generation process, if Region Selection Tokens were utilized, the region selected by these tokens are highlighted with red boxes in the images. For additional examples, please refer to the supplementary material. 
   % The examples presented correspond to several application scenarios where Visual Perception Tokens are  effective, such as extracting detailed information from large documents, detecting the presence of fine-grained objects in images, and counting objects.
