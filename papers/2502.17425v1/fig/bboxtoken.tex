   \caption{The relationship between the Region Selection Tokens we used and a precise bbox. Region Selection Token uses the cells containing the top-left and bottom-right corners to describe the approximate location of the region. In this example, the image is evenly divided into $4\times 4$ cells. In our main experiment, we divide images into $8\times 8$ cells.}
