The output should consist of two tuples formatted as (id, nf, x, y), where id is the object's unique identifier, nf is the normalized frame number of detection, and x and y are the normalized coordinates of the bounding box center in each frame.\texttt{"}\\
\texttt{\textcolor{blue}{Q:}}\texttt{"}Can you locate \mbox{\{object\_id\}} in the traffic video and provide the standardized spatiotemporal localization for its first and last visible frames? The output should be a list containing two tuples, with each tuple structured as  \mbox{(id, nf, x, y)}. In this format, id denotes the unique identifier of the object, nf represents the normalized frame number in which the object is detected, and x and y are the normalized coordinates of the object's bounding box center within the respective frame.\texttt{"}
