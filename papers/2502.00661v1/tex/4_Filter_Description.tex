\section{Filter Description}
\label{sec: filter description}
The system is represented with three coordinate frames: the global frame $G$, the IMU frame $I$, and the radar frame $R$. The proposed EKF-based RIO aims to estimate the 6D pose of the IMU-fixed frame $I$ with respect to the global reference frame $G$. The estimator utilizes the error state extended Kalman filter (ES-EKF), which is well-suited for handling the non-linear dynamics and measurement models typically encountered in pose estimation problems. By maintaining a minimal error-state and operating close to the origin, the ES-EKF avoids issues such as over-parameterization and singularities, ensuring consistency and efficiency. It also simplifies Jacobian computations, enhancing the filterâ€™s robustness and computational efficiency when fusing IMU and radar measurements.
