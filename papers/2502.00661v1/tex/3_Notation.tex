\section{Notation}
\label{sec: notation}
Uppercase letters in superscripts (e.g., $A$ in ${}^A\mathbf{q}_B$) denote the reference coordinate frame. Quaternions, which are commonly used to represent attitude, follow the Hamilton convention \cite{sola2017quaternion}. Vectors are represented by bold lowercase letters, matrices by bold uppercase letters, and scalars by non-bold lowercase letters.

${}^A\mathbf{q}_B$ represents the quaternion describing the attitude of frame $B$ relative to frame $A$. The rotation matrix obtained from this quaternion, ${}^A\mathbf{R}_B = \mathbf{R}({}^A\mathbf{q}_B)$, is the part of the special orthogonal group, $\text{SO}(3)$. ${}^A\mathbf{p}_B$ represents the position vector of frame $B$ relative to frame $A$, expressed in the $A$ frame.
