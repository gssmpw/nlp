    \caption{\looseness-1\new{Illustration of the simple and architecture agnostic looping mechanism that we consider. A $k$-layer block looped $L$ times ({\bf middle}) is denoted by \loopy{k}{L}, which can essentially be viewed as a weighted shared model. The iso-param baseline, \loopy{k}{1}, is a $k$-layer model with the same number of \emph{distinct} parameters. The iso-FLOP baseline, \loopy{kL}{1}, is a $kL$-layer model with the same depth but $L$ times more parameters. Middle looping is a strategy that is inspired from prior works on model stacking (e.g. \citep{saunshi2024inductive}).}}
