\subsection{Teamwork in Healthcare}

Patients encounter preventable harms in healthcare, such as unexpected infection and errors in diagnosis, medication, and surgery **Hewitt, "Reducing Preventable Harms"**. 
To ensure safe and high-quality care delivery, it is important to establish efficient teamwork to clarify roles and responsibilities and communicate medical information **Tucker, "Effective Communication in Healthcare Teams"**. 
However, such efforts are consistently challenged by chaotic and overcrowded clinical environments *****, insufficient patient information *****, and intensive workloads of HCWs *****. 
Especially in critical care delivery, HCWs experience physical, mental, and emotional fatigue under time-sensitive medical procedures **Benner, "Physician Burnout"**. 
Moreover, the power dynamics within the team can discourage members from speaking up even in cases where evidence-based treatment protocols are violated **Tuckman, "Group Dynamics"**.
Therefore, supportive sociotechnical systems are needed to facilitate the cooperation of HCWs and improve patient safety.
Macrocognition and distributed cognition frameworks help researchers explore the complexities of team dynamics. Macrocognition highlights how teams perform cognitive work in dynamic environments through shared mental models and situational awareness **Salas, "Macrocognition"**, while distributed cognition reveals how team members, tools, and the environment share critical information *****. 
HCI researchers have explored technological solutions to enhance medical teamwork. 
For example, Jagannath et al. examined the use of an electronic flowsheet in medical resuscitations and suggested aligning it with evidence-based protocols **Jagannath, "Electronic Flowsheets"**. 
Similarly, Wang et al. investigated the impact of team-based care on patient outcomes **Wang, "Team-Based Care"**.

\subsection{Augmented Reality for Healthcare}

Researchers have widely used co-design methods to develop effective interventions for specialized teams, such as in medical settings, helping bridge the gap between technological capabilities and clinical needs *****. 
Kusunoki et al. described their work as participatory design and conducted workshops with HCWs to optimize display designs that support verbal communication patterns **Kusunoki, "Participatory Design"**. 
Similarly, Mastrianni et al. interviewed trauma teams to develop guidelines for decision support alerts, while they explored various systems they primarily focused on digital checklists, wall displays, and audio alerts to improve team coordination without disrupting patient care *****. 
Co-design methods have proven to be a valuable technique to develop AR-HMD solutions for medical teams, as they help bridge the gap between technological capabilities and clinical needs **Mastrianni, "Decision Support Alerts"**.

\subsection{Co-Design with Healthcare Teams}

Zhang et al. explored sociotechnical factors affecting smart glass adoption in emergency medical services *****. 
These co-design sessions revealed key considerations around team situational awareness, cognitive load during patient care, and the balance between providing useful information and avoiding information overload **Zhang, "Smart Glass Adoption"**.
Through co-design, researchers can better understand how AR solutions need to adapt to different roles within the medical team, from experienced physicians to new nurses, ensuring that the technology supports collaboration *****.
