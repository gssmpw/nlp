    abstract = {This study aims to investigate key considerations and critical factors that influence the implementation and adoption of smart glasses in fast-paced medical settings such as emergency medical services (EMS).We employed a sociotechnical theoretical framework and conducted a set of participatory design workshops with 15 EMS providers to elicit their opinions and concerns about using smart glasses in real practice.Smart glasses were recognized as a useful tool to improve EMS workflow given their hands-free nature and capability of processing and capturing various patient data. Out of the 8 dimensions of the sociotechnical model, we found that hardware and software, human-computer interface, workflow, and external rules and regulations were cited as the major factors that could influence the adoption of this novel technology. EMS participants highlighted several key requirements for the successful implementation of smart glasses in the EMS context, such as durable devices, easy-to-use and minimal interface design, seamless integration with existing systems and workflow, and secure data management.Applications of the sociotechnical model allowed us to identify a range of factors, including not only technical aspects, but also social, organizational, and human factors, that impact the implementation and uptake of smart glasses in EMS. Our work informs design implications for smart glass applications to fulfill EMS providers’ needs.The successful implementation of smart glasses in EMS and other dynamic healthcare settings needs careful consideration of sociotechnical issues and close collaboration between different stakeholders.Smart glass technology has been tested in various healthcare settings over the past decade. However, limited research has investigated the potential application of this technology in fast-paced, hands-busy medical settings, such as emergency medical services (EMS). Our study aims to address this critical research gap by investigating key considerations and critical factors that influence the implementation and adoption of smart glasses in time-critical medical settings through the lens of a sociotechnical perspective. We conducted a set of design workshops with EMS providers to understand what factors can facilitate or hinder the uptake of smart glasses. Our results highlighted several key user concerns and considerations that must be thoroughly addressed, such as the requirement for durable and weather-proof devices and long-lasting batteries, easy-to-use user interface, seamless workflow integration, and regulation-compliant data management. The results of this study can inform design, implementation, and evaluation of future smart glass applications to better support emergency patient care. We call for closer collaboration among different stakeholders, including device manufacturers, system designers, researchers, policymakers, and medical practitioners.},

We interviewed 12 clinicians with experience in leading pediatric trauma resuscitations to elicit design requirements for decision support alerts and how these alerts should be designed for teams with shared leadership. Based on the interview data, we identified three types of decision support alerts: reminders to perform tasks, alerts to changes in patient status, and suggestions for interventions. We also found that clinicians perceived alerts in this setting as coordination mechanisms and that some alert preferences were associated with leader experience levels. From these findings, we contribute three perspectives on how alerts can aid coordination and discuss implications for designing decision support alerts for shared leadership in time-critical medical processes.},

In this mixed-methods study, we examined how a digital checklist for pediatric trauma resuscitation could trigger decision support alerts and recommendations. We identified two criteria that cognitive aids must satisfy to support these alerts: (1) context information must be entered in a timely, accurate, and standardized manner, and (2) task status must be accurately documented. Using co-design sessions and near-live simulations, we created two checklist features to satisfy these criteria: a form for entering the pre-hospital information and a progress slider for documenting the progression of a multi-step task. We evaluated these two features in the wild, contributing guidelines for designing these features on cognitive aids to support alerts and recommendations in time- and safety-critical scenarios.},

We use this in situ experiment with a paper prototype to investigate the role-driven nature of coordination and to identify system requirements for computerized support of role-based coordination in time-critical work. While role information is useful in coordinating time-critical work, our findings show that the current low-tech solution did not provide significant improvement in team coordination. The situations that were most in need of role-identification were the least likely to achieve it because role-tags required work by trauma team members. Similarly, because role-tags allowed workarounds and misuse, they proved ineffective in controlling the number of people in the room. We suggest technological ways of identifying roles to help coordination in the trauma bay.},

In this paper, we offer a perspective on what awareness means within the context of an ad hoc, time- and safety-critical medical setting by looking at teams treating severely ill patients with urgent needs. We report findings from four participatory design workshops conducted with emergency medicine clinicians at two regional emergency departments. Workshops were developed to elicit design ideas for information displays that support awareness in emergency medical situations. Through analysis of discussions and clinicians' sketches of information displays, we identified five features of teamwork that can be used as a foundation for supporting awareness from the perspective of clinicians. Based on these findings, we contribute rich descriptions of four facets of awareness that teams manage during emergency medical situations: team member awareness, elapsed time awareness, teamwork-oriented and patient-driven task awareness, and overall progress awareness. We then discuss these four awareness types in relation to awareness facets found in the CSCW literature.},

This paper explores how to design AI for clinical usefulness in different contexts. We conducted 19 design sessions and design interventions with 13 radiologists from 7 clinical sites in Denmark and Kenya, based on three iterations of a functional AI-based prototype. Ten sociotechnical dependencies were identified as crucial for the design of AI in radiology. We conceptualised four technical dimensions that must be configured to the intended clinical context of use: AI functionality, AI medical focus, AI decision threshold, and AI Explainability. We present four design recommendations on how to address dependencies pertaining to the medical knowledge, clinic type, user expertise level, patient context, and user situation that condition the configuration of these technical dimensions.},

We explore contouring, a critical workflow aimed at identifying and segmenting tumors, usually performed on immobile desktop computers in clinics, in which limited support for mobile access leads to prolonged and subpar treatment planning. Following interviews and think-aloud studies (N = 10 physicians), we report key contouring behaviors, and later design a novel cross-device prototype that enables contouring on everyday touch devices. We compared contouring via desktop and touch in a lab study (N = 8 residents) and found that mobile phones not only yielded similar accuracy, but also took significantly less time. Our results point to three broad design guidelines for cross-device solutions deployed within standalone healthcare workflows, and highlight how incorporating different device and input modalities can improve treatment delivery in today’s distributed healthcare environments.},

The secondary actor interacts with the primary user understanding they are seeing both physical and virtual worlds. We use grounded theory to study interaction tasks, participatory design sessions, and in-depth interviews of 10 participants and explore how AR real-time modifications affect them. We observe a power imbalance attributed to the: (1) lack of transparency of the primary user’s view, (2) violation of agency over self-presentation, and (3) discreet recording capabilities of AR glasses. This information asymmetry leads to a negotiation of behaviors to reach a silently understood equilibrium. This paper addresses underlying design issues that contribute to power imbalances in dyadic interactions and offers nuanced insights into the dynamics between primary users and secondary actors.},

In light of this, we conducted in-depth interviews with 16 users of various AI-based everyday recommender systems, investigating how people design their AI user experiences in actual use contexts. Exploring people’s current experiences of adopting and adapting those systems to achieve their own desired experiences, we discovered three styles of end-user design of their experiences: teaching, resisting, and repurposing.

Although voice user interfaces (VUIs) have been widely studied, the potential uses of full-body gestures in VUIs that can fully understand users’ surroundings and gestures are relatively unexplored. In this two-phase research using a Wizard-of-Oz approach, we aim to investigate the role of gestures in VUI interactions and explore their design space. In an initial exploratory user study with six participants, we identify influential factors for VUI gestures and establish an initial design space. In the second phase, we conducted a user study with 12 participants to validate and refine our initial findings. Our results showed that users are open and ready to adopt and utilize gestures to interact with multi-modal VUIs, especially in scenarios with poor voice capture quality. The study also highlighted three key categories of gesture functions for enhancing multi-modal VUI interactions: context reference, alternative input, and flow control. Finally, we present a design space for multi-modal VUI gestures along with demonstrations to enlighten future design for coupling multi-modal VUIs with gestures.},

Participants’ lived experiences impacted their perceptions and interactions with their VFAI, fueling rich insights about how to design for diverse needs. For example, while one participant saw increased potential in the VFAI after interacting with the design probe for health data reporting, another was skeptical of using it to communicate with her doctor.

We synthesized the results and propose SoundShift for increasing MR sound awareness, which includes six sound manipulations: Transparency Shift, Envelope Shift, Position Shift, Style Shift, Time Shift, and Sound Append. To evaluate the effectiveness of SoundShift, we conducted a user study with 18 blind participants across three simulated MR scenarios, where participants identified specific sounds within intricate soundscapes. We found that SoundShift increased MR sound awareness and minimized cognitive load. Finally, we developed three real-world example applications to demonstrate the practicality of SoundShift.},

abstract = {Geometric motion-based visual feedback widely used in existing voice assistants (VAs) plays a significant role in voice interactions. It enables a realtime and simultaneous depiction of VAs' conversational states, thereby mitigating the verbosity of speech and reducing unnecessary turn-taking. However, the study on VA visual feedback, which focuses on geometric motion graphics for different conversational states, has not been extensively explored. In this study, we systematically designed `Voicon', shape-based visual feedback, and explored the expandability of its visual language. To achieve this, we determined 3 conversational states through a literature review. We then conducted a conjoint analysis using the visual attributes extracted from a participatory design workshop. Based on the results, we proposed the Voicon system and created video prototypes for qualitative evaluation. Our findings demonstrated that our Voicon system is intuitively understandable and perceived as useful by users. We believe this pictorial enriches and expands the design space of visual feedback for VAs, which facilitates voice interaction.},

HCI research has started exploring collective stress visualization to facilitate group awareness and collective coping via testing prototypes in controlled settings. However, an in-depth understanding of users’ needs and envisaged scenarios based on their authentic experiences are still lacking. In this study, we utilized a participatory approach called co-constructing stories to investigate how a collective stress visualization would be used in office workers’ authentic workday routines. We constructed use case stories with a group of office workers separately based on their personal lived experiences, using a design probe called AffectiveGarden. Our results categorized six clusters of benefits for collective coping through visualization and their implications for future design practice.},

Workers are leaving their jobs for a variety of reasons, ranging from burnout and work intensification to a lack of meaningful employment. While some literature maintains that labor-replacing automation is poised to bridge the shortages, we argue there is an opportunity for technology design to instead improve job quality and retention. Drawing on interviews with unionized guest room attendants, we report on workers’ perceptions of a widely-used algorithmic room assignment system. We then present worker-generated design ideas that adapt this system toward supporting three key facets of wellbeing: self-efficacy, transparency, and workload. We argue for the need to consider these facets of wellbeing through design across the service landscape, particularly as HCI attends to the impacts of AI and automation on frontline work.},

Delivery platforms promise entry-level work, flexibility, and other benefits. However, researchers remain divided on if these platforms benefit workers and society at large. This study aims to shed light on the comprehensive challenges in food delivery work, uncovering gig worker-centered design opportunities to improve the lives of food couriers. Adopting an exploratory research process, we analyzed 19 ride-along food delivery videos and performed nine semi-structured interviews with food couriers in Portugal. Our findings illustrated the complexity and challenging nature of delivery work due to the entangled physical, digital, social, natural, and human factors. We captured and discussed gig worker-centered opportunities that surfaced from work challenges, echoing the needs of food couriers about supporting work, justice, inclusion, and work vision.},

But despite growing evidence suggesting that worker well-being in gig economy platforms have become significant societal problems, few studies have investigated possible solutions. We take a stride in this direction by engaging workers, platform employees, and local regulators in a series of speed dating workshops using storyboards based on real-life situations to rapidly elicit stakeholder preferences for addressing financial, physical, and social issues related to worker well-being. Our results reveal that existing public and platformic infrastructures fall short in providing workers with resources needed to perform gigs, surfacing a need for multi-platform collaborations, technological innovations, as well as changes in regulations, labor laws, and the public’s perception of gig workers, among others. Drawing from multi-stakeholder findings, we discuss these implications for technology, policy, and service as well as avenues for collaboration.},

Through design fiction, we then imagine a future interface as a diegetic prototype, the story of Squirrel Game, that demonstrates each of our three affordances in a realistic usage scenario.

abstract = {A growing organizational trend is to utilize ad-hoc team formation which allows for teams to intentionally form based on the member skills required to accomplish a specific task. Due to the unfamiliar nature of these teams, teammates are often limited by their understanding of one another (e.g., teammate preferences, tendencies, attitudes) which limits the team's functioning and efficiency. This study conceptualizes and investigates the use of a teammate information-sharing recommender system which selectively shares interpersonal recommendations between unfamiliar teammates (e.g., "Your voice may be overshadowed by this teammate when making decisions...") to promote teammate understanding. Through a mixed-methods approach involving 105 participants working on actual unfamiliar teams, this study explores how presentation elements such as anonymity and explanations influence system perceptions and how anonymity influences team outcomes. Results indicate that anonymizing recommendations was associated with worse team measures, particularly team satisfaction and team cohesion. Qualitative results shed light on why team members perceived privacy concerns and team benefits associated with using the system. We contribute to CSCW through a better understanding of how to support unfamiliar teams, the conceptualization and empirical investigation of a novel teammate information-sharing recommender system, and foundational design recommendations associated with such a system.},

ABSTRACT = {Augmented reality (AR) applications are increasingly being used in various fields (e.g., design, maintenance, assembly, repair, training, etc.), as AR techniques help improve efficiency and reduce costs. Moreover, collaborative AR systems extend applicability, allowing for collaborative environments for different roles. In this paper, we propose a multi-user collaborative AR system (aptly called the “multi-user collaborative system”, or MUCSys); it is composed of three ends—MUCStudio, MUCView, and MUCServer. MUCStudio aims to construct industrial content with CAD model transformation, simplification, database update, marker design, scene editing, and exportation, while MUCView contains sensor data analysis, real-time localization, scene loading, annotation editing, and virtual–real rendering. MUCServer—as the bridge between MUCStudio and MUCView—presents collaborative and database services. To achieve this, we implemented the algorithms of local map establishment, global map registration, optimization, and network synchronization. The system provides AR services for diverse industrial processes via three collaborative ways—remote support, collaborative annotation, and editing. According to the system, applications for cutting machines were presented to improve efficiency and reduce costs, covering cutting head designs, production line sales, and cutting machine inspections. Finally, a user study was performed to prove the usage experience of the system.},

abstract = {German Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are in crisis, struggling with an increasing shortage of skilled workers, ultimately putting patients’ safety at risk. To counteract this process, researchers are increasingly concerned with finding digital solutions which aim to support healthcare professionals by enhancing the efficiency of reoccurring critical caring tasks and thus, improve working conditions. In this regard, this paper evaluates the application of Augmented Reality (AR) for patient monitoring for critical care nursing. Grounded on an observational study, semi-structured interviews, as well as a quantitative analysis, mobile patient monitoring scenarios, present particularly during patient transport, were identified as an innovative context of use of AR in the field. Additionally, user requirements such as high wearability, hands-free operability, and clear data representation could be derived from the obtained study results. For validation of these and identification of further requirements, three prototypes differing in their data illustration format were subsequently developed and quantitatively, as well as qualitatively evaluated by conducting an online survey. Thereby, it became evident that future implementations of a corresponding system for patient monitoring ought to integrate a context-dependent data presentation in particular, as this combines high navigability and availability of required data. Identifying patient monitoring during patient transport as a potential context of use, as well as distinguishing a context-dependent design approach as favorable constitute two key contributions of this work and provide a foundation on which future implementations of AR systems in the nursing domain and other related contexts can be established.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smart glasses have been gaining momentum as a novel technology because of their advantages in enabling hands-free operation and see-what-I-see remote consultation. Researchers have primarily evaluated this technology in hospital settings; however, limited research has investigated its application in prehospital operations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the potential of smart glasses to support the work practices of prehospital providers, such as emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 EMS providers recruited from 4 hospital-based EMS agencies in an urban area in the east coast region of the United States. The interview questions covered EMS workflow, challenges encountered, technology needs, and users' perceptions of smart glasses in supporting daily EMS work. During the interviews, we demonstrated a system prototype to elicit more accurate and comprehensive insights regarding smart glasses. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the open coding technique. RESULTS: We identified four potential application areas for smart glasses in EMS: enhancing teleconsultation between distributed prehospital and hospital providers, semiautomating patient data collection and documentation in real time, supporting decision-making and situation awareness, and augmenting quality assurance and training. Compared with the built-in touch pad, voice commands and hand gestures were indicated as the most preferred and suitable interaction mechanisms. EMS providers expressed positive attitudes toward using smart glasses during prehospital encounters. However, several potential barriers and user concerns need to be considered and addressed before implementing and deploying smart glasses in EMS practice. They are related to hardware limitations, human factors, reliability, workflow, interoperability, and privacy. CONCLUSIONS: Smart glasses can be a suitable technological means for supporting EMS work. We conclude this paper by discussing several design considerations for realizing the full potential of this hands-free technology.},

  abstract = {Background Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have increasingly appeared in the medical literature in the past decade, with AR recently being studied for its potential role in remote health care delivery and communication. Recent literature describes AR's implementation in real-time telemedicine contexts across multiple specialties and settings, with remote emergency services in particular using AR to enhance disaster support and simulation education. Despite the introduction of AR in the medical literature and its potential to shape the future of remote medical services, studies have yet to investigate the perspectives of telemedicine providers regarding this novel technology. Objective This study aimed to understand the applications and challenges of AR in telemedicine anticipated by emergency medicine providers with a range of experiences in using telemedicine and AR or VR technology. Methods Across 10 academic medical institutions, 21 emergency medicine providers with variable exposures to telemedicine and AR or VR technology were recruited for semistructured interviews via snowball sampling. The interview questions focused on various potential uses of AR, anticipated obstacles that prevent its implementation in the telemedicine area, and how providers and patients might respond to its introduction. We included video demonstrations of a prototype using AR during the interviews to elicit more informed and complete insights regarding AR's potential in remote health care. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed via thematic coding. Results Our study identified 2 major areas of use for AR in telemedicine. First, AR is perceived to facilitate information gathering by enhancing observational tasks such as visual examination and granting simultaneous access to data and remote experts. Second, AR is anticipated to supplement distance learning of both minor and major procedures and nonprocedural skills such as cue recognition and empathy for patients and trainees. AR may also supplement long-distance education programs and thereby support less specialized medical facilities. However, the addition of AR may exacerbate the preexisting financial, structural, and literacy barriers to telemedicine. Providers seek value demonstrated by extensive research on the clinical outcome, satisfaction, and financial benefits of AR. They also seek institutional support and early training before adopting novel tools such as AR. Although an overall mixed reception is anticipated, consumer adoption and awareness are key components in AR's adoption. Conclusions AR has the potential to enhance the ability to gather observational and medical information, which would serve a diverse set of applications in remote health care delivery and education. However, AR faces obstacles similar to those faced by the current telemedicine technology, such as lack of access, infrastructure, and familiarity. This paper discusses the potential areas of investigation that would inform future studies and approaches to implementing AR in telemedicine.},

  abstract = {Background Basic life support (BLS) is crucial in the emergency response system, as sudden cardiac arrest is still a major cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, only a minority of victims receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from bystanders. In this context, training could be helpful to save more lives, and technology-enhanced BLS simulation is one possible solution. Objective The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of our augmented reality (AR) prototype as a tool for BLS training. Methods Holo-BLSD is an AR self-instruction training system, in which a standard CPR manikin is ``augmented'' with an interactive virtual environment that reproduces realistic scenarios. Learners can use natural gestures, body movements, and spoken commands to perform their tasks, with virtual 3D objects anchored to the manikin and the environment. During the experience, users were trained to use the device while being guided through an emergency simulation and, at the end, were asked to complete a survey to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed tool (5-point Likert scale; 1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree). Results The system was rated easy to use (mean 4.00, SD 0.94), and the trainees stated that most people would learn to use it very quickly (mean 4.00, SD 0.89). Voice (mean 4.48, SD 0.87), gaze (mean 4.12, SD 0.97), and gesture interaction (mean 3.84, SD 1.14) were judged positively, although some hand gesture recognition errors reduced the feeling of having the right level of control over the system (mean 3.40, SD 1.04). Conclusions We found the Holo-BLSD system to be a feasible and acceptable tool for AR BLS training.},

Nineteen liver data sets were used comprising 3D surface models, 2D image data, pathology information, diagnosis and treatment decisions. These data sets can interactively be sorted and investigated individually regarding their volumetric and meta information. The three participation modes were evaluated within a user study with surgery lecturers (5) and medical students (5). We assessed the usability and presence using questionnaires. Additionally, we collected qualitative data with semistructured interviews. A total of 435 individual statements were recorded and summarized to 49 statements. The results show that our prototype is usable, induces presence, and potentially support the teaching of liver anatomy and surgery in the future.},
