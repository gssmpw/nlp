\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work shows how to lift TC problems to a larger structured problem
and use fast sketching-based TD algorithms as ALS subroutines,
extending their guarantees to the TC setting and establishing novel connections to iterative methods.
We prove guarantees for the convergence rate of an approximate version of the Richardson iteration,
and we study how these algorithms perform in practice on real-world tensors.
One interesting future direction is to analyze the speedup that adaptive step sizes give in \texttt{accelerated-mini-als}.
