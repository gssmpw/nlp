In conclusion, we introduce HumanDiT, a pose-guided DiT-based framework designed for high-fidelity, long-form human motion video generation, trained on a large-scale human video dataset. HumanDiT supports variable resolutions and sequence lengths, and ensures visual consistency through a prefix-latent reference strategy. Leveraging poses generated by the proposed Keypoint-DiT and pose adapter, HumanDiT produces high-quality, pose-consistent videos with wild images and poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance across diverse scenarios.
