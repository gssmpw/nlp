abstract = {Most existing Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods are primarily designed to improve brightness in dark regions, which suffer from severe degradation in nighttime images. However, these methods have limited exploration in another major visibility damage, the glow effects in real night scenes. Glow effects are inevitable in the presence of artificial light sources and cause further diffused blurring when directly enhanced. To settle this issue, we innovatively consider the glow suppression task as learning physical glow generation via multiple scattering estimation according to the Atmospheric Point Spread Function (APSF). In response to the challenges posed by uneven glow intensity and varying source shapes, an APSF-based Nighttime Imaging Model with Near-field Light Sources (NIM-NLS) is specifically derived to design a scalable Light-aware Blind Deconvolution Network (LBDN). The glow-suppressed result is then brightened via a Retinex-based Enhancement Module (REM). Remarkably, the proposed glow suppression method is based on zero-shot learning and does not rely on any paired or unpaired training data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both glow suppression and low-light enhancement tasks.},

abstract = {The ability of a camera to record a high dynamic range image, whether by taking one snapshot or a sequence, is limited by the presence of veiling glare - the tendency of bright objects in the scene to reduce the contrast everywhere within the field of view. Veiling glare is a global illumination effect that arises from multiple scattering of light inside the camera's body and lens optics. By measuring separately the direct and indirect components of the intra-camera light transport, one can increase the maximum dynamic range a particular camera is capable of recording. In this paper, we quantify the presence of veiling glare and related optical artifacts for several types of digital cameras, and we describe two methods for removing them: deconvolution by a measured glare spread function, and a novel direct-indirect separation of the lens transport using a structured occlusion mask. In the second method, we selectively block the light that contributes to veiling glare, thereby attaining significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios than with deconvolution. Finally, we demonstrate our separation method for several combinations of cameras and realistic scenes.},
