\section{Conclusions and Future Research}

In summary, our main contribution was to introduce and examine a natural relaxation of VIs, which we refer to as \emph{expected} VIs. Unlike VIs, which are marred by computational intractability, we showed that EVIs can be solved efficiently under minimal assumptions. We also uncovered many other intriguing properties of EVIs (\emph{cf.}~\Cref{tab:results}).

There are many promising avenues for future work. VIs enjoy a great reach in a wide range of applications, some of which were discussed earlier in our introduction. It would be interesting to explore in more detail how EVIs fare in such settings compared to VIs. In particular, given that EVIs relax VIs, in addition to their more favorable computational properties, it is likely that they unlock new, more desirable solutions not present under VIs. 
For example, it is well known (\eg,~\citealp{Ashlagi05:Value}) that CEs can achieve better welfare than Nash equilibria in games. In light of the prominence of correlated equilibria in the rich setting of multi-player games, we anticipate EVIs to solidify their place also in other application areas beyond the realm of game theory.
