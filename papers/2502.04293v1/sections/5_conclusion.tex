We propose GCE-Pose, a category-level pose estimation method that leverages category-specific shape and semantic priors to improve pose learning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets through a Semantic Shape Reconstruction (SSR) module and a Global Context Enhanced (GCE) feature fusion module. GCE-Pose reconstructs partial inputs into complete semantic shapes, providing robust prior guidance for pose estimation. Although our semantic prior is limited to specific categories without scaling to instance-level alignment, our semantic shape reconstruction strategy still performs accurate pose estimation on category-level real data, even under occlusions and sensor artifacts, moving towards application-ready accuracy in category-level pose estimation.
