\caption{The slice when $K=3$. (a) It consists of $3 \times 3$ Processing Elements (PE), interconnected with each other in vertical and horizontal directions. In addition, the slice interacts with the Input Recycling Buffer to provide and read back activations to be reused. The read back activity is finalized by diagonal connections. An adder tree eventually accumulates psums coming from bottom PEs. Red arrows relate to activations; black dashed arrows relate to weights; blue arrows relate to psums.
(b) Each PE stores the current activation, weight, psum in registers. Two multiplexers select the direction of the activation to be reused (vertically, horizontally, diagonally). Finally, a pipelined multiply-accumulation unit executes the current computation.
