\caption{Top-level architecture of 3D-TrIM. $P_I$ cores execute convolutions between $P_I$ ifmaps and $P_I \times P_O$ kernels. Each core hosts $P_O$ slices, operating on the same ifmap. To maximize ifmap utilization on-chip, an Input Recycling Buffer is accommodated at the core level and shared among the slices. $P_O$ adder trees accumulate psums to finalize the convolution. A control logic supervises the functionality of the entire architecture over time.
