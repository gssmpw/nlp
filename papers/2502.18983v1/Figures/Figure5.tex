\caption{Example of dataflow. An $8 \times 8$ ifmap is considered. The computational cycles from 6 to 13 are visualized in detail. In the ifmap, the area in yellow indicates the portion managed by the shadow registers. For each cycle, the activations processed by the PEs, shift registers and shadow registers are reported. Activations in blue are read from the memory. Activations in orange are shifted through right-to-left movements. Activations in green relate to diagonal movements through shift registers. Activations in yellow relate to diagonal movements using shadow registers. Xs refer to don't care cases.
