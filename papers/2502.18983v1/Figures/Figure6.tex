\caption{3D-TrIM vs TrIM\cite{Sestito_24_2}: Comparisons on the (a) VGG-16 and (b) AlexNet CNNs. For each convolution layer, the horizontal label indicates the ifmap size $I$, the number of input channels $C$, the number of filters $F$, and the kernel size $K$ in the form $(I,C,F,K)$. The values relate to the number of operations per memory access per slice (OPs/Access/Slice) experienced by each layer. The green bars refer to 3D-TrIM, while the orange bars refer to TrIM.
