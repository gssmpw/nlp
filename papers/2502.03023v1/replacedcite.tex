% cp -> parameter tuning in cp -> our gap 
\paragraph{Conformal prediction}
Conformal prediction is a method for uncertainty quantification that ensures that the prediction intervals or sets cover the true label with a user-defined error rate____. 
% It could be used for regression____ and classification____. 
On the one hand, conditional coverage validity is a key property of conformal prediction, ensuring the algorithm fairness____.
On the other hand, to enhance the efficiency of conformal prediction, recent studies____ have proposed training-based methods, which could be regarded as adapters, performing tuning prior to conformal prediction.
Beyond these, with many non-conformity scores proposed, the score selection or aggregation is another challenge in conformal prediction____.
These recent paradigms of conformal prediction typically require tuning some parameters on a hold-out dataset, and our work provides the first study to quantify the negative effect induced by using the same dataset for tuning and calibration.
% Though a great deal of work has been researched for efficiency or (conditional) coverage validity, the tuning bias of parameter tuning in conformal prediction is still an open problem.

\paragraph{Learnability}
As classical learnability theory, a learnable model could be regarded as a risk minimization model with a specific hypothesis class____.
And further, the constrained risk minimization model is developed as a special case of learnability theory, where the hypothesis class is the set with a specific constraint or structure, such as structural risk minimization of character recognition____, of data-dependent hypothesis class____, of Rademacher penalty method____ and rough set-based classifier____.
As for conformal prediction, several works study learn the conformal prediction directly by designing a specific objective function____. 
Further, the conformal prediction is a special case of risk minimization problem with the constraint of coverage guarantee, and the generalization loss for the size of prediction set could be quantified____, including classification____ and regression____.
As we proposed in~\cref{sec:theoretical_results}, we interpret the tuning bias as a further constrained risk minimization problem of conformal prediction and provide the first theoretical analysis of the tuning bias.
% In this work, we interpret the tuning bias as a further constrained ERM problem of conformal prediction. 
% In this work, we are the first to interpret the tuning bias as a further constrained ERM problem of conformal prediction.

% The issue of tuning bias could also be interpreted as a special case of learnability, where the hypothesis class is the set of all possible indicator functions that score below the thresholds with transformation parameters.
% Though a great deal of work has been done on learnability in conformal prediction, the research on learnability in tuning bias remains blank.
