\section{CONCLUSION}

In our paper, we proposed a novel model called \textit{FuXi}-$\alpha$, which leverages Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention to enhance the interactions with temporal and positional features, and Multi-stage Feed-Forward Networks (MFFNs) to facilitate implicit interactions. Our offline and online A/B experiments demonstrate that \textit{FuXi}-$\alpha$ consistently outperforms prior models, and reveal the effectiveness of each component. Additionally, the performance continually improves while scaling up our model, highlighting its potential for large-scale recommendation systems. In future work, we plan to extend our model to tackle more complex recommendation problems, such as multi-behavior and multi-modal recommendations, and to apply our model to scenarios involving long sequences.
