\section{Related Work}
\myparagraph{Anomaly Detection Datasets}: Datasets are crucial for defect detection research. Traditionally, algorithms are developed using specialized datasets for specific objects, such as pcbs **Berndtsson et al., "MVTec-AD"**____ **Sarkale et al., "BTAD"**____ **Wang et al., "MPDD"**, and steel **Kim et al., "VisA"**. These training datasets often required manual labeling, limiting their impact on advancing industrial anomaly detection (IAD). The release of MVTec-AD in 2019 is a significant milestone, as it supported the development of unsupervised IAD algorithms by providing a diverse dataset. Subsequently, datasets like BTAD **Sarkale et al., "BTAD"**____ **Wang et al., "MPDD"** and VisA ____ have further propelled IAD research. Recently, the Real-IAD ____ dataset introduced a larger, multi-view dataset, presenting new challenges for IAD.

Anomaly synthetic: Artificially synthesizing anomalies allows researchers to augment datasets and improve model performance, even with limited original data. Recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods have increasingly utilized synthetic anomaly images. For example, CutPaste **Berghof et al., "CutPaste"** generates negative samples by cutting and pasting image segments, while DRAEM ____ and DeSTSeg ____ use Perlin noise and random uniform samples to create anomaly masks. Additionally, DTD ____ provides a source for blending anomalies into original images. The capabilities of diffusion models have further expanded synthetic data generation ____.

\myparagraph{Anomaly Detection} 
Recovery-based methods train networks to restore defects in images to their normal state ____ . For example, RealNet **Berthelot et al., "RealNet"** employs a feature reconstruction network with pre-trained multi-scale features, adaptively selecting and reconstructing residuals. By avoiding equal inputs and outputs, these methods mitigate the identity mapping issue in traditional reconstruction approaches. Moreover, the adaptability of diffusion models to various downstream tasks has spurred advancements in anomaly detection ____.

Knowledge distillation (KD) methods align teacher-student outputs for normal regions while differentiating defective ones for precise localization ____ . Identical network structures, however, may reduce feature diversity. Techniques like RD ____ and AST ____ address this by adopting serial or asymmetric architectures, improving differentiation between normal and abnormal features. Our method enhances this further by using heterogeneous teacher-student networks to better separate normal and abnormal features.
