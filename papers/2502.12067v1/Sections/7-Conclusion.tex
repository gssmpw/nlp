\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work introduces \method, a simple yet effective approach for controllable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) compression. \method is built upon the semantic importance of CoT tokens --- By selectively skipping less important tokens while preserving critical ones, \method enables LLMs to generate compressed CoTs with adjustable ratios, thereby striking an expected balance between reasoning efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and tasks validate the effectiveness of \method. We hope our investigations in \textit{token skipping} will offer valuable insights for advancing efficient CoT research and inspire future studies in this area.
