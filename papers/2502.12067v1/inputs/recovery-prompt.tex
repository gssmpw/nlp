Could you please recover the following compressed Chain-of-Thought output of a mathematical question to its original full content?

\vskip 0.1in

The question is: 

Marcus is half of Leoâ€™s age and five years younger than Deanna. Deanna is 26. How old is Leo?

\vskip 0.1in

The compressed Chain-of-Thought: 

break down Deanna 26 Marcus five years younger 26 - 5 21 Marcus half Leo's age Leo twice Marcus's age Marcus 21, Leo's age 2 x 21 = 42.
