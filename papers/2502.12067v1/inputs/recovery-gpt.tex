\textbf{Recovered CoT}: 1. We know that Deanna is 26 years old. 2. Marcus is five years younger than Deanna. So, Marcus’s age is \( 26 - 5 = 21 \). 3. Marcus is also half of Leo’s age, which means Leo’s age is twice Marcus’s age. 4. Since Marcus is 21 years old, Leo’s age is \( 2 \times 21 = 42 \). So, Leo is 42 years old.
