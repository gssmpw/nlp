\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec: conclusions}
\anew{In this paper, we prove a \emph{uniqueness} result: Under standard synchronous message passing assumptions, any strictly stateless deterministic algorithm oblivious to the message content which solves terminating broadcast is indistinguishable from \emph{Amnesiac Flooding}. 
We therefore argue due to both its uniqueness and simplicity, that Amnesiac Flooding is a fundamental or prototypical broadcast algorithm.
We formalise the four properties required for this uniqueness to hold, and show that by relaxing each individually one can obtain other correct and terminating broadcast algorithms, of which we present several.
These present the following natural questions: To what extent does Amnesiac Flooding represent a ``minimal'' broadcast algorithm?
Are there identifiable families of algorithms solving terminating broadcast with a subset of these restrictions? 
Are any of these independent of (i.e. not derivatives of) Amnesiac Flooding? \\

% Are there other problems whose solutions, under natural model restrictions, are limited to a single or small number of algorithms? 
We also obtain an understanding of the structural properties of Amnesiac Flooding. In particular, we study its sensitivity to single message drops, uni-directional link failures, and weak byzantine collusion, showing it can easily become non-terminating or non-broadcasting under such conditions. 
% Even though statelessness should help with properties such as self-stabilisation, this shows limitations that lack of state imposes towards building fault-tolerance. 
This is, perhaps, surprising as statelessness is frequently associated with fault tolerance, such as in the self stabilizing setting.
A reasonable interpretation of \cref{thm:balance}, however, is that Amnesiac Flooding, while locally stateless, depends heavily on a distributed ``meta-state'' contained in the configuration of sent messages.
This suggests it is unlikely that any minor modification of Amnesiac Flooding will resolve its fragility without depending on an entirely different mechanism for termination.
In support of this, we note that of the four alternatives presented in the proof of the Existence of Relaxed Protocols Theorem, only Random-Flooding is meaningfully more robust (and will in fact terminate from any configuration in finite time almost surely).
Nevertheless, we contend that further exploration of stateless algorithms such as Amnesiac Flooding, their properties and related models are important for both theory and practice of distributed networks.

For the first time we investigate Amnesiac Flooding from the perspective of fault sensitivity, and demonstrate that it is extraordinary fragile to even weak faults such as the failure to transmit a single message.
As such despite being an ideal theoretical broadcast protocol, its practical utility is limited.
This is, perhaps, surprising as statelessness is frequently associated with fault tolerance, such as in the self stabilizing setting.
A reasonable interpretation of \cref{thm:balance}, however is that Amnesiac Flooding, while locally stateless, depends heavily on a distributed ``meta-state'' contained in the configuration of sent messages.

In support of this, we note that of the four alternatives presented in the proof of the Existence of Relaxed Protocols Theorem, only Random-Flooding is meaningfully more robust (and will in fact terminate from any configuration in finite time almost surely).

Unfortunately, despite this we also demonstrate that no protocol is able to achieve correct and terminating broadcast while maintaining four desirable properties of Amnesiac Flooding.
This, in combination with its simplicity, suggests that Amnesiac Flooding is to some extent a minimal or prototypical protocol for terminating broadcast.
We therefore, argue that regardless of its fault sensitivity Amnesiac Flooding should be considered an object of mathematical interest. On the other hand, we demonstrate that there exist other distinct algorithms maintaining three of the four properties.
