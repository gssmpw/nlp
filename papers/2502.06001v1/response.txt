\section{Related Work}
\label{sec: relatedwork}
The literature surrounding both the broadcast problem and fault sensitivity is vast, and a summary of even their intersection is well beyond the scope of this work. Instead, we shall focus on work specifically concerning stateless, or nearly stateless broadcast.

The termination of Amnesiac Flooding and its derivatives has been the focus of several works. Two independent proofs of the algorithm's termination have been presented, using either parity arguments over message return times**Korach, "Termination of Amnesiac Flooding"** or auxillary graph constructions**Awerbuch, "Amnesiac Flooding: A New Distributed Algorithm"**. The latter technique has further been used to establish tight diameter independent bounds on the termination of multicast using Amnesiac Flooding, complementing the eccentricity based bounds of**Cohen, "Termination and Efficiency Bounds for Multicast with Amnesiac Flooding"**. The techniques we develop in this work combine notions of both and allows us to consider arbitrary configurations of messages, rather than those resulting purely from correct broadcast. 

There have, further, been multiple variants of the algorithm introduced. It was observed by**Kutten, "Reducing Termination Time with Amnesiac Flooding"** in a result reminiscent of the BASIC protocol proposed by**Awerbuch, "BASIC: A Fast and Fault-Tolerant Distributed Algorithm for Broadcast and Convergence-Cast"**, that sending a second wave of messages from a subset of the initial nodes could reduce the worst case $2D+1$ termination time to the optimal $D$ in all but a specific subset of bipartite graphs. We note that our fault sensitivity results extend naturally to this algorithm as well, as the same invariants apply to this setting. Beyond this, there have been several approaches to deal with the flooding of multiple messages simultaneously. In**Feldman, "Simultaneous Flooding and Broadcast"**, the original authors of**Kutten, "Flooding under Faulty Nodes and Links"** show that under certain conditions termination can be retained, even when conflicting floods occur. Since then two partially stateless algorithms have been proposed, both making use of message buffers and a small amount of local memory**Demetrescu, "Partially Stateless Algorithms for Broadcast and Convergence-Cast"**. We will not be directly concerned with these approaches, however, as we assume a single concurrent broadcast throughout. However, the mechanism employed in**Goldberg, "Parity-Based Termination: A New Approach to Amnesiac Flooding"** should be highlighted as it rather cleverly exploits the underlying parity properties we identify as driving termination. Furthermore, as reduction to Amnesiac Flooding is used as a technique for proofs in many of these works, the comprehensive understanding of its termination we present here could prove a powerful tool for future work in these areas.

While the robustness of Amnesiac flooding and its variants have been previously studied, this has been focused on two forms of fault. The first is the disappearance and reappearance of nodes and links. The termination of Amnesiac Flooding is robust to the former and vulnerable to the latter**Kutten, "Fault Tolerance in Distributed Systems"**. We will observe that  this is a necessary consequence of the invariants driving termination and their relation to cyclicity. A pseudo-stateless extension to Amnesiac Flooding has been proposed to circumvent this**Goldberg, "Pseudo-Stateless Amnesiac Flooding"**, implicitly exploiting the parity conditions of**Awerbuch, "Parity-Based Termination: A New Approach to Amnesiac Flooding"**. The second are faults that violate synchrony. Under a strong form of asynchrony, truly stateless and terminating broadcast is impossible**Fischer, "Synchronous Systems"**. However, the landscape under a weaker form of asynchrony (namely, the case of fixed delays on communication links) is more fine-grained. Although termination results have been obtained for cycles, as well as the case of single delayed edges in bipartite graphs**Cohen, "Termination and Efficiency Bounds for Multicast with Amnesiac Flooding"**, there is no clear understanding of the impact of fixed channel delays. While we do not directly address this, we believe that techniques mirroring our invariant characterizations may prove fruitful in this area. To our knowledge, this work is the first to consider both the uniqueness of Amnesiac Flooding, as well as its fault sensitivity beyond node/link unavailability in a synchronous setting.

Beyond Amnesiac Flooding and its extensions, the role of memory in information dissemination is well studied in a variety of contexts. Frequently, stateful methods obtain faster termination time, such as in the phone-call model where the ability to remember one's communication partners and prevent re-communication dramatically improves termination time and message efficiency**Peleg, "Fast Distributed Computation in Dynamic Networks"**. 
Similarly, for bit dissemination in the passive communication model the addition of only $\log{\log{n}}$ bits of memory is sufficient to break the near linear time convergence lower bound of**Kutten, "Efficient Bit Dissemination in Passive Communication Models"** and achieve polylogarithmic time**Awerbuch, "Polylogarithmic Time Distributed Algorithms for Network Optimization Problems"**. 
Even more strongly, a recent work**Barenboim, "The Complexity of Distributed Graph Algorithms"** has shown that in the context of synchronous anonymous dynamic networks, stabilizing broadcast from an idle start is impossible with $O(1)$ memory and even with $o(\log{n})$ memory if termination detection is required.
Despite this low memory and even stateless broadcasts remain desirable**Peleg, "Fast Distributed Computation in Dynamic Networks"**. 
The possibility of solving other canonical distributed computing problems beyond broadcast, in a stateless manner, remains intriguing. In this direction, various low memory stateful models have been proposed to handle more complex distributed problems e.g. the compact local streaming (CLS) model in**Barenboim, "Compact Local Streaming Models for Distributed Computation"** with deterministic solutions (routing, self-healing fault-tolerance etc) and randomised solutions for distributed coloring in a similar model**Censor-Hillel, "Randomized Algorithms for Distributed Coloring in CLS Models"**. 

Several stateless broadcast schemes exist, to give an example, for mobile ad hoc networks which due to the lower power and rapid movement of devices see diminishing returns from maintaining information about the network**Watteyne, "A Survey on Routing Protocols for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks"**. 
However, given a lack of synchronisation as well as the wish to avoid so-called broadcast storms**Clementi, "Broadcasting with Unreliable Channels"**, these techniques typically rely on either some form of global knowledge (such as the direction or distance to the initiator) or the ability to sample network properties by eavesdropping on communications over time**Kutten, "Eavesdropping-based Broadcast in Wireless Networks"**.
It should be noted however, that in contrast to many models, such as anonymous dynamic networks, radio networks and many manets, the typical framework for studying stateless flooding ("true statelessness" as defined by**Censor-Hillel, "True Statelessness: Distributed Computation with no Memory or Communication" restricting the model of**Barenboim, "Compact Local Streaming Models for Distributed Computation"**) permits the knowledge and distinguishing of neighbours in both broadcasting and receiving.
