    \begin{*theorem}[Uni-directional link failure]
    \label{thm: directed}
        For any graph $G=(V,E)$ and any initiator set $I\subsetneq V$ there exists an edge $e \in E$ such that a uni-directional link failure at $e$ will cause Amnesiac Flooding to either fail to broadcast or fail to terminate when initiated from $I$ on $G$. Furthermore, for any non-empty set of uni-directional link failures there exists $v \in V$ such that, when Amnesiac Flooding is initiated at $v$, it will either fail to broadcast or fail to terminate.
