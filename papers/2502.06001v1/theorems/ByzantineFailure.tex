    \begin{*theorem}[Byzantine Failure]\label{thm: Byzantine}
        If Amnesiac Flooding on $G=(V,E)$ initiated from $I\subsetneq V$ experiences a \emph{weak Byzantine failure} at $J\subseteq V\setminus I$, then the adversary can force:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Failure to broadcast if and only if $J$ contains a cut vertex set.
            \item Non-termination if and only if at least one member of $J$ lies on either a cycle or FEC subgraph. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{*theorem}
