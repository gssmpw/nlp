    \begin{*theorem}[Single Message Failure]
    \label{thm:message drop}
        If single-source Amnesiac Flooding experiences a \emph{single message drop failure} for the message $(u,v)$ then it fails to 
       terminate.
        if either:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $uv$ is not a bridge
            \item $uv$ lies on a FEC subgraph
        \end{itemize}
        Moreover, it fails to broadcast if and only if this is the first message sent along $uv$, $uv$ is a bridge, and the side of the cut containing $u$ does not contain an odd cycle.
