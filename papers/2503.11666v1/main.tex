\begin{abstract}
The escalating complexity of \ac{SoC} designs has created a bottleneck in verification, with traditional techniques struggling to achieve complete coverage. Existing techniques, such as \ac{CRV} and coverage-driven methodologies, rely on time-consuming and redundant simulation regression, leading to higher verification costs and longer time-to-market due to the manual effort required to adjust constraints and drive the stimuli to achieve coverage objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology that leverages supervised \ac{ML} to optimize simulation regressions, resulting in reduced simulation run-time and the number of test simulations required to achieve target coverage goals. We also investigate and compare the effectiveness of various supervised learning algorithms from scikit-learn \cite{scikit-learn}. Our results demonstrate that these algorithms can achieve at least 99\% coverage regain (\ref{eq:coverage_regain}) with significantly reduced simulation cycles. We utilize \ac{PyUVM} over \ac{SV-UVM} for testbench creation, enabling simpler constructs using Python and facilitating the reuse of existing \ac{ML} libraries. Our methodology is applied to three diverse designs, and our results show that it can significantly reduce verification costs, manual efforts, and time-to-market, while enhancing verification productivity and completeness, by automating the testbench update process and achieving target coverage goals.
