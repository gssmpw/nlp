In this work, we developed a novel design-agnostic methodology that leverages the power of supervised machine learning and PyUVM-based testbenches to optimize coverage-driven verification. \ac{PyUVM} offered advantageous on-the-fly data collection for the \ac{ML} process. Our approach achieved significant reductions in test simulations, simulation cycles, and run-time. The automatic update of testbenches with new tests, sequences, and constraints enabled seamless integration of the \ac{ML} environment into the simulation environment, streamlining the verification process. Our results showed that linear models outperform other supervised regressors while achieving \SI{99}{\percent} coverage regain.
