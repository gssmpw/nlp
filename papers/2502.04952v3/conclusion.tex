\section{Conclusion}
% \vspace{-0.2em}
We present the contribution identification algorithm, which addresses the redundant summary deficiency in the prior value flow analysis. 
It identifies redundant summaries efficiently and effectively without compromising soundness or efficiency.
Furthermore, it results in an average decrease in the time and memory overhead of state-of-the-art path-sensitive value flow analysis by 45\% and 27\%, respectively.
In the end, it enables path-sensitive analyses without compromising precision and still achieves good performance, making it comparable to path-insensitive analyses.
