\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

LLMs are powerful tools to generate code from natural language descriptions, but their adoption by non-technical users is hindered by the complexity of application deployment and operation.
With \sysname{}, we have proposed leveraging the high levels of abstraction of the FaaS paradigm to handle code execution and operation for non-technical users.
Furthermore, we proposed to leverage the reduced complexity of the FaaS programming model to improve correctness of LLM-generated applications.
Our evaluation of \sysname{} with a proof-of-concept prototype and a new dataset of real user application descriptions has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and its benefits compared to operating LLM-generated code without FaaS.
