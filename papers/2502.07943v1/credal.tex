\section{Developing the Close Reading Methodology (\credal)}
\label{sec:credal}

This section outlines the iterative process we followed to develop \credal. The process evolved through a series of steps, each designed to refine the methodology based on practical applications, feedback, and structured evaluation. Below, we detail each step of this process.

\subsection{Initial development}
\label{sec:credal:dev}

\subsubsection{Initial Exploration and Refinement}
\label{sec:credal:dev:1}

Our research team initiated the process by deeply engaging with the technique of close reading, traditionally employed in literary studies for detailed analysis of texts~\cite{frank}. Following a review of the relevant literature and practical application on literary texts, we sought to adapt this approach to the analysis of data models. Each team member independently proposed methods for applying close reading to the schemas. After reviewing individual work, we compared our approaches, identified commonalities, and developed the first draft of a methodology for applying close reading to data models.

In the next phase, we applied the newly developed methodology to a fresh set of schemas. This time, all team members used the same standardized approach, allowing us to observe how different individuals interpreted and applied the same methodology in diverse ways. This approach highlighted variations in interpretation and application, which led us to further refine and modify the methodology.

We used both knowledge graph data models (examining schemas from Wikidata.org and Schema.org) and relational data models during this first step. 
Recognizing the widespread use of relational data models \cite{silberschatz} across various industries and the broad availability of standard relational data modeling curricula, we decided to focus on relational data models for the remainder of our study.
We conducted another round of close reading, this time using open-source 
data models,\footnote{e.g., \href{https://gitmind.com/erd-examples.html}{GitMind}, \href{https://devtoolsdaily.medium.com/crafting-an-automatic-erd-generator-a-journey-from-ddl-to-diagram-83cc5da8cab7}{DevTools Daily}, \href{https://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/entity-relationship-diagrams}{ConceptDraw}}
and adapted our methodology based on this experience.

\subsubsection{Development of Supplemental Materials}
\label{sec:credal:dev:2}

In order to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the methodology, it was necessary to involve more independent reviewers.
Therefore, to ensure that the methodology could be effectively applied by others, we developed a set of supplemental materials. Since different team members brought unique perspectives and strategies to the project, we synthesized these insights into a practical guide. This guide contains valuable tips and advice aimed at helping users navigate potential challenges during applications of the methodology.

Additionally, we created a sample reading to demonstrate the methodology’s practical application. The chosen example, ``A Secure Students’ Attendance Monitoring System''~\cite{erd} (see Appendix~\ref{sec:example_reading} for details), was specifically selected for its balanced complexity, ensuring that it was detailed enough to be informative without overwhelming learners. The familiar context of education made the example relatable to a wide audience, and the step-by-step approach offered clear guidance. Together, these supplemental materials served as essential resources, providing both conceptual support and practical reference points.
