\section*{Impact Statement}
\system advances cost-efficient AI by demonstrating how small on-device language models can collaborate with powerful cloud-hosted models to perform data-intensive reasoning. By reducing reliance on expensive remote inference, \system makes advanced AI more accessible and sustainable. This has broad societal implications, including lowering barriers to AI adoption and enhancing data privacy by keeping more computations local. However, careful consideration must be given to potential biases in small models and the security risks of local code execution.
