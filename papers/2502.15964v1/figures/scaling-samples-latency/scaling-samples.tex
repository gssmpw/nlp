    \caption{\textbf{Exploring the trade-off between cost and quality with sampling at the edge.} The x-axis represents the number of tokens processed by the \textit{local model}, while the y-axis shows the accuracy achieved. Foreground dots connected by a line highlight the trend in accuracy improvement as the number samples (and remote tokens processed). The vertical  lines denote the point at which batched, parallel sampling is no longer compute efficient.}
