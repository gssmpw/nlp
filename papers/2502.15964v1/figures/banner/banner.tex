        \textbf{Local-Remote Systems}. \naive and \system protocols. \textbf{(Left)} Problem set-up: local and remote LM collaborate on a data-intensive reasoning task. \textbf{(Center)} \naive: A simple communication protocol in which the local and remote models have an ``unconstrained'' back and forth chat. \textbf{(Right)} \system: an extension of \naive where the remote LM decomposes a query into many \textit{jobs} that are processed in parallel by the local model. Each job is a single-step instruction over a chunk of the context.
