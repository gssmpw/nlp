\subsection{Imaging Modalities Integrated to Understand and Locate Acupoints}
Researchers, including Leow et al. and Park et al., explored the use of ultrasound to locate various acupoints and demonstrated the potential of 2D ultrasound-guided techniques for acupuncture needle insertion **Leow, "Ultrasound-Guided Acupuncture Needle Insertion"** __**Kim, "Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Imaging for Enhanced Acupuncture Safety"**. Kim et al. developed a procedure to acquire 2D ultrasound images using a probe to enhance acupuncture safety by visualizing the underlying structures beneath the skin **Kim, "Two-Dimensional Ultrasound Imaging for Enhanced Acupuncture Safety"** __**Lin, "Safe Needling Depths in Acupuncture: A Systematic Review"**. However, the lack of spatial information from 2D images and the challenge of managing a probe during needle insertion remains significant, as prior studies primarily focused on visualizing acupoints for anatomical understanding rather than providing real-time guidance. Our system overcomes the challenge of locating acupoints in space from 2D images by adopting UCT and MR technology, enabling the visualization of 3D reconstructed anatomical structures directly on the patient’s body (right arm). 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) have also been utilized retrospectively to assess safe needling depths **Lin, "Safe Needling Depths in Acupuncture: A Systematic Review"**. Lin et al., in their review, noted considerable inconsistency in defining safe needling depths across research groups, with no conclusive evidence linking or quantifying acupoint depth to anatomical structures based on imaging results **Lee, "Defining Safe Needling Depths for Acupuncture"** __**Park, "Acupuncture Needle Insertion Depth and Anatomical Structure Interaction"**. Therefore, our system focused on providing insertion trajectory guidance, allowing practitioners to manually adjust the auto-generated insertion trajectory using their hands while wearing an MR head-mounted display (HMD). The insertion depth is not predefined by the system but is visualized through holographic renderings of bone, muscle, and tracked needles.
