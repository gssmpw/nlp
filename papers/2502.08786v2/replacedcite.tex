\subsection{Imaging Modalities Integrated to Understand and Locate Acupoints}
Researchers, including Leow et al. and Park et al., explored the use of ultrasound to locate various acupoints and demonstrated the potential of 2D ultrasound-guided techniques for acupuncture needle insertion ____. Kim et al. developed a procedure to acquire 2D ultrasound images using a probe to enhance acupuncture safety by visualizing the underlying structures beneath the skin ____. However, the lack of spatial information from 2D images and the challenge of managing a probe during needle insertion remains significant, as prior studies primarily focused on visualizing acupoints for anatomical understanding rather than providing real-time guidance. Our system overcomes the challenge of locating acupoints in space from 2D images by adopting UCT and MR technology, enabling the visualization of 3D reconstructed anatomical structures directly on the patient’s body (right arm). 

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) have also been utilized retrospectively to assess safe needling depths ____. Lin et al., in their review, noted considerable inconsistency in defining safe needling depths across research groups, with no conclusive evidence linking or quantifying acupoint depth to anatomical structures based on imaging results ____. Therefore, our system focused on providing insertion trajectory guidance, allowing practitioners to manually adjust the auto-generated insertion trajectory using their hands while wearing an MR head-mounted display (HMD). The insertion depth is not predefined by the system but is visualized through holographic renderings of bone, muscle, and tracked needles.

\subsection{Extended Reality (XR) Systems for Acupuncture Guidance}
From initial virtual representations of acupoints to more recent advancements in Virtual Reality (VR), multiple VR systems have been developed primarily for acupuncture teaching and training ____. To enhance the immersion of simulation and training experiences, Sun et al. developed a MR training simulator that allows practitioners to develop muscle memory ____. Chen et al. created an AR system on an Android smartphone to visually represent acupoints in space ____, while Zhang et al. introduced an Android app utilizing a new method to localize AR acupoints ____. Despite these advancements, significant gaps remain in applying extended reality systems to clinical settings, particularly in working with real human bodies and supporting hands-on, real-world needling practices ____. To our knowledge, we developed the first HMD-based MR system that provides real-time guidance for acupuncture needle insertion and evaluated its effectiveness on actual patients.
