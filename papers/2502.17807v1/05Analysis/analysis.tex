\subsection{Response Length}
We conduct an analysis of response length\footnote{Using Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct tokenizer}  and its correlation with accuracy metrics as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:len_performance}.
The o1-preview model is excluded from this analysis due to the unavailability of its reasoning chain.
A significant disparity emerges between the average lengths of reasoning models and instruct models.
Notably, while distilled models exhibit substantially increased response lengths that do incorporate reasoning chains, a persistent gap remains between distilled models and their teacher counterparts in terms of length-accuracy optimization.

\subsection{Is the reasoning ability of distilled models generalizable?}
Though DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B achieves comparable scores on math and code datasets\cite{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability}, its efficacy substantially degrades on the DocPuzzle benchmark(see Figure \ref{fig:distill-teacher}). 
Furthermore, as evidenced in Table \ref{tab:main_results}, the gap between DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct with a zero-shot COT prompt remains statistically insignificant.
These findings suggest that reasoning capabilities acquired through supervised finetuning on distilled datasets produced by heterogeneous models exhibit limited generalization to complex, long-context reasoning scenarios.
This conclusion aligns with \citet{chu2025sft}, who demonstrate that models trained by supervised fine-tuning tend to memorize surface patterns in training data while struggling with out-of-distribution generalization. 
The empirical evidence challenges the universal applicability of knowledge distillation techniques and calls for other techniques,  such as reinforcement learning and self-improvement, to improve reasoning generalization.

\subsection{The Potential of Exploration}
Given the growing prominence of reinforcement learning (RL) in language model training, we quantify exploration capacity through the pass@3 score.
Figure \ref{fig:pass_at_3} illustrates that DeepSeek-R1 achieves superior exploration capability.
Our analysis reveals no significant correlation between LLM exploration potential (the difference between pass@3 and baseline scores) and pairwise accuracy scores.
We extend this investigation to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, derived from the Qwen2.5-32B base model.
Under controlled experimental conditions (temperature = 0.3, top\_p = 0.2, top\_k = 0), both models exhibit constrained exploration capacities as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pass_at_3}.

\subsection{Typical Error Analysis}
To investigate the limitations of the reasoning capacity of state-of-the-art LLMs, we conduct an error analysis for o1-preview and DeepSeek-R1 in Table \ref{tab:error}.
\paragraph{Arithmetic Reasoning Deficits}
The answer can be inferred by comparing two tables of futures prices and spot prices: (1)~Spot Price = Basis + Futures Price; 
(2)~As the equation does not hold where 
Zhangjiagang spot price = 6650, basis = 406, futures price = 6344,
and Hubei rapeseed oil spot price = 9350, basis = 661, futures price = 8449.
(3)~According to the question, there is an error in one of the soy-bean oil prices in the spot table, and there is an error in one of the rapeseed oil prices in the basis table.
Hence, the error in the spot table should be corrected as Zhangjiagang spot price =406 + 6344 = 6750.
The error in the basis table should be corrected as Hubei rapeseed oil basis = 9350 - 8449 = 901.  
Both models fail to extract the price relationship formula from tabular data, instead generating plausible but incorrect responses through heuristic estimation.
\paragraph{Common Sense Reasoning Limitations}
It is common knowledge that the gross floor area is larger than the usable area.
However, o1-preview and DeepSeek-R1 fail to recognize this difference, leading to incorrect judgments.
The lack of certain common sense knowledge prevents LLMs from engaging in further implicit reasoning.
