  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods play a pivotal role in reducing the impact of uncertainties during both optimization and decision making processes. They have been applied to solve a variety of real-world problems in science and engineering. Bayesian approximation and ensemble learning techniques are two widely-used types of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods. In this regard, researchers have proposed different UQ methods and examined their performance in a variety of applications such as computer vision (e.g., self-driving cars and object detection), image processing (e.g., image restoration), medical image analysis (e.g., medical image classification and segmentation), natural language processing (e.g., text classification, social media texts and recidivism risk-scoring), bioinformatics, etc. This study reviews recent advances in UQ methods used in deep learning, investigates the application of these methods in reinforcement learning, and highlights fundamental research challenges and directions associated with UQ.}

Model complexity of deep learning can be categorized into expressive capacity and effective model complexity. We review the existing studies on those two categories along four important factors, including model framework, model size, optimization process, and data complexity. We also discuss the applications of deep learning model complexity including understanding model generalization, model optimization, and model selection and design. We conclude by proposing several interesting future directions.}

  abstract = {This paper reviews exploration techniques in deep reinforcement learning. Exploration techniques are of primary importance when solving sparse reward problems. In sparse reward problems, the reward is rare, which means that the agent will not find the reward often by acting randomly. In such a scenario, it is challenging for reinforcement learning to learn rewards and actions association. Thus more sophisticated exploration methods need to be devised. This review provides a comprehensive overview of existing exploration approaches, which are categorised based on the key contributions as: reward novel states, reward diverse behaviours, goal-based methods, probabilistic methods, imitation-based methods, safe exploration and random-based methods. Then, unsolved challenges are discussed to provide valuable future research directions. Finally, the approaches of different categories are compared in terms of complexity, computational effort and overall performance.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we first derive two explicit mathematical expressions of bit error rates (BERs) with Rayleigh fading for differential phase shift keying (DPSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), and establish corresponding simulation models to realize the effect of Rayleigh fading. Next, we propose a mathematical expression to define the effect of shadowing fading and an approach to computing it. Then, we optimize the effect of path loss through adapting the value of the path loss exponent to different environments. Finally, using a packet-oriented simulation tool, OPtimized Network Engineering Tool (OPNET), we realize the effects of Rayleigh fading and shadowing fading, optimize the effect of path loss, and investigate the integrated impact of these effects on the performance of wireless mobile networks including wireless local area networks (WLANs) and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Simulation results not only coincide with the experimental results in present literature, but also show that these effects exert a non-negligible impact on the performance of wireless mobile networks. Accordingly, our new models and approaches make the present over-optimistic simulation results more accurate and reasonable.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new robust update rule of target network for deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to replace the conventional update rule, given as an exponential moving average. The target network is for smoothly generating the reference signals for a main network in DRL, thereby reducing learning variance. The problem with its conventional update rule is the fact that all the parameters are smoothly copied with the same speed from the main network, even when some of them are trying to update toward the wrong directions. This behavior increases the risk of generating the wrong reference signals. Although slowing down the overall update speed is a naive way to mitigate wrong updates, it would decrease learning speed. To robustly update the parameters while keeping learning speed, a t-soft update method, which is inspired by Student-t distribution, is derived with reference to the analogy between the exponential moving average and the normal distribution. Through the analysis of the derived t-soft update, we show that it takes over the properties of the Student-t distribution. Specifically, with a heavy-tailed property of the Student-t distribution, the t-soft update automatically excludes extreme updates that differ from past experiences. In addition, when the updates are similar to the past experiences, it can mitigate the learning delay by increasing the amount of updates. In PyBullet robotics simulations for DRL, an online actor¨Ccritic algorithm with the t-soft update outperformed the conventional methods in terms of the obtained return and/or its variance. From the training process by the t-soft update, we found that the t-soft update is globally consistent with the standard soft update, and the update rates are locally adjusted for acceleration or suppression.}

  abstract = {The k-means clustering algorithm is considered one of the most powerful and popular data mining algorithms in the research community. However, despite its popularity, the algorithm has certain limitations, including problems associated with random initialization of the centroids which leads to unexpected convergence. Additionally, such a clustering algorithm requires the number of clusters to be defined beforehand, which is responsible for different cluster shapes and outlier effects. A fundamental problem of the k-means algorithm is its inability to handle various data types. This paper provides a structured and synoptic overview of research conducted on the k-means algorithm to overcome such shortcomings. Variants of the k-means algorithms including their recent developments are discussed, where their effectiveness is investigated based on the experimental analysis of a variety of datasets. The detailed experimental analysis along with a thorough comparison among different k-means clustering algorithms differentiates our work compared to other existing survey papers. Furthermore, it outlines a clear and thorough understanding of the k-means algorithm along with its different research directions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a covert communication scheme based on a spread spectrum for ultra-violet communication. We first characterize the system model of the communication system, where Warden is adopted to monitor the legitimated user transmission based on the binary hypothesis test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To avoid periodic transmission of the pilot sequence which potentially degrades covertness, we propose a blind synchronization approach, such that the pilot sequence does not need to be transmitted. It is observed from system-level simulation that the spread spectrum-based approach can achieve both low detection bit error rate and covertness under weak light intensity. Moreover, we experimentally evaluate the detection performance and covertness of the proposed approach.}
