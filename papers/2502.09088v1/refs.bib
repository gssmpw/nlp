abstract = {Statistical shape models are an essential tool for various tasks in Med. Img. analysis, including shape generation, reconstruction and classification. Shape models are learned from a population of example shapes, which are typically obtained through segmentation of volumetric Med. Img.s. In clinical practice, highly anisotropic volumetric scans with large slice distances are prevalent, e.g., to reduce radiation exposure in CT or Img. acquisition time in MR Img.. For existing shape modeling approaches, the resolution of the emerging model is limited to the resolution of the training shapes. Therefore, any missing information between slices prohibits existing methods from learning a high-resolution shape prior. We propose a novel shape modeling approach that can be trained on sparse, binary segmentation masks with large slice distances. This is achieved through employing continuous shape representations based on neural implicit functions. After training, our model can reconstruct shapes from various sparse inputs at high target resolutions beyond the resolution of individual training examples. We successfully reconstruct high-resolution shapes from as few as three orthogonal slices. Furthermore, our shape model allows us to embed various sparse segmentation masks into a common, low-dimensional latent space — independent of the acquisition direction, resolution, spacing, and field of view. We show that the emerging latent representation discriminates between healthy and pathological shapes, even when provided with sparse segmentation masks. Lastly, we qualitatively demonstrate that the emerging latent space is smooth and captures characteristic modes of shape variation. We evaluate our shape model on two anatomical structures: the lumbar vertebra and the distal femur, both from publicly available datasets.}

abstract = {Freehand 3D ultrasound (3D-US) is a promising technique for measuring muscle volume but it requires gel pads or water tanks to limit probe compression on the skin which makes it hard to use in clinical applications. Our objectives were to measure the effect of different compressions on muscle volume in order to assess the clinical applicability of a minimal compression method for lower limb muscles. 4 muscles of the lower limb on 15 healthy volunteers were scanned with a new commercial freehand 3D-US setup accessible to clinical experimentators. Each muscle was scanned with 3 levels of compression: standard compression, minimal compression and gel pad (method validated against MRI). Volume was calculated using software segmentation tools. Acquisitions and segmentations were done by the same examiner. There was a significant impact of standard compression on volume measurements, but no difference between minimal compression and gel pad. Standard compression underestimated volume with a mean bias of 16 mL. For minimal compression, 75 % of measured differences were below the predefined clinically acceptable limits of 10 mL. Mean bias for this method was 1.1 mL. In conclusion, standard compression in freehand 3D-US induces a systematic bias in volume calculations. But, with a trained examiner and the necessary precautions to minimize compression, this bias could be abolished and become acceptable in clinical applications. When a high accuracy is required, gel pads could still be important to consider.}

abstract="The accurate prediction of femur shape changes due to hip diseases is potentially useful for early diagnosis, treatment planning, and the assessment of disease progression. This study proposes a novel pipeline that leverages geometry encoding and context-awareness mechanisms to predict disease-related femur shape changes. Our method exploits the inherent geometric properties of femurs in CT scans to model and predict alterations in bone structure associated with various hip diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA). We constructed a database of 367 CT scans from patients with hip OA, annotated using a previously developed bone segmentation model and an automated OA grading system. By combining geometry encoding and clinical context, our model achieves femur surface deformation prediction through implicit geometric and clinical insights, allowing for the detailed modeling of bone geometry variations due to disease progression. Our model demonstrated moderate accuracy in a cross-validation study, with a point-to-face distance (P2F) of 1.545 mm on the femoral head, aligning with other advanced predictive methods. This work marks a significant step toward personalized hip disease treatment, offering a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers and aiming to enhance patient care outcomes.",

abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) freehand ultrasound (US) is a widely used Img. modality that allows non-invasive Img. of Med. anatomy without radiation exposure. Surface reconstruction of US volume is vital to acquire the accurate anatomical structures needed for modeling, registration, and visualization. However, traditional methods cannot produce a high-quality surface due to Img. noise. Despite improvements in smoothness, continuity, and resolution from deep learning approaches, research on surface reconstruction in freehand 3D US is still limited. This study introduces FUNSR, a self-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction method to learn signed distance functions (SDFs) from US volumes. In particular, FUNSR iteratively learns the SDFs by moving the 3D queries sampled around volumetric point clouds to approximate the surface, guided by two novel geometric constraints: sign consistency constraint and on-surface constraint with adversarial learning. Our approach has been thoroughly evaluated across four datasets to demonstrate its adaptability to various anatomical structures, including a hip phantom dataset, two vascular datasets and one publicly available prostate dataset. We also show that smooth and continuous representations greatly enhance the visual appearance of US data. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of our method to improve segmentation performance, and its robustness to noise distribution and motion perturbation.}
