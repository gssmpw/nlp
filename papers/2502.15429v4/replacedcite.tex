\section{Related Work}
%In the academic literature, 
% The %prevalence 
% presence of fraudulent academic articles is increasing, with thousands of fake manuscripts being published in peer-reviewed journals every year____. 
The increasing scientific fraud presents a serious challenge to both the research community and society at large. Previous studies addressing this challenge primarily focus on rule-based heuristics%. These methods are 
, based on analyzing indicators such as author affiliations____, citation patterns____, journal impact factors and author networks____. 
Recently, traditional machine learning techniques____ as well as BERT-based models____ have been proposed to help with fraudulent article detection. 
%More recently, machine learning techniques such as Decision Trees____, trained to distinguish human-written vs. AI-generated text, and BERT-based models____, %which are specifically trained to distinguish human-written vs. AI-generated text, or 
%trained to distinguish retracted vs accepted manuscripts, have %significantly advanced the field by enhancing 
%been proposed to help with %the accuracy and efficiency of 
%fraud detection.


However,  %Despite 
the rapid growth in the number of fraudulent articles %, there has not been sufficient 
has not been matched by dedicated attention within the NLP field % devoted  to this problem
____%, particularly within the NLP research field
. Currently, there is an urgent need for more research into two key aspects.  (1) \emph{Benchmarks}.  
%The current largest open-source dataset related to this task is Retraction Watch____, which brings together about 50,000 retracted articles in various fields. 
Existing studies generally employ Retraction Watch____, a blog that monitors and reports on retractions of scientific papers, to analyze retraction behaviors____.
The Retraction Watch provides a collection of retracted records, but it does not constitute a benchmark on its own for comparing existing methods.
While benchmarks exist for specific fraud types, such as plagiarism____ and machine-generated text____, there is currently no standardized benchmark including diverse fraud types using real-world articles.
(2) \emph{Open-Source Tools}. While some systems for detecting fraudulent articles %already 
exist, they are often proprietary and controlled by commercial entities that are reluctant to share their technologies____.
Even though some LLM-based applications have been developed to address news misinformation____ and plagiarism____, there is a need for open-source LLMs specifically tailored to scientific fraud detection.
Such models would enhance transparency and foster collaboration in the fight against scientific fraud.

Note that the development of open-source tools alone is not sufficient; effective fraud detection systems must also be transparent and interpretable. The necessity for systems to provide explanations for their outputs in tasks such as fact-checking____ and misinformation detection____ is well-acknowledged. 
While previous research has explored incorporating explainable AI to explain decision-making processes____, the study of explainability in fraud detection systems remains limited.
