\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce \DatasetName, a novel large-scale dataset specifically designed for long-text rendering, addressing the existing gap in datasets capable of supporting such tasks. 
To demonstrate the utility of models in handling long-text generation, we create a dedicated test set and evaluate current state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models.
Additionally, the open availability of a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality long-text rendering dataset like \DatasetName is crucial for advancing the training of text-conditioned image generation models.

There are several promising directions for further enhancing \DatasetName, which we have not explored in this paper due to the increased computational costs these approaches entail: \emph{i}. Multiple rounds of dataset bootstrapping to iteratively improve data quality. \emph{ii}. Generating multiple synthetic captions per image to further expand the dataset corpus.
