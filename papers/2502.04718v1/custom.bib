    abstract = { Ordered labeled trees are trees in which the left-to-right order among siblings is significant. The distance between two ordered trees is considered to be the weighted number of edit operations (insert, delete, and modify) to transform one tree to another. The problem of approximate tree matching is also considered. Specifically, algorithms are designed to answer the following kinds of questions:1. What is the distance between two trees? 2. What is the minimum distance between \$T\_1 \$ and \$T\_2 \$ when zero or more subtrees can be removed from \$T\_2 \$? 3. Let the pruning of a tree at node n mean removing all the descendants of node n. The analogous question for prunings as for subtrees is answered.A dynamic programming algorithm is presented to solve the three questions in sequential time \$O(|T\_1 | \times |T\_2 | \times \min ({\textit{depth}}(T\_1 ),{\textit{leaves}}(T\_1 )) \times \min ({\textit{depth}}(T\_2 ),{\textit{leaves}}(T\_2 )))\$ and space \$O(|T\_1 | \times |T\_2 |)\$ compared with \$O(|T\_1 | \times |T\_2 | \times ({\textit{depth}}(T\_1 ))^2 \times ({\textit{depth}}(T\_2 ))^2 )\$ for the best previous published algorithm due to Tai [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 26 (1979), pp, 422-433]. Further, the algorithm presented here can be parallelized to give time \$O(|T\_1 | \times |T\_2 |)\$. }

abstract = {We present the Word Mover's Distance (WMD), a novel distance function between text documents. Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The WMD distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the WMD metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.},

abstract = {Word Mover’s Distance (WMD) computes the distance between words and models text similarity with the moving cost between words in two text sequences. Yet, it does not offer good performance in sentence similarity evaluation since it does not incorporate word importance and fails to take inherent contextual and structural information in a sentence into account. An improved WMD method using the syntactic parse tree, called Syntax-aware Word Mover’s Distance (SynWMD), is proposed to address these two shortcomings in this work. First, a weighted graph is built upon the word co-occurrence statistics extracted from the syntactic parse trees of sentences. The importance of each word is inferred from graph connectivities. Second, the local syntactic parsing structure of words is considered in computing the distance between words. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SynWMD, we conduct experiments on 6 textual semantic similarity (STS) datasets and 4 sentence classification datasets. Experimental results show that SynWMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on STS tasks. It also outperforms other WMD-based methods on sentence classification tasks.}

(2018) as a single language model pre-trained from monolingual corpora in 104 languages, is surprisingly good at zero-shot cross-lingual model transfer, in which task-specific annotations in one language are used to fine-tune the model for evaluation in another language. To understand why, we present a large number of probing experiments, showing that transfer is possible even to languages in different scripts, that transfer works best between typologically similar languages, that monolingual corpora can train models for code-switching, and that the model can find translation pairs. From these results, we can conclude that M-BERT does create multilingual representations, but that these representations exhibit systematic deficiencies affecting certain language pairs.",}

Gradually styles of textual data are also being changed in many novel works. This paper focuses on the transfer of the sentimental vibe of a sentence. Given a positive clause, the negative version of that clause or sentence is generated keeping the context same. The opposite is also done with negative sentences. Previously this was a very tough job because the go-to techniques for such tasks such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [1] and Long Short-Term Memories(LSTMs) [2] can't perform well with it. But since newer technologies like Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) and Variational AutoEncoder(VAE) are emerging, this work seem to become more and more possible and effective. In this paper, Multi-Genarative Variational Auto-Encoder is employed to transfer sentiment values.

This is especially true for tasks depending on subjective judgments such as sentiment analysis or offensive language detection. Particularly in these latter cases, the NLP community has come to realize that the common approach of reconciling{'} these different subjective interpretations risks misrepresenting the evidence. Many NLP researchers have therefore concluded that rather than eliminating disagreements from annotated corpora, we should preserve themindeed, some argue that corpora should aim to preserve all interpretations produced by annotators. But this approach to corpus creation for NLP has not yet been widely accepted. The objective of the Le-Wi-Di series of shared tasks is to promote this approach to developing NLP models by providing a unified framework for training and evaluating with such datasets. We report on the second such shared task, which differs from the first edition in three crucial respects: (i) it focuses entirely on NLP, instead of both NLP and computer vision tasks in its first edition; (ii) it focuses on subjective tasks, instead of covering different types of disagreements as training with aggregated labels for subjective NLP tasks is in effect a misrepresentation of the data; and (iii) for the evaluation, we concentrated on soft approaches to evaluation. This second edition of Le-Wi-Di attracted a wide array of partici- pants resulting in 13 shared task submission papers.",}

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised inference-time approach to authorship obfuscation to address the unique challenges of authorship obfuscation: lack of supervision data for diverse authorship and domains, and the need for a sufficient level of revision beyond simple paraphrasing to obfuscate the authorship, all the while preserving the original content and fluency.We introduce JAMDEC, a user-controlled, inference-time algorithm for authorship obfuscation that can be in principle applied to any text and authorship. Our approach builds on small language models such as GPT2-XL in order to help avoid disclosing the original content to proprietary LLM{'}s APIs, while also reducing the performance gap between small and large language models via algorithmic enhancement. The key idea behind our approach is to boost the creative power of smaller language models through constrained decoding, while also allowing for user-specified controls and flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on GPT2-XL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods based on comparably small models, while performing competitively against GPT3.5 175B, a propriety model that is two orders of magnitudes larger.",}

Inspired by this, we define a new task, namely stylized data-to-text generation, whose aim is to generate coherent text for the given non-linguistic data according to a specific style. This task is non-trivial, due to three challenges: the logic of the generated text, unstructured style reference and biased training samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized data-to-text generation model, named StyleD2T, comprising three components: logic planning-enhanced data embedding, mask-based style embedding, and unbiased stylized text generation. In the first component, we introduce a graph-guided logic planner for attribute organization to ensure the logic of generated text. In the second component, we devise feature-level mask-based style embedding to extract the essential style signal from the given unstructured style reference. In the last one, pseudo triplet augmentation is utilized to achieve unbiased text generation, and a multi-condition based confidence assignment function is designed to ensure the quality of pseudo samples. Extensive experiments on a newly collected dataset from Taobao1 have been conducted, and the results show the superiority of our model over existing methods.},journal = {ACM Trans. Inf.

However, BT mainly improves the translation of inputs that share a similar style (to be more specific, translation-liked inputs), since the source side of BT data is machine-translated. For natural inputs, BT brings only slight improvements and sometimes even adverse effects. To address this issue, we propose Text Style Transfer Back Translation (TST BT), which uses a style transfer to modify the source side of BT data. By making the style of source-side text more natural, we aim to improve the translation of natural inputs. Our experiments on various language pairs, including both high-resource and low-resource ones, demonstrate that TST BT significantly improves translation performance against popular BT benchmarks. In addition, TST BT is proved to be effective in domain adaptation so this strategy can be regarded as a generalized data augmentation method. Our training code and text style transfer model are open-sourced.",}

It offers a compromise solution that scores well on several popular quality measures. This approach exploits the dominance relation and the ideal point decision aid method, which selects one counterfactual from the Pareto front.

We propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures. The model can alternatively be seen as enhancing VAEs with the wake-sleep algorithm for leveraging fake samples as extra training data. With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls, and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model learns interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces short sentences with desired attributes of sentiment and tenses. Quantitative experiments using trained classifiers as evaluators validate the accuracy of sentence and attribute generation.}}

Deceiving Online Authorship Attribution Models Using Neural Text Generators}, volume={16}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/19304}, DOI={10.1609/icwsm.v16i1.19304}, abstractNote={Recently, there has been a rise in the development of powerful pre-trained natural language models, including GPT-2, Grover, and XLM. These models have shown state-of-the-art capabilities towards a variety of different NLP tasks, including question answering, content summarisation, and text generation. Alongside this, there have been many studies focused on online authorship attribution (AA). That is, the use of trained models to identify the authors of online texts. Given the power of natural language models in generating convincing texts, this paper examines the degree to which these language models can generate texts capable of deceiving online AA models. Experimenting with both blog and Twitter data, we utilise GPT-2 language models to generate texts using the existing posts of online users. We then examine whether GPT-2-based text generators are capable of mimicking authorial style to such a degree that they can deceive typical AA models. From this, we find that current AI-based text generators are able to successfully mimic authorship, showing capabilities towards this on both datasets. Our findings, in turn, highlight the current capacity of powerful natural language models to generate original online posts capable of mimicking authorial style sufficiently to deceive popular AA methods. This is a key finding given the proposed role of AA in real-world applications such as spam-detection and the investigation of criminal activity online -- where deceptive texts could be automatically generated to mimic authorship in order to mislead these critical AA systems.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media}, author={Jones, Keenan and Nurse, Jason R.C. and Li, Shujun}, year={2022}, month={May}, pages={429-440} }

Existing stylometry research assumes that authors have not attempted to disguise their linguistic writing style. We challenge this basic assumption of existing stylometry methodologies and present a new area of research: adversarial stylometry. Adversaries have a devastating effect on the robustness of existing classification methods. Our work presents a framework for creating adversarial passages including obfuscation, where a subject attempts to hide her identity, and imitation, where a subject attempts to frame another subject by imitating his writing style, and translation where original passages are obfuscated with machine translation services. This research demonstrates that manual circumvention methods work very well while automated translation methods are not effective. The obfuscation method reduces the techniques' effectiveness to the level of random guessing and the imitation attempts succeed up to 67\% of the time depending on the stylometry technique used. These results are more significant given the fact that experimental subjects were unfamiliar with stylometry, were not professional writers, and spent little time on the attacks. This article also contributes to the field by using human subjects to empirically validate the claim of high accuracy for four current techniques (without adversaries). We have also compiled and released two corpora of adversarial stylometry texts to promote research in this field with a total of 57 unique authors. We argue that this field is important to a multidisciplinary approach to privacy, security, and anonymity.},journal = {ACM Trans. Inf. Syst.

We propose a new method to effectively transform the text from a high-resource domain to a low-resource domain by changing its style-related attributes to generate synthetic data for training. Moreover, we design a constrained decoding algorithm along with a set of key ingredients for data selection to guarantee the generation of valid and coherent data. Experiments and analysis on five different domain pairs under different data regimes demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve results compared to current state-of-the-art data augmentation methods. Our approach is a practical solution to data scarcity, and we expect it to be applicable to other NLP tasks.",}

However, large-scaled image and stylized caption pairs cost lots of resources and are usually unavailable. Therefore, it's a challenge to generate stylized captions without paired stylized caption dataset. Previous work on controlling the style of generated captions in an unsupervised way can be divided into two ways: implicitly and explicitly. The former mainly relies on a well-trained language model to capture style knowledge, which is limited to a single style and hard to handle multi-style task. Thus, the latter uses extra style constraints such as outlined style labels or stylized words extracted from stylized sentences to control the style rather than the trained style-specific language model. However, certain styles, such as humorous and romance, are implied in the whole sentence, instead of in some words of a sentence. To address the problems above, we propose a two-step method based on Transformer: firstly detach style representations from large-scaled stylized text-only corpus to provide more holistic style supervision, and secondly attach the style representations to image content to generate stylized captions. We learn a shared image-text space to narrow the gap between the image and the text modality for better attachment. Due to the trade-off between semantics and style, we explore three injection methods of style representations to balance two requirements of image content preservation and stylization. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art systems in overall performance, especially on implied styles.},booktitle = {Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Multimedia},pages = {4733–4741},numpages = {9},keywords = {multimodal, stylized image captioning},location = {Lisboa, Portugal},series = {MM '22}}

However, current state-of-the-art medical mining methods usually produce opaque, black-box models.

In the medical domain, counterfactuals can provide example-based explanations for predictions, and show practitioners the modifications required to change a prediction from an undesired to a desired state. In this paper, we propose a counterfactual solution MedSeqCF for preventing the mortality of three cohorts of ICU patients, by representing their electronic health records as medical event sequences, and generating counterfactuals by adopting and employing a text style-transfer technique. We propose three model augmentations for MedSeqCF to integrate additional medical knowledge for generating more trustworthy counterfactuals. Experimental results on the MIMIC-III dataset strongly suggest that augmented style-transfer methods can be effectively adapted for the problem of counterfactual explanations in healthcare applications and can further improve the model performance in terms of validity, BLEU-4, local outlier factor, and edit distance. In addition, our qualitative analysis of the results by consultation with medical experts suggests that our style-transfer solutions can generate clinically relevant and actionable counterfactual explanations.}}

We propose a new task of expertise style transfer and contribute a manually annotated dataset with the goal of alleviating such cognitive biases.

This is a challenging task, unaddressed in previous work, as it requires the models to have expert intelligence in order to modify text with a deep understanding of domain knowledge and structures. We establish the benchmark performance of five state-of-the-art models for style transfer and text simplification. The results demonstrate a significant gap between machine and human performance.

Proper evaluation metrics are like a beacon guiding the research of simile generation (SG). However, it remains under-explored as to what criteria should be considered, how to quantify each criterion into metrics, and whether the metrics are effective for comprehensive, efficient, and reliable SG evaluation. To address the issues, we establish HAUSER, a holistic and automatic evaluation system for the SG task, which consists of five criteria from three perspectives and automatic metrics for each criterion. Through extensive experiments, we verify that our metrics are significantly more correlated with human ratings from each perspective compared with prior automatic metrics.

This task contributes to safer and more respectful online communication and can be considered a Text Style Transfer (TST) task, where the text{'}s style changes while its content is preserved. We present three approaches: (i) knowledge transfer from a similar task (ii) multi-task learning approach, combining sequence-to-sequence modeling with various toxicity classification tasks, and (iii) delete and reconstruct approach. To support our research, we utilize a dataset provided by Dementieva et al. (2021), which contains multiple versions of detoxified texts corresponding to toxic texts. In our experiments, we selected the best variants through expert human annotators, creating a dataset where each toxic sentence is paired with a single, appropriate detoxified version. Additionally, we introduced a small Hindi parallel dataset, aligning with a part of the English dataset, suitable for evaluation purposes. Our results demonstrate that our approach effectively balances text detoxification while preserving the actual content and maintaining fluency.",}

 abstract = {The stylistic properties of text have intrigued computational linguistics researchers in recent years. Specifically, researchers have investigated the text style transfer task (TST), which aims to change the stylistic properties of the text while retaining its independent content of style. Over the last few years, many novel TST algorithms have been developed, while the industry has leveraged these algorithms to enable exciting TST applications. The field of TST research has developed because of this symbiosis. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on text style transfer. More concretely, we create a taxonomy to organize the TST models, and provide a comprehensive summary of the state of the art. We review existing evaluation methodologies for TST tasks and conduct a large-scale reproducibility study in which we experimentally benchmark 19 state-of-the-art TST algorithms on two publicly available datasets.

 abstract = {Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. Human evaluations can take months to finish and involve human labor that can not be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evaluation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.},

 abstract = {This paper reports on the shared tasks organized by
the 20th IWSLT Conference. The shared tasks address 9
scientific challenges in spoken language translation:
simultaneous and offline translation, automatic
subtitling and dubbing, speech-to-speech translation,
multilingual, dialect and low-resource speech
translation, and formality control. The shared tasks
attracted a total of 38 submissions by 31 teams. The
growing interest towards spoken language translation
is also witnessed by the constantly increasing number
of shared task organizers and contributors to the
overview paper, almost evenly distributed across
industry and academia.},

@inproceedings{goswami-etal-2023-weakly,
 abstract = {Exploiting cognates for transfer learning in under-resourced languages is an exciting opportunity for language understanding tasks, including unsupervised machine translation, named entity recognition and information retrieval. Previous approaches mainly focused on supervised cognate detection tasks based on orthographic, phonetic or state-of-the-art contextual language models, which under-perform for most under-resourced languages. This paper proposes a novel language-agnostic weakly-supervised deep cognate detection framework for under-resourced languages using morphological knowledge from closely related languages. We train an encoder to gain morphological knowledge of a language and transfer the knowledge to perform unsupervised and weakly-supervised cognate detection tasks with and without the pivot language for the closely-related languages. While unsupervised, it overcomes the need for hand-crafted annotation of cognates. We performed experiments on different published cognate detection datasets across language families and observed not only significant improvement over the state-of-the-art but also our method outperformed the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Our model can be extended to a wide range of languages from any language family as it overcomes the requirement of the annotation of the cognate pairs for training.},

 abstract = {Variations in writing styles are commonly used to
adapt the content to a specific context, audience, or
purpose. However, applying stylistic variations is
still by and large a manual process, and there have
been little efforts towards automating it. In this
paper we explore automated methods to transform text
from modern English to Shakespearean English using an
end to end trainable neural model with pointers to
enable copy action. To tackle limited amount of
parallel data, we pre-train embeddings of words by
leveraging external dictionaries mapping
Shakespearean words to modern English words as well
as additional text. Our methods are able to get a
BLEU score of 31+, an improvement of
{\mbox{$\approx$}} 6 points above the strongest
baseline. We publicly release our code to foster
further research in this area.},

@article{liu2024adaptive,
 abstractnote = {Recently, arbitrary text style transfer (TST) has made significant progress with the paradigm of prompt learning. In this paradigm, researchers often design or search for a fixed prompt for any input. However, existing evidence shows that large language models (LLMs) are prompt-sensitive and it is sub-optimal to apply the same prompt to any input for downstream TST tasks. Besides, the prompts obtained by searching are often unreadable and unexplainable to humans. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Prompt Routing (APR) framework to adaptively route prompts from a human-readable prompt set for various input texts and given styles. Specifically, we first construct a candidate prompt set of diverse and human-readable prompts for the target style. This set consists of several seed prompts and their variants paraphrased by an LLM. Subsequently, we train a prompt routing model to select the optimal prompts efficiently according to inputs. The adaptively selected prompt can guide the LLMs to perform a precise style transfer for each input sentence while maintaining readability for humans. Extensive experiments on 4 public TST benchmarks over 3 popular LLMs (with parameter sizes ranging from 1.5B to 175B) demonstrate that our APR achieves superior style transfer performances, compared to the state-of-the-art prompt-based and fine-tuning methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/DwyaneLQY/APR},

 abstract = {This paper focuses on text detoxification, i.e., automatically converting toxic text into nontoxic text. This task contributes to safer and more respectful online communication and can be considered a Text Style Transfer (TST) task, where the text{'}s style changes while its content is preserved. We present three approaches: (i) knowledge transfer from a similar task (ii) multi-task learning approach, combining sequence-to-sequence modeling with various toxicity classification tasks, and (iii) delete and reconstruct approach. To support our research, we utilize a dataset provided by Dementieva et al. (2021), which contains multiple versions of detoxified texts corresponding to toxic texts. In our experiments, we selected the best variants through expert human annotators, creating a dataset where each toxic sentence is paired with a single, appropriate detoxified version. Additionally, we introduced a small Hindi parallel dataset, aligning with a part of the English dataset, suitable for evaluation purposes. Our results demonstrate that our approach effectively balances text detoxification while preserving the actual content and maintaining fluency.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the first publicly available
treebank of Odia, a morphologically rich low resource
Indian language. The treebank contains approx. 1082
tokens (100 sentences) in Odia were selected from
{`}Samantar{''}, the largest available parallel
corpora collection for Indic languages. All the
selected sentences are manually annotated following
the {`}Universal Dependency{''} guidelines. The
morphological analysis of the Odia treebank was
performed using machine learning techniques. The Odia
annotated treebank will enrich the Odia language
resource and will help in building language
technology tools for cross-lingual learning and
typological research. We also build a preliminary
Odia parser using a machine learning approach. The
accuracy of the parser is 86.6{\%} Tokenization,
64.1{\%} UPOS, 63.78{\%} XPOS, 42.04{\%} UAS and
21.34{\%} LAS. Finally, the paper briefly discusses
the linguistic analysis of the Odia UD treebank.},

 abstract = {While massively multilingual speech models like wav2vec 2.0 XLSR-128 can be directly fine-tuned for automatic speech recognition (ASR), downstream performance can still be relatively poor on languages that are under-represented in the pre-training data. Continued pre-training on 70{--}200 hours of untranscribed speech in these languages can help {---} but what about languages without that much recorded data? For such cases, we show that supplementing the target language with data from a similar, higher-resource {}donor{'} language can help. For example, continued pretraining on only 10 hours of low-resource Punjabi supplemented with 60 hours of donor Hindi is almost as good as continued pretraining on 70 hours of Punjabi. By contrast, sourcing supplemental data from less similar donors like Bengali does not improve ASR performance. To inform donor language selection, we propose a novel similarity metric based on the sequence distribution of induced acoustic units: the Acoustic Token Distribution Similarity (ATDS). Across a set of typologically different target languages (Punjabi, Galician, Iban, Setswana), we show that the ATDS between the target language and its candidate donors precisely predicts target language ASR performance.},
