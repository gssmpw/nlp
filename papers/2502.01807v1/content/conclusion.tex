\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we introduced \ourAlg~, a decentralized Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) algorithm. The decentralized approach to VNE offers superior scalability, robustness, and security in comparison to prior algorithms.
%
We benchmarked our algorithm against existing heuristic and preprocessing algorithms, demonstrating that our method maintains strong performance despite its fully decentralized nature.
