\section{Introduction}
Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a crucial aspect of network virtualization technology. It involves the on-demand embedding of Virtual Network Requests (VNRs) within Physical Networks (PNs) by mapping virtual nodes and links with specific resource requirements onto physical servers and paths with finite capacities.

This process is essential in providing the necessary flexibility and isolation required for deploying various network applications in a shared infrastructure. 


The embedding strategy affects resource utilization, subsequently impacting the revenue and cost of the operational network. Given the NP-hard characteristic of the problem~\cite{vne_nphard}, the development of efficient embedding algorithms has been a central focus of comprehensive research~\cite{survey_1}.

However, a significant portion of existing studies face limitations regarding scalability and robustness. Most of them are centralized solutions, which encounter difficulties in scaling as the number of Virtual Network Requests (VNRs) increases. These solutions are also vulnerable to the failure of nodes responsible for the embedding process, restricting their practical use in modern, time-sensitive environments with growth demands.

A potential solution to these challenges involves the use of a decentralized network embedding algorithm, which could improve the scalability and robustness of existing solutions.


In this work, we employ a distributed algorithm, ring leader election in particular, to formulate a decentralized Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) algorithm.  This algorithm doesn't depend on a central node, instead utilizing multiple physical servers to embed virtual networks (VN) efficiently. Users can submit their VN to any physical server in the network for embedding. Each server will then run a basic breadth-first search (BFS)-like algorithm for local embedding. Subsequently, the server sends the Virtual Network Request (VNR) to other geo-distributed servers to conduct their local embedding algorithm. Ultimately, the embedding with the lowest cost and highest revenue is selected as the final embedding through a straightforward leader election algorithm.


To the best of our knowledge, \ourAlg~ is the first fully decentralized Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) algorithm documented in the literature.
