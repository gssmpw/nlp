In this study, we proposed E2fNet, a simple yet effective model for EEG-to-fMRI generation. 
E2fNet effectively captures meaningful EEG features and consistently demonstrates strong performance across multiple datasets. 
While further studies are necessary to fully validate the practical utility of the generated fMRI data, we believe that our approach holds promising potential for cost-effective applications in the field of neuroimaging.
