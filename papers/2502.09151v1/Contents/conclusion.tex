Our mathematical proofs (Section~\ref{Sec:main}) and empirical illustrations (Section~\ref{sec:sim}) demonstrate that regularization can reduce the computational complexity of diffusion models considerably. 
Broadly speaking,
regularization replaces the dependence on the input dimension by a dependence on a much smaller intrinsic dimension.
But our findings might just be the beginning: we believe that types of regularization beyond the sparsity-inducing $\ell_1$-regularization applied here, such as total variation, could lead to further improvements.
