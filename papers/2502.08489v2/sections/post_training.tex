This section explores various post-training stages, showing that model-user interactions can be significantly enhanced through targeted fine-tuning. It is important to note that, other than instruction-based fine-tuning, no additional steps were taken for model alignment. This means that none of the released checkpoints has undergone any sort of preference optimization, which would undoubtedly improve the overall performance.  Although the team is currently focusing efforts on such methods, none of the preliminary experiments are covered in this report and will only be addressed in future releases.
