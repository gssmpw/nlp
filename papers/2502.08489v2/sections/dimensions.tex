The Salamandra family comes in three different sizes, each of them designed for different use cases. The smallest variant is light enough to run on commodity hardware, at the cost of lower performance. The intermediate size can be easily deployed on modern accelerators, offering a high performance at an affordable cost. Finally, the largest model in the family delivers superior performance but requires multiple GPUs for operation. All details regarding model dimensions are summarized in Table \ref{tab:model_dimensions}.
