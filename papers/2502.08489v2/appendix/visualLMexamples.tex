This section includes several cherry-picked interactions with the multimodal version of Salamandra 7B, which is prompted either in English, Spanish or Catalan.

    \caption{Captioning example in Spanish. Salamandra is asked to provide a detailed description of a painting that depicts a poker game between dogs. The model's response is very complete and describes the scene in great detail, although it includes a few inaccuracies such as the number of dogs (i.e. six instead of seven) and the type of drinking vessels (i.e. mugs instead of glasses). It also fails to identify some high-level subtleties, like the fact that the Bulldog is cheating, which is quite hard to perceive even for a human observer.}

    \caption{Grounding example in Spanish. Salamandra provides a numbered list to describe the colors and relative positions of each vehicle shown in the image. It misses the yellow car and misidentifies the blue train as a bus, but the overall response is quite satisfactory.}
