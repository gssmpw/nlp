\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we address the IM problem under the assumption of unknown diffusion model parameters.
We analyze the feasibility and benefit of hyperbolic space for the IM task, which motivates us to explore the geometric property of hyperbolic space to model hidden hierarchical structures in social networks and influence propagation instances. 
Specifically, we propose a new diffusion model agonistic method, HIM, for the IM problem. HIM encodes influence spread patterns from the social network structure and influences activations into hyperbolic user representations.
Leveraging the hierarchical properties of hyperbolic space, we can effectively identify high-influence nodes based on the distance of learned representations.
The distance to the origin and the distances between representations can be used to balance effective and efficient seed node selection for IM.
Extensive experiments show that when the diffusion parameters are unknown, our method consistently outperforms all baselines on four normal-size networks, achieving maximal influence spread across different propagation modes.
Meanwhile, compared to other representation learning-based methods, our method demonstrates superior scalability, as it can efficiently scale to social networks over millions of nodes.
