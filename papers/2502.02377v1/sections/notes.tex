% propose BF GDA/SGDA
% introduce adaptive regret notion and non-degenerative populations
%%% theoretical results
% convergence of GDA/SGDA in our setting for exponential policies
% hypotethis that it should work still by clipping the policy side ( then experiments), then argue that it can help for convergence of NN policies (talk about L0-L1 smoothness and past results on that matter, theoretical results left for future work on GDA/SGDA)
% 
%%% experiments
% repeated prisonner's dilemma as a first example to show results on GDA, (with specific or full set of deterministic policies??)
% Show clipping effect (works on higher lr)
% boxplots, learned distributions, learning curve on worst-case regret ?

% more advanced experiments on random POMDPS (provide figure for the env ?)
% show empirically that it still works. clipping as well ?

% final set of experiments on complex environments with NN policies.
