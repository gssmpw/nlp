\paragraph{Limitations}
[When using utility, if for some scenario, the maximum utility was reached, but its utility is still lower the other scenarios, then we are stuck learning forever on the same scenario, while there is possibly some possible improvements on other scenarios without degrading the performance on this scenario.]

[With utility, the adaptive distribution may set the probability of hardest scenarios (scenarios where it is difficult to learn) to the highest in early stages of learning, which is quite the contrary to what you typicially do in curriculum learning.]

[Only experiment with two players]
[Need tests on other domains]
