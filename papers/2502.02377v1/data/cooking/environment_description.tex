%\paragraph{The Collaborative Cooking (Overcooked) Environment \cite{carroll_utility_learning_about_2019, strouse_collaboration_with_humans_2021, leibo_scalable_evaluation_multi_2021,agapiou_melting_pot_2_2023}.} In this game, players act as chefs in a gridworld kitchen, working together to deliver as many tomato soup dishes as possible within a set time. To do so, they have to collect tomatoes, cook them, prepare dishes, and deliver the soup. Successful deliveries reward both players equally. Players must navigate the kitchen, interact with objects in the right order, and coordinate with each other. Each player has an egocentric, partial RGB view of the environment. We evaluate approaches on two different kitchen layouts: circuit and cramped \cite{agapiou_melting_pot_2_2023}.
