The preordering problem \eqref{eq:objective}--\eqref{eq:triangle} is stated as an integer linear program (ILP).
In order to solve ILPs for NP-hard problem an understanding of the polyhedral geometry of its feasible solutions is essential.
The convex hull of all feasible solutions to the preordering problem is called the \emph{preorder polytope}.
Polytopes of several closely related problems have been studied extensively as discussed in \Cref{sec:related-work}.
In \citet{muller1996partial} the class of \emph{odd closed walk inequalities} has been introduced for the partial order polytope.
We adapt them to the preorder polytope as follows.

\begin{definition}
    Let $k \geq 3$ odd and let $v: \mathbb{Z}_k \to V$.
    The \emph{odd closed walk inequality} with respect to $v$ is defined as
    \begin{align}\label{eq:odd-closed-walk}
        \sum_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_k} \left( x_{v_iv_{i+1}} - x_{v_iv_{i+2}} \right) \leq \frac{k-1}{2}
    \end{align}
    where the additions $i+1$ and $i+2$ are modulo $k$.
\end{definition}

\citet{muller1996partial} proves validity of the odd closed walk inequalities for the partial order polytope by showing that they are  obtained by adding some triangle inequalities \eqref{eq:triangle} and box inequalities $0 \leq x_{ij}$ for some $ij \in V_2$ and rounding down the right hand side.
As these inequalities are also valid for the preorder polytope, this immediately implies that the odd closed walk inequalities are also valid for the preorder polytope.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:inherited-facets}
    Every inequality that induces a facet of the partial order polytope and is valid for the preorder polytope also induces a facet of the preorder polytope.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    As every partial order is a preorder, the partial order polytope is contained in the preorder polytope.
    Therefore, for any inequality that is valid for both polytopes the dimension of the induced face of the preorder polytope is greater or equal to the dimension of the induced face of the partial order polytope.
    Since the partial order polytope is full dimensional \citep[Theorem 3.1]{muller1996partial}, so is the preorder polytope, and, in particular, they have the same dimension.
    Together, any inequality that induces a facet of the partial order polytope, i.e., a face of co-dimension 1, and is valid for the preorder polytope, induces a face of the preorder polytope of co-dimension at most 1, and, therefore, defines a facet.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $k \geq 3$ odd and let $v: \mathbb{Z}_k \to V$ injective (i.e., $v$ defines a simple cycle).
    Then the odd closed walk inequality \eqref{eq:odd-closed-walk} defines a facet of the preorder polytope.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    \citet{muller1996partial} shows that if the odd closed walk is a cycle (i.e. every node is visited at most once) then the corresponding odd closed walk inequality defines a facet of the partial order polytope \citep[Theorem 4.2]{muller1996partial}.
    Together with \Cref{lem:inherited-facets} the theorem follows.
\end{proof}
