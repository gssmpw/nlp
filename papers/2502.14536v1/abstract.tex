We discuss the preordering problem, a joint relaxation of the correlation clustering problem and the partial ordering problem. 
We show that preordering remains \textsc{NP}-hard even for values in $\{-1,0,1\}$.
We introduce a linear-time $4$-approximation algorithm and a local search technique.
For an integer linear program formulation, we establish a class of non-canonical facets of the associated preorder polytope.
By solving a non-canonical linear program relaxation, we obtain non-trivial upper bounds on the objective value.
We provide implementations\footnotemark[2] of the algorithms we define, apply these to published social networks and compare the output and efficiency qualitatively and quantitatively.
