(b) Overview of our \textit{Self-Rationalization} model. The decoder can 1) output \textit{corrections} from the model's token vocabulary, 2) extract \textit{evidence words} as source indexes by leveraging the pointer mechanism, and 3) predict an \textit{error type} from the predefined set of error type classes. ``<s>'' and ``</s>'' are start-of-sentence and end-of-sentence tokens. Although we show the case in a Seq2Seq model, other generative models like Llama3 can work similarly.}
