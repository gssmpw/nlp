abstract = {Learning how to automatically solve optimization problems has the potential to provide the next big leap in optimization technology. The performance of automatically learned heuristics on routing problems has been steadily improving in recent years, but approaches based purely on machine learning are still outperformed by state-of-the-art optimization methods. To close this performance gap, we propose a novel large neighborhood search (LNS) framework for vehicle routing that integrates learned heuristics for generating new solutions. The learning mechanism is based on a deep neural network with an attention mechanism and has been especially designed to be integrated into an LNS search setting. We evaluate our approach on the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), the split delivery vehicle routing problem (SDVRP), and the capacitated team orienteering problem (CTOP). We show that the NLNS approach is able to outperform a handcrafted LNS on the CVRP and SDVRP and match the performance of a standard LNS on the CTOP. NLNS is thus able to quickly and effectively learn high performance heuristics to maneuver through the search space of difficult routing problems, coming close to the performance of state-of-the-art optimization approaches.}

abstract = {The combinatorial optimization (CO) problems on the graph are the core and classic problems in artificial intelligence (AI) and operations research (OR). For example, the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) are fascinating NP-hard problems and have important significance for the existing transportation system. Traditional methods such as heuristics methods, exact algorithms, and solution solvers can already find approximate solutions on small-scale graphs. However, they are helpless for large-scale graphs and other problems with similar structures. Moreover, traditional methods often require artificially designed heuristic functions to aid decision-making. In recent years, more and more work has focused on applying deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL) to learn heuristics, which allows us to learn the internal structure of the graph end-to-end and find the optimal path under the guidance of heuristic rules. However, most of these still need manual assistance, and the RL method used has the problems of low sampling efficiency and small searchable space. This paper proposes a novel framework (called OmegaZero) based on Alphago Zero, which does not prescribe expert experience or label data but is trained through self-play. We divide the learning into two stages: in the first stage, we employ graph attention network (GAT) and GRU to learn node representations and memory history trajectories. In the second stage, we employ Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and deep RL to search for the solution space and train the model.}

title = "Policy-Based Self-Competition for Planning Problems",
abstract = "AlphaZero-type algorithms may stop improving on single-player tasks in case the value network guiding the tree search is unable to approximate the outcome of an episode sufficiently well. One technique to address this problem is transforming the single-player task through self-competition. The main idea is to compute a scalar baseline from the agent{\textquoteright}s historical performances and to reshape an episode{\textquoteright}s reward into a binary output, indicating whether the baseline has been exceeded or not. However, this baseline only carries limited information for the agent about strategies how to improve. We leverage the idea of self-competition and directly incorporate a historical policy into the planning process instead of its scalar performance. Based on the recently introduced Gumbel AlphaZero (GAZ), we propose our algorithm GAZ {\textquoteleft}Play-to-Plan{\textquoteright} (GAZ PTP), in which the agent learns to find strong trajectories by planning against possible strategies of its past self. We show the effectiveness of our approach in two well-known combinatorial optimization problems, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem. With only half of the simulation budget for search, GAZ PTP consistently outperforms all selected single-player variants of GAZ.",

Because of the limited battery capacity, electric vehicles are required to visit recharging stations en-route. Therefore, the routing schemes of conventional vehicles may not be suitable as the routing schemes of electric vehicles. In this paper, the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP) is introduced, and the corresponding mathematical model is formulated. The EVRP seeks to minimize the energy consumption of electric vehicles. The comprehensive calculation of energy consumption used by electric vehicles is provided in the EVRP model. An ant colony (AC) algorithm based meta-heuristics is proposed as the solution method of the EVRP. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is evaluated through extensive numerical experiments on the newly generated instances. We also illustrate the benefits of using an energy consumption-minimizing objective function rather than a distance-minimizing objective function for routing electric vehicles.}

Contrary to existing routing models for ECVs, which assume energy consumption to be a linear function of traveled distance, we utilize a realistic energy consumption model that incorporates speed, gradient and cargo load distribution. This is highly relevant in the context of ECVs because energy consumption determines the maximal driving range of ECVs and the recharging times at stations. To address the problem, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm that is enhanced by a local search for intensification. In numerical studies on newly designed E-VRPTWMF test instances, we investigate the effect of considering the actual load distribution on the structure and quality of the generated solutions. Moreover, we study the influence of different objective functions on solution attributes and on the contribution of ECVs to the overall routing costs. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the developed algorithm on benchmark instances of the related problems VRPTW and E-VRPTW.}

abstract = {Encouraged by international efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and local emissions, many public transport operators are converting their fleets to battery-powered electric buses. Public transport operators can choose between different electric bus concepts, with the total cost of ownership being the most important decision criterion. The associated strategic decisions regarding charging strategy, vehicle concept, and charging infrastructure have a significant impact on the operational planning of the electric buses. Motivated by this, this paper aims to analyze the interactions between electrification and operational planning, especially vehicle scheduling and crew scheduling. This allows us to make a more comprehensive comparison of different electrification concepts. Prior work has addressed the impact of electrification on vehicle scheduling but has neglected the interactions with crew scheduling. Crew scheduling dominates operational costs and planning for many public transport operators and must therefore be considered in all strategic decisions. For this reason, in this work we focused on integrated electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem. This allows us to calculate the total cost of ownership of different electric bus concepts under better representation of local conditions. We deal with the electric vehicle and crew scheduling problem with a metaheuristic based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search. We tested the developed methodology for a real-world bus route. Our results indicate that the constraints for crew scheduling significantly impact the total cost of ownership and the required number of vehicles of the different electrification concepts. Our case study suggests that the choice of the most cost-effective concept depends significantly on crew scheduling constraints. These findings imply that crew scheduling constraints should be considered as part of the local framework for bus fleet electrification.}

However, environmental sustainability is far wider than carbon emissions and climate change. This review aims to highlight the importance of considering air pollutants in optimisation studies and evaluate the limitation of the current assessments for air emissions, particularly in relation to transportation. The source of air pollutants is firstly overviewed with special attention on non-stationary sources, freight and sea transportation. The type of measurement to obtain the emission data and the available optimisation models on transport mode choice selection were then summarised. The strengths and Weaknesses' have been indicated. The identified gap includes greenhouse gas and air pollutants not being evaluated simultaneously and the interaction between the different pollutants are not being adequately considered. A better assessment framework and impact categories classification are consequently required. The summarised assessment model of transportation mode choice shows that the current viewpoint on low emissions, green or environmental sustainability options refers to carbon dioxide as a part of greenhouse gas. Attention towards a better emission assessment and management has been supported in this study through critical discussion. The next step of this work is to develop a methodology to measure greenhouse gas and air pollutants simultaneously by considering the synergistic effect and the discussed limitation. It is important for minimising the potential of footprint shifting and poor decision-making.}

The results shows that: (1) Overall, high-speed railways have a significant reducing effect on carbon emissions, while highways and urban rail have the opposite effect. (2) Considering spatial spillover effects, highways and high-speed railways can promote carbon emissions reduction in neighboring areas, while urban rail has the opposite effect. (3) For scale heterogeneity, urban rail can reduce carbon emissions in mega-cities, while highways and high-speed railways have the opposite effect. For regional heterogeneity, all three types of transport infrastructure can reduce carbon emissions in western cities, but increase urban carbon emissions in eastern and central regions. (4) Industrial upgrading, technological progress, and population agglomeration are all pathways through which transport infrastructure indirectly affects carbon emissions, but their effects vary for different transport infrastructure.}

abstract = {This paper presents an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach aimed at efficiently determining energy-optimal routes for a group of electric logistic vehicles, with the objective of minimizing operating costs. First, an Energy-Minimization Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EM-EVRP) is formulated with an energy consumption model for electric vehicles, rather than Distance Minimization EVRP commonly favored in the literature. The energy consumption model incorporates several factors such as vehicle dynamics, road information, and charging losses. Then, the problem is reformulated based on the Markov decision process and solved using the transformer-based DRL method. The policy network is designed following the Transformer structure, including an encoder, a feature embedding module, and a decoder, where the feature embedding module is added to provide contextual information. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superior of the proposed DRL method over existing learning-based methods and conventional methods, in solving both EM-EVRP and DM-EVRP. Notably, the formulated EM-EVRP achieves greater cost reduction than the traditional DM-EVRP.}

abstract = {New energy vehicles are accelerating to substitute for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and fossil oil. Although most literature acknowledges this trend, few compare two specific substitutable paths in terms of the operation system, namely electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). This paper makes a comparative analysis of EVs and HFCVs in power sources, fuel storage and transportation, fuel supply infrastructure construction, and the cost and use of vehicles. Our findings indicate that electric passenger vehicles have more advantages in economy, safety, and environmental impact, in comparison with hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicles. Nevertheless, great efforts should still be made to develop advanced rapid charging technology, shorten charging time, and accelerate charging infrastructure construction. Then, it is just around the corner for EVs to gradually take over from traditional motor vehicles driven by oil. In contrast, popularizing hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicles faces several insurmountable obstacles in the short run, such as the high hydrogen production price, complicated storage process, and expensive hydrogen refueling station infrastructure. However, hydrogen fuel cell commercial vehicles have unique application scenarios. The dislocation and complementarity principle in different scenarios of EVs and HFCVs is supposed to be firmly grasped.}

abstract = {The digital economy and digital technology are promoting the integrated development of industry and digital, forming a new path for industrial upgrading and building a new development pattern.In today's context of digital economy and green transformation, it is a challenging optimization problem to scientifically plan the logistics routes of electric vehicles (EVs) when taking charging strategies into consideration. Aiming at the drawback of supposing a fixed charging rate in the traditional EV routing problems (EVRPs), the charging data of a type of mainstream EVs were collected and the instantaneous charging power was simulated in the real scenario. To solve problems of the fixed charge timing and charged energy in traditional EVRP models and partial charging strategies, a new EVRP model considering the flexible charging strategy (EVRP-FCS) by taking the charged energy as one of the decision variables. To effectively solve the model and fully search in the solution space, an improved evolutionary algorithm was proposed. The performance advantages of the algorithm are determined by comparison of 22 groups of large-scale experimental examples. The experimental results have demonstrated the performance advantages of the algorithm.}

abstract = {Electric Vehicle (EV)-based parcel delivery is getting much more popular these days due to EVs being eco-friendly and sustainable. One well-known problem in the literature to study last-mile delivery via EVs is the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP). One limitation of EVRP is that it assumes all customers must be visited directly by EVs. This forces companies to purchase or utilize additional EVs, increasing operational costs for EV utilization and routing. To overcome this limitation, the present work introduces the Prize-collecting EVRP with Time Windows (PC-EVRP-TW), utilizing multiple EVs for the home-delivery service of high-priority customers (customers with high loyalty or premium memberships), leaving the rest for the next day or outsourcing to a third-party shipper. It also ensures a minimum number of served demands to maintain service quality. PC-EVRP-TW is modeled by mixed-integer linear programming and solved by a problem-specific hybrid metaheuristic aiming to minimize EVs’ route and usage cost and maximize collected profits (prizes) while satisfying EVs’ load and battery capacity, task completion, and time window constraints. Analyses were performed on the optimal solution of PC-EVRP-TW. The results show that the company could achieve significant route cost savings, up to 22% compared to EVRP-TW. Additionally, remarkable reductions in EV usage costs, 6%, 16%, and 18%, were observed for various-size instances of PC-EVRP-TW. These findings highlight the potential for practitioners and managers to realize substantial cost savings and optimize EV usage by selectively serving a prioritized subset of customers daily, particularly when facing high utilization costs and the inability to serve all customers directly.}
