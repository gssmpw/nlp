\textbf{a})
%
Loss a 4-layer encoder-only model with (dark blue) and without (light blue) symmetric initialization, respectively.
%
Models are trained on the Red Pajama dataset \citep{together2023redpajama}.
%
\textbf{b})
%
Median symmetry score during training
%
Color code is as in panel \textbf{a}.
%
\textbf{c})
%
Same as in panel \textbf{a} for each layer in the model with and without symmetric initialization. 
%
Each layer is color-coded as in the illustration on the left.
%
All plots show the median and the interquartile range across the heads of a given layer.
