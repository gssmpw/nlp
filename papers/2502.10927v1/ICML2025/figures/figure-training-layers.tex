\textbf{a})
%
Evolution of symmetry score during training.
%
Shown are the median and the interquartile range.
%
Models were trained on the Wikipedia dataset \citep{wikidump}.
%
Encoder-only and decoder-only models are color-coded in blue and purple, respectively (see legend).
%
\textbf{b})
%
Same as in panel \textbf{a}
for the median directionality score.
%
\textbf{c})
%
Evolution of the median symmetry score across layers of the encoder-only (left) and decoder-only (right) models.
%
Each layer is color-coded as shown on the legend.
%
\textbf{d})
%
Same as panel $\textbf{c}$ for the median directionality score.
