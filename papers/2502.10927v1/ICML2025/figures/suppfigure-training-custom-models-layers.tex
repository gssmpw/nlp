Evolution of the median symmetry score across layers of the encoder-only (left) and decoder-only (right) models.
%
Each layer is color-coded as shown on the legend of Figure \ref{fig-training-layers}.
%
Shown are the median and the interquartile range.
%
Models were trained on the Jigsaw dataset \citep{jigsaw_challenge}.
%
\textbf{b})
%
Same as in panel \textbf{a} for the median directionality score.
%
\textbf{c})
%
Same as in panel \textbf{a} for models trained on the Red Pajama dataset \citep{together2023redpajama}.
%
\textbf{d})
%
Same as panel $\textbf{c}$ for the median directionality score.
