\begin{proposition}
\label{prop-directionality-score}
%
The symmetry score $d$ provides a quantitative measure of the degree of directional bias in a given square matrix $\bm{M}$. \\
%
1) The directionality score $d$ is a scalar value that lies within the range  $[-1, 1]$. \\
%
2) For any given $\gamma > 0$, a directionality score $d = \pm 1$ indicates that vectors satisfying the condition defined by $\gamma$
are exclusively present in the rows or the column distribution, respectively. 
\\
3) The directionality score of a random matrix $\bm{M} \in \mathbb{M}_n$ with entries $\bm{M}_{ij} \sim p(0,\sigma)$ from a probability distribution with zero mean and a variance that scales as $O(n^{-1}) $ tends to zero in the limit $n\rightarrow\infty$.
