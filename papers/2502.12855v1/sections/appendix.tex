\section{Arithmetic in Reasoning Context}
\label{app:gsm8k_arith_details}
We evaluate the frequency of numerical computation errors made by models within a reasoning context. For this evaluation, we use the \gsm{} test set and identify arithmetic computations based on the provided calculation annotations (enclosed within \texttt{<<>>}). Given a question and its solution up to an annotation, models are prompted to generate the next few tokens. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:gsm_arith_examples}, each model generates five tokens per input. We extract the numerical values at the beginning of the generated text and compare them to the expected output to measure accuracy.

\section{Prompt for Math Word Problems}
\label{app:math_prompt}
We use four exemplars from the prompt from \citet{wei2022chain} to evaluate the models on math word problem datasets except AQuA. The prompt is shown in Listing~\ref{fig:mwp_prompt}. The prompt for AQuA is shown in Listing~\ref{fig:aqua_prompt}.

\section{MAWPS Detailed Results}
\label{app:mawps_detailed_results}
Table~\ref{tab:mawps_detailed_results} shows the accuracy (\%) achieved by the instruction-tuned models on different datasets within MAWPS.

\section{Robustness with Greedy Decoding}
\label{app:robustness_greedy}
We also evaluate the robustness of post-trained models with greedy decoding. Our results show that the model fine-tuned on the \tulu{} mixture and the arithmetic dataset is more robust to numerical changes than the model fine-tuned only on the \tulu{} mixture. The results on GSM-Plus and GSM-Symbolic are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:gsm_plus_accuracy_greedy} and Table~\ref{tab:gsm_symbolic_results_greedy}, respectively.
