We present RiskHarvester, a risk-based tool to compute a security risk score based on the value of the asset and ease of attack on a database. We calculated the value of asset by identifying the sensitive data categories present in a database from the database keywords. We utilized data flow analysis, SQL, and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) parsing to identify the database keywords. To calculate the ease of attack, we utilized passive network analysis to retrieve the database host information. To evaluate RiskHarvester, we curated RiskBench, a benchmark of 1,791 database secret-asset pairs with sensitive data categories and host information manually retrieved from 188 GitHub repositories. RiskHarvester demonstrates precision of (95\%) and recall (90\%) in detecting database keywords for the value of asset and precision of (96\%) and recall (94\%) in detecting valid hosts for ease of attack. Finally, we conducted an online survey to understand whether developers prioritize secret removal based on security risk score. We found that 86\% of the developers prioritized the secrets for removal with descending security risk scores.
