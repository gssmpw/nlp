In our study, we followed the USENIX Ethics Guidelines~\cite{ethics-guideline}. Since RiskBench contains sensitive information, the dataset will be selectively shared with researchers and tool developers under a data protection agreement to ensure ethical use. Additionally, we obtained IRB approval from our institution (Uni IRB blinded) before conducting the survey. No personally identifiable information was collected from participants apart from the email addresses of the participants who wished to participate in the lottery. Additionally, a consent form was included in the email stating that participants should not attempt to use the secret-asset pairs to verify their validity. We have also stated in the consent form that participation was voluntary and participants could withdraw at any time.
