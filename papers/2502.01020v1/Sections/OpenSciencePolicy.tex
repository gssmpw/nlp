Our curated dataset, RiskBench, is stored in Google BigQuery (Dataset ID: \textit{\seqsplit{dev-range-411201.riskbench}}) as a relational structured data. Researchers and tool developers can utilize and extend the dataset for future research using SQL queries in Google BigQuery. Additionally, we have made the implementation of RiskHarvester publicly available~\cite{riskartifacts}.
