\section{Conclusion}

We present Classroom Simulacra, a contextual student generative agent environment powered by large language models for learning behavioral simulation in online education. Such student agent mimics real students' past learning histories and takes actions in new course materials and test questions. This student agent environment is powered by our new fine-grained datasets and a powerful transferable iterative reflection module to augment the simulation performance. A series of experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our student simulation. With the increasing importance of AI-based education and intelligent tutoring systems, we believe that our work can serve as the important groundwork to support diverse applications in educational context.
