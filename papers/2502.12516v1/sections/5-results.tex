% \subsection{Frame Identification}
% Previous work~\cite{devasier-etal-2024-robust} explored the possibility of filtering candidate targets produced by matching potential lexical units using a frame identification model. To build upon this idea towards a single-step frame-semantic parsing method, we explore the potential of frame elements being used to filter out candidate targets. In this approach, no ground-truth frame inputs are given. This also removes the bias from the model assuming the input always has at least one frame element.

% We represent the LLM instructions using the JSON-exist representation as it performed the best in Table~\ref{tab:representation_performance}. We used Phi-4 for this experiment as it had a very high performance-to-size ratio, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:candidate_frame}. \todo{should run this on qwen-72b} We found that directly using the model performed poorly, likely due to bias in the model learning that each input contains the given frame. To address this, we fine-tuned the LLM using candidates from the training set and found a significant improvement in performance. \todo{add candidates examples}

% Performance on par with CoFFTEA, the previous-best frame identification system.
% Maybe qwen 72b will perform better.
