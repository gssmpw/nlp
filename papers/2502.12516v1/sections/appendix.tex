% We provide full details for the data saturation analysis in Table~\ref{tab:saturation}

\section{Reproducibility}
\label{app:reproducibility}
To fine-tune the models in this work, we used three different systems. For the small models, (0.5-7B parameters) we experimented with training and evaluating on a system with 1x Nvidia RTX 4070 and another system with 1x Nvidia A100 40GB. For medium-sized models (14-32B parameters), we only experimented with the system with 1x Nvidia A100 40GB. For large models (70B+ parameters), we used a third system with 1x Nvidia H100 80GB. 

Github Copilot was used in the creation of some of our code.

\section{YAGS Quality Assessment}
\label{app:yags-bad}
\input{tables/yags-bad-annos}
We found several labels which we disagree with among a small random sample of Phi-4's predictions compared with the original annotations. We show these examples in Table~\ref{tab:yags-bad-annotations}.
