Your task is to analyze the given sentence and identify all the frame elements associated with the Abandonment frame. A frame in linguistics is a schematic representation of a situation involving various participants, props, and other conceptual roles, known as frame elements. The Abandonment frame involves an Agent who leaves behind a Theme, effectively rendering it no longer within their control or normal security as their property.

Below are some details regarding the Abandonment frame:

1. **Frame Definition**: An Agent leaves behind a Theme, effectively rendering it no longer within their control or of the normal security as one's property.

2. **Frame Elements**:
    - **Agent (Core)**: The person who acts to leave behind the Theme.
    - **Theme (Core)**: The entity that is relinquished to no one from the Agent's possession.
    - **Place (Peripheral)**: The location where the Agent gives up the Theme.
    - **Time (Peripheral)**: When the Agent gives up the Theme.
    - **Manner (Peripheral)**: The style in which the Agent gives up the Theme.
    - **Duration (Peripheral)**: For what expanse of time the Agent has given up the Theme.
    - **Explanation (Extra-Thematic)**: A proposition from which the act of abandonment logically follows.
    - **Depictive (Extra-Thematic)**: Describes the Agent during the abandoning event.
    - **Degree (Peripheral)**: The extent to which the Agent leaves the Theme behind.
    - **Means (Peripheral)**: An action performed by the Agent that accomplishes the action.
    - **Purpose (Peripheral)**: The purpose for which the Agent abandons the Theme.
    - **Event_description (Extra-Thematic)**: A description of the event as a whole.

3. **Examples**:
    - "Carolyn abandoned her car and jumped on a red double decker bus." 
      - Frame Elements: {"Agent": "Carolyn", "Theme": "her car"}
    - "Jamie Hill, prosecuting, said Stevenson and a friend took a Nova car from North Skelton and abandoned it in Nottingham."
      - Frame Elements: {"Agent": "Stevenson and a friend", "Theme": "it", "Place": "in Nottingham"}

Using this information, identify the relevant frame elements in the following input sentence. Your response should be structured in JSON format with frame elements as keys and the specific text references from the sentence as values. Ensure every frame element is present as a key, with an empty string if not applicable.

Input Sentence: {input_sentence}

Output the frame elements in JSON format, exemplified as:
```

    "Agent": "text",
    "Theme": "text",
    "Place": "text",

To identify all the frame elements associated with the "Adducing" frame in a given sentence, follow the steps below. Frame semantics is a theory that describes the understanding of a word's meaning based on the conceptual frame it evokes. Each frame involves various participants and conceptual roles known as frame elements.

**Frame: Adducing**
- **Definition**: A Speaker mentions a Specified_entity filling a Role, thereby providing information which supports a point of the Speaker.

**Core Frame Elements:**
- **Speaker**: The person who specifies the Role to be filled by the Specified_entity.
- **Specified_entity**: The entity that the Speaker identifies as filling a particular Role.
- **Role**: A slot in a particular event or relation whose filler the Speaker identifies.

**Peripheral Frame Elements:**
- **Addressee**: The person to whom the Speaker identifies the filler of a Role.
- **Manner**: Description of how the act is performed.
- **Means**: The act whereby the Speaker makes a statement.
- **Medium**: The physical entity or channel used by the Speaker to transmit the statement.
- **Time**: The time when the statement is made.
- **Place**: Where the statement takes place.
- **Purpose**: What the Speaker intends to accomplish by adducing the Specified_entity.
- **Explanation**: The reason for which the Speaker comes to the conclusion about the Specified_entity.
- **Containing_event**: The context or event in which the adducing occurs.
- **Event_description**: Descriptions related to the entire clause.
- **Frequency**: How often the event occurs.
- **Circumstances**: The context or conditions under which the adducing takes place.
- **Depictive**: The state or condition of the Speaker during the statement.

**Instructions:**
- Analyze the provided sentence to identify words or phrases that correspond to each of the possible frame elements listed above.
- Provide a json output listing the recognized frame elements and their corresponding text from the sentence.

Here is your input sentence for analysis:

"{input_sentence}"

**Output format example:**

```json
{
    "Specified_entity": "text",
    "Speaker": "text",
    "Role": "text",
    "Manner": "text",
    ...
}
```

Please ensure the json output lists only the elements present in the sentence, leaving absent elements out.
