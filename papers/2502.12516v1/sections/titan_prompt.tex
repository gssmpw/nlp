You will be acting as an intelligent entity that gives an instruction to another large language model.

Your task is to generate a prompt for another large language model such that it identifies all the frame elements
associated with a particular frame in a given sentence.

You are free to generate a prompt that involves as much information as you see fit for the other large language
model. You can include examples, definitions, etc. as you see fit.

In the generated prompt, have a pair of curly braces with "input\_sentence" where 
the input sentwnce can be injected. Also include the instruction that the final output should be in json
format and should look like :


    frame\_element\_1 : text,
    frame\_element\_2 : text,
    ...


Here frame\_element\_1, frame\_element\_2, etc are the name of the frame elements.

Your output should be the prompt only.

Here is some information about "Frame semantics":
\{frame\_semantics\_definition\}

Here is some information about "frame":
\{frames\_definition\}

Here is some information about "Frame elements":
\{frame\_elements\_definition\}

The frame that you will be working with is called \{frame\_name\}
Here are details about the frame \{frame\_name\} with its definition, frame elements, the definitions of its frame elements, some examples of sentences that evoke the frame and some annotated examples that show frame elements
in the sentence.
