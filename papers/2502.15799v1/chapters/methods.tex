In this section we describe the OpenSafetyMini, our proposed dataset, which challenges modern models, encompassing harder responses of higher quality

One of the  previous open-questions benchmarks XSAFETY~\cite{wang2023all} was consisted of two existing benchmarks and translated them into multiple languages. Our preliminary analysis revealed ambiguities in English-language prompts that introduce noise during model evaluation. For instance, certain questions contained vague phrasing or cultural references that permitted multiple valid interpretations.

To address these quality issues, we implemented a  two-stage filtration procedure. First, we aimed to estimate question's \textit{deflection score} - the likelihood (0-100 scale) that the model would refuse to reply based on ethical considerations. 

This approach is reasonable since modern LLM undergoed reinforcement learning alignment are capable of verbalized uncertainty estimation - an ability of modern models to estimate their uncertainty towards respodingin verbally, a property known to well reflect ambiguity~\cite{kadavath2022languagemodelsmostlyknow,ni2024largelanguagemodelshonest}. Therefore, we observe that the model is likely capable of reflecting verbal deflection score.

We employed GPT-4o \cite{hurst2024gpt} with 10 independent evaluations of each prompt to ensure consistency in resulting score~\cite{wang2023selfconsistencyimproveschainthought}. We further removed all questions with average deflection score below 50. The prompt template is reflected in Appendix~\ref{app:deflect_rate}.

Finally, we manually reviewed the remaining ones, filtering the questions of low quality. This process yielded \textbf{OpenSafetyMini} - a refined dataset of 1,067 English prompts.

\section{Experimental Procedure}

In this section, we describe the experimental procedure employed to assess the safety of quantized models and the robustness of LLM-as-a-Judge for safety evaluation. 

% Our methodology consists of the following key components:


\subsection{Models}

To compare the impact of quantization methods on LLMs, we selected LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct~\cite{dubey2024llama}, which has undergone safety alignment using reinforcement learning, and the unaligned Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2~\cite{jiang2023mistral7b} to ensure diversity in our evaluations.
%, both known for their advanced architectures, widespread use in natural language processing tasks and good performance across their size category\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard\#/?official=true&params=7\%2C9&types=chat}} \cite{chiang2024chatbot}, \cite{open-llm-leaderboard-v2}.

We also used an "abliterated" LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct~\cite{arditi2024refusallanguagemodelsmediated} as the least safe model, uncensored by removing "refusal directions".

Other technical details are available in Appendix~\ref{app:technical}.
% To assess the impact of quantization methods on model safety using benchmark metrics, we need to establish the range of these metrics from safest to least safe. We used the original model as the safest baseline and an "abliterated" \cite{arditi2024refusallanguagemodelsmediated} version of Llama-3.1 8B Instruct, which was uncensored by erasing "refusal direction" from the model’s residual stream activations.

\subsection{Quantization Procedures}

We employed four state-of-the-art quantization methods, each representing a distinct quantization technique family and offering optimal quality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AWQ:}~\cite{lin2024awq} This method employs linear quantization with weight scaling, allowing for both 8-bit and 4-bit representations.
    \item \textbf{QUIK:}~\cite{ashkboos2023towards} Similar to AWQ, QUIK uses linear quantization but incorporates non-quantizable salient vectors, also supporting 8-bit and 4-bit formats.
    \item \textbf{AQLM:}~\cite{egiazarian2024extreme} This approach utilizes additive vector quantization, focusing on 4-bit and lower (including 2-bit) precision.
    \item \textbf{QUIP\#:}~\cite{chee2024quip} This method applies vector quantization combined with a Hadamard Transform to smooth the weights, allowing for 4-bit and lower (including 2-bit) precision.
\end{itemize}
    
Details and description of each quantization method can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:methods}.



\subsection{Becnhmarks and Evaluation}
We used \textbf{four} benchmarks combining automated evaluation and human assessment to comprehensively assess the safety and reliability of LLMs and their quantized versions.

For a comprehensive overview of these benchmarks, please refer to Appendix~\ref{app:datasets}.

\subsubsection{Open-Ended Safety}

\textbf{Human evaluation} was conducted by five linguistic experts across four quantization methods . All assessors held bachelor's degrees in linguistics and had prior experience in the safety evaluation of LLM responses. Each expert was compensated at a rate four times the minimum wage. The inter-rater agreement, measured using Krippendorff’s $\alpha$, yielded a score of 0.623.
Each expert evaluated 1,067 samples per model, including both quantized and non-quantized variants, see Table~\ref{tab:safe_human}, resulting in a total of over 20,000 human evaluations, or 4,268 unique labeled question-answer pairs. The presentation order of the models was randomized for each expert. Each model’s response was classified into one of four categories: Unsafe, Safe, Error, or Ambiguous. The latter two categories were introduced because responses that contain errors or are ambiguous cannot be definitively evaluated as safe or unsafe. The descriptions of these categories are provided below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Error}: This category refers to instances where a model produces gibberish or repeats text. In such cases, the response cannot be evaluated as either safe or unsafe and should be disregarded entirely.

    \item \textbf{Ambiguous}: This indicates that human experts were unable to determine whether the response was safe or unsafe.
\end{itemize}

Instructions given to experts provided in Appendix~\ref{app:annotation_instructions}.

\paragraph{LLM-as-a-Judge} 

To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of model response safety, we employed the "LLM-as-a-Judge" approach using Gemma 2 27B~\cite{team2024gemma}. Our results demonstrate a high 92\% agreement with human judgments, validating the reliability of our evaluation procedure.

%We also evaluated this model on the SafetyBench dataset to show that it is fair to use Gemma as a safety evaluator. For results, please see Section~\ref{sec:safetybench_res}.

%The evaluation prompt was selected to match the human evaluations on the annotated sample ensuring consistency when extrapolating human assessments to the other methods. We achieved 92\% agreement between LLM evaluations and human annotations.

More details provided in Appendix~\ref{app:gemma_prompt}.


\subsubsection{Multiple-Choice Safety}

We use {SafetyBench}~\cite{zhang2023safetybench}, a multiple-choice benchmark, to assess a model's understanding of safety concepts rather than its refusal behavior. Accuracy on a private test set serves as the evaluation metric.

Models were evaluated on the English version of SafetyBench in a 5-shot setting, following the authors’ provided examples and prompt template. To ensure reliable parsing, we selected the answer with the highest model output logit for each question.
For further details, see Appendix~\ref{app:safetybench_prompt}.

\subsubsection{Trustworthiness}

We utilize the factual Question Answering multi-hop dataset \textbf{HotPotQA}~\cite{yang2018hotpotqa} to evaluate LLM trustworthiness and reliability in mitigating hallucinations. Following the original paper, we assess model performance in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setting, where the model receives three contexts: two distracting and one ground-truth. This setup closely resembles real-world LLM systems, which are typically equipped with retrievers that may introduce imperfect or misleading information.

To measure the factuality of model outputs, we employ two evaluation metrics: the automated {AlignScore} and the rule-based {In-accuracy}. 

\textbf{AlignScore}\cite{zha-etal-2023-alignscore} evaluates hallucinations by measuring the consistency between the generated response and its relevant context.

\textbf{In-Accuracy} assesses whether the model's response contains the correct answer\cite{ni2024llms,moskvoretskii2025adaptive}.

%Since we generated open-ended responses, we applied a rule-based approach

% \section{Dataset}
% Explain how our datase was obtained. 

% In our work we used a filtered version of Xsafety~\cite{wang2023all} dataset. We have removed the following sections from human evaluation:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Ethics And Morality - too ambiguous and culture dependent 
%     \item Insult - It is unclear what response we should except from a model since in most of the texts, there are no clear question and request.
%     \item Inquiry With Unsafe Opinion - ambiguous
%     \item Prompt Leaking - ambiguous, most of the time models say that is has some loopholes but it does not disclose them.
%     \item Commonsense - quite difficult for human evaluation 
%     \item Physical Harm - model responses were quite safe most of the time.
% \end{itemize}
