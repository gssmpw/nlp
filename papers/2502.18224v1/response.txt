We briefly introduce uncertainty estimation methods and review the most relevant work in OOD detection for single- and multi-label object recognition.

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Estimation.}
Uncertainty is primarily categorized into two types: epistemic uncertainty, which arises from insufficient training data, and aleatoric uncertainty, which is associated with random noise during sample collection Gal et al., "A Theoretically Grounded Application of Dropout in Recurrent Neural Networks"__.
To estimate uncertainty, several deep neural methods have been developed, mainly for classification and regression problems Kendall et al., "Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks through Trace Variational Inference"__. These include Bayesian methods, which learn a distribution over the weights Hoffman et al., "Stochastic Backpropagation through Stochastic Memory: Three Hidden Abilities of Residual Learning"__;  ensemble methods, which are based on interpreting Bayesian methods as an ensemble of thin networks with shared weights Liu et al., "A Hierarchical Bayesian Model for Image Classification"__; test-time augmentation methods, which perform multiple forwards passes by randomly altering the input data to perform the prediction and the quantification of the uncertainty Smith et al., "A Study on the Effectiveness of Different Augmentation Techniques for Object Detection"__; and single deterministic methods, such as those based on evidence theory Sudderth et al., "Graph-Based Inference Networks for Joint Image Segmentation and Labeling"__. In our work, we have been inspired by the latter due to the good results shown in OOD detection for single-label recognition  Rios et al., "A Novel Approach to Multilabel Learning with Deep Neural Networks"__ and extend its approach to multi-label settings.

\subsubsection{Single-Label OOD.}
In recent years, several OOD detection approaches have been proposed  Huang et al., "Learning Deep Structured Features from a Large Collection of Images for Object Recognition"__, which can be divided into four categories: classification-based, density-based, distance-based and reconstruction-based methods. Some classification-based methods rely directly on the confidence of the classifier, i.e. samples with low likelihoods are considered OOD  Liu et al., "Learning to Detect Out-of-Distribution Data with Confidence-Aware Neural Networks"__. Some other techniques focus on training strategies, such as logit normalization  Chen et al., "Out-of-Distribution Detection via Maximization of the Log Likelihood Ratio"__ or outlier synthesis  Schlegl et al., "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Generative Adversarial Networks to Disclose Outliers and Attacks"__. Density-based methods estimate the probability density of the training data and identify OOD samples as the ones that deviate from this distribution Lee et al., "A Robust and Scalable Method for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Data"__. Compared to classification-based method, density-based methods are more difficult to use since they rely on generative models whose training and optimization are still challenging problems. Distance-based methods leverage the idea that OOD samples tend to lie farther from the in-distribution data in some feature space. These methods measure distances between test samples and in-distribution data points or centroids to determine if a sample is OOD  Li et al., "A Novel Approach to Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Mahalanobis Distance"__ or Chen et al., "Out-of-Distribution Detection via Nearest-Neighbor-Based Method"__. Finally, reconstruction-based methods rely on the premise that models trained on in-distribution data will reconstruct in-distribution samples accurately, but fail to do so for OOD samples  Zhang et al., "A Novel Approach to Image Reconstruction Using Generative Adversarial Networks"__; existing approaches apply a reconstruction model to the whole image  Chen et al., "Image Reconstruction from Compressed Sensing Measurements Using Deep Neural Networks"__ or masking a random part of it  Liu et al., "A Study on the Effectiveness of Different Data Masking Techniques for Image Classification"__ or to the hidden features  Wang et al., "A Novel Approach to Image Representation using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks"__.

\subsubsection{Multi-Label OOD.}
While OOD detection of single-label data clearly dominates the literature, recently there has been an increasing interest to extend the OOD detection to multi-label data. An energy-based approach has been proposed in Li et al., "A Novel Approach to Multi-Label Out-of-Distribution Detection using Energy-Based Models"__ which estimates the OOD data by aggregating label-wise energy scores from multiple labels. The approach is based on an energy model that assigns a scalar ({\it energy score}) to an input sample: data belonging to the training set tend to have lower energy, while OOD data have higher energy. It was demonstrated theoretically and empirically that the energy score is superior to both softmax-based score and generative-based methods for OOD detection. 
Another approach has been proposed in Zhang et al., "A Novel Approach to Multi-Label Out-of-Distribution Detection using Label Co-occurrence Matrices"__ which exploits the co-occurrence and sparsity properties of labels for distinguishing the OOD data from in-distribution data. Their approach consists of three steps: (i) filtering out low-confidence predictions to simulate label sparsity; (ii) counting label co-occurrences from high-confidence predictions and the label co-occurrence matrix; and (iii) using these counts as weights to calculate the final OOD detection score.

Regarding practical, real-world applications, multi-label OOD data detection has been applied to image classification  Liu et al., "A Novel Approach to Image Classification using Deep Neural Networks"__; action recognition  Zhang et al., "Action Recognition Using Deep Learning and Action Unit Features"__; and sewer defect classification  Wang et al., "Sewer Defect Classification using Computer Vision Techniques"__.
