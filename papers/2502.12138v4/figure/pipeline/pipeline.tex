    Given  uncalibrated sparse views, our model can infer high-quality camera poses, geometry and appearance in a single feed-forward pass. We use camera poses as proxies to guide subsequent geometry and appearance learning. Given initial pose estimates, we first compute camera-centric geometry, then project it into a global scene representation. Finally, we form 3D Gaussians on top of the scene geometry to enable photo-realistic novel-view synthesis.
