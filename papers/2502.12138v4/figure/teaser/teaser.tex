\captionof{figure}{We present \method, a feed-forward approach that simultaneously recovers high-quality poses, geometry and appearance from uncalibrated sparse views within \textbf{0.5s}.
Our model excels in the scenarios with a camera circling around the subject, and also shows robust generalization to real-world casual captures, such as an indoor bedroom.
In the central area below, we casually captured six random bedroom images with minimal overlap. Our method demonstrates high-quality geometry reconstruction even in this challenging case.
