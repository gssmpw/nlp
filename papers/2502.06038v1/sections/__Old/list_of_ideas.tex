\section{List of Ideas}

\begin{itemize}
    \item No go result on how memory is stored to show $.... 2 + 5 =$ and $.... 3 + 4 =$ will fail because the previous will always overwhelm. Generalizes to attn heads in parrallel (pay attention to only a few tokens). Maybe in asymptotic for many heads in serial. Something you can prove w/o making the model very contrived.
    \item Formalize model as dynamical system up to some error
    \item Same model, but if you have long context, then will it still select max (or smthng) at the end? Ask to prove model will produce max on any (or up to a bound). Show something with a state machine type model (like RNNs/ Mamba, etc) or Neural Turing Machines or Reinforcement Learning. For example for max, you can always have the model store some information and that gets passed back into the input.
