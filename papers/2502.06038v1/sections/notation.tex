% \subsection*{Notation}
% We use a similar notation to Ref.~\cite{gross2024compact} for our variable lettering. 
% We will also use $\vec{e}_i$ to denote the $i$-th standard basis vector: $(0, 0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0)$.
% Moreover, we will use ``numpy'' notation to denote the selection of rows and columns of a matrix.
% I.e.\ $X[i, :]$ (or simply $X[i]$) is the $i$-th row of matrix $X$ and $X[:, j]$ is the $j$-th column of matrix $X$.
