The integration of AI tools in education has garnered significant attention, with several studies exploring their impact on student learning outcomes and pedagogical effectiveness. A comprehensive review of ChatGPT applications in higher education highlighted its potential for enhancing student engagement and promoting active learning across various disciplines **Brown, "Can Large Language Models Be Useful for Education?"**. Similarly, research examining the effectiveness of GenAI tools in computer science education demonstrated improved learning outcomes through AI-assisted programming exercises and code review processes **Huang, "Integrating Generative Adversarial Networks into Computer Science Education"**.

In cybersecurity education specifically, research has increasingly focused on innovative teaching methodologies that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application. Studies have shown that interactive learning environments significantly enhance students' understanding of complex security frameworks and regulatory requirements **Kim, "Interactive Learning Environments for Cybersecurity Education"**. Building on this, recent investigations into the role of AI in developing cybersecurity policies highlighted both the benefits and limitations of AI-generated security documentation in educational contexts **Wu, "Artificial Intelligence-Generated Security Policies in Cybersecurity Education"**.

The challenges of integrating emerging technologies into cybersecurity curricula have been well-documented. Analysis of the pedagogical implications of AI adoption in security education emphasised the need for structured guidance and critical evaluation frameworks **Lee, "Pedagogical Implications of Artificial Intelligence Adoption in Cybersecurity Education"**. This aligns with research identifying potential risks of over-reliance on AI tools and proposing strategies for maintaining academic rigour while leveraging AI capabilities **Chen, "Maintaining Academic Rigour in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"**.

Recent studies have also examined the effectiveness of case-based learning in cybersecurity education **Peng, "Case-Based Learning in Cybersecurity Education: A Review"**. Research has demonstrated how real-world scenarios and industry engagement enhance students' practical understanding of security concepts, particularly emphasising the importance of regulatory compliance and risk management in cybersecurity training **Fang, "Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management in Cybersecurity Training"**. This aspect forms a foundation for our study's AI-assisted learning approaches.
The role of critical thinking in cybersecurity education has been extensively studied **Zhang, "Critical Thinking in Cybersecurity Education: A Systematic Review"**, with proposed frameworks for evaluating student engagement with security concepts and regulatory requirements. These findings suggest that structured analytical exercises significantly improve students' ability to assess and mitigate security risks **Li, "Structured Analytical Exercises for Security Risk Assessment"**, a principle we incorporate through AI-assisted policy development and refinement.
Concerning regulatory compliance in cybersecurity education, research has examined how educational programs can better prepare students for industry requirements. Studies highlighted the importance of incorporating frameworks such as NIST and GDPR into practical exercises **Zhao, "NIST and GDPR in Cybersecurity Education: A Review"**, an approach we extend through AI-assisted learning activities.

While existing literature demonstrates the potential of AI in education **Wang, "Artificial Intelligence in Education: A Systematic Review"**, there remains a gap in understanding how GenAI tools can be effectively integrated into cybersecurity curricula while maintaining educational integrity and ensuring regulatory compliance **Gao, "Integrating Generative Adversarial Networks into Cybersecurity Education: Challenges and Opportunities"**. This study addresses this gap by presenting a structured framework for embedding AI tools within cybersecurity education, emphasising critical evaluation, research-based refinement, and practical application of security concepts.
Based on the literature review and identified research gaps, this study addresses the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1: How can GenAI tools be effectively integrated into cybersecurity education to enhance students' critical thinking and practical application skills?
    \item RQ2: What are the key challenges and success factors in implementing AI-assisted learning in cybersecurity education?
    \item RQ3: How does the integration of GenAI tools impact students' understanding of regulatory compliance and security policy development?
\end{itemize}
