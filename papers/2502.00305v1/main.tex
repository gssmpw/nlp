\begin{abstract}
     Cold-start active learning (CSAL) selects valuable instances from an unlabeled dataset for manual annotation.
     It provides high-quality data at a low annotation cost for label-scarce text classification.
     However, existing CSAL methods overlook weak classes and hard representative examples, resulting in biased learning.
     To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel dual-diversity enhancing and uncertainty-aware (\mymethod{}) framework for CSAL.
     Specifically, \mymethod{} leverages a pretrained language model (PLM) to efficiently extract textual representations, class predictions, and predictive uncertainty.
     Then, it constructs a Dual-Neighbor Graph (DNG) to combine information on both textual diversity and class diversity, ensuring a balanced data distribution.
     It further propagates uncertainty information via density-based clustering to select hard representative instances.
     \mymethod{} performs well in selecting class-balanced and hard representative data by dual-diversity and informativeness.
     Experiments on six NLP datasets demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of \mymethod{}.
