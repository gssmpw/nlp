\subsection{Cold-start Active Learning (CSAL)}
\label{sec:csal-taxonomy}

According to the taxonomy of ____, CSAL research for NLP can be categorized as informativeness-based, representativeness-based, and hybrid.
As most methods are hybrid, the techniques and challenges for informativeness or representativeness are elucidated below.

\subsubsection{Informativeness}
\label{subsubsec:informativeness}

\paragraph{Uncertainty}
The main metric for informativeness in CSAL is uncertainty, as it is more tractable in cold-start stages than others (\eg{} gradients).
High predictive uncertainty indicates difficulty for the model, thus valuable for annotation.
Most existing methods use language models (LMs) for estimation.
Common estimators include
entropy ____,
LM probability ____,
LM loss ____, and
probability margin ____.
However, several challenges exist in uncertainty estimation:
(a)
Often, a closed-world assumption is imposed.
In other words, predictions are normalized such that they sum to $1$.
This hinders the expression of uncertainty, as it forces mapping to one of the known classes, ignoring options such as ``none of the above'' ____.
(b) PLMs suffer from overconfidence ____.
This requires calibration for more robust uncertainty estimation ____.
(c)
Task information is hardly considered.
As a result, the uncertainty will not be related to the downstream task (output uncertainty), but rather its intrinsic perplexity (input uncertainty) ____.
\patron{} ____ uses task-related prompts to tackle this issue.

\subsubsection{Representativeness}
\label{subsubsec:repr}

\paragraph{Density}
To avoid outliers, density-based CSAL methods prefer ``typical'' instances.
The method of ____ and TypiClust (____) prioritize instances with high $k$NN density.
Uncertainty propagation ____ is also useful in aggregating density information.
A typical group of uncertain examples indicates a region where the model's knowledge is lacking.

\paragraph{Discriminative}
Some CSAL methods acquire sequentially or iteratively.
They thus discriminate, \ie{} prefer an instance if it differs the most from selected ones.
Coreset selection ____ selects an instance (cover-point) such that its minimum distance to selected instances is maximized.
\votek{} ____ adopts a greedy approach to select remote instances on a $k$NN graph.

\paragraph{Batch diversity}
It is more efficient to acquire in batch mode ____, \ie{} to select multiple instances at each step.
Clustering has been a common technique to enhance batch diversity and avoid redundancy in CSAL.
It helps structure the unlabeled dataset by grouping similar instances together.
____ and ____ first proposed \mbox{pre-clustering} the input space to select representatives from each cluster. %
____ used spectral clustering on the similarity matrix of documents.
____ and ____ used hierarchical clustering to stabilize the process.
____ and more recent works ____ have commonly used \kmeans{} for its simplicity and efficiency.
However, these clustering methods can be sensitive to outliers.
Moreover, clustering in the input space only contributes to textual diversity, regardless of other aspects.%

\subsection{Missed Cluster Effect}
The \mse{} ____ is an extreme case of class imbalance.
It refers to when an AL strategy neglects certain classes (or clusters within classes).
____ first recognized the \mse{} in the context of text classification.
They suggested more use of domain knowledge. %
Knowledge extraction from PLMs is in harmony with this suggestion.
____ proposed an uncertainty-based approach to avoid the \mse{} in word sense disambiguation (WSD). %
However, it is based on task-agnostic LM probability.
____ showed that labeling relevant instances, which reduces the labeling noise, also helps mitigate the \mse{}.
Label calibration aligns with this finding.
While many works are devoted to addressing the \mse{} or general class imbalance (\eg{} ____) for general AL, they often rely on a labeled subset. %
Class diversity enhancement would help mitigate class imbalance issues, but it remains an open question for CSAL.
