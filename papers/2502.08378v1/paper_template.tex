% \muning{Should we highlight the "Adaptiveness" and "Robustness" as our main advantage here? e.g. adaptive and robust standing-up control} 
Standing-up control is crucial for humanoid robots, 
with the potential for integration into current locomotion and loco-manipulation systems, such as fall recovery. 
Existing approaches are either limited to simulations that overlook hardware constraints or rely on predefined ground-specific motion trajectories, failing to enable standing up across postures in real-world scenes. 
To bridge this gap, we present \ours (\underline{H}uman\underline{o}id \underline{St}anding-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework that learns standing-up control from scratch, enabling robust sim-to-real transfer across diverse postures.
\ours effectively learns posture-adaptive motions by leveraging a multi-critic architecture and curriculum-based training on diverse simulated terrains.
% To ensure real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound, preventing oscillations and abrupt movements on the hardware.
To ensure successful real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound to alleviate oscillatory and violent motions on physical hardware, respectively. 
After simulation-based training, the learned control policies are directly deployed on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the controllers achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a wide range of laboratory and outdoor environments (\cref{fig:teaser}). Videos are available on \href{https://taohuang13.github.io/humanoid-standingup.github.io/}{our project page}.
% \xiao{(Version 1) The experiments of controller deployment on Unitree G1 robot demonstrate smooth, robust, and stable standing-up motions across diverse real-world scenes as shown in~\cref{fig:teaser}. (Version 2) The controllers, trained entirely in simulation, transfer directly to the Unitree G1 robot without fine-tuning, demonstrating smooth and stable standing-up motions across diverse real-world scenarios as shown in~\cref{fig:teaser}.}
% \ours integrates multiple critics and training curriculums to efficiently learn multi-stage skills. To ensure smooth motion and prevent oscillations or abrupt movements, we apply smoothness regularization and impose an implicit limit on motion speed. After training in simulation, the resulting control policies are deployed on the real humanoid robot, Unitree G1. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policies achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a variety of challenging scenarios, showcasing our potential of \ours to enhance existing humanoid control systems.


% We envision integrating humanoid standing-up skills into current humanoid control systems, \eg locomotion and bimanual manipulation,  enabling humanoid robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks. This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based humanoid standing-up control, achieving robust performance across diverse scenarios. We present \ours (\underline{H}uman\underline{o}id \underline{St}anding-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework for learning standing-up controllers from various initial postures. \ours incorporates multiple critics and a curriculum-based approach to efficiently acquire multi-stage skills. To prevent oscillations and abrupt movements, we apply smoothness regularization and impose an implicit limit on motion speed. After training in simulation, the resulting control policies are directly deployed on a real humanoid robot, Unitree G1. Our experimental results demonstrate that the policies produce smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a variety of challenging scenarios, showcasing the potential of \ours to enhance existing humanoid control systems (\cref{fig:teaser}).


% We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to learn humanoid standing-up controllers from diverse postures. To better balance the reward functions, we adopt the multi-critic technique. To accelerate exploration, we design a force curriculum to assist the standing up at the initial training stage. To ensure deployability, we apply an action bound on the policy network. We also design multiple terrains to model the real-world initial postures in the simulation. Our policy can be successfully transferred to diverse real-world scenarios.

% \section{Introduction}
% This demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file" for the
% Robotics: Science and Systems conference papers produced under \LaTeX\
% using IEEEtran.cls version 1.7a and later.  

% \section{Section}

% Section text here. 

% \subsection{Subsection Heading Here}
% Subsection text here.

% \subsubsection{Subsubsection Heading Here}
% Subsubsection text here.


% \section{RSS citations}

% Please make sure to include \verb!natbib.sty! and to use the
% \verb!plainnat.bst! bibliography style. \verb!natbib! provides additional
% citation commands, most usefully \verb!\citet!. For example, rather than the
% awkward construction 

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% \cite{kalman1960new} demonstrated...
% \end{verbatim}
% }

% \noindent
% rendered as ``\cite{kalman1960new} demonstrated...,''
% or the
% inconvenient 

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% Kalman \cite{kalman1960new} 
% demonstrated...
% \end{verbatim}
% }

% \noindent
% rendered as 
% ``Kalman \cite{kalman1960new} demonstrated...'', 
% one can
% write 

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% \citet{kalman1960new} demonstrated... 
% \end{verbatim}
% }
% \noindent
% which renders as ``\citet{kalman1960new} demonstrated...'' and is 
% both easy to write and much easier to read.
  
% \subsection{RSS Hyperlinks}

% This year, we would like to use the ability of PDF viewers to interpret
% hyperlinks, specifically to allow each reference in the bibliography to be a
% link to an online version of the reference. 
% As an example, if you were to cite ``Passive Dynamic Walking''
% \cite{McGeer01041990}, the entry in the bibtex would read:

% {\small
% \begin{verbatim}
% @article{McGeer01041990,
%   author = {McGeer, Tad}, 
%   title = {\href{http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.abstract}{Passive Dynamic Walking}}, 
%   volume = {9}, 
%   number = {2}, 
%   pages = {62-82}, 
%   year = {1990}, 
%   doi = {10.1177/027836499000900206}, 
%   URL = {http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.abstract}, 
%   eprint = {http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.full.pdf+html}, 
%   journal = {The International Journal of Robotics Research}
% }
% \end{verbatim}
% }
% \noindent
% and the entry in the compiled PDF would look like:

% \def\tmplabel#1{[#1]}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[\tmplabel{1}] Tad McGeer. \href{http://ijr.sagepub.com/content/9/2/62.abstract}{Passive Dynamic
% Walking}. {\em The International Journal of Robotics Research}, 9(2):62--82,
% 1990.
% \end{enumerate}
% %
% where the title of the article is a link that takes you to the article on IJRR's website. 


% Linking cited articles will not always be possible, especially for
% older articles. There are also often several versions of papers
% online: authors are free to decide what to use as the link destination
% yet we strongly encourage to link to archival or publisher sites
% (such as IEEE Xplore or Sage Journals).  We encourage all authors to use this feature to
% the extent possible.
