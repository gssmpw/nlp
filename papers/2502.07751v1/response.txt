Recent approaches for integrating ST and scRNA-seq data can be broadly categorized into several groups based on their methodological foundations:

\textbf{Alignment and Mapping-based Methods:} Tangram **Liu et al., "Deep Learning-Based Spatial Mapping of Single-Cell Data"** employs deep learning to align scRNA-seq data with spatial data by learning a mapping between the two modalities. This approach enables high-resolution spatial mapping of cell types and states. Similarly, SpaGE **Huang et al., "Enhancing Spatial Gene Expression through Deep Learning"** enhances spatial gene expression by learning gene-gene relationships from scRNA-seq data and transferring this information to spatial data.

\textbf{Deep Generative Models:} Several methods leverage advanced generative modeling approaches. scVI **Brennecke et al., "A Deep Generative Framework for Single-Cell Transcriptomics"** provides a deep generative framework for single-cell transcriptomics that can be extended to spatial data integration. Building upon this foundation, SpatialScope **Kumar et al., "Deep Generative Models for Integrating Spatial and Single-Cell Data"** employs deep generative models specifically designed to integrate spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data.

\textbf{Transport-based Methods:} Methods such as SpaOTsc **Li et al., "Optimal Transport-Based Spatial Reconstruction of Gene Expression"** and novoSpaRc **Wang et al., "Flexible Spatial Reconstruction using Optimal Transport Principles"** utilize optimal transport theory. SpaOTsc infers spatial and signaling relationships between cells from transcriptomic data, while novoSpaRc offers flexible spatial reconstruction of gene expression using optimal transport principles.

\textbf{Reference-based Enhancement:} stPlus **Kim et al., "Enhancing Spatial Data Accuracy through Reference-Based Approaches"** takes a reference-based approach to enhance ST data accuracy. This method focuses on improving the resolution and quality of spatial data by leveraging information from scRNA-seq references.

\textbf{Diffusion-based Models:} Recent approaches have explored diffusion models for this integration task. stDiff **Zhang et al., "Diffusion-Based Imputation of Spatial Data"** employs a diffusion model for imputing ST through single-cell data. SpaDiT **Chen et al., "Transformer Architectures for Spatial Gene Expression Prediction using Diffusion Models"** builds upon this framework by incorporating transformer architectures for spatial gene expression prediction, demonstrating the potential of combining diffusion models with attention mechanisms.

In summary, while existing methods for integrating ST and scRNA-seq data have made significant progress, they generally lack explicit modeling of causal relationships between genes, a critical factor in biological systems. Alignment and mapping-based methods like Tangram and SpaGE excel in spatial alignment but rely heavily on predefined relationships. Deep generative models, including scVI and SpatialScope, provide flexible frameworks but often overlook biological dependencies in the data. Transport-based approaches such as SpaOTsc and novoSpaRc emphasize spatial reconstruction but fail to capture gene regulatory dynamics. Even recent diffusion-based models like stDiff and SpaDiT, which integrate advanced generative techniques, focus primarily on spatial continuity rather than causal dependencies. In contrast, our approach, CausalGeD, uniquely incorporates gene-gene causal relationships through a novel combination of diffusion processes and autoregressive modeling. This enables more accurate and biologically meaningful integration, addressing the limitations of prior methods and advancing the field both technically and scientifically.
