\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
\noindent In this section, we first describe in detail the properties of NVM technologies, highlighting the implications these might have in the design of a DBMS. We then describe currently available NVM hardware and  system software to manage NVM.


\subsection{Characteristics of NVM}
\noindent \textbf{Data access latency:} Read latencies for NVM technologies will certainly be significantly lower than those of conventional disks. However, since NVM devices are still under development, sources quote varying read latencies. For example, the read latency for STT-RAM ranges from 1 to 20ns, and PC-RAM is expected to be around 50ns ~\cite{arulraj2015let,wang2013low,perez2010non}. Nonetheless, read latency of some NVM technologies is expected to be similar to that of DRAM ~\cite{mittal2016survey,arulraj2015let,wang2013low,chang2012limits,arulraj2016write,oukid2014sofort,chatzistergiou2015rewind}, which is typically around 60ns.

PC-RAM and R-RAM are reported to have a higher write latency compared to DRAM, but STT-RAM also outperforms DRAM in this regard ~\cite{arulraj2015let,wang2013low}. However, the write latency is typically not in the critical path, since it can be tolerated by using buffers ~\cite{qureshi2009scalable}.

\noindent\textbf{Density:} NVM technologies provide higher densities than DRAM, which makes them a good candidate to be used as main memory as well as primary storage, particularly in embedded systems~\cite{huang2012register}. For example, PC-RAM provides 2 to 4 times higher density as compared to DRAM~\cite{qureshi2009scalable}. Future NVMs are expected to have higher capacity and better scalability than DRAM \cite{oukid2015instant,chakrabarti2014atlas,zhang2015study,viglas2014write}
, and it is expected to scale to lower technology nodes as opposed to DRAM.

\noindent\textbf{Endurance:} The maximum number of writes a memory cell can withstand is lower for most NVM 
technologies when compared to DRAM ~\cite{qureshi2009scalable,zhou2009durable}. Specifically, PC-RAM, R-RAM, 
and STT-RAM have projected endurances of $10^{10}$, $10^{8}$, and $10^{15}$ respectively;  as compared to 
$10^{16}$ for DRAM ~\cite{arulraj2015let}. On the other hand, NVMs exhibit higher endurance than flash 
memory technologies ~\cite{wang2013low}.

\noindent\textbf{Energy consumption:} Since NVM does not need a refresh cycle to maintain data states in memory cells like a  DRAM, 
they are more energy efficient. A main memory designed using PC-RAM technology consumes significantly lower per access write energy as compared to DRAM~\cite{zhou2009durable}. Other NVM technologies also have similar lower energy consumption per bit when compared to DRAM~\cite{arulraj2015let,perez2010non}.

In addition to the features listed above, NVM technologies also provide byte-addressability like DRAM and persistency like disks. Due to these features, NVMs are starting to appear in embedded and energy-critical devices and are expected to play a major role in future computing systems. Companies like Intel and Micron have launched the 3D XPoint memory technology, which features non-volatility \cite{3DXPoint}. Intel has also introduced new instructions to support the usage of persistent memory at the instruction set architecture (ISA) level~\cite{intel2016architecture}.

\subsection{Available NVM hardware}\label{NVDIMM}

While NVM hardware has been available in recent years, it has mainly been used to implement Solid State Disks (SSD) using the NVM Express (NVMe) interface. This technology is not suitable as a DRAM replacement due to its endurance and latency properties. Researchers have been anticipating the arrival of Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMM) based on NVM to substitute traditional DRAM DIMMs for a long time. Recently, in April 2019, Intel has released its 3D Xpoint DIMM based on NVM technology~\cite{hirofuchi2019preliminary}.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{3DXPointInterface}, 3D Xpoint DIMMs connect to the memory bus and communicate with a processor through the integrated memory controller (iMC). Each iMC can connect to up to three DIMMs~\cite{peng2019system,yang2019empirical}. A non-standard protocol, DDR-T, is followed for communication between processors and 3D XPoint DIMM. Intel\textquotesingle s Cascade Lake processors are yet the only ones to support 3D Xpoint memory.  As each processor supports two iMCs, six DIMMs are supported in total~\cite{peng2019system,yang2019empirical,izraelevitz2019basic}.

3D XPoint DIMMs can operate in two different modes: Memory and App Direct. Memory mode uses NVM to expand main memory without providing the feature of persistency, while regular DRAM serves as a cache for NVM. In this mode, operating system and CPU see the NVM memory as a volatile extension of main memory. In App Direct mode, NVM is used as a separate persistent memory and does not use DRAM as cache. App Direct mode provides an application direct access to data residing in NVM without interference of the operating system and with byte-addressability. However, it requires an NVM-aware file system to allocate, name, and access persistent data.

\subsection{System software for NVM}

Using NVM as primary storage necessitates modifications not only in application software but also in system software in order to 
take advantage of NVM features. A traditional file system (FS) accesses the storage through a block layer. If a disk is replaced by NVM without any modifications in
the FS, the NVM storage will still be accessed at block level granularity. Hence, we will not be able to take advantage of the byte-addressability feature of NVM. 

For this reason, researchers have developed purpose-built file systems such as NOn Volatile memory Accelerated (NOVA) \cite{xu2016nova} and persistent memory file System (PMFS) ~\cite{dulloor2014system,githubPMFS}. Both file systems expose NVM to an application by providing direct access through a memory map (mmap) interface. As this work uses PMFS, we discuss it in more detail below.

PMFS is an open-source POSIX compliant FS developed by Intel Research. It offers two key features in order to facilitate usage of NVM.  
First, PMFS does not maintain a separate address space for NVM. In other words, both main memory and NVM use the same address space. This implies that there is no need to copy data from NVM to DRAM to make it accessible to an application. A process can directly access file system protected data stored in NVM at byte level granularity.

Second, in a traditional FS stored blocks can be accessed in two ways: (i) file I/O and (ii) memory mapped I/O. PMFS implements file I/O in a similar way to a traditional FS. However, the implementation of memory mapped I/O differs. In a traditional FS, memory mapped I/O would first copy pages to DRAM~\cite{dulloor2014system} from where an application can examine those pages. PMFS avoids this copy overhead by mapping NVM pages directly into the address space of a process. Fig.~\ref{Fig1} from~\cite{dulloor2014system} compares a traditional FS with PMFS.

%\subsection{NVM DIMM}
%Dual In-line Memory Module using NVM have been long anticipated by communit of memory reserachers. Recently, Intel has annnounced and made commercially available its product named Intel's 3D XPoint memory as an NVM DIMM.
