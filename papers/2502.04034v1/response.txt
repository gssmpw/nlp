\subsection{Domain Generalization}
Domain generalization (DG) is proposed to construct models that perform well on unseen domains without access to their data during training. Recent advancements in DG have achieved remarkable progress**Li et al., "Deep Domain Confusion"**, with approaches generally categorized into three main groups: data manipulation**Guo et al., "Multi-Faceted Feature Space for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation"**, representation learning**Mancini and Alahari, "Learning to Generalize: An Improved Gradient Episodic Memory Method for Deep Domain Confusion"**, and learning strategy**Ji et al., "Deep Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DDANN)"**. While our method falls within the realm of representation learning, it significantly differs from existing domain adversarial learning-based methods. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric adaptive clustering constraint, enabling the model to better capture the nuances of real-world drug response data. The most closely related work is the SSDG**Wang et al., "Single-Sided Domain Generalization for Face Anti-Spoofing"**, a single-sided domain generalization approach for face anti-spoofing. However, our method distinguishes itself through the incorporation of contrastive learning-based asymmetric clustering constraints and the proposal of a latent independent projection module, allowing the encoder to learn non-redundant features and thereby enhance the model's generalization capability.

\subsection{Drug Response Prediction}
The prediction of clinical drug responses has drawn considerable attention from machine learning community. Some studies employed patient drug response data to fine-tune models initially trained on cell line datasets. For instance, CODE-AE**Zhou et al., "Cellular Origin and Dynamics of the Cancer Genome Atlas"**, is based on domain separation network**Chen et al., "Deep Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DDANN)"**,to extract shared features between cell lines and patients. It was trained on cell line drug sensitivity data and then used to predict the drug response for tumor patients. Precily **Wang et al., "Precily: A Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Drug Response in Single Cells"**, integrated signaling pathway and drug feature to predict drug responses \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. In contrast, drug response prediction at the single-cell level is still in its infancy, due to the scarcity of drug response data in single-cell context. Only a few studies leveraged domain adaptation between bulk RNA-seq (source domain) and scRNA-seq (target domain) data to predict drug sensitivity of individual cells. For example, scDEAL **Li et al., "Single-Cell Domain Adaptation for Drug Response Prediction"**, aligned the bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq features by minimizing the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) **Zhang et al., "Maximum Mean Discrepancy Based Feature Alignment for Single-Cell Data"** ,in the latent space for single-cell drug response prediction. SCAD**Chen et al., "Single-Cell Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Drug Response Prediction"**, adopted adversarial domain adaptation to learn drug-gene signatures from the GDSC dataset **Gao et al., "GDSC: A Large-Scale Dataset of Cancer Cells with Gene Expression and Drug Sensitivity Data"** ,for inferring drug sensitivity in single cells. Distinct from the existing methods, we aim to establish a predictive model with superior generalizability across distinct target domains, spanning both single-cell and patient-level datasets, without access to target-domain data during training.
