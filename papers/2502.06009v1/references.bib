	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a lot of concern about "fake news" driving polarization of society. However, recent research has shown that factually incorrect news is relatively rare and that bias and polarization in news reporting might arise from the selection and framing the news rather than making up news. We model this process as a three-stage process: first of all, the publisher selects what topics to report on the homepage. Conditional on reporting a topic, the publisher decides what factual statements to select (such as summarizing an event or quoting a politician). Finally, conditional on reporting a factual statement, the publisher has some leeway in framing the statement by adding slant. We use a simple sender/receiver model to understand selection and framing where the sender tries to influence the receiver by deciding on how to best assemble a news article. We then use our framework to document selection and framing in 14 US newspapers by using generative AI (ChatGPT) to disassemble the top homepage articles into unique factual statements. We measure the extent to which a statement is supporting the world-view of left-leaning and right-leaning partisans on an online crowdsourcing platform where human raters are incentivized to label each statement accurately. In a separate framing survey we compare how each statement is framed in different newspapers on a left to right spectrum.},

    abstract = "Large language models (LLMs) excel in abstractive summarization tasks, delivering fluent and pertinent summaries. Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 6 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on the which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position bias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization. Our code and data can be found here: https://github.com/ntunlp/MiddleSum.",

    abstract = "Recent studies have found that summaries generated by large language models (LLMs) are favored by human annotators over the original reference summaries in commonly used summarization datasets. Therefore, we study an LLM-as-reference learning setting for smaller text summarization models to investigate whether their performance can be substantially improved. To this end, we use LLMs as both oracle summary generators for standard supervised fine-tuning and oracle summary evaluators for efficient contrastive learning that leverages the LLMs{'} supervision signals. We conduct comprehensive experiments with source news articles and find that (1) summarization models trained under the LLM-as-reference setting achieve significant performance improvement in both LLM and human evaluations; (2) contrastive learning outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning under both low and high resource settings. Our experimental results also enable a meta-analysis of LLMs{'} summary evaluation capacities under a challenging setting, showing that LLMs are not well-aligned with human evaluators. Particularly, our expert human evaluation reveals remaining nuanced performance gaps between LLMs and our fine-tuned models, which LLMs fail to capture. Thus, we call for further studies into both the potential and challenges of using LLMs in summarization model development.",
