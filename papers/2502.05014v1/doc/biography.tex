{Tristan Schuler}{img/tristan-ieee.jpeg}
is a Robotics Research Scientist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in the Distributed Autonomous Systems Section for the Navy Center for Applied Research in Artificial Intelligence (NCARAI). He
is an expert in autonomous lighter-than-air platforms with several publications and patents since 2018. Tristan has a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from George Mason University and an M.S. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Arizona where he defended his thesis on solar balloons for planetary exploration. In 2021, he was awarded a Karles research Fellowship from the NRL to develop autonomous HAB technology for SHAB-Vs. His HAB expertise has led to continued research and collaborations with AFRL, NRL, ONR, Sandia, NASA JPL, and several universities.
