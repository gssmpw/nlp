In stable matching, one must find a matching between two sets of agents, commonly men and women, or job applicants and job positions. Each agent has a preference ordering over who they want to be matched with. Moreover a matching is said to be stable if no pair of matched agents prefer each other compared to their current matching. 
    
We consider solving stable matching in a distributed synchronous setting, where each agent is its own process. Moreover, we assume up to $t_L$ agents on one side and $t_R$ on the other side can be byzantine. After properly defining the stable matching problem in this setting, we study its solvability.

When there are as many agents on each side with fully-ordered preference lists, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for stable matching to be solvable in the synchronous setting. These conditions depend on the communication model used, i.e., if parties on the same side are allowed to communicate directly, and on the presence of a cryptographic setup, i.e., digital signatures.
