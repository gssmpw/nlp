\section{Conclusion and Limitations}
\label{sec:main:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced BDO, an efficient and scalable foundation model for brain dynamics, integrates continuous-discrete SSMs with SSL through the lens of SOC. Leveraging amortized inference with control formulation, our model effectively captures complex temporal dependencies in the underlying nature of fMRI data. By learning brain representations through SOC-driven SSL objective, it achieved superior performance across various downstream tasks, while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Despite its strong performance, some challenges remain. The variational gap from the linear approximation may lead to cumulative errors, requiring further analysis to ensure stability and accuracy. Additionally, while partial interpretability was demonstrated, further work is required to achieve comprehensive interpretability and generalization for direct use in medical and clinical deployment. 

Nevertheless, the efficiency and scalability of BDO underscore its potential as a foundation model for fMRI. By scaling effectively across model size, data volume, and training duration while maintaining resource efficiency, BDO represents a promising step toward more effective and interpretable brain dynamics modeling, with potential applications in both neuroscience research and clinical practice.
