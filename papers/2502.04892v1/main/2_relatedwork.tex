\textbf{State-Space Models for fMRI. }
SSMs provide an elegant framework for analyzing fMRI data by modeling hidden neuronal states and their dynamics. A widely used example is DCM, a Bayesian SSM framework for estimating effective connectivity, which has been a cornerstone for fMRI~\citep{FRISTON20031273,triantafyllopoulos2021bayesian, novelli2024spectral}. However, it often assumes stationarity and linearity in state dynamics, limiting its ability to capture complex, non-linear brain dynamics~\citep{daunizeau2012stochastic}. Beyond DCM, SSMs have been used to model dynamic functional connectivity, capturing temporal interactions among brain regions~\citep{chakravarty2019state,zhang2021voxel}. Recent advances integrate neural networks with SSMs to improve temporal modeling, as seen in approaches like Brain-Mamba~\citep{behrouz2024brain, wei2024hierarchical}. 
We propose an efficient SSM with an SSL objective, designed for foundation models to capture complex, non-stationary dynamics with improved scalability.

\textbf{Stochastic Optimal Control for Sequential Models. } SOC is a mathematical framework that optimizes control policies for stochastic systems often modeled via SDEs. \citet{li2020scalable} derived the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for the posterior distribution of latent dynamics and optimized parameterized non-linear dynamics. \citet{heng2020controlled} investigated approximations of the smoothing distribution using control theory, which was later extended to continuous settings by \citet{lu2024guidance}. \citet{chopin2023computational} applied SOC theory to approximate Doob's $h$-transform, leading to the development of an online filtering algorithm. More recently, \citet{park2024amortized} explored efficient methods for approximating the posterior distribution by leveraging SOC. In this work, we utilize SOC to develop an efficient SSL framework for SSMs for brain dynamics foundation models.
