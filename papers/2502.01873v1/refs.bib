abstract = {Aggregation structures with explicit information, such as image attributes and scene semantics, are effective and popular for intelligent systems for assessing aesthetics of visual data. However, useful information may not be available due to the high cost of manual annotation and expert design. In this paper, we present a novel multi-patch (MP) aggregation method for image aesthetic assessment. Different from state-of-the-art methods, which augment an MP aggregation network with various visual attributes, we train the model in an end-to-end manner with aesthetic labels only (i.e., aesthetically positive or negative). We achieve the goal by resorting to an attention-based mechanism that adaptively adjusts the weight of each patch during the training process to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we propose a set of objectives with three typical attention mechanisms (i.e., average, minimum, and adaptive) and evaluate their effectiveness on the Aesthetic Visual Analysis (AVA) benchmark. Numerical results show that our approach outperforms existing methods by a large margin. We further verify the effectiveness of the proposed attention-based objectives via ablation studies and shed light on the design of aesthetic assessment systems.},

abstract = {We present an interactive application that enables users to improve the visual aesthetics of their digital photographs using spatial recomposition. Unlike earlier work that focuses either on photo quality assessment or interactive tools for photo editing, we enable the user to make informed decisions about improving the composition of a photograph and to implement them in a single framework. Specifically, the user interactively selects a foreground object and the system presents recommendations for where it can be moved in a manner that optimizes a learned aesthetic metric while obeying semantic constraints. For photographic compositions that lack a distinct foreground object, our tool provides the user with cropping or expanding recommendations that improve its aesthetic quality. We learn a support vector regression model for capturing image aesthetics from user data and seek to optimize this metric during recomposition. Rather than prescribing a fully-automated solution, we allow user-guided object segmentation and inpainting to ensure that the final photograph matches the user's criteria. Our approach achieves 86% accuracy in predicting the attractiveness of unrated images, when compared to their respective human rankings. Additionally, 73% of the images recomposited using our tool are ranked more attractive than their original counterparts by human raters.},
