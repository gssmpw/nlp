\section{RELATED WORK}
Image aesthetic and composition evaluation is an open research subject with ongoing applications and a history of interest in the field. Older methods that use saliency and rule of thirds based techniques **Itti, "Visual Attention: The Past 25 Years"** used limited datasets and were implemented using algorithms. Other methods in related areas aim to recompose or improve images **Lischinski, "Interactive Local Frequency Selection" ____** While these methods have been shown to work, they have limited generalization and often make assumptions about inital photo composition. Later the AVA dataset **Torralba et al., "Context Prior with Clutter Aware Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Weakly Supervised Visual Object Transfer"** was collected and labeled: it provided a large dataset to the task and is now the most common benchmark for the photo aesthetic analysis task.

With the introduction of a large dataset, it opened the gateway for use of neural networks.  Methods and papers like DMA-Net **Ma et al., "DANet: Deep Aesthetic Network"** utilize convolutional neural networks to estimate aesthetic rankings of the AVA dataset. Further work lead to papers like NIMA **Lu et al., "NIMA: Neural Image Assessment"** where improvements to the loss functions were made to better represent diversity in aesthetic rankings, as well as increasing accuracy and correlation scores.

State of the art methods like MP_adam  **Ma et al., "MP-Adam: Optimizing Aesthetic Rankings with Multi-Phase Training"** and A-Lamp  **Jin et al., "A-Lamp: Attention-Based Deep Neural Networks for Image Aesthetics Prediction"** make use of patches, attention mechanisms, and significant hardware to focus in on specific aesthetic features attacking accuracy metrics. Pool-3FC  **Zhang et al., "Pool-3FC: Patch-based Progressive Fusion and Channel-wise Attention Mechanism for Photo Aesthetic Assessment"** pools features in a comparable way to also squeeze the most amount of information out of the source data.
