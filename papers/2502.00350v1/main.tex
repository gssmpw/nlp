\begin{abstract}
Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM) agents are revolutionizing 
Autonomous Software Engineering (ASE),
enabling 
automated coding, problem fixes, and feature improvements. 
However, localization -- precisely identifying software problems by navigating to relevant code sections -- remains a significant challenge. 
Current approaches often yield suboptimal results due to a lack of effective integration between LLM agents and precise code search mechanisms.
This paper introduces \nickname, an LLM agent framework that improves accuracy for software issue localization by integrating priority-based scheduling for LLM-guided action, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that \nickname
becomes the new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) in function match rate (65.33\%) on SWE-bench Lite.
It also improves the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by 6.33 percentage points through its patch generation integration.
%achieved an improvement of 6.33 percentage points on the final resolved rate of an open-source framework by integrating its patch generation.
