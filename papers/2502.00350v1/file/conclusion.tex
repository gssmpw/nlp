We presented \nickname, a framework designed to enhance software issue localization by incorporating innovative methodologies such as priority-based scheduling for LLM-generated actions, action decomposition with relevance scoring, and distance-aware context pruning to streamline the search process and improve localization accuracy. On the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, \nickname achieved a 65.33\% function match rate, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) for software issue localization. Furthermore, by integrating the patch generation component from another open-source framework, \nickname attained a final resolution rate of 41.00\%, achieving a 6.33 percentage points improvement over the original framework. These contributions not only advance the field of ASE but also provide a modular framework that may inspire future research in integrating LLMs with automated debugging systems.
