\subsection{Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation}
Research on audio-driven 3D motion generation has been an area of interest for decades, with methods evolving significantly over time.
Early approaches \citep{taylor2012dynamic, xu2013practical,edwards2016jali} relied primarily on procedural methods, which segmented speech into phonemes and mapped them to predefined visemes through handcrafted rules.
Although procedural methods provide explicit control over the generated animations, they typically require complex parameter tuning and fail to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world speaking styles.
As a result, procedural methods struggled to deliver animations that appeared both natural and adaptable to varying speech dynamics.
In recent years, learning-based approaches \citep{faceformer2022, codetalker2023, diffposetalk2024, danvevcek2023emotional, emotalk2023, yang2024probabilistic} have advanced rapidly, addressing these limitations and enabling more natural and expressive facial animations.
Additionally, some approaches \citep{yi2022predicting, ye2024real3d, zhang2023sadtalker, tan2024say} focus on directly generating talking head videos without explicitly modeling motion.
However, this limits their ability to integrate with motion-driven downstream applications, restricting their broader applicability.

\subsection{Autoregressive 3D Facial Motion Generation}
Autoregressive (AR) methods model the temporal sequence of facial motion in a step-by-step manner.
These methods typically leverage pre-trained speech model features \citep{baevski2020wav2vec, hsu2021hubert, kyutai2024moshi} as speech representations, which are subsequently mapped to 3D deformable model parameters or 3D meshes via neural networks.
For example, FaceFormer \citep{faceformer2022} autoregressively predicts the continuous facial motion parameters while MeshTalk \citep{richard2021meshtalk} learns a prior over categorical expression tokens.
CodeTalker \citep{codetalker2023} and MultiTalk \citep{multitalk2024} tokenize facial motions with a VQ-VAE and train a transformer decoder to predict subsequent motion tokens based on audio features.
Learn2Talk \citep{Zhuang2024learn2talk} augments FaceFormer with lip-sync and lip-reading losses, improving alignment with speech.
MMHead \citep{wu2024mmhead} provides text descriptions as an extra condition for controlling the generated motion. 
However, these methods also show limitations.
Temporal autoregressive modeling often under represents motion within each time window, leading to overly smooth lip movements and failing to capture the complex speech-to-motion mapping.
This issue becomes more pronounced with larger and more diverse datasets.
Additionally, many approaches \citep{faceformer2022, codetalker2023, multitalk2024} rely on a predefined set of style labels to reduce the complexity of the mapping, which limits their ability to adapt to new individuals and styles.


\subsection{Diffusion based 3D Facial Motion Generation}
Diffusion models \citep{ho2020denoising, zhu2023taming, alexanderson2023listen, facediffuser2023, ma2024diffspeaker, diffposetalk2024} have recently gained traction for generative tasks because of their strong modeling capacities.
FaceDiffuser \citep{facediffuser2023} conditions a diffusion model on audio features to predict displacements from a neutral template.
More recently, FaceTalk \citep{aneja2023facetalk} employs a diffusion model on expression coefficients with cross-attention to wav2vec2 \citep{baevski2020wav2vec} features, while DiffSpeaker \citep{ma2024diffspeaker} utilizes biased conditional attention for a diffusion-driven synthesis pipeline.
Scantalk \citep{scantalk2024} uses a DiffusionNet \citep{sharp2022diffusionnet} structure to overcome the fixed topology limitation and perform diffusion on arbitrary meshes.
Similarly, DiffPoseTalk \citep{diffposetalk2024} uses a diffusion-based transformer decoder to generate both expression and pose (blendshapes) conditioned on audio and learned style features.
Going beyond motion, LetsTalk \citep{zhang2024letstalk} adopts a spatiotemporal diffusion approach to synthesize entire video frames.
Although these methods generate high-fidelity and realistic facial motion, their iterative sampling steps can be computationally expensive and may limit real-time applicability.

In this paper, we leverage FLAME \citep{FLAME2017} as our motion representation and propose a novel autoregressive framework for speech-driven motion generation.
It not only outperform current diffusion models in generating facial motion, but it also achieves real-time speed and produce natural head poses.
A comparison of our method with existing approaches is shown in Table \ref{tab:comp_methods}.
Our method enables arbitrary style inference, allowing stylized motion generation at inference time by providing an example motion clip.
Additionally, our method generates both facial expressions and head poses while maintaining real-time performance.
