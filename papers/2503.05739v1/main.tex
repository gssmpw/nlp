\begin{abstract}
Understanding the complex dynamics of human navigation and spatial behavior is essential for advancing location-based services, public health, and related fields. This paper investigates the multifaceted relationship between individuals and their environments (e.g. location and places they visit), acknowledging the distinct influences of personal preferences, experiences, and social connections. While certain locations hold sentimental value and are frequently visited, others function as mere transitory points. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to exploit visitation patterns and dwell times to characterize an individual's relationship with specific locations. We identify seven key types of spatial relationships and analyze the discrepancies among these visit types across semantic, spatial, and temporal dimensions. Our analysis highlights key findings, such as the prevalence of anchored-like visits (e.g. home, work) in both real-world Singapore and Beijing datasets, with unique associations in each city -Singapore's anchored-liked visits include recreational spaces, while Beijing's are limited to residential, business, and educational sites. These findings emphasize the importance of geographic and cultural context in shaping mobility and their potential in benefiting the precision and personalization of location-based services.
