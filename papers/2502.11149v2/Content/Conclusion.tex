\section{Conclusion}

We present EquiLLM, a framework that synergizes the strengths of LLMs and geometric GNNs to address the dual challenges of $\mathrm{E}(3)$-equivariance and knowledge integration in 3D physical system modeling. By introducing geometry-aware prompting and a modular architecture that isolates invariant and equivariant processing, EquiLLM circumvents the inherent limitations of LLMs in spatial reasoning while enabling the infusion of domain-specific knowledge through flexible prompting strategies. The separation of roles—LLMs as invariant feature processors and geometric GNNs as directional information handlers—provides a principled approach to preserving symmetry constraints. In future work, we plan to explore optimal prompting strategies for better leveraging domain knowledge and extending this framework to broader scientific tasks. We hope the EquiLLM framework will serve as a valuable reference for applying LLMs in scientific domains.
