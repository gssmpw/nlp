\begin{abstract}
Creativity assessment in science and engineering is increasingly based on both human and AI judgment, but the cognitive processes and biases behind these evaluations remain poorly understood. We conducted two experiments examining how including example solutions with ratings impact creativity evaluation, using a finegrained annotation protocol where raters were tasked with explaining their originality scores and rating for the facets of remoteness (whether the response is ``far'' from everyday ideas), uncommonness (whether the response is rare), and cleverness. In Study 1, we analyzed creativity ratings from 72 experts with formal science or engineering training, comparing those who received example solutions with ratings (example) to those who did not (no example). Computational text analysis revealed that, compared to experts with examples, no-example experts used more comparative language (e.g., ``better/worse'') and emphasized solution uncommonness, suggesting they may have relied more on memory retrieval for comparisons. In Study 2, parallel analyses with state-of-the-art LLMs revealed that models prioritized uncommonness and remoteness of ideas when rating originality, suggesting an evaluative process rooted around the semantic similarity of ideas. In the example condition, while LLM accuracy in predicting the true originality scores improved, the correlations of remoteness, uncommonness, and cleverness with originality also increased substantially --- to upwards of $0.99$ --- suggesting a homogenization in the LLMs evaluation of the individual facets. These findings highlight important implications for how humans and AI reason about creativity and suggest diverging preferences for what different populations prioritize when rating. 

% In contrast, experts with examples used less comparative language and focused more on direct assessments of cleverness.

% \section{General Formatting Instructions}

% The entire content of a paper (including figures, references, and anything else) can be no longer than six pages in the \textbf{initial submission}. In the \textbf{final submission}, the text of the paper, including an author line, must fit on six pages. Up to one additional page can be used for acknowledgements and references.

% The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns with an
% overall width of 7 inches (17.8 cm) and length of 9.25 inches (23.5
% cm), with 0.25 inches between the columns. Leave two line spaces
% between the last author listed and the text of the paper; the text of
% the paper (starting with the abstract) should begin no less than 2.75 inches below the top of the
% page. The left margin should be 0.75 inches and the top margin should
% be 1 inch.  \textbf{The right and bottom margins will depend on
%   whether you use U.S. letter or A4 paper, so you must be sure to
%   measure the width of the printed text.} Use 10~point Times Roman
% with 12~point vertical spacing, unless otherwise specified.

% The title should be in 14~point bold font, centered. The title should
% be formatted with initial caps (the first letter of content words
% capitalized and the rest lower case). In the initial submission, the
% phrase ``Anonymous CogSci submission'' should appear below the title,
% centered, in 11~point bold font.  In the final submission, each
% author's name should appear on a separate line, 11~point bold, and
% centered, with the author's email address in parentheses. Under each
% author's name list the author's affiliation and postal address in
% ordinary 10~point type.

% Indent the first line of each paragraph by 1/8~inch (except for the
% first paragraph of a new section). Do not add extra vertical space
% between paragraphs.


% \section{First Level Headings}

% First level headings should be in 12~point, initial caps, bold and
% centered. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line space
% below the heading.


% \subsection{Second Level Headings}

% Second level headings should be 11~point, initial caps, bold, and
% flush left. Leave one line space above the heading and 1/4~line
% space below the heading.


% \subsubsection{Third Level Headings}

% Third level headings should be 10~point, initial caps, bold, and flush
% left. Leave one line space above the heading, but no space after the
% heading.


% \section{Formalities, Footnotes, and Floats}

% Use standard APA citation format. Citations within the text should
% include the author's last name and year. If the authors' names are
% included in the sentence, place only the year in parentheses, as in
% \citeA{NewellSimon1972a}, but otherwise place the entire reference in
% parentheses with the authors and year separated by a comma
% \cite{NewellSimon1972a}. List multiple references alphabetically and
% separate them by semicolons
% \cite{ChalnickBillman1988a,NewellSimon1972a}. Use the
% ``et~al.'' construction only after listing all the authors to a
% publication in an earlier reference and for citations with four or
% more authors.


% \subsection{Footnotes}

% Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
% footnote.} in the text. Place the footnotes in 9~point font at the
% bottom of the column on which they appear. Precede the footnote block
% with a horizontal rule.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}


% \subsection{Tables}

% Number tables consecutively. Place the table number and title (in
% 10~point) above the table with one line space above the caption and
% one line space below it, as in Table~\ref{sample-table}. You may float
% tables to the top or bottom of a column, and you may set wide tables across
% both columns.

% \begin{table}[H]
% \begin{center} 
% \caption{Sample table title.} 
% \label{sample-table} 
% \vskip 0.12in
% \begin{tabular}{ll} 
% \hline
% Error type    &  Example \\
% \hline
% Take smaller        &   63 - 44 = 21 \\
% Always borrow~~~~   &   96 - 42 = 34 \\
% 0 - N = N           &   70 - 47 = 37 \\
% 0 - N = 0           &   70 - 47 = 30 \\
% \hline
% \end{tabular} 
% \end{center} 
% \end{table}


% \subsection{Figures}

% All artwork must be very dark for purposes of reproduction and should
% not be hand drawn. Number figures sequentially, placing the figure
% number and caption, in 10~point, after the figure with one line space
% above the caption and one line space below it, as in
% Figure~\ref{sample-figure}. If necessary, leave extra white space at
% the bottom of the page to avoid splitting the figure and figure
% caption. You may float figures to the top or bottom of a column, and
% you may set wide figures across both columns.

% \begin{figure}[H]
% \begin{center}
% \fbox{CoGNiTiVe ScIeNcE}
% \end{center}
% \caption{This is a figure.} 
% \label{sample-figure}
% \end{figure}


% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Place acknowledgments (including funding information) in a section at
% the end of the paper.


% \section{References Instructions}

% Follow the APA Publication Manual for citation format, both within the
% text and in the reference list, with the following exceptions: (a) do
% not cite the page numbers of any book, including chapters in edited
% volumes; (b) use the same format for unpublished references as for
% published ones. Alphabetize references by the surnames of the authors,
% with single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
% references by the same authors by the year of publication, with the
% earliest first.

% Use a first level section heading, ``{\bf References}'', as shown
% below. Use a hanging indent style, with the first line of the
% reference flush against the left margin and subsequent lines indented
% by 1/8~inch. Below are example references for a conference paper, book
% chapter, journal article, dissertation, book, technical report, and
% edited volume, respectively.
