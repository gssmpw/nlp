%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
\heiner{Title is a bit long. It should be disaggregated KVS (not the) as there exist more than one KVS implementations. If you say decoupling, you must say decoupling of A and B. There have to be at least 2 things that are decoupled.}
\liuyi{Fixed it, we will formulate a new one after revising paper.}

Disaggregated memory systems achieve resource utilization efficiency and system scalability by distributing computation and memory resources into distinct pools of nodes. RDMA is an attractive solution to support high-throughput communication between different disaggregated resource pools. However, existing RDMA solutions face a dilemma: one-sided RDMA completely bypasses computation at memory nodes, but its communication takes multiple round trips; two-sided RDMA achieves one-round-trip communication but requires non-trivial computation for index lookups at memory nodes, which violates the principle of disaggregated memory. This work presents \sys, a novel indexing solution for key-value stores with a one-round-trip RDMA-based network that does not incur computation-heavy tasks at memory nodes. \sys is the first to utilize dynamic minimal perfect hashing and separates its index into two components: one memory-efficient and compute-heavy component at compute nodes and the other memory-heavy and compute-efficient component at memory nodes. 
%We design detailed to support data operations and system updates of \sys. 
We implement a prototype of \sys and evaluate its performance in a public cloud. The experimental results show that \sys achieves higher throughput than both the state-of-the-art one-sided RDMA and two-sided RDMA-based in-memory KVS by 1.06-5.03$\times$, due to the unique strength of applying a separated perfect hashing index. 
%We believe the decoupled index framework is an ideal solution for disaggregate memory systems.

\heiner{language is a bit hyperbole (redefine, unprecedented), please tone down.}\liuyi{fix them to ``offer'' and ``enhanced''.}
Disaggregated key-value stores offer distributed systems, separating storage from computation for enhanced flexibility, performance, fault tolerance, and resource efficiency by leveraging fast network technologies like RDMA.
\heiner{the two sentences do not connect, unclear what RDMA has to do with disaggregated KV. you need to first explain challenges that these KV systems face. Then you can say RDMA has been proposed to address these challenges. Then you can say RDMA suffers from x which is what you address. (every sentence has to build on top of the previous)}\liuyi{add RDMA as one of technology for Disaggregated KVS.}
Existing RDMA-based works have often surrounded the perception that two-sided RDMA (RPC) primitives significantly consume CPU resources on the remote server. 
\heiner{try to avoid subjective statements such as "criticism has often surrounded" its a claim that is hard to prove. Rephrase into objective statements, e.g. Existing RDMA-based systems}\liuyi{change to ``Existing RDMA-based works''}
However, our observation reveals that the reason is that there is too much computation imposed on the memory pool. \heiner{again unsubstantiated claim. You do not want to tell the reviwers what they commonly think. Stick with objective facts. e.g asy our experiments show that RDMA cannot solve the problems because of X (two-roundtrips?) and Y(limited memory?)} This finding offers a fresh perspective for reevaluating the bottleneck of the two-sided RDMA schemes with limited CPU resources.\liuyi{change to limitations of two-sided RDMA.}
To address the shortcomings of RDMA, we propose \sys, a novel scheme utilizing Minimal Perfect Hashing (MPH) to separate data lookup computation in a disaggregated KVS. By offloading most of the data lookup computation to compute nodes, we optimize throughput, enabling memory nodes to concentrate on memory access without taking care of extra computation. We also designed decoupled, pre-allocated, and shufflable MPH and partial locking mechanism to efficiently handle \texttt{Insert} requests and MPH resizing.  The extensive experiments demonstrate that \sys outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory KVS by 1.20-5.03$\times$ in the full data read workload on YCSB and real-world datasets.
\heiner{Is the focus on RDMA justified? We don't really leverage any RDMA technology, do we? I think your proposed design rather addresses B-Tree implementations. I would use this outline for the abstract:
1. Motivate KV 2. Describe a sota (b-tree/hash) based implementation and say that "as our experiments show these implementations show limited perf because of CPU overhead". (It is important that you discuss this sota first before RDMA, because it is unclear why RDMA has been proposed in the first place.) 3. RDMA has been proposed to address the compute overheads but it introduces 2 new challenges (2 roudntrips and limited memory). 4. We propose a design that provides both of 2 worlds: Low overhead of RDMA but implemented in the host CPU to address 2 roudntrips and memory limitations. 5. Results of proposed technique}\liuyi{We do use two-sided RDMA, which is RPC to build our work. RPC-Btree and RPC-hash are both we talked in this paper are both built on top of two-sided RDMA mode.}
