This section compares animated VR stories with general XR applications~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2022elements, liu2023challenges, krauss2021current}, proposes research opportunities, and acknowledges study limitations.

\subsection{\RR{Comparison between Animated VR Stories and General XR Applications}}

Recent studies have identified and discussed four phases to create general XR applications: requirement collection~\cite{borsting2022software}, designing and prototyping~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2022elements}, implementation~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2021current}, and testing~\cite{ashtari2020creating, liu2023challenges}. The ten stages identified in our study share some similar goals and activities with these phases but also exhibit differences.



Specifically, the six stages, from idea generation to design, are regarded as the pre-production phase of creating an animated VR story. Similar to requirement collection, designing, and prototyping in general XR creation, these stages focus on conceptualization and planning, gradually refining elements from low to medium fidelity~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2022elements}. 
However, they also differ significantly.
For example, general XR applications, which are often designed for functional purposes~\cite{ashtari2020creating} such as training and rehabilitation, necessitate a strong focus on end-user needs during requirement collection~\cite{borsting2022software}. Conversely, our results show that VR story creators often commence from a place of personal expression, curating content based on the stories they desire to narrate (Sec.~\ref{sec:idea_generation}). 
This unique narrative focus leads to distinct issues related to balancing narrative intent with view autonomy (\textbf{C1-1}), understanding VR story experiences (\textbf{C1-2}), and describing multi-element plots (\textbf{C2-1}). 
These issues delve deeper into the core of VR stories than findings about insufficient general guidelines~\cite{ashtari2020creating} and a lack of general references~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2021current} in prior XR research.

Asset development, scene assembly, and story integration are stages in the production phase. 
Similar to the implementation phase of general XR applications~\cite{krauss2021current}, the production phase also utilizes many tools (e.g., Unity, Blender) to transform designs into immersive VR experiences. 
However, there are several differences.
First, while general XR creators prioritize functionalities and interactions~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2022elements}, VR story creators make more efforts to achieve visual quality and aesthetics (Sec.~\ref{sec:asset_development}). Thus, we highlight issues related to satisfactory visuals and artistic expressions (\textbf{C3-1}, \textbf{C3-2}), which are not emphasized in previous XR studies~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2021current, krauss2022elements}. 
Second, VR story creators concentrate on specific and core VR story experiences, leading to unique issues in coordinating multiple story elements (\textbf{C5-1}) and switching between multiple narrative perspectives (\textbf{C5-2}).
Third, our results emphasize creators' efforts in \RR{adjusting design factors (e.g., colors, sizes, camera movement, and lighting configurations)} to enhance emotional impact (\textbf{C6-1}), \RR{while the emotional impact in VR has received limited attention in previous research~\cite{ashtari2020creating, krauss2021current, krauss2022elements}.}


The testing phase of general XR applications intersects with our evaluation stage, both aiming to verify that the final outputs function as anticipated. While the testing phase for XR applications encompasses various methods~\cite{liu2023challenges, borsting2022software}, including unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user testing, animated VR story creators do not perform these testing methods. Once their VR story experience operates seamlessly, they proceed to informal user evaluation to gather viewers' feedback.

\subsection{Limitations}

Firstly, our interviewees were neither XR experts nor novice XR creators. Most had formal art training with experience in 2D/3D animation and game development, often using game engines. Their backgrounds might influence their focus on the pre-production phase requiring more creativity, rather than production. Consequently, our findings primarily apply to creators with similar experience levels. Future research may include participants like non-professional artists or hobbyists without art and XR backgrounds, to understand if their challenges and needs differ.

Secondly, our interviewees usually collaborated with professional audio production teams or utilized existing online resources to design and develop audio elements. Consequently, their insights into audio aspects were limited and not thoroughly explored in our study. Future research may engage creators specialized in audio design, particularly those experienced in storytelling through sound, to uncover innovations in audio design for VR stories.

Thirdly, given the recent availability of VR devices and creation software, our interviewees were predominantly between 22 and 33 years old. This may have excluded seasoned creators, who might offer unique insights and deeper creative needs from their broader experience in non-VR fields. Future empirical studies may consider including seasoned creators, such as filmmakers or animators who possess a desire to delve into animated VR stories but have not had the opportunity to do so.
