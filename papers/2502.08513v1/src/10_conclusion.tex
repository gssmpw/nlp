\section{Conclusion}

Our study delved deeply into the creation processes and challenges associated with crafting animated VR stories. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 animated VR story creators. Through this, we identified ten stages that creators typically go through when creating animated VR stories. The inclusion and order of these stages can vary, leading to diverse workflows, which can be categorized as story-driven or visual-driven. Additionally, we highlighted nine unique issues that VR story creators encounter. Our findings complement existing research by offering a richer, more granular perspective on animated VR story creation. Based on the findings, we discuss several future research directions in supporting animated VR story creation.
