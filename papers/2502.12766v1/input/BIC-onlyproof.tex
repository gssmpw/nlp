\begin{proofof}{Proposition~\ref{prop:ic for uniform}}
The proof follows closely the proof of~\citet[Section E]{Fiduciary}; hence, we omit the details.

\begin{proofof}{Theorem~\ref{theorem: ic fee}}
$\ICSEGB$ is IR by design, as it only recommends the default arm, a greedy arm, or according to $\SEGB$. To analyze its social welfare, observe that after $K(1+{\eta}\E\left[\frac{1}{\delta}\right])$ phases in expectation, we only explore. This follows directly from Proposition~\ref{prop:i-d bounds}. Since the length of each phase is $B=\ceil*{\frac{H}{\xi \gamma}}+1$, there are at most $O\left(\frac{K \eta H \E\left[\frac{1}{\delta}\right]}{\xi \gamma}  \right)$ exploration rounds in expectation. To show it is BIC, we divide the analysis according to the agent's index. The analysis closely follows the proof of \citet[Theorem 3]{Fiduciary}, and is hence omitted.
