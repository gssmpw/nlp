  abstract = 	 {   We investigate the time complexity of SGD learning on fully-connected neural networks with isotropic data. We put forward a complexity measure,{\it the leap}, which measures how “hierarchical” target functions are. For $d$-dimensional uniform Boolean or isotropic Gaussian data, our main conjecture states that the time complexity to learn a function $f$ with low-dimensional support is $$\Tilde \Theta (d^{\max(\mathrm{Leap}(f),2)}) \,\,.$$    We prove a version of this conjecture for a class of functions on Gaussian isotropic data and 2-layer neural networks, under additional technical assumptions on how SGD is run. We show that the training  sequentially learns the function support with a saddle-to-saddle dynamic. Our result departs from Abbe et al.’22 by going beyond leap 1 (merged-staircase functions), and by going beyond the mean-field and gradient flow approximations that prohibit the full complexity control obtained here.Finally, we note that this gives an SGD complexity for the full training trajectory that matches that of Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower-bounds. }

  abstract = 	 {It is currently known how to characterize functions that neural networks can learn with SGD for two extremal parametrizations: neural networks in the linear regime, and neural networks with no structural constraints. However, for the main parametrization of interest —non-linear but regular networks— no tight characterization has yet been achieved, despite significant developments. We take a step in this direction by considering depth-2 neural networks trained by SGD in the mean-field regime. We consider functions on binary inputs that depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of coordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how neural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent low-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Accordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large ambient dimension $d$.  Our main results characterize a hierarchical property —the merged-staircase property— that is both \emph{necessary and nearly sufficient} for learning in this setting.  We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of functions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of learning efficiently. The key tools are a new “dimension-free” dynamics approximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of low-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity testing, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for non-almost orthogonal functions.}

  abstract = 	 {Significant theoretical work has established that in specific regimes, neural networks trained by gradient descent behave like kernel methods. However, in practice, it is known that neural networks strongly outperform their associated kernels. In this work, we explain this gap by demonstrating that there is a large class of functions which cannot be efficiently learned by kernel methods but can be easily learned with gradient descent on a two layer neural network outside the kernel regime by learning representations that are relevant to the target task. We also demonstrate that these representations allow for efficient transfer learning, which is impossible in the kernel regime. Specifically, we consider the problem of learning polynomials which depend on only a few relevant directions, i.e. of the form $f^\star(x) = g(Ux)$ where $U: \R^d \to \R^r$ with $d \gg r$. When the degree of $f^\star$ is $p$, it is known that $n \asymp d^p$ samples are necessary to learn $f^\star$ in the kernel regime. Our primary result is that gradient descent learns a representation of the data which depends only on the directions relevant to $f^\star$. This results in an improved sample complexity of $n\asymp d^2$ and enables transfer learning with sample complexity independent of $d$.}

  abstract = 	 {In mixed linear regression, each observation comes from one of L regression vectors (signals), but we do not know which one. The goal is to estimate the signals from the unlabeled observations. We propose a novel approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional limit. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic mean-squared error. This can be used to tailor the AMP algorithm to take advantage of any known structural information about the signals. Using state evolution, we derive an optimal choice of AMP ‘denoising’ functions that minimizes the estimation error in each iteration. Numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results, and show that AMP significantly outperforms other estimators including spectral methods, expectation maximization, and alternating minimization. Though our numerical results focus on mixed linear regression, the proposed AMP algorithm can be applied to a broader class of models including mixtures of generalized linear models and max-affine regression.}

  abstract =   {We consider the problem of signal estimation in generalized linear models defined via rotationally invariant design matrices. Since these matrices can have an arbitrary spectral distribution, this model is well suited for capturing complex correlation structures which often arise in applications. We propose a novel family of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for signal estimation, and rigorously characterize their performance in the high-dimensional limit via a state evolution recursion. Our rotationally invariant AMP has complexity of the same order as the existing AMP derived under the restrictive assumption of a Gaussian design; our algorithm also recovers this existing AMP as a special case. Numerical results showcase a performance close to Vector AMP (which is conjectured to be Bayes-optimal in some settings), but obtained with a much lower complexity, as the proposed algorithm does not require a computationally expensive singular value decomposition.}

  abstract = 	 {Mixed linear regression involves the recovery of two (or more) unknown vectors from unlabeled linear measurements; that is, where each sample comes from exactly one of the vectors, but we do not know which one. It is a classic problem, and the natural and empirically most popular approach to its solution has been the EM algorithm. As in other settings, this is prone to bad local minima; however, each iteration is very fast (alternating between guessing labels, and solving with those labels).    In this paper we provide a new initialization procedure for EM, based on finding the leading two eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. We then show that with this, a re-sampled version of the EM algorithm provably converges to the correct vectors, under natural assumptions on the sampling distribution, and with nearly optimal (unimprovable) sample complexity. This provides not only the first characterization of EM’s performance, but also much lower sample complexity as compared to both standard (randomly initialized) EM, and other methods for this problem.}

  abstract = 	 {Single-Index Models are high-dimensional regression problems with planted structure, whereby labels depend on an unknown one-dimensional projection of the input via a generic, non-linear, and potentially non-deterministic transformation. As such, they encompass a broad class of statistical inference tasks, and provide a rich template to study statistical and computational trade-offs in the high-dimensional regime.  While the information-theoretic sample complexity to recover the hidden direction is linear in the dimension $d$, we show that computationally efficient algorithms, both within the Statistical Query (SQ) and the Low-Degree Polynomial (LDP) framework, necessarily require $\Omega(d^{k^\star/2})$ samples, where $k^\star$ is a “generative” exponent associated with the model that we explicitly characterize. Moreover, we show that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by establishing matching upper bounds using a partial-trace algorithm. Therefore, our results provide evidence of a sharp computational-to-statistical gap (under both the SQ and LDP class) whenever $k^\star&gt;2$. To complete the study, we construct smooth and Lipschitz deterministic target functions with arbitrarily large generative exponents $k^\star$.}

We consider a \emph{high-dimensional} setting where $n,m \to \infty$ with $m/n = \mathcal{O}(1)$, and a large class of (possibly correlated) random matrices $\bPhi$ and observation channels. Spectral methods are a powerful tool to obtain approximate observations of the signal $\bX^\star$ which can be then used as initialization for a subsequent algorithm, at a low computational cost. In this paper, we extend and unify previous results and approaches on spectral methods for the phase retrieval problem. More precisely, we combine the linearization of message-passing algorithms and the analysis of the \emph{Bethe Hessian}, a classical tool of statistical physics. Using this toolbox, we show how to derive optimal spectral methods for arbitrary channel noise and right-unitarily invariant matrix $\bPhi$, in an automated manner (i.e. with no optimization over any hyperparameter or preprocessing function). }

This problem setting is motivated by the classical additive model literature, the recent representation learning theory of two-layer neural network, and large-scale pretraining where the model simultaneously acquires a large number of “skills” that are often \textit{localized} in distinct parts of the trained network. We prove that a large subset of polynomial $f_*$ can be efficiently learned by gradient descent training of a two-layer neural network, with a polynomial statistical and computational complexity that depends on the number of tasks $M$ and the \textit{information exponent} of $f_m$, despite the unknown link function and $M$ growing with the dimensionality. We complement this learnability guarantee with computational hardness result by establishing statistical query (SQ) lower bounds for both the correlational SQ and full SQ algorithms.}

  abstract = 	 { Polynomial regression is a basic primitive in learning and statistics. In its most basic form the goal is to fit a degree $d$ polynomial  to a response variable $y$ in terms of an $n$-dimensional input vector $x$. This is extremely well-studied with many applications and has sample and runtime complexity $\Theta(n^d)$. Can one achieve better runtime if the intrinsic dimension of the data is much smaller than the ambient dimension $n$? Concretely, we are given samples $(x,y)$ where $y$ is a degree at most $d$ polynomial in an unknown $r$-dimensional projection (the relevant dimensions) of $x$. This can be seen both as a generalization of phase retrieval and as a special case of learning multi-index models where the link function is an unknown low-degree polynomial. Note that without distributional assumptions, this is at least as hard as junta learning. In this work we consider the important case where the covariates are Gaussian. We give an algorithm that learns the polynomial within accuracy $\epsilon$ with sample complexity that is roughly $N = O_{r,d}(n \log^2(1/\epsilon) (\log n)^d)$ and runtime $O_{r,d}(N n^2)$. Prior to our work, no such results were known even for the case of $r=1$. We introduce a new \emph{filtered PCA} approach to get a warm start for the true subspace and use \emph{geodesic SGD} to boost to arbitrary accuracy; our techniques may be of independent interest, especially for problems dealing with subspace recovery or analyzing SGD on manifolds.}

We prove a strong universality result showing that Bayes-optimal performances are characterized by an equivalent Gaussian model with an effective prior, whose parameters are entirely determined by an expansion of the non-linear function.  In particular, we show that to reconstruct the signal accurately, one requires a signal-to-noise ratio growing as \(N^{\frac 12 (1-1/k_F)}\), where \(k_F\){is} the first non-zero Fisher information coefficient of the function.  We provide asymptotic characterization for the minimal achievable mean squared error (MMSE) and an approximate message-passing algorithm that reaches the MMSE under conditions analogous to the linear version of the problem.  We also provide asymptotic errors achieved by methods such as principal component analysis combined with Bayesian denoising, and compare them with Bayes-optimal MMSE. }

Our primary objective is to find an optimal spectral method, and to extend the celebrated (BBP) phase transition criterion —well-known in the homogeneous case— to our inhomogeneous, block-structured, Wigner model. We provide a thorough rigorous analysis of a transformed matrix and show that the transition for the appearance of 1) an outlier outside the bulk of the limiting spectral distribution and 2) a positive overlap between the associated eigenvector and the signal, occurs precisely at the optimal threshold, making the proposed spectral method optimal within the class of iterative methods for the inhomogeneous Wigner problem.}

  abstract = 	 { Modern large-scale statistical models require the estimation of thousands to millions of parameters. This is often accomplished by iterative algorithms such as gradient descent, projected gradient descent or their accelerated versions. What are the fundamental limits of these approaches? This question is well understood from an optimization viewpoint when the underlying objective is convex. Work in this area characterizes the gap to global optimality as a function of the number of iterations. However, these results have only indirect implications on the gap to \emph{statistical} optimality. Here we consider two families of high-dimensional estimation problems: high-dimensional regression and low-rank matrix estimation, and introduce a class of ‘general first order methods’ that aim at efficiently estimating the underlying parameters. This class of algorithms is broad enough to include classical first order optimization (for convex and non-convex objectives), but also other types of algorithms. Under a random design assumption,  we derive lower bounds on the estimation error that hold in the high-dimensional asymptotics in which both the number of observations and the number of parameters diverge. These lower bounds are optimal in the sense that there exist algorithms in this class whose estimation  error matches the lower bounds up to asymptotically negligible terms. We illustrate our general results through applications to sparse phase retrieval and sparse principal component analysis.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of parameter estimation in a high-dimensional generalized linear model. Spectral methods obtained via the principal eigenvector of a suitable data-dependent matrix provide a simple yet surprisingly effective solution. However, despite their wide use, a rigorous performance characterization, as well as a principled way to preprocess the data, are available only for unstructured (i.i.d. Gaussian and Haar orthogonal) designs. In contrast, real-world data matrices are highly structured and exhibit non-trivial correlations. To address the problem, we consider correlated Gaussian designs capturing the anisotropic nature of the features via a covariance matrix $\Sigma$. Our main result is a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of spectral estimators. This allows us to identify the optimal preprocessing that minimizes the number of samples needed for parameter estimation. Surprisingly, such preprocessing is universal across a broad set of statistical models, which partly addresses a conjecture on optimal spectral estimators for rotationally invariant designs. Our principled approach vastly improves upon previous heuristic methods, including for designs common in computational imaging and genetics. The proposed methodology, based on approximate message passing, is broadly applicable and opens the way to the precise characterization of spiked matrices and of the corresponding spectral methods in a variety of settings. }

  abstract = 	 { Low-rank matrix recovery problems involving high-dimensional and heterogeneous data appear in applications throughout statistics and machine learning. The contribution of this paper is to establish the fundamental limits of recovery for a broad class of these problems. In particular, we study the problem of estimating a rank-one matrix from Gaussian observations where different blocks of the matrix are observed under different noise levels. In the setting where the number of blocks is fixed while the number of variables tends to infinity, we prove asymptotically exact formulas for the minimum mean-squared error in estimating both the matrix and underlying factors. These results are based on a novel reduction from the low-rank matrix tensor product model (with homogeneous noise) to a rank-one model with heteroskedastic noise. As an application of our main result, we show that show recently proposed methods based on applying principal component analysis (PCA) to weighted combinations of the data are optimal in some settings but sub-optimal in others. We also provide numerical results comparing our asymptotic formulas with the performance of methods based weighted PCA, gradient descent, and approximate message passing. }
