\noindent\textbf{Workload Characterizing and Modeling.}
Early studies ____ explored workload patterns and focused on providing insights into performance and operational challenges in a corporate setting while also releasing modeled workloads (MixGraph ____ and YCSB ____), for the research community to use and learn. However, these workload characterization and modeling studies have relied solely on manual approaches performed by human experts.  
% Benchmark tools such as the Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) ____ further standardized the evaluation process, though their reliance on synthetic workloads limits real-world applicability.
More recently, automated techniques for workload modeling have emerged, leveraging machine learning to generalize across systems. While such methods have shown promise in domains like networking ____, they have not been applied to LSM-KVS.

\noindent\textbf{LSM-KVS Tuning and Optimization.}
Several studies have focused on tuning and optimizing LSM-KVS to balance performance and resource utilization. While shown to be effective, existing approaches like ADOC ____, RTune ____, K2vtune ____, Dremel ____, CAMAL ____, all focus on a subset of options and workloads using ML-based or heuristic approaches. For instance, ADOC focuses on modifying only two configuration options: the block size and the available resources for background processes. While this method effectively improves performance, it does not assist beyond certain workloads (e.g., write-heavy). In contrast, ELMo-Tune-V2 produces a design that leverages LLM to surpass the subset paradigm set by the current work. Further, our design encompasses an end-to-end solution that includes workload characterization and modeling, along with real-time tuning capabilities not showcased in any current design.

\noindent\textbf{LLM for LSM-KVS Tuning.}
Emerging studies ____ have explored using LLM for LSM-KVS tuning. For instance, Elmo-Tune ____ leverages LLMs to generate tuning recommendations by synthesizing knowledge of preset workload patterns, enabling an iterative tuning loop. Meanwhile, $\lambda$-tune ____ focuses on OLAP applications (e.g., Postgres) to optimize their configurations. Similar goals inspire our approach but differ in two key areas. Unlike both solutions, which rely on pre-trained LLMs for configuration synthesis, our methodology performs characterization and modeling of benchmarks to formulate an end-to-end solution. We diverge from the existing solutions by incorporating real-time tuning, a feature not considered by ELMo-Tune, and focusing on LSM-KVS, which faces very different workloads and more dynamic setups than OLAP applications that $\lambda$-Tune focuses upon.
