This paper addresses the pressing issue of liquidity fragmentation within Ethereum’s rollups by introducing UAT20, a universal abstract token standard. By leveraging Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), UAT20 ensures consistent and unified token states across multiple rollups, eliminating the inefficiencies and complexities caused by fragmented liquidity. The proposed two-phase commit protocol resolves conflicts arising from UAT20 transactions, ensuring \emph{eventual consistency}. Through an empirical analysis of liquidity fragmentation, this work provides a robust solution that enhances liquidity utilization, simplifies user interactions, and strengthens the foundation of Ethereum’s multi-rollup ecosystem, paving the way for a more seamless and efficient decentralized financial landscape.
