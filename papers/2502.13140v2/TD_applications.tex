\section{Applications in Biomedical Analysis}
~\label{sec:td_biomed}
Tensor decomposition extracts latent structures from high dimensional data and preserves interpretability of the features. This is critical in analyzing biomedical data to ensure the insights drawn from lower-dimensional factors are reliable and actionable, leading to biomarker discovery, prognosis, and developing therapeutics for complex diseases. 
% Preserving this interpretability in biological data is of critical importance to ensure the insights drawn from these analyses are reliable and actionable, which is essential when these results directly impact health and scientific discovery. Given the increasing volume and complexity of biomedical data, ranging from multi-omics profiles to high-resolution imaging and spatial transcriptomics, tensor decomposition offers a unique approach to uncover latent biological signals, integrate diverse datasets, and enhance interpretability in data-driven research. 

% \paragraph{Multi-omics} Tensor decomposition helps integrate heterogeneous biological data (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) by identifying shared and distinct molecular signatures across different biological layers. This improves biomarker discovery, patient stratification, and disease subtyping, leading to more personalized medicine approaches.  

% \paragraph{Medical imaging} For MRI, fMRI, and CT scans, tensor methods aid in denoising, feature extraction, and identifying disease-related patterns by decomposing images into meaningful components. This improves diagnostic accuracy and allows for better interpretation of underlying pathophysiological processes.  

% \paragraph{Spatial transcriptomics} Tensor decomposition is used to analyze high-dimensional spatial gene expression data, revealing underlying cellular structures and tissue organization. By capturing spatially varying gene expression patterns, it enhances our understanding of cell-cell interactions and disease microenvironments, such as in cancer or neurodegenerative disorders.  

%\paragraph{Topic modeling} 
To further explore the role of tensor decomposition in biomedical research, we used a topic modeling-based approach by employing BERTopic~\cite{grootendorst2022bertopic} to conduct an unsupervised analysis of the literature on tensor decomposition and biological data in PubMed. By leveraging transformer-based embeddings and topic clustering, we systematically identified key themes and research trends related to TD and its applications in biomedicine. %multi-omics, medical imaging, and spatial transcriptomics. 
The terms we searched were \say{tensor decomposition} in combination with (\texttt{AND}) the following terms: \say{genomics},
\say{transcriptomics},
\say{proteomics},
\say{metabolomics},
\say{epigenomics},
\say{microbiomics},
\say{multiomics} \texttt{OR} \say{multi-omics},
\say{cancer},
\say{cardiovascular disease},
\say{diabetes},
\say{alzheimer's disease},
\say{neurological disorder},
\say{autoimmune disease},
\say{kidney disease},
\say{obesity},
\say{medical imaging}. From those 16 terms, 536 documents were extracted from PubMed in the past ten years. This approach enabled us to identify dominant research areas, emerging applications, and potential gaps in the field, providing a structured overview of how tensor decomposition is being utilized across different biomedical domains.

Our analysis revealed a well-established use of TD in medical imaging, where it has been applied for tasks such as noise reduction, feature extraction, and disease pattern recognition~\cite{bustin2019high,Brender2019,Li2021,Zhang2017,Chatzichristos2019}(Figure~\ref{fig:sidebyside}A), with 218 articles cited over 1,400 times (Supplementary Table 1). This aligns with the long history of tensor methods in signal processing and image analysis. This is followed by applications in complex diseases such as cardiovascular disease~\cite{zhao2019detecting}, with TD methods used to factor ECG signals~\cite{liu2020automated} and X-rays~\cite{sedighin2024tensor}, among other applications. Similarly, TD methods have been used to analyze EEG~\cite{cong2015tensor} and neuroimaging data for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease~\cite{durusoy2018multi}, Parkinson's disease~\cite{pham2017tensor}, stroke~\cite{zhou2024tensor}, glioblastoma~\cite{yang2014discrimination}, etc. More recently, we observed a slight increase in the application of TD to multi-omics data, reflecting the growing need for integrative approaches in systems biology (Figure~\ref{fig:sidebyside}A). This trend highlights the increasing recognition of tensor methods as powerful tools for extracting meaningful patterns from high-dimensional, heterogeneous biological datasets.

To further interpret the structure of the identified topics, we visualized the document embeddings using UMAP, with topics color-coded for clarity (Figure~\ref{fig:sidebyside}B). This visualization revealed distinct topic clusters, highlighting distinct areas of research focus. The most represented topics were \say{\texttt{cell\_omics\_expression}}, \say{\texttt{diffusion\_imaging\_noise}}, and \say{\texttt{brain\_connectivity\_eeg}}, reflecting the strong presence of tensor decomposition in imaging-related applications. The \say{\texttt{cell\_omics\_expression}} topic encompassed studies leveraging tensor methods for multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics to analyze gene expression across cells and tissues~\cite{hore2016tensor,Omberg2007,Ramdhani2020,Wang2019}. The \say{\texttt{brain\_connectivity\_eeg}} topic captured research applying TD to neurological and electrophysiological data, particularly EEG and fMRI, for brain signal processing and cognitive studies~\cite{Li2021,Chatzichristos2019}. The \say{\texttt{diffusion\_imaging\_noise}} topic represented works focused on image denoising, enhancement, and reconstruction in medical imaging, further reinforcing the dominant role of tensor methods in this domain~\cite{bustin2019high,Brender2019,Li2021,Zhang2017,Chatzichristos2019}. More information on the other topic clusters are included in the Supplementary Tables 1-3.

This exploration highlights the significant role of TD in biomedicine, demonstrating its widespread application in medical imaging, multi-omics, and neuroscience. The increasing adoption of these methods emphasizes their value in extracting meaningful insights from complex biomedical data. Tensors are unique in their applications in multi-modal, multi-omics data because they have the ability to integrate these data sets, find linear and non-linear ineteractions between them, and extract meaningful latent representations which can be then used to perform downstream tasks~\cite{kolda2009tensor, luo2017tensor}. We provide a framework for integrating TD methods, including emerging methods such as quantum tensor decomposition in Figure~\ref{fig:qtd_framework}. Although insightful, this investigation is far from exhaustive and does not provide a holistic view on the literature with specific sub-areas such as genomics, MRI images, electronic health records (EHR), spatial transcriptomics, etc. having more applications of TD~\cite{hore2016tensor, olesen2023tensor, sedighin2024tensor, ho2014marble, song2023gntd}. Hence, we will focus on each of these sub-areas broadly categorized into biomedical imaging, multi-omics analysis, and spatial transcriptomics. 
%Looking ahead, we aim to explore the potential of quantum computing to further enhance tensor decomposition techniques, as quantum approaches may offer new computational efficiencies and capabilities for handling the ever-growing scale and complexity of biomedical datasets.
