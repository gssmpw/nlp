\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this paper introduces \modelname, an innovative model for object parsing that is rooted in a dictionary-based framework. A key aspect of \modelname is its emphasis on elucidating the intrinsic relationships between parts and objects, which significantly enhances the interpretability and consistency of parsing outcomes. Building upon an off-the-shelf cluster-based mask transformer, \modelname introduces the dictionary-based mask transformer by incorporating dictionary components. These components are associated with their corresponding classes in a fixed one-to-one manner. By implementing a component-wise contrastive algorithm and logical relation modeling, \modelname aligns its parsing predictions more closely with the underlying semantic hierarchy, akin to human cognitive processing. The consistency in prediction is further enhanced by the proposed post-processing function. This approach not only improves the accuracy of the parsing but also provides a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between part and object entities in images. As a result, \modelname sets the new state-of-the-art performances on PartImageNet and Pascal-Part-108 and surpasses prior arts by a non-trivial margin.
