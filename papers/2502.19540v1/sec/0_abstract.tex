In this work, we present \modelname, an interpretable and consistent object parsing framework based on dictionary-based mask transformer. Designed around \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{C}omponents and Logic\textbf{al} Constraints, \modelname rethinks existing cluster-based mask transformer architectures used in segmentation; Specifically, \modelname utilizes a set of dictionary components, with each component being explicitly linked to a specific semantic class. To advance this concept, \modelname introduces a hierarchical formulation of dictionary components that aligns with the semantic hierarchy. This is achieved through the integration of both within-level contrastive components and cross-level logical constraints. Concretely, \modelname employs a component-wise contrastive algorithm at each semantic level, enabling the contrasting of dictionary components within the same class against those from different classes. Furthermore, \modelname addresses logical concerns by ensuring that the dictionary component representing a particular part is closer to its corresponding object component than to those of other objects through a cross-level contrastive learning objective. To further enhance our logical relation modeling, we implement a post-processing function inspired by the principle that a pixel assigned to a part should also be assigned to its corresponding object. With these innovations, \modelname establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both PartImageNet and Pascal-Part-108, outperforming previous methods by a significant margin of 2.08\% and 0.70\% in part mIoU, respectively. Moreover, \modelname exhibits notable enhancements in object-level metrics across these benchmarks, highlighting its capacity to not only refine parsing at a finer level but also elevate the overall quality of object segmentation.
