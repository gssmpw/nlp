\subsection{Impact of number of samples per class on learnability}
\label{appendix:samples_per_class}
\new{The results from Figure~\ref{fig:miniimagenet_frac_dataset_accuracy} suggest that as the number of samples per class goes down, so does the accuracy.  This is the case with increased sharding for complex learning tasks.}
