\section{Discussion}
Our findings provide a nuanced view of how practitioners engaged in high-skill work have integrated GenAI to reshape their tasks, adjust their relationships, and ultimately shift their perceptions of their roles. These transformations also exposed practitioners to several underlying tensions, which we unpack here.
 
\input{5.1.Role-Identities}







% -- role identity shift (start with periphery but leaking core tasks to genai)
% -- inability to control what tasks people give--more and more dependency
% -- tension with high vs low-level skills
% --capacity building vs augmentation
% --balance between increased productivity or freeing time to do other tasks vs increasing pressure/pace demand due to speed of GenAI

% role reduction happening in two ways: one by increasing their capability, they are now less dependent on someone else and also less dependent on themselves


% 2. human-machine collaboration
