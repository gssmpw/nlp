\subsection{AI's Role in Work Transformations}

While the relationship between automation and work has long been studied,
Freeman et al., "The Impact of Technological Change on Industry Structure" argue that the impact of AI-driven trends on labor may be harder to predict.
Autor, "Does Automation Pose a Threat to Employment?" notes that automation tends to increase the value of complementary tasks where humans have comparative advantages.
% Autor, "What Do Migrants Really Want?" has argued that automation tends to complement tasks that it cannot substitute for, potentially leading to a bifurcation whereby automation hollows out middle tasks and creates demand for high-level abstract tasks and manual labor. However, Autor notes that machine-learning-driven AI, using inductive methods, diverges from traditional automation techniques in ways that might threaten tasks that utilize tacit knowledge, which traditionally have resisted automation. This raises the question of how and to what extent AI technologies might transform human work. 
%Through a quantitative lens, Park et al., "The Impact of Automation on Employment: Evidence from Task-Level Data" analyzed automation at a task level from 2008 to 2020, finding that machine control and hazardous tasks have become more automated, while systems analysis and creative and critical thinking have become less so ____.
However, a fair amount of work has also tried to answer this question through the experiences of workers in domains that have begun to integrate AI.
Early work in HCI suggests that, indeed, AI's limitations favor complementary transformations of work rather than simply displacing human labor. Fox et al., "Patchwork: The Invisible Labor That Emerges Around the Gaps Between AI Expectations and Reality" describe patchwork as a form of new invisible labor that emerges around the gaps between AI expectations and reality____.
This labor takes different forms, including \textit{compensating patchwork}, where humans fill in for AI when it breaks down, \textit{peripheral patchwork}, where humans watch over supposedly autonomous machines, and \textit{collaborative patchwork}, where a human works in concert with the AI to help adapt to contextual changes like the weather. However, how these changes will affect the dynamics of work across different professions remains to be seen.

%Workers also create patches--manual reconfigurations of AI systems to make them more reliable.
%In a similar vein, Levy, "The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation" observes that, while future models of automation in trucking may delegate more tasks completely to AI, the current reality is one of integrating AI into truckers' work through \textit{compelled hybridization} like smart wearable or camera systems to monitor fatigue while driving____.
% Outside the realm of manual work, Wang et al., "AutoAI: Automating Data Science Tasks" spoke to data scientists about the advent of AutoAI, which is geared towards automating data science tasks. Overall, they found that the data scientists viewed continued automation in their field as inevitable, but also believed that human expertise would never be fully displaced____.

% Overall, the evidence seems to suggest a near-term a divide between the vision of AI-driven automation in the workplace and the messy reality of how integrating AI into human work actually changes that work. With that said, the nature and availability of AI technologies in the workplace have drastically changed over the past two years with the rise of generative AI models. 

% \subsection{GenAI's Early Signs of Impact on Working Communities}

Rapid innovation in GenAI and their multi-modal task capabilities positions them to support professional work in new ways.
%such as hospitality ____,education ____, and manufacturing ____.
%____. 
Recent research predicts that almost 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10\% of their work tasks altered by GenAI technologies____,
exposing even high-skill roles to GenAI____.    

Two research narratives have emerged. The first has explored the potential of GenAI to bolster workers' tasks, skills, and outcomes. Experimental studies have indicated positive worker performance ____.
%For instance, an initial study with customer support agents using Gen AI reflected a 14\% increase in the number of issues that they resolved per hour____.
% A more recent study exploring the impact of GenAI tools on professional work in ten different job categories demonstrated at least 26 \% savings in their task duration____. Here, professional consultants in a controlled experiment either delegated portions of work or continually interacted with GenAI, indicating nuances in their GenAI usage. GenAI tools might also augment employees' creative processes by provoking idea generation through serendipity____.
Another stream of research has investigated shortcomings of GenAI technologies that negatively impact aspects of work. Recent studies have shown that professionals using GenAI may introduce biases and errors into their work processes, affecting the artifacts they produce %____.
More broadly, studies have argued the negative impacts of these micro-changes on the development of professional capacities, with a strong potential to dilute human skills such as creativity and critical thinking ____.

\subsection{HCI, Work, and Gen AI}
Several projects have already examined how specific communities or fields are engaging with GenAI. One question of interest is how practitioners in different fields are adopting such tools.
For example, Takaffoli et al., "Exploring the Adoption of GenAI by UX Designers" studying UX designers, found, among other things, that they used GenAI more for research tasks than design tasks, and more at an individual level than at a team level____.


Some projects focused on how GenAI becomes adopted in a given context. Boulus et al., "A Five-Stage Framework for Developing Augmentative Relationships with GenAI" identified five stages in developing a functional augmentative relationship with GenAI.
%(1) playing around, (2) infatuation, (3) commitment, characterized by more serious considerations of how to use the tool, including financial and ethical considerations, (4) frustration with the tool as continued use exposes limitations or friction due to changes in the human or the AI's behavior, and (5) enlightenment, characterized by realization and adjustment to the complementary imperfections of themselves and the tool.
____, meanwhile, found initial resistance among game design interns who were encouraged to use GenAI by program directors. Interestingly, they found that interns were more likely to embrace its use in programming tasks than artistic ones, considering ethics and quality.
%Their reasoning focused on ethical questions like ownership and agency, as well as variance between the quality of work produced by GenAI across the two domains. 
% The authors also found differences in perception of GenAI as a tool, rather than a threat to replace them____.

Others examined practitioner perceptions of how GenAI will transform their industries.
Li et al., "Exploring Practitioners' Views on the Impact of GenAI on UX Design" found that experienced UX designers were confident that their uniquely human abilities would relegate GenAI tools to assistive roles, but worried that increased usage of these tools could negatively impact junior designers____. In particular, they worried that pressure to keep up with the speed of GenAI  could lead to ``creativity exhaustion'' among human designers. 
%Kalving et al., through surveys, focus-groups, and interviews with designers, found a generally optimistic view of AI as a collaborator for human designers, couched in ethical concerns over issues like authenticity, and marked by an acceptance that designers would need to adapt, perhaps moving away from traditional UI design and focusing on uniquely human capacities like empathy for users____.

We were primarily interested in how practitioners are using GenAI on their own to transform the nature of work. Job crafting theory has been studied extensively with full-time employees in traditional organizational contexts across various domains ____. 
% Within these settings, studies have focused on both proactive and reactive crafting practices in specific work situations, such as  shaping identity ____, goal-setting ____, planning and scheduling ____, work-transitions ____, work-life balance ____, and developing professional relationships ____.
With recent transformations in job structures, job crafting has also been studied in contexts of non-traditional forms of work, such as gig work ____. 
% For example, ____ explored how female IT contractors craft their jobs to thrive in a male-dominated sector. Similarly, ____ found that gig workers who engaged in individual and collaborative job crafting behaviors indicated higher resilience.

Despite the burgeoning interest in job crafting, there is limited understanding of how AI technologies are shaping workers' crafting perspectives. Studying changing worker-led practices through the lens of job crafting in the advent of GenAI technologies is beneficial for multiple reasons. The job crafting lens allows us to position agency in the hands of the workers, the actual users of the GenAI technology. This framework also allows us to balance some of the techno-deterministic narrative surrounding the GenAI push with a social constructivist understanding of how individuals integrate GenAI into their work. Lastly, it provides a systematic approach to examine the nuanced sociotechnical practices at a micro-level.
