\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

This paper proposes \ours, a lightweight, plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with 3D VONs. \ours effectively extracts fine-grained discriminative features by attentively associating historical and motion features with the current feature space through Motion-Static Integration. We introduce a new temporal consistency metric to better analyze the effectiveness of \ours when combined with SOTA methods in long-term predictions. Extensive visualizations validate the noticeable deflickering effect in several challenging scenarios. Future work will explore the integration of explicit instance-level supervision in occupancy tracking.
