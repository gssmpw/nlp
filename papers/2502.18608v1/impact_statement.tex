\paragraph{Impact Statement.}
As outlined in prior research, watermarking plays a crucial role in addressing social issues such as detecting plagiarism, tracing text origins, and combating misinformation. Our work investigates vulnerabilities in LLM watermarking that could potentially be exploited by attackers to break the watermark mechanism, posing risks to the owners or users of the model. However, we believe that our research has a positive societal impact by revealing the current weaknesses of watermarking methods, highlighting the need for stronger, more reliable systems, and advocating for improved evaluation frameworks. Ultimately, this work contributes to advancing the field toward more effective LLM watermarking solutions.
