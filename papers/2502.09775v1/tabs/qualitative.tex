    \caption{\textbf{Qualitative comparisons.} \emph{CellFlow} generates significantly more accurate images that reflect the actual biological effects of perturbations compared to baselines. For example, Floxuridine inhibits DNA replication, leading to reduced cell density; AZ138 is an Eg5 inhibitor, causing cell death and shrinkage; Demecolcine destabilizes microtubules, resulting in smaller, fragmented nuclei. Columns 1–5, 6–7, and 8–9 correspond to samples from the BBBC021, RxRx1, and JUMP datasets, respectively. More drug's mode-of-action in \S\ref{sec:data}.}
