\section*{Impact Statement}
\label{sec:impact}
\emph{CellFlow} introduces a novel framework for modeling cellular behavior under genetic and chemical perturbations, which uses flow-matching to generate high-fidelity cellular images and predict phenotypic trajectories. This tool addresses critical challenges in experimental biology by providing scalable and interpretable computational models for studying perturbations at both single-cell and population levels. \emph{CellFlow} has the potential to accelerate therapeutic discovery and drug repurposing by rapidly screening compounds through in-silico simulations of cell responses to perturbations. Follow-up biology experiments would be directed toward the most promising candidates based on computational experiments. By modeling the space of genetic and chemical perturbations, \emph{CellFlow} can facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets and compounds, streamlining biomedical research. In addition to medical applications, \emph{CellFlow} can accelerate basic research into cell biology processes by modeling responses to genetic or chemical perturbations. However, we acknowledge that these are early attempts to model complex and dynamic biological systems, and future research with larger and more diverse datasets will improve performance. Furthermore, we are limited by current datasets that focus on a few cancer cell lines, which could introduce bias and may not fully represent normal physiology. We are committed to ensuring robustness in our models and mitigating biases to the extent possible, given the constraints of the dataset and the available training data. In summary, \emph{CellFlow} bridges machine learning and cellular biology, enabling new frontiers in virtual cell modeling, drug discovery, and systems biology research with broad implications for science and medicine.
