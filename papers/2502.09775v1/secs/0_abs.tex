Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce \emph{CellFlow}, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, \emph{CellFlow} models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effectsâ€”a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, \emph{CellFlow} generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35\% improvement in FID scores and a 12\% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, \emph{CellFlow} enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research.
