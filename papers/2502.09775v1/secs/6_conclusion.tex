\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduce \emph{CellFlow}, a method that leverages flow matching to generate cell images under various perturbations while capturing their trajectories, paving the way for the development of a virtual cell framework for biomedical research. In future work, we plan to scale up \emph{CellFlow} to process terabytes of imaging data encompassing diverse cell types and a wide range of perturbations, enabling the full potential of virtual cell modeling.
