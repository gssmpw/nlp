\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a method to separate superficial knowledge from deep knowledge within alignment, enabling us to quantify the the superficial portion of alignment. Our analysis finds that superficial knowledge indeed constitutes a large proportion of alignment, though not entirely.   Knowledge beyond the superficial, related to reasoning abilities and contextual integration, is also crucial to alignment. Additionally, our extracted superficial knowledge extends beyond mere analytical use, offering practical applications such as weak-to-strong superficial alignment and recovering compromised safety.
