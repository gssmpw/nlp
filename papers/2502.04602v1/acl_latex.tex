% Tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human feedback or preferences, namely alignment, is crucial for regulating LLM behaviors with human values. However, this process usually consumes substantial resources per model. Questions may arise about the value of extensive efforts, as recent studies suggest simpler and more cost-effective methods such as in-context learning can achieve similar results. And Urial proposes alignment mainly stylistic token shifts. This prompts us to question the superficiality of alignment. 
% Some researchers propose the hypothesis that alignment may involve mostly superficial knowledge, while deeper knowledge is primarily learned during pre-training.
% Although the effects of potentially superficial alignment have been observed, the extent of its superficiality remains uncertain. In this paper, we extract and analyze superficial knowledge from the aligned models to quantify its proportion. Our analysis shows that while superficial knowledge forms a significant part of alignment, it does not encompass all aspects. Knowledge related to reasoning and contextual integration also plays a crucial role in alignment. Additionally, beyond contributing to analysis, we find that our extracted superficial knowledge demonstrates properties that lead to unique advantages: (1) it is transferable across models, enabling efficient weak-to-strong offsite alignment; (2) it is recoverable after being disrupted, thereby enabling the restoration of alignment in compromised models.


Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences, often achieved through fine-tuning based on human feedback, is essential for ensuring safe and responsible AI behaviors. However, the process typically requires substantial data and computation resources. Recent studies have revealed that alignment might be attainable at lower costs through simpler methods, such as in-context learning. This leads to the question: Is alignment predominantly superficial? In this paper, we delve into this question and provide a quantitative analysis. We formalize the concept of superficial knowledge, defining it as knowledge that can be acquired through easily token restyling, without affecting the model’s ability to capture underlying causal relationships between tokens. We propose a method to extract and isolate superficial knowledge from aligned models, focusing on the shallow modifications to the final token selection process. By comparing models augmented only with superficial knowledge to fully aligned models, we quantify the superficial portion of alignment. Our findings reveal that while superficial knowledge constitutes a significant portion of alignment, particularly in safety and detoxification tasks, it is not the whole story. Tasks requiring reasoning and contextual understanding still rely on deeper knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate two practical advantages of isolated superficial knowledge: (1) it can be transferred between models, enabling efficient offsite alignment of larger models using extracted superficial knowledge from smaller models, and (2) it is recoverable, allowing for the restoration of alignment in compromised models without sacrificing performance.
