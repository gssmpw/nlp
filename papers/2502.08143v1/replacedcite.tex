\label{sec:RelatedWorks}
Due to the vast literature on BOBW and data-dependent bounds in various bandits learning settings, this sections presents only the most relevant works in multi-armed bandits.
A more comprehensive list of related works can be found in____ and references therein.

\textbf{Best-of-both-worlds bounds.} The BOBW bounds in our paper are derived using the SPM method for tuning learning rates in the FTRL framework, originally proposed in____. For stochastic bandits, our $O(\frac{K\ln{T}}{\Delta_{\min}})$bound  in Sections~\ref{sec:BOBWboundsSparseLosses} and~\ref{sec:SPMwOFTRLwReservoirSampling} matches that of____, and our $O(\sum_{i \neq i^*}\frac{\ln{T}}{\Delta_i})$ bound in Section~\ref{sec:CoordinateWiseSPM} matches that of____. 
Both of these bounds are looser than the $O(\sum_{i \neq i^*}\frac{\sigma_i^2 \ln{T}}{\Delta_i})$ in____ obtained by a more specialized approach, where $\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the losses of a sub-optimal arm $i$.
However, except for____, these existing works have an $O(\sqrt{T\ln{T}})$ worst-case bound for adversarial bandits, which contains an extra $\ln{T}$ factor compared to our work. 
Our BOBW bound also have data-dependent guarantees, which is an advantage over____. 
For bandits with sparse losses,____ similarly obtained bounds that are both BOBW and dependent on the sparsity constraint; however their bounds contain extra factors of $\ln(KT)$ in stochastic bandits and $\sqrt{\ln{T}}$ in adversarial bandits compared to our results.

\textbf{Data-dependent bounds.} We study the following data-dependent quantities: sparsity of losses, total variations and small losses. 
For bandits with sparse negative losses where $\norm{\ell_t} \leq S$ and $S$ is unknown, our $O(\frac{S\ln{T}}{\Delta_{\min}}, \sqrt{ST\ln(K)})$ BOBW bound is the first $S$-agnostic and $T$-optimal BOBW bound for this setting, which improves upon on the bound of____ and matches the best known bound for adversarial bandits in____.
When the total variations $Q, Q_\infty$ and/or the loss of the best arm $L^*$ (defined in Section~\ref{sec:ProblemSetup}) are small, our algorithms are based on the optimistic FTRL (OFTRL) framework similar to____. 
The dependency on $Q, Q_\infty$ and $L^*$ in our results match the best known bounds in these works, while our BOBW bounds have an optimal $O(\square\ln{T}, \square\sqrt{T})$ dependency on $T$. 
Particularly, our coordinate-wise real-time SPM algorithm in Section~\ref{sec:CoordinateWiseSPM} can be seen as a $T$-optimal variant of the algorithm in____, which share the idea of using separate learning rates for each arm.

% \textbf{Arm-dependent learning rates.} Existing works on \emph{decreasing} learning rates____, which require prior knowledge to set the initial values of these learning rates. We have the commonly seen increasing learning rates as done in____.
