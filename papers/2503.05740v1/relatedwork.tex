\noindent\textbf{AI-powered Chatbots for Seniors: }
Social interaction plays a crucial role in the cognitive health of seniors ~\citep{patil2024interventions,fiori2012impact}.

AI-powered chatbots have emerged as a promising alternative ~\citep{rodriguez2023qualitative,owan2023conversational}.

Recent efforts span commercial products \citep{seniortalk,elliq} and research prototypes focused on emotional support and audio assistance ~\citep{yang2024talk2care,liu2021towards,seniortalk,ryu2020simple,hong2024conect}. Unlike prior work, our approach prioritizes user conversational \textit{engagement}, which has been empirically shown to enhance both cognitive and emotional status.

\noindent\textbf{Conversational Strategies: }
%
\citet{liu-etal-2021-towards} curated a dataset with annotated strategies, demonstrating the effectiveness of Helping Skills Theory~\cite{hill2020helping} in providing emotional support. 
%
\citet{YUAN2023100384} examined the causal relationships between dialogue acts (DAs) and participantsâ€™ emotional states in a clinical trial \citep{iconect-detail}, emphasizing the impact of strategic interventions in tele-mediated dialogues.
%
\citet{seo2021learning} identified key strategies for improving child patient-provider communication through semi-structured interviews. 
%
{Few works have systematically integrated these strategies into the reasoning flow of AI chatbots. Our approach fills this gap by embedding structured conversational strategies for automatically enhancing user engagement.}

%
\noindent\textbf{Multi-turn chatbot exploration: } Recent advances in AI dialogue systems predominantly focused on short-turn interactions ~\citep{owan2023conversational,dam2024complete}. While some pioneering research has explored multi-turn optimization through Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for LLMs \citep{verma2022chai,zhou2024archer,abdulhai2023lmrl,gao2025regressing}, these methods were not specifically designed for supporting senior dialogue engagement. Our approach is  tuning-free yet compatible with RL-driven methods, enabling future extensions through hierarchical RL to further enhance multi-turn conversation engagement.
