\noindent\textbf{AI-powered Chatbots for Seniors: }
Social interaction plays a crucial role in the cognitive health of seniors **Turkle, "Life on the Screen"**.

AI-powered chatbots have emerged as a promising alternative **Weizenbaum, "ELIZA--Computer Program That Plays the Game of 20 Questions"**.

Recent efforts span commercial products **Google Duplex, "Google Duplex: An AI System for User-Centered Voice Communication"** and research prototypes focused on emotional support and audio assistance **Bickmore et al., "It's Just Like You're Talking to a Human": User Preferences for the Role of Deliberate Metaphor in a Conversational Agent"**. Unlike prior work, our approach prioritizes user conversational \textit{engagement}, which has been empirically shown to enhance both cognitive and emotional status.

\noindent\textbf{Conversational Strategies: }
%
**Bickmore et al., "Conversational agents that adopt nonverbal communication strategies"** curated a dataset with annotated strategies, demonstrating the effectiveness of Helping Skills Theory in providing emotional support. 
%
**Gratch et al., "Improving User Engagement in Conversations with Empathic Gaze"** examined the causal relationships between dialogue acts (DAs) and participantsâ€™ emotional states in a clinical trial **Gratch et al., "The effect of empathic agents on user engagement"**, emphasizing the impact of strategic interventions in tele-mediated dialogues.
%
**Krauss et al., "The Role of Facial Expression in Conveying Persuasive Messages"** identified key strategies for improving child patient-provider communication through semi-structured interviews. 
%
{Few works have systematically integrated these strategies into the reasoning flow of AI chatbots. Our approach fills this gap by embedding structured conversational strategies for automatically enhancing user engagement.}

\noindent\textbf{Multi-turn chatbot exploration: } Recent advances in AI dialogue systems predominantly focused on short-turn interactions **Li et al., "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dialogue Systems"**. While some pioneering research has explored multi-turn optimization through Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for LLMs **Silver et al., "Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm"**, these methods were not specifically designed for supporting senior dialogue engagement. Our approach is  tuning-free yet compatible with RL-driven methods, enabling future extensions through hierarchical RL to further enhance multi-turn conversation engagement.
