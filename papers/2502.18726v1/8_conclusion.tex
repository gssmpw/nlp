\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce \tool, a benchmark for deep learning tasks related to code generation. The dataset comprises 520 instances, gathered from the most starred and recently updated GitHub repositories. We categorize the data based on the pipeline stage, ML task, and input data type. 
%Multiple reviewers ensure the accuracy of our labels. 
Additionally, our quantitative analysis of the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs on \tool reveals that DL code generation is challenging and \tool can provide more insight to help improve the generation process.
Using our taxonomy of issues found in LLM-generated DL code, the qualitative analysis reveals the distinct challenges that LLMs face when generating DL code compared to general code as well as the similarities and differences between human-written and LLM-generated DL code.

%(GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 sonnet, Llama 3.1 70b, and Mistral 7b  categorizing pass@1 accuracy across different criteria. We also provide examples demonstrating the distribution and diversity of our benchmark.
% (melika) you can add that we plan to extend the experiments on different LLMs.
