\section{Threats to validity}

Even with the temperature parameter set to zero, our experiments still utilized non-deterministic models. While a lower temperature reduces randomness, it does not fully eliminate variability in the models' outputs~\cite{ouyang2023llm,song2024good}. Also, we sourced data from various repositories related to DL and AI but did not include all possible repositories or tags. Expanding the dataset could capture a wider range of use cases and code patterns. 

Data labeling was performed by four independent annotators, achieving strong inter-rater reliability. Despite this, some labeling conflicts persisted and were addressed through discussions to reach a consensus. However, not all discrepancies could be fully resolved. Also, even if we used the commonly used pass@k metric to evaluate model performance, prior research~\cite{shiri2024history} shows that passing all test cases does not guarantee complete code correctness, especially in edge cases.
