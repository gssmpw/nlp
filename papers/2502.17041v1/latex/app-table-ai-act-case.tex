\textbf{Question-Answer Chain from the Official Compliance Checker: } \\
(1) What kind of entity is your organization? \\
\hspace{3.5mm} Answer: Provider.

(2) Has a downstream deployer, distributor, or importer made any modifications to your system? \\
\hspace{3.5mm} Answer: Modifying the intended purpose of the system; performing a substantial modification to the system.

(3) Is the system used within the scope of Europe? \\
\hspace{3.5mm} Answer: It is placed on the EU market, and the output is used in the EU.

(4) Is the system excluded from the EU AI ACT (e.g., for military, research, or educational purposes)? \\
\hspace{3.5mm} Answer: No.

(5) Is the system a prohibited system? \\
\hspace{3.5mm} Answer: Yes, it incorporates biometric categorization and social scoring. \\
\textbf{Norm Type: } Prohibited (determined by the question-answer chain). \\

\textbf{GPT-4o Synthesized Case: }\\
The AI system, named 'EmotionSense', is a General Purpose AI model designed to perform emotion recognition and real-time remote biometrics. It is provided under free and open-source licenses. The system has undergone substantial modifications and its intended purpose has been altered since its initial deployment. EmotionSense is placed on the market and put into service within the European Union, and its outputs are utilized within the EU. The system is capable of analyzing facial expressions and physiological signals to determine emotional states in real-time. This functionality is used in various applications, including customer service, security, and healthcare. The system's deployment involves the collection and processing of biometric data from individuals without their explicit consent, raising concerns about privacy and data protection.\\
