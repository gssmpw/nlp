The workflow of our proposed \name. 
We decompose the transmission principle into multiple factors such as ``Purpose'' and ``Consent''. 
Given collected legal documents and court cases, we parse their CI parameters via \ding{192}, \ding{193} and \ding{195}.
Then, auxiliary knowledge bases are created in \ding{194} by creating hierarchical knowledge graphs about roles and attributes.
With the help of auxiliary knowledge bases, we may ground the case's contextual parameters to match the applicable regulations in \ding{196}.
Lastly, we may implement various in-context reasoning modules in \ding{197} to determine if the case meets existing privacy standards.
