\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to take advantage of clients' private data via secure MPC for FL. We demonstrate massive potential of this class of checks at enhancing FL robustness and adaptability to distribution shifts, while preserving privacy. Moreover, the capability of securely computing statistics over multiple data sources has its use beyond robust FL. It can help more applications such as data appraisal, personalized FL and etc. 

We do note that our work has significant room for improvement especially in scalability. Currently, scaling our protocol to more clients and larger models or datasets remains computationally intensive. In addition to developing more efficient secure inference techniques, especially for larger models, we hope that more robustness checks based on statistics computed with private client data will be proposed. Integrating our work with differential privacy is also an interesting direction, to provide output privacy. We welcome the community to join our effort.
