This study explores the use of LLMs as proxies for human behavior in rumor dissemination across diverse network architectures. 
Our findings demonstrate their practicality and scalability in network simulations. 
Moreover, we analyze the impact of network attributes and prompt configurations on rumor spread, contributing to the understanding of LLMs' role in modeling social interactions and information flow.

For future work, we plan to analyze a wider range of rumors and develop advanced agent personas for more realistic outcomes. 
We also aim to scale network sizes, explore mitigation strategies for rumor spread, and examine the role of additional LLM-based agents in shaping outcomes.
