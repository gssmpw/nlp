\section*{Limitations}

While our study provides valuable insights into the understanding of small model learnability gap in math reasoning, we acknowledge that our research primarily focuses on this specific domain and does not evaluate other crucial skills such as instruction following, code generation, or multi-modal understanding. We also did not investigate the impact of fine-grained variations in pre-training data composition on the small model learnability gap. A more detailed analysis of how different pre-training data sources and their proportions affect learning outcomes could offer valuable insights into optimizing data selection strategies for mitigating this gap.
