abstract = {This study investigates the impact of peripheral visual information in alleviating motion sickness when engaging in non-driving tasks in fully automated driving. A peripheral visual feedforward system (PVFS) was designed providing information about the upcoming actions of the automated car in the periphery of the occupant's attention. It was hypothesized that after getting the information from the PVFS, the users' situation awareness is improved while motion sickness is prevented from developing. The PVFS was also assumed not to increase mental workload nor interrupt the performance of the non-driving tasks. The study was accomplished on an actual road using a Wizard of Oz technique deploying an instrumented car that behaved like a real fully automated car. The test rides using the current setup and methodology indicated high consistency in simulating the automated driving. Results showed that with PVFS, situation awareness was enhanced and motion sickness was lessened while mental workload was unchanged. Participants also indicated high hedonistic user experience with the PVFS. While providing peripheral information showed positive results, further study such as delivering richer information and active head movement are possibly needed.}

abstract = {Motion sickness susceptibility questionnaires (MSSQ) predict individual differences in motion sickness caused by a variety of stimuli. The aim was to develop a short MSSQ. Development used repeated item analysis and various scoring methods. Retained were motion types (cars, boats, planes, trains, funfair rides, etc.); corrections for motion type exposure; sickness severity weightings; childhood versus adult experiences. Excluded were visual/optokinetic items (cinerama, virtual reality, etc.) with low sickness prevalence, they added little information but could become important in the future. Norms and percentiles were produced (n=257). Predictive validity used controlled motions (total n=178): cross-coupled (Coriolis); 0.2Hz frequency translational oscillation; off vertical axis rotation (OVAR); visual-motion simulator. Predictive validity for motion was median r=0.51. Relationship between MSSQ-Short and other non-motion sources of nausea and vomiting (e.g. headaches, food, stress, viral, etc.) in the last 12 months was r=0.2 (p<0.01). Reliability: Cronbach's alpha 0.87; test–retest reliability around r=0.9; Part A (child) with Part B (adult) r=0.68. MSSQ-Short provides reliability with an efficient compromise between length (reduced time cost) and validity (predicted motion susceptibility). Language variants include French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Flemish, German, Russian and Chinese.}

abstract = {Motion sickness comprises a set of symptoms, such as nausea, headaches, and disorientation, that affects healthy individuals when undergoing different types of motion, including virtual motion. The ways of mitigating motion sickness is a controversial issue as it strongly depends on variability among individuals due to anthropometric, physical as well as physiological traits, making it difficult to identify and derive a universal solution. With the introduction of autonomous vehicles, we are moving from car sickness, which is motion sickness induced when riding in cars, to autonomous car sickness, which arises from riding in autonomous vehicles. To ensure advancement of fully-autonomous vehicles, a comfortable experience must be provided to the passengers. An important factor that affects the acceptance of autonomous cars is the capability of passengers to perform non-driving tasks like reading, relaxing, and/or socialising in a comfortable style with no or limited motion sickness symptoms. Drivers, who never suffer from motion sickness while driving, might be, when riding as passengers in autonomous cars, susceptible to motion sickness due to the lack of controllability on the vehicle in addition to sensory conflicts. Therefore, in-depth investigations on the causes of autonomous car sickness are required. In this paper, we present different theories explaining the ‘how' and ‘why' of motion sickness and then discuss whether these factors are applicable to autonomous car sickness. The adaptation of different motion sickness predictors that can be used to limit autonomous car sickness are also discussed, with a proposal of a framework that provides a viable solution to mitigate autonomous carsickness.}

abstract = {Summary This chapter discusses three basic tools essential to understand structural equation models. They are model notation, covariances, and path analysis. Latent random variables represent unidimensional concepts in their purest form. The latent variable model encompasses the structural equations that summarize the relationships between latent variables. The measurement model has structural equations that represent the link between the latent and observed variables, as an imperfect rather than a deterministic one. Covariance is a central concept for the models. Contemporary applications emphasize three components of path analysis: (1) the path diagram, (2) decomposing covariances and correlations in terms of model parameters, and (3) the distinctions between direct, indirect, and total effects of one variable on another.}

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting users’ acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs, Level 3). A theoretical acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with new constructs: initial trust and two types of perceived risk (i.e., perceived safety risk [PSR] and perceived privacy risk [PPR]). It was hypothesized that initial trust was built upon perception factors (i.e., perceived usefulness [PU], perceived ease of use [PEOU], PSR, and PPR) and was a key determinant of AV acceptance. The validity of the model was confirmed with a structure equation modeling analysis based on data collected from 216 survey samples. Results revealed that initial trust was the most critical factor in promoting a positive attitude towards AVs, which, together with PU, determined users’ intention to use AVs. Initial trust could be enhanced by improving PU and reducing PSR associated with AVs. Theoretically, these findings suggest that initial trust offers another and probably more important pathway for other factors to impact consumers’ adoption of systems with uncertainty. Practically, the findings provide guidance for designing interventions aimed at improving public’s acceptance towards AVs.}
