Communication among agents in MARL was first introduced by Lauer, "Autonomous Agents"  and has since become an active research area due to its potential to enhance cooperation and improve task performance. The flexibility of communication protocols makes finding effective solutions for the MARL paradigm challenging____.
To address this difficulty, many studies have focused on optimizing communication components, such as message generators, message aggregators, and connectivity among agents, through end-to-end training____. From the sender side,

Recently, researchers have addressed challenges posed by real-world communication systems. Notably, Wang, "Noise-Tolerant Communication"  and Zhang, "Traffic Management in Multi-Agent Systems"  
 reduce communication costs by crafting succinct messages, while 
Foerster, "Attention-Based Communication" , Al-Shedivat, "Learning to Communicate" , Itoh, "In-Channel Information Encoding" , Cao, "Decentralized Training"  and Zhang, "Communication in Multi-Agent Systems"  
 manage overhead by pruning unnecessary communication links. Additionally, 
Wang, "Stochastic Coding" 
 propose a stochastic encoding/decoding scheme to handle noisy channels, and 
Zhang, "Delay-Aware Communication" 
 introduces delay-aware communication to account for the high latency of wireless channels.

Despite these advancements, scalability in communication mechanisms has been largely overlooked, often due to the quadratically increasing communication cost associated with fully-connected graphs as the number of agents grows. Although few works explicitly address the scalability issue, efforts to design communication topologies among agents offer potential solutions. These can be categorized into fully-connected, rule-based, and learned topologies. 
Early works____ typically adopt fully-connected topologies to demonstrate communication benefits, but at the cost of high bandwidth requirements. Later on, to reduce the overall communication overhead, 
Wang, "Scalable Communication"  and Zhang, "Traffic Management in Multi-Agent Systems"  
 restrict communication to nearby neighbors based on distance, while 
Liu, "Neural Communication" 
 limits communication to neighboring agents in networked MASs. In spite of achieving significant performance gains, their further applicability may be limited since they require extra information beyond local observation to determine the communication topology. In contrast, learned topology methods assume no such requirements and offer high flexibility. In particular, 
Foerster, "Attention-Based Communication" , Al-Shedivat, "Learning to Communicate" , Itoh, "In-Channel Information Encoding" , Cao, "Decentralized Training"  
 locally deploy gates for agents to decide if they should engage in communication. However, these methods may result in uncontrollable overall communication costs due to individual control schemes. Alternatively, 
Zhang, "Graph Attention-Based Communication" 
 utilizes graph attention mechanisms to learn the communication topology, while 
Cao, "Scalable Communication" 
 extends the idea and enables control over the overall communication sparsity. Although effective in small-scale MASs, peer-wise connectivity becomes increasingly difficult to learn in large-scale MASs, and high sparsity may impair performance, as discussed by Wang.

\paragraph{Exponential Graphs}
% \textcolor{blue}{Should I put this paragraph above the last one?}
Exponential graphs are a class of graph topologies that exhibit strong scalability properties with respect to the number of nodes. They have been primarily used in distributed learning to periodically synchronize model updates across devices. 
Kearns, "Distributed Learning" 
 investigate exponential graphs with gossip algorithms and achieve high consensus rates for decentralized learning. Follow-up works____ build upon this topology, optimizing model weight update algorithms and providing empirical evidence and theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of exponential graphs. Beyond distributed learning, exponential graphs also have applications in chip design____. Overall, exponential graphs demonstrate efficient information dissemination across many nodes, making them a promising candidate topology for achieving scalable communication in MARL. \looseness=-1
