\textbf{Omnidirectional Radiance Field}.
Neural radiance field (NeRF)____ has emerged as a powerful neural scene representation for novel view synthesis. NeRF represents a scene as a neural network with radiance and opacity outputs for each 3D point. Although most existing radiance field approaches____ can synthesize photorealistic novel views by learning from dense perspective image captures, they tend to suffer from inaccurate geometry reconstruction due to the limited field-of-view coverage and sparse view inputs. 
To achieve an immersive scene touring with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF),____ proposes omnidirectional radiance field learning from sparse 360-degree images with geometry-adaptive blocks, while some previous works incorporate 360-degree 3D priors for better geometry feature learning____. EgoNeRF____ employs quasi-uniform angular grids to enhance performance in egocentric scenes captured within a small circular area.
The recent 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) techniques parameterize radiance fields as explicit 3D Gaussians, significantly accelerating rendering and optimization____. 
With the efficient 3D-GS representation, concurrent OmniGS____ optimizes 3D Gaussian splats via sparse panorama inputs while 360-GS____ further exploits indoor layout priors for robust structure reconstruction. 

While panoramas offer a continuous and wide field of view for omnidirectional optimization, all discussed works focus on radiance field reconstruction merely from known camera parameters, which are vulnerable to inaccurate camera modeling.

% \subsection{Camera Model} radiance field models only consider a set of input perspective images
\textbf{Camera Model.} A camera model is a camera projection function that establishes a mathematical relationship between 2D images and 3D observation. Typically, camera models can be classified into two groups, including parametric camera models, e.g.____ and generic camera models, e.g.____. Parametric camera models assume in 3D vision that lens distortion is symmetrical radially and use high-order polynomials to approximate models of real lenses. Conversely, generic camera models exploit a mass of parameters to associate each pixel with a 3D ray and calibrate distortion. Recent neural lens modeling____ employs an invertible neural network____ to model lens distortion while its optimization is memory-consuming. 
In this paper, we propose a generic camera model tailored for the 360-degree camera.
