\subsection{Datasets}\label{app:datasets}
Here we provide a brief description of each dataset used for the mean estimation experiments in \cref{sec:real_data}. For additional details, the reader may refer to \citet{Angelopoulos2023}. All of the datasets were downloaded from the examples provided as part of the \texttt{ppi-py} package~\citep{Angelopoulos2023a}.

\paragraph{Alphafold.}
The \textsc{alphafold} dataset contains the following features for $N = 10802$ protein residues analysed by \citet{Bludau2022}: whether the residue is phosphorylated ($Z_i \in \{0,1\})$, whether the residue is part of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR, $Y_i \in \{0,1\}$), and the prediction of the AlphaFold model~\citep{Jumper2021} for the probability of $Y_i$ being equal to one ($f(X_i) \in [0,1]$). The goal is to estimate the odds ratio of a protein being phosphorylated and being part of an IDR region, i.e.
\begin{equation*}
    \theta^\star = \frac{\mu_1 / (1 - \mu_1)}{\mu_0 / (1 - \mu_0)},
\end{equation*}
where $\mu_1 = \mathrm{Pr}(Y = 1 \mid Z = 1)$ and $\mu_0 = \mathrm{Pr}(Y = 1 \mid Z = 0)$. Following \citet{Angelopoulos2023}, given $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, we construct $1 -
\alpha / 2$ confidence intervals $\mathcal{C}_0 = [l_0, u_0]$ and $\mathcal{C}_1 = [l_1, u_1]$ for $\mu_0$ and $\mu_1$, respectively. Then, by a union bound, the interval
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{C} = \left\{\frac{c_1}{1 - c_1} \cdot \frac{1 - c_0}{c_0} \colon c_0 \in \mathcal{C}_0, c_1 \in \mathcal{C}_1 \right\} = \left(\frac{l_1}{1 - l_1} \cdot \frac{1 - u_0}{u_0}, \frac{u_1}{1 - u_1} \cdot \frac{1 - l_0}{l_0}\right)
\end{equation*}
has coverage at least $1 - \alpha$.

\paragraph{Forest.}
The \textsc{forest} dataset contains the following features for $N = 1596$ parcels of land in the Amazon rainforest examined during field visits~\citep{Bullock2020}: whether the parcel has been subject to deforestation ($Y_i \in \{0, 1\}$) and the prediction of a gradient-boosted tree model for the probability of $Y_i$ being equal to one ($f(X_i) \in [0, 1]$). The goal is to estimate the fraction of Amazon rainforest lost to deforestation, i.e.~$\theta^* = \mathbb{E}[Y]$.

\paragraph{Galaxies.}
The \textsc{galaxies} dataset contains the following features for $N = 16743$ images from the Galaxy Zoo 2 initiative \citep{Willett2013}: whether the galaxy has spiral arms ($Y_i \in \{0, 1\}$) and the prediction of a ResNet50 model \citep{He2016} for the probability of $Y_i$ being equal to one ($f(X_i) \in [0, 1]$). The goal is to estimate the fraction of galaxies with spiral arms, i.e.~$\theta^* = \mathbb{E}[Y]$.

\paragraph{Genes.}
The \textsc{genes} dataset contains the following features for $N = 61150$ gene promoter sequences: the expression level of the gene induced by the promoter and the prediction of a transformer model for the same quantity \citep{Vaishnav2022}. The goal is to estimate the median expression level across genes.

\paragraph{Census.}
The \textsc{census} dataset contains the following features for $N = 380091$ individuals from the 2019 California census: the individual's age, sex, and yearly income, as well as the prediction of a gradient-boosted tree model trained on the previous year's raw data for the individual's income. The goal is to estimate the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression coefficients when regressing income on age and sex.

\paragraph{Healthcare.}
The \textsc{healthcare} dataset contains the following features for $N = 318215$ individuals from the 2019 California census: the individual's yearly income and whether they have health insurance ($Y_i \in \{0, 1\}$), as well as the prediction of a gradient-boosted tree model trained on the previous year's raw data for the probability of $Y_i$ being equal to one ($f(X_i) \in [0, 1]$). The goal is to estimate the logistic regression coefficient when regressing health insurance status on income.
