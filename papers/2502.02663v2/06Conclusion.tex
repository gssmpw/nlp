\section{Conclusions}

This paper presents U-GRAPH, a novel approach to the center of mass estimation with active perception. We design a pipeline that contains two main components: a Bayesian Neural Network that can provide prediction and its associated uncertainty, and an ActiveNet that produces an informed rotation based on the prior estimation. This approach reduces the need for repetitive grasping by replacing it with an efficient and effective rotation. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of U-GRAPH, which consistently outperforms traditional methods and adapts well to real-world scenarios.
