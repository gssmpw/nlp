abstract = {Recent advances in self-supervised models have led to effective pretrained speech representations in downstream speech emotion recognition tasks. However, previous research has primarily focused on exploiting pretrained representations by simply adding a linear head on top of the pretrained model, while overlooking the design of the downstream network. In this paper, we propose a temporal shift module with pretrained representations to integrate channel-wise information without introducing additional parameters or floating-point operations per second. By incorporating the temporal shift module, we developed corresponding shift variants for 3 baseline building blocks: ShiftCNN, ShiftLSTM, and Shiftformer. Furthermore, we propose 2 technical strategies, placement and proportion of shift, to balance the trade-off between mingling and misalignment. Our family of temporal shift models outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture dataset in fine-tuning and feature-extraction scenarios. In addition, through comprehensive experiments using wav2vec 2.0 and Hidden-Unit Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers representations, we identified the behavior of the temporal shift module in downstream models, which may serve as an empirical guideline for future exploration of channel-wise shift and downstream network design.}}

abstract = {The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is witnessing a rapid evolution in the field of emotion quantification. New possibilities for understanding and parsing human emotions are emerging from advances in this technology. Multi-modal data sources, including facial expressions, speech, text, gestures, and physiological signals, are combined with machine learning and deep learning methods in modern emotion recognition systems. These systems achieve accurate recognition of emotional states in a wide range of complex environments. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of research advances in multi-modal emotion recognition techniques. This serves as a foundation for an in-depth discussion combining the field of AI with the quantification of emotion, a focus of attention in the field of psychology. It also explores the privacy and ethical issues faced during the processing and analysis of emotion data, and the implications of these challenges for future research directions. In conclusion, the objective of this paper is to adopt a forward-looking perspective on the development trajectory of AI in the field of emotion quantification, and also point out the potential value of emotion quantification research in a number of areas, including emotion quantification platforms and tools, computational psychology, and computational psychiatry.}

abstract = {The last few decades have witnessed a revolution in the field of mental health, brought about by state-of-the-art techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we review the evidence for the systematic application of AI for the detection and intervention of stress-related mental health problems. We first explore the potential application of AI in stress detection and screening through advanced computational techniques of machine learning algorithms that analyze biomarkers of stress and anxiety. Building on the accurate detection of mental health problems, we further review the evidence for AI-based stress interventions and propose the promising prospect of applying decoded neurofeedback as a personalized resilience-building intervention. Together, the current review assesses the effectiveness and major challenges of AI technologies in real-world applications and demonstrates the transforming impact of AI on the field of mental health.}
