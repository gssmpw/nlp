\begin{abstract}

% In AI-assisted decision-making, AI often offers fixed suggestions disregarding human thoughts. In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in deciding whether to adopt AI recommendations when disagreements occur.
% To tackle this challenge, we propose \emph{Human-AI Deliberation}, a novel framework promoting human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. To enable deliberation, we design \emph{Deliberative AI} which leverages LLMs to bridge the domain-specific model and humans. To understand the effects of human-AI deliberation, we implemented our framework in a graduate admission task and conducted a between-subjects study (N=110). Results show that \emph{Deliberative AI} outperforms conventional AI assistants in improving humans' cognitive engagement and task performance. Based on a mixed-method analysis of participants' behaviors (dialogue dynamics and opinion changes), perceptions of AI, experiences, and open-ended feedback, we further derive a set of practical implications for designing better AI systems that can deliberate with humans.

% In AI-assisted decision-making, traditional AI systems often present fixed suggestions that users passively accept or reject as a whole, limiting opportunities for nuanced communication, particularly in cases of disagreement. To address this, we propose a novel Human-AI Deliberation Framework, inspired by theories of human deliberation, that supports dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates between humans and AI. Central to this approach is Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to facilitate flexible, conversational interactions and precise information exchange with domain-specific models. In a mixed-methods user study, we found that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) systems by enhancing appropriate human reliance and improving task performance. Based on in-depth analysis of participant behavior, perceptions, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we offer key design implications for future AI-assisted decision-making systems.


% In AI-assisted decision-making, traditional AI systems often present fixed suggestions that users passively accept or reject in their entirety, limiting opportunities for nuanced communication, especially in cases of disagreement. To address this limitation, we propose a \ms{\emph{Human-AI Deliberation} approach}, inspired by theories of human deliberation, which enables dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and iterative decision updates between humans and AI. Central to this approach is a new AI assistant, \emph{Deliberative AI}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to facilitate flexible, conversational interactions and enable precise information exchange with domain-specific models. In a mixed-methods user study, we found that \emph{Deliberative AI} outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) systems by promoting appropriate human reliance and improving task performance. Drawing from an in-depth analysis of participant perceptions, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we discuss key findings, potential concerns, and the generalizability of this framework for future AI-assisted decision-making systems.
Decomposition is a fundamental skill in algorithmic programming, requiring learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a \emph{``learner-LLM co-decomposition''} approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.
