\subsection{Target Environments}
% This subsection briefly outlines the reasons for selecting the eight target environments depicted in \figref{fig:road} and their key characteristics. An overview of the eight sequences is presented in \tabref{tab:sequence}.

\subsubsection{Mountain}
\texttt{Mountain} captures sequences on Gwanak Mountain, the highest elevation difference among all sequences. The route includes speed bumps and rough roads, causing significant rolling and pitching.


\subsubsection{Library}
% \texttt{Library} captures sequences from a long, narrow, one-way path near the library on campus. The route involves two loops for loop closure with sequences recorded in clear afternoon and cloudy night. The path is narrow and includes steep curves with uphill and downhill sections.

\subsubsection{Sports Complex}
\texttt{Sports Complex} captures sequences around a sports complex, including parking areas and roads with flat, gently sloped, and steep sections. Two loops with an average speed below 30 km/h were recorded during the day and night.
\subsubsection{Parking Lot}
\texttt{Parking Lot} captures sequences from a parking lot with many left turns, recorded on a clear afternoon and at night. While the ground appears flat, slight elevation variations are noted. This sequence has the shortest distance among all.
\subsubsection{River Island}
% \texttt{River Island} captures three sequences for multi-session place recognition, recorded during the day and dusk, with each route uniquely designed. The flat area features various driving paths, including intersections and two-lane one-way roads.

\subsubsection{Bridge}
\texttt{Bridge} captures sequences for place recognition research, driven back and forth along a four-lane overpass and the Wonhyo Bridge over the Han River. It includes sequences recorded on a rainy afternoon and cloudy dusk, with an average speed of \unit{60}{km/h}, and sections featuring traffic congestion in urban environments.
\subsubsection{Street}
\texttt{Street} captures a sequence of driving in heavy congestion and rain near IFC Seoul during rush hour. Due to the crowds and numerous vehicles, there are many dynamic objects, leading to frequent stops.
\subsubsection{Stream}
% \texttt{Stream} captures an S-shaped stream route that is driven during the day and night. One-way roads run along both sides of the stream, with U-turns via bridges. For place recognition research, intentional revisits were designed, resulting in similar environments.

 % Each sequence features distinct environmental characteristics, and multiple revisits to the same locations ensure sufficient queries for place recognition evaluation.

\subsection{Data Description and Format}

The file structure of the HeRCULES dataset is delineated in \figref{fig:file}. The acquisition time of
all measurements are stored in \texttt{datastamp.csv}. The FMCW LiDAR and 4D radar data are provided in \texttt{time.bin}, while the camera data is in \texttt{time.png}. For spinning radar data, we support software that converts raw polar images into Oxford-style \cite{barnes2020oxford} and Cartesian images. \ac{IMU}, \ac{GPS}, and \ac{INS} data are provided in \texttt{.csv}, and calibration information between sensors is available in \texttt{.yaml} and \texttt{.txt} format. The data types for each sensor are detailed in \tabref{tab:sensors}.

\subsection{Individual Ground Truth}
Before logging each sequence, we ensure that the GNSS solution is fixed and the INS solution has converged. We use \ac{PTP} to synchronize timestamps in \ac{UTC} across all sensors. However, spatiotemporal discrepancies arise due to differences in sensor mounting positions and data acquisition times.
To address this, we provide ground truth poses for each sensor to support place recognition research, handling spatial differences using extrinsic calibration results and temporal differences with B-Spline interpolation \cite{mueggler2018continuous}.
The ground truth is shown in \figref{fig:gtpose}, highlighting the importance of independently deriving ground truth pose for each sensor.
