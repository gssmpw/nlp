\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper we proposed a monolithically 3D printed bellow soft arm, integrating a \gls{vs} mechanism based on bead-jamming. The spherical beads were designed as to not interfere with the large native \gls{rom} (approximately \SI{90}{\degree}) when unjammed.

Experimental characterization shows that the proposed solution notably increases stiffness, reducing the sag of the arm in the presence of external loads. However, as a side effect, jamming also reduces the \gls{rom} of the arm. In this regard, we found that the actuation/jamming sequence affects the mobility of the actuator. To investigate this, we evaluated the effect of three different actuation/jamming sequences and selected the one with the least impact on the overall \gls{rom}.

Future work will focus on closed-loop control, allowing real-time stiffness adjustment to adapt the actuatorâ€™s behavior to task or environmental changes.
