\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a novel open-source pipeline for podcast transcription, annotation, and end-to-end fact-checking, addressing critical challenges in long-form audio content. By integrating real-time audio playback with interactive annotation, our tool streamlines the process of correcting transcription errors, identifying check-worthy claims, and resolving contextual ambiguities.
