    abstract = {Chapter 3 focuses on voice—in particular, how personal narratives become embedded in a political voice for many exiled groups. The author illustrates this tangled relationship in his fieldwork and then elaborates on it through the work of scholars who have written on the Harkis of France and on refugees in South Sudan. What becomes clear in these accounts is that personal narratives of exile provide a challenge to the understanding of what a narrative account means by the degree of a narrator’s investment in audience, testimony, witnessing, and a need to speak with unquestioned authority. The author also considers the narrative form many of these accounts take: hope.},

    abstract = "Reports of personal experiences or stories can play a crucial role in argumentation, as they represent an immediate and (often) relatable way to back up one{'}s position with respect to a given topic. They are easy to understand and increase empathy: this makes them powerful in argumentation. The impact of personal reports and stories in argumentation has been studied in the Social Sciences, but it is still largely underexplored in NLP. Our work is the first step towards filling this gap: our goal is to develop robust classifiers to identify documents containing personal experiences and reports. The main challenge is the scarcity of annotated data: our solution is to leverage existing annotations to be able to scale-up the analysis. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we conduct a set of in-domain and cross-domain experiments involving three datasets (two from Argument Mining, one from the Social Sciences), modeling architectures, training setups and fine-tuning options tailored to the involved domains. We show that despite the differences among datasets and annotations, robust cross-domain classification is possible. Second, we employ linear regression for performance mining, identifying performance trends both for overall classification performance and individual classifier predictions.",
