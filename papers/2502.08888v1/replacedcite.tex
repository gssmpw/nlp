\subsection{Rumor Detection} 

Early research on automatic rumor detection focused on pre-defined features or rules____ to train supervised classification models. To circumvent tedious feature engineering, subsequent studies proposed data-driven methods based on neural network models____ and multi-task learning frameworks____. Advanced approaches were then proposed to leverage propagation information____. 
% For instance, ____ exploited graph-based attention networks in the rumor detection task. 
% Recent advancements such as Adversarial Contrastive Learning____ have further enriched the field of rumor detection. 
% For example, ____ utilized event augmentation, while ____ and ____ employed Adversarial Contrastive Learning methods. 
% ____ incorporated prompt learning into the rumor debunking model, and both ____ and ____ applied transformer-based methods to strengthen the representation of rumor propagation trees, considering fine-grained post relations.
In this study, we formulate our approach based on a propagation structured model, with a specific emphasis on deducing post-level stances using weak supervision with only claim-level annotation. Drawing inspiration from the efficacy of propagation information, our methods are designed based on graph structure for incorporating social context information.

\subsection{Stance Detection} 

Manual analysis of stance has revealed a close relationship between specific veracity categories and stances____. Subsequent studies explored various hand-crafted features____ 
% or Gaussian process____ 
for training stance detection models. More recently, deep neural networks have been employed for stance representation learning and classification____.
% aiming to mitigate the need for feature engineering and enhance generalizability
% Some studies considered conversation structure, including tree-structured models____ and multi-task frameworks for the joint detection of rumors and stances____. 
% Research has also incorporated contrastive learning for stance detection____. 
% Presently, multi-target stance detection has gained attention from researchers. ____ introduced a target-adaptive graph, while ____ utilized a teacher-student model for the stance detection task. However, multi-target stance detection usually operates on clear targets, which does not align with the messy information characteristics found on real-world social media. Additionally, it often requires datasets annotated with stance labels specific to particular targets.
However, the aforementioned methods typically require a substantial stance corpus annotated at the post level for training. While several unsupervised models based on pre-defined models____ and unsupervised structural embedding____ for stance detection exist, their generalizability is consistently a critical concern due to their specific problem settings, reliance on manually crafted features.
% and the underlying models pre-trained for certain topics or tasks. 
In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised propagation model to concurrently classify rumor veracity and post stances on social media without the need for post stance labels. 

\subsection{Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)}

MIL is a form of weakly supervised learning designed to train a classifier with coarse-grained bag-level annotations to assign labels to fine-grained instances arranged in the bag____. 
% Subsequent research in the MIL domain introduced several variants by extending threshold-based, count-based, and weighted collective MIL assumptions to deduce the bag-level label____. 
In recent years, MIL has proven effective and found successful applications in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks____.
% such as user satisfaction analysis in Community Question Answering (CQA)____,
% customer services of E-Commerce____, text segment-level models for sentiment analysis____, 
% fashion outfit recommendation____, and recently misinforming sentence detection in fake news debunking____. 
However, the original MIL framework is specifically designed for the binary classification of instances lacking complex structures, and bag-level labels are expected to conform to instance-level labels. 
% Our primary challenge lies in devising a general framework capable of addressing the multi-class problem and overcoming incompatibility between bag and instance-level labels. 
In our work, we study an LLM-enhanced MIL framework to transform the multi-class problem into multiple binary classifiers, resolving the label incompatibility between bag and instance levels.

% ____ proposed a reinforced tuning framework based on LLM for joint stance and rumor detection,
____ and ____ utilized LLM for stance detection.
% ____ utilized an unsupervised framework with LLM for zero-shot stance detection. 
These methods primarily focus on directly predicting rumor or stance types using LLMs. %However, as generative models, the classification capabilities of LLMs remain relatively underexplored. So,
% Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) are a class of LLMs that have revolutionized artificial intelligence in recent years.

% \subsection{Transformer Networks}

% The transformer architecture has attracted increasing attention and demonstrated remarkable efficacy in sequence encoding and decoding tasks. A standard transformer architecture comprises encoder and decoder components. The key distinction lies in the decoder's use of masked self-attention to prevent tokens from attending to their future positions____. In this paper, we opt for the transformer encoder as our backbone.
% % as Figure~\ref{fig:TransEncoder} shows, 
% Diverging from previous sequence transduction models, each encoder has a stack of $N$ identical modules, discarding recurrence and convolution structures in favor of a multi-head self-attention module and position-wise feed-forward network (FFN). 
% % As Figure~\ref{fig:TransEncoder} shows, 
% Residual connections surround each module, followed by a normalization module. Notably, self-attention modules are employed to ensure that related words can be combined irrespective of their position. 
% Recent work has accentuated the transformer architecture's ability to effectively learn context-sensitive word representations, proving beneficial for various NLP tasks, such as pre-training word representation____, question answering____, machine translation____, and rumor detection____. Motivated by the success of the transformer in producing dense contextual embeddings, we develop an LLM-based rumor detection architecture to model the propagation structure of microblog posts and incorporate novel hierarchical attention mechanisms to jointly predict rumor veracity and stance labels.
