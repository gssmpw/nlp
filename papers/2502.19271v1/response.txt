\subsection{Multi-criteria Recommender Systems}

    Adopting MCRS is crucial for platforms seeking to enhance user satisfaction, engagement, and retention. Unlike traditional Recommender Systems  that rely on single criteria like ratings or item popularity, MCRS consider diverse factors such as user demographics, item attributes, temporal dynamics, and contextual information **Herlocker et al., "Algorithms for Personalized Recommendation"** allowing them  to deliver more personalised and contextually relevant recommendations, catering to the varied and evolving preferences of users. The rating data in a MCRS can be represented as a three-dimensional (3D) tensor, allowing factorisation of the tensor and higher order decomposition **Bennett et al., "Neural Network for Collaborative Filtering"**. The user similarity in recommender systems has advanced from single-criterion to multi-criteria approaches with the aid of fuzzy methods **Yao et al., "Fuzzy Relational Database Model"** which seeks to improve predictive accuracy and tackle the challenge of personalised recommendations amidst information overload. Multi-criteria collaborative filtering systems **Srivastava et al., "Multi-Criteria Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendations"**, such as those incorporating Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) **Jang et al., "ANFIS: Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System"** and Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) **Kohonen et al., "Self-Organizing Maps"**, aim to provide accurate recommendations by integrating user preferences across multiple dimensions. ANFIS combines fuzzy logic with neural networks to adaptively learn from user interactions and refine recommendations based on evolving preferences and contextual cues. ANFIS is primarily used for prediction tasks rather than classification. It combines the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks with the interpretability of fuzzy logic to model complex relationships and make predictions based on input data **Zadeh et al., "Fuzzy Sets"**. SOMs, on the other hand, leverage unsupervised learning to cluster items based on their similarity and user interactions, facilitating personalized recommendations within each cluster **Kohonen et al., "Self-Organizing Maps"**. Together, these methods enable MCRS to effectively handle the complexity of multidimensional data and enhance recommendation accuracy.
    
    MCRS often employ two-stage methods to enhance recommendation accuracy by estimating target item ratings and learning sub-score weights **Li et al., "Two-Stage Matrix Factorization for Recommendation Systems"**. These methods are designed to handle the complexity of multiple criteria involved in decision-making processes, ensuring that recommendations are tailored to diverse user preferences and requirements. Subsequently, deep learning models have been pivotal in advancing MCRS. Models like sparse autoencoders, which are tailored to balance criteria **Vincent et al., "Extracting and Ranking Relevant Patterns with Denoising Autoencoders"**, and deep neural networks applied to matrix factorization **Monti et al., "BinPool: Binarized Pooling for Deep Neural Networks"** have proven highly effective in enhancing recommendation accuracy. These approaches leverage the capacity of deep learning to handle complex interactions among multiple criteria, thereby improving the precision and relevance of recommendations. These methods leverage contextual information to improve relevance **Srivastava et al., "Context-Aware Recommendation System"** and consider multiple stakeholder preferences to boost overall performance **Zhang et al., "Personalized Recommendation with Multi-Objective Optimization"**. For instance, Shambour et al. **Shambour et al., "Deep Learning for Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems"** introduced a deep learning algorithm for multi-criteria recommenders, employing deep autoencoders to uncover intricate user preferences. Nassar et al. **Nassar et al., "Multi-Criteria Recommendation with Deep Learning"** integrated multi-criteria recommendation with deep learning, extracting features and utilising neural networks for correlation learning. These advancements underscore the potential of deep learning approaches in enhancing the capabilities of multi-criteria recommendation systems. Hong et al. **Hong et al., "Tensor-Based Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems"** introduced two single tensor models that incorporate users (or countries), items, multi-criteria features, and temporal information to capture user preferences over time. Li et al. **Li et al., "Multi-Task Learning for Multi-Criteria Recommendation"** developed a framework that enables multi-task learning for multi-criteria recommendation by integrating multiple criteria into a unified model.

    Wang et al. **Wang et al., "Deep Neural Networks for Personalized Recommendation"** introduced to enhance recommender system for  image active recommendation that harnesssed multi-modal information and high-order collaborative signals to aid in representation learning, while also capturing personalized user preferences in images.  Li et al.  **Li et al., "Multiview Social Recommendation with Graph Attention Networks"** introduced  multiview social recommendation for item recommendation from various perspectives  to take advantage of the complex relationships within social networks. It performs user-level preference learning for each user independently, without overlap. Chen et al.  **Chen et al., "Multi-View Representation Learning for Session-Based Recommendation"** constructed an authentic global graph derived from a multi-view representation of items and sessions based on a knowledge graph to extract global item-item relationships within the knowledge view for session-based recommendation.
    
\subsection{Recommender Systems based on Contrastive Learning}

    Contrastive learning **Wang et al., "Contrastive Learning for Recommendation"** is a powerful paradigm in machine learning that aims to learn representations by contrasting positive pairs (similar samples) and negative pairs (dissimilar samples) in a latent space. This approach leverages the idea that similar samples should be closer together while dissimilar ones should be farther apart, thereby facilitating the discovery of meaningful patterns and representations from data. The use of contrastive learning in recommender systems has increased, with various versions being implemented. By leveraging the strengths of contrastive learning, these systems aim to learn more robust and discriminative representations of user-item interactions **Wang et al., "Contrastive Learning for Recommendation"**.  Contrastive learning helps in distinguishing between positive and negative samples more effectively, thereby enhancing the quality of recommendations **Li et al., "Improving Recommendation with Contrastive Learning"**.
    
    Wei et al. **Wei et al., "Cold-Start Item Representation via Contrastive Learning"**  reframed the learning of cold-start item representations from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximize the mutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals. They introduce a new objective function based on contrastive learning and develop a straightforward yet effective framework for cold-start recommendations. Chen et al. **Chen et al., "Intent Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation"** introduced Intent Contrastive Learning to  integrate a latent intent variable into sequential recommendation that involves learning distribution functions of users' intents from unlabeled sequences of user behaviour through contrastive self-supervised learning.
    
    Yang et al. **Yang et al., "Knowledge-Adaptive Contrastive Learning for Recommender Systems"** introduced Knowledge-Adaptive Contrastive Learning that involves  data augmentation independently from the user-item interaction view and the knowledge graph  view, and applying contrastive learning across these two perspectives. The algorithm ensures that item representations encode information that is common across both views by incorporating a contrastive loss **Wang et al., "Contrastive Loss for Knowledge-Adaptive Contrastive Learning"**. Zhang et al. **Zhang et al., "Dual Contrastive Learning Recommendation Framework"** developed a dual contrastive learning recommendation framework. The first contrastive learning step promotes uniform distributions across users and items, while the second step aims to generate contrastive embeddings from output vectors **Li et al., "Contrastive Embeddings for Dual Contrastive Learning"**. Qin et al. **Qin et al., "Intent Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation"** introduced Intent Contrastive Learning  for Sequential Recommendation designed to capture users' latent intentions by segmenting a user's sequential behaviour into multiple subsequences using a dynamic sliding operation. These subsequences are then processed through an encoder to generate representations that capture the user's intentions **Chen et al., "Encoder for Intent Contrastive Learning"**.
    
    In this paper **Wang et al., "Supervised Contrastive Learning with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks"**, proposed a learning paradigm called supervised contrastive learning based on graph convolutional neural networks. Initially, during data preprocessing, they calculate the similarity between different nodes on both the user side and the item side. When applying contrastive learning, they consider not only the augmented samples as positive samples but also a certain number of augmented samples of similar nodes as positive samples **Wang et al., "Supervised Contrastive Learning with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks"**. Wei et al.  **Wei et al., "Multi-Level Cross-Modal Contrastive Learning for Recommendation"** proposed a recommendation framework called Multi-level Cross-modal Contrastive Learning. This framework aims to construct multi-level contrastive learning to fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal semantic information in a self-supervised manner. They consider user interaction and semantic review as two distinct semantic modalities and devise two modal-specific contrastive learning strategies to enhance intra-modal learning **Li et al., "Intra-Modal Contrastive Learning for Multi-Level Cross-Modal"**.
