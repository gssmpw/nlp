\begin{abstract}
The rapid advancement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has led to an exponential growth in research publications, creating an urgent need for efficient knowledge management and reasoning systems in this domain. We present a comprehensive knowledge-enhanced system for PSCs that integrates three key components. First, we develop Perovskite-KG, a domain-specific knowledge graph constructed from 1,517 research papers, containing 23,789 entities and 22,272 relationships. Second, we create two complementary datasets: Perovskite-Chat, comprising 55,101 high-quality question-answer pairs generated through a novel multi-agent framework, and Perovskite-Reasoning, containing 2,217 carefully curated materials science problems. Third, we introduce two specialized large language models: Perovskite-Chat-LLM for domain-specific knowledge assistance and Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM for scientific reasoning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms existing models in both domain-specific knowledge retrieval and scientific reasoning tasks, providing researchers with effective tools for literature review, experimental design, and complex problem-solving in PSC research.

\section{Introduction}
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising next-generation photovoltaic technologies, achieving remarkable progress with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 27.0\% within just over a decade \cite{NREL2025,snaith2018present,correa2017promises,wu2021main,ang2022comprehensive,sathaye2011renewable,bogdanov2019radical}. The rapid development of PSCs has generated an exponential growth in research publications, making it increasingly challenging for researchers to efficiently access and utilize the vast amount of knowledge in this field. This challenge is particularly acute given the complex interplay between material composition, fabrication processes, and device structure that characterizes PSC research.

Traditional approaches to scientific knowledge management, such as literature reviews and databases, while valuable, are limited in their ability to capture the intricate relationships between different aspects of PSC research~\cite{yang2024achievements,han2025perovskite}. Furthermore, existing artificial intelligence systems in materials science typically focus on either specific prediction tasks or general scientific knowledge, lacking the specialized capability to handle the unique characteristics of perovskite solar cell research~\cite{han2025perovskite}. This gap highlights the need for an integrated system that can both organize domain knowledge systematically and provide intelligent assistance to researchers. 


To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive knowledge-enhanced system specifically designed for the perovskite solar cell domain, consisting of three key components. First, we develop \textbf{Perovskite-KG}, a domain-specific knowledge graph constructed from 1,517 research papers, containing 23,789 entities and 22,272 relationships across manufacturing processes, parameters, and performance metrics. Second, we create a multi-agent framework for generating high-quality instruction-tuning data, which not only reduces annotation costs but also ensures high reliability and low hallucination through the synergy of multiple specialized agents and expert guidance. This framework generates two complementary datasets: (1) \textbf{Perovskite-Chat}, an instruction-tuning dataset comprising 55,101 high-quality question-answer pairs generated from 2,214 high-impact papers using a novel multi-agent framework, and (2) \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning}, a collection of 2,217 carefully curated materials science problems designed to enhance scientific reasoning capabilities. Third, we introduce two specialized large language models: \textbf{Perovskite-Chat-LLM} for domain-specific knowledge assistance and \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM} for tackling complex materials science reasoning tasks.

\noindent \textbf{Contributions.} Our work makes the following key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We construct the first comprehensive knowledge graph for perovskite solar cells, organizing domain knowledge into a structured format that captures the relationships between materials, processes, and device performance.
    \item We propose an effective multi-agent framework for generating high-quality instruction-tuning data, resulting in two specialized datasets: a diverse domain-specific dataset covering seven research categories and a focused reasoning dataset for enhancing scientific problem-solving capabilities.
    \item We develop and evaluate two specialized LLMs for perovskite solar cells that demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models: one optimized for domain-specific queries and another for scientific reasoning tasks.
    \item We provide extensive experimental results showing the effectiveness of our integrated system in supporting various research tasks, from literature review to experimental design and complex problem-solving in materials science.
\end{itemize}



\section{Related Work}

\subsection{LLM in Materials Science}
The convergence of language modeling and computational materials science has unlocked transformative potential for accelerated discovery. Recent breakthroughs in domain-specific architectures (e.g., hierarchical attention mechanisms \cite{kononova2021opportunities} and multimodal fusion networks \cite{swain2016chemdataextractor}) have addressed critical challenges in crystal structure prediction \cite{walker2021impact} and phase diagram analysis \cite{TREWARTHA2022100488}. As evidenced by the Materials Genome Initiative benchmarks \cite{Tshitoyan2019}, three principal research thrusts have emerged: (1) structured information extraction from heterogeneous corpora, (2) knowledge graph embeddings for composition-property relationships, and (3) neurosymbolic reasoning for synthesis pathway optimization.

Building upon these foundations, knowledge-enhanced systems have achieved state-of-the-art performance through two complementary paradigms: graph-based approaches employing heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) now attain 89.7\% accuracy on multi-hop material property queries \cite{an2024knowledgegraphquestionanswering}, while agent-based frameworks demonstrate 18.7\% improvement in autonomous experimental design through chain-of-thought prompting \cite{zhang-etal-2024-honeycomb}.

The field's maturation is further evidenced by systematic resource development: (i) The SciQAG framework \cite{wan2024sciqagframeworkautogeneratedscience} introduces a novel curriculum learning paradigm for generating 120K domain-specific QA pairs, reducing expert annotation requirements by 78\%; (ii) Standardized evaluation now spans chemical synthesis (ChemLLMBench's reaction yield prediction task \cite{guo2023largelanguagemodelschemistry}), biomedical applications (MultiMedQA's toxicity prediction challenge \cite{MultiMedQA}), and cross-domain reasoning (SciEval's materials-device co-design track \cite{sun2023scieval}).



\subsection{Knowledge Graph in Materials Science}
Domain-specific knowledge graphs have evolved into structured semantic frameworks that systematically consolidate heterogeneous multi-source data through machine-readable representations, enabling cross-domain knowledge integration to accelerate discovery pipelines~\cite{pan2024unifying,song2024scene,zhu2022multi}. 
In materials informatics, current implementations manifest two distinct paradigms: literature-derived systems exemplified by MatKG~\cite{venugopal2024matkg} and DISCOMAT~\cite{gupta2023discomat}, which employ NLP and graph techniques to extract material compositions from textual sources, while empirical architectures represented by MatSciKB~\cite{zhang2024honeycomb}, Propnet~\cite{mrdjenovich2020propnet}, MekG~\cite{statt2023materials}, and MOF-KG~\cite{an2022building} focus on encoding experimental provenance and computational models through graph-based representations of material lineages. 
However, these approaches face the challenges that manual curation processes with resource burdens, while existing extraction methods exhibit limited granularity in resolving complex synthesis-process-property relationships from unstructured text. 
To address these limitations, we propose an LLM-driven framework specifically optimized for perovskite materials research, featuring a hybrid architecture that synergizes domain ontologies with self-supervised relationship extraction, augmented by automated quality control pipelines that enforce materials science constraints. 

In this section, we collect $1,517$ paper in perovskite domain to build Perovskite-KG and design the automatic knowledge graph construction pipeline including three stages document filtering, knowledge extracting and knowledge graph organization~\cite{mrdjenovich2020propnet}, as shown in Appendix ~\ref{appendix:schema_in_Perovskite_KG}.





\subsection{Reasoning alignment}
Recent advances in parameter-efficient alignment have witnessed multiple research teams pursuing distinct methodologies to align the performance of o1~\citep{o1}. Contemporary approaches bifurcate along two technical axes: (1) reinforcement learning paradigms exemplified by DeepSeek-R1's adversarial preference optimization \citep{guo2025deepseek} and K1.5's multi-objective reward shaping \citep{k1.5}, versus (2) supervised fine-tuning strategies employing distilled datasets at scale ($\geq10^4$ examples) as demonstrated in \citep{sky_t1,xu2025redstardoesscalinglongcot,bespoke_stratos}. Notably, S1~\citep{s1} and LIMO~\citep{limo} operationalize the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis \citep{zhou2023lima} through curriculum-based sparse fine-tuning, achieving comparable reasoning capabilities with merely 1,000-2,000 carefully curated examples - a 92\% reduction in annotation costs relative to conventional SFT approaches.

% There are a number of concurrent efforts to build models that replicate the performance of o1~\citep{o1}. For example, DeepSeek-r1 and k1.5~\citep{guo2025deepseek, k1.5} are built with reinforcement learning methods, while others rely on SFT using tens of thousands of distilled examples~\citep{sky_t1,xu2025redstardoesscalinglongcot, bespoke_stratos}. S1~\citep{s1} and LIMO~\citep{limo} follow the "Superficial Alignment Hypothesis" presented in LIMA~\citep{zhou2023lima}, where the authors find that 1,000 and less examples can be sufficient to align a model to reasoning ability.
 
% We show that SFT on only 1,000 examples suffices to build a competitive reasoning model matching o1-preview and produces a model that lies on the pareto frontier (\autoref{fig:s1k-bar}). Further, we introduce budget forcing which combined with our reasoning model leads to the first reproduction of OpenAI's test-time scaling curves~\citep{o1}. Why does supervised finetuning on just 1,000 samples lead to such performance gains? We hypothesize that the model is already exposed to large amounts of reasoning data during pretraining which spans trillions of tokens. Thus, the ability to perform reasoning is already present in our model. Our sample-efficient finetuning stage just activates it and we scale it further at test time with budget forcing. This is similar to the "Superficial Alignment Hypothesis" presented in LIMA~\citep{zhou2023lima}, where the authors find that 1,000 examples can be sufficient to align a model to adhere to user preferences.

% 要详细说明schema (放附录)
\noindent $\bullet$ \textbf{Document Filtering}. 
Drawing upon expert knowledge, we have developed the schema for perovskite materials. 
This schema, shown in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:schema_kg}, integrates three ontologies $\{o_i \mid o_i \in \text{schema} \}$: fabrication, parameters, and performance.
The fabrication ontology encompasses the procedures and conditions required to synthesize perovskite materials. 
The parameters ontology defines the ingredients, structural components, and other compositional aspects of the device. 
The performance ontology is concerned with the efficiency and functional characteristics of perovskite devices.
Each ontology $o_i$ is further divided into sub-ontologies $so_i^{(j)}$, where $o_i = \bigcup_{j=1}^{n_i} so_i^{(j)}$ and $n_i$ represents the number of sub-ontologies within $o_i$. 
Each sub-ontology $so_i^{(j)}$ provides a domain-specific description, denoted as $d_i^{(j)}$, along with a corresponding data type, denoted as $t_i^{(j)}$, that is relevant to its particular scope.

For each sub-ontology $[ so_i^{(j)}, d_i^{(j)}, t_i^{(j)} ]$ (e.g., \textit{"Coating Parameter" - "Details about the coating method used in the material deposition process" - "Float"}), we create the prompts to query documents $D = \{ D_k \mid k = 1, \dots, m \}$ using a large language model.
These prompts facilitate the extraction of relevant information for each sub-ontology. 
The output $D_{\text{filtered}}^{(i, j)}$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
D_{\text{filtered}}^{(i, j)} = \{ D_k \in D \mid so_i^{(j)} \subset D_k \},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $D_{\text{filtered}}^{(i, j)}$ represents the set of filtered documents containing pertinent details for sub-ontology $so_i^{(j)}$ across the collection. 
This approach ensures a systematic and efficient retrieval of targeted information for each sub-ontology.

\noindent $\bullet$ \textbf{Knowledge Extracting}.
% 别忘了加点边引用关系，知识可以分成两大类，Intrinsic Knowledge and Intercitation Knowledge
% In this section, we define Perovskite-KG with two main types of knowledge: intrinsic knowledge ($K_{\text{intr}}$) and intercitation knowledge ($K_{\text{cite}}$). 
% The intrinsic knowledge ($K_{\text{intr}}$) is derived directly from the content of individual scientific papers based on an established schema, while the intercitation knowledge ($K_{\text{cite}}$) represents the information gathered from relationships and connections formed through citations between different scientific papers.
We employ a prompt function, denoted as $f_{\text{prompt}}(\cdot)$, to transform the sub-ontology $[so_i^{(j)}, d_i^{(j)}, t_i^{(j)}]$ into a document prompt, represented as $f_{\text{prompt}}(so_i^{(j)}, d_i^{(j)}, t_i^{(j)})$. 
To extract the potential domain knowledge $K$, we utilize a pre-trained large language model (LLM), expressed as $\text{LLM}(\cdot; \theta)$, under a zero-shot setting where the parameters $\theta$ remain fixed.
The whole pipeline can be formulated as below:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\scalebox{0.92}{$
K = \underset{D_{\text{filtered}}^{(i, j)}}{\text{search}} \; \; \text{LLM}(f_{\text{prompt}}(so_i^{(j)}, d_i^{(j)}, t_i^{(j)}); \theta),
$}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the search function $\text{search}(\cdot)$ may involve an argmax operation to identify the highest-scoring output or a sampling approach to generate outputs according to the probability distribution specified by the adopted $\text{LLM}(\cdot; \theta)$. 

After extracting knowledge, we conduct quality control procedures to ensure accuracy and reliability. These procedures include entity disambiguation and relationship deduplication.
Entity disambiguation in a knowledge graph aims to resolve ambiguity by identifying the unique entity that corresponds to an ambiguous mention, denoted as $e_{\text{mention}}$, within a subgraph. 
The objective is to determine a distinct entity $e^*$ that accurately represents $e_{\text{mention}}$.
Relationship deduplication involves identifying and merging redundant relations in the knowledge graph. For instance, given two relations $r_i = (e_1, r, e_2)$ and $r_j = (e_1', r', e_2')$, if they convey the same semantic meaning—that is, if $(e_1, e_2)$ and $(e_1', e_2')$ refer to identical entities and the relations $r$ and $r'$ are equivalent.


\noindent $\bullet$ \textbf{Knowledge Graph  Organization}.
We construct the Perovskite Knowledge Graph (Perovskite-KG) using a graph database. The Perovskite-KG consists of $23,789$ entities and $22,272$ relationships. By incorporating citation relationships between papers, we enable our LLM to provide references for its responses, enhancing credibility and reducing hallucination.

\section{Instruction Tuning Dataset Generation}

In this section, we collect $2,214$ the top level publications papers in perovskite domain and design the instruction tuning dataset including question answering and multiple choice questions, containing $55,101$ instances around 4.4 million tokens, named \textbf{Perovskite-Chat}. Our experiments show that our perovskite instruction tuning dataset can effectively improve the performance of LLMs on perovskite related tasks.

Figure \ref{fig:kg_pipeline} (b) illustrates this multi-agent framework for instruction tuning dataset generation. The process begins with expert guidance and academic literature from various sources (including Science, Nature, Elsevier, Springer, arXiv, and others) as inputs. The expert guidance is provided by the domain expert focus on 7 research categories, 21 research questions. Table \ref{tab:question_classification} further expands this classification by presenting 21 specific research questions (Q1-Q21) organized within these seven categories, more details can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:dataset_statistics}. These inputs feed into a multi-agent system: (1) an Information Extraction Agent that processes the raw content, (2) a Quality Validation Agent that ensures data accuracy and relevance, and (3) a Document Summarization Agent that condenses and structures the information.  This framework ensures systematic, high-quality data processing through multiple validation and refinement stages. 

Let $D = \{d_1, ..., d_n\}$ represent the collection of academic literature from various sources, and $E = \{c_1, ..., c_7\}$ denote the expert guidance categories with corresponding research questions $Q = \{q_1, ..., q_{21}\}$. The multi-agent framework processes these inputs through three specialized agents:

Information Extraction: 
\begin{equation}
A_{\text{extract}}(d_i) = \{x_1, ..., x_k\}
\end{equation}

Quality Validation: 
\begin{equation}
A_{\text{validate}}(x_j) = \begin{cases} 
1, & \text{if valid} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Document Summarization: 
\begin{equation}
A_{\text{summarize}}(X_{\text{valid}}) = y
\end{equation}

The final instruction tuning dataset $\mathcal{D}$ is constructed as:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D} = \{(q_i, y_i) \mid q_i \in Q, \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
y_i = A_{\text{summarize}}(A_{\text{validate}}(A_{\text{extract}}(d_i)))\}
\end{equation}

Next, we introduce \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning}, a collection of 2,217 high-quality questions from materials science textbooks, designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in perovskite and materials science domains. Similar to S1~\cite{s1} and LIMO~\cite{limo}, our dataset maintains data efficiency with fewer than 3,000 instances. The questions were sourced from hundreds of widely-used materials science and engineering textbooks, with a focus on perovskite solar cells and fundamental materials science concepts. Our rigorous selection process applied three key criteria: clarity of problem statements, solution completeness, and alignment with core materials science principles. Materials science professors conducted expert assessments to categorize questions by difficulty level, validated through student performance data and baseline model testing. To develop comprehensive solution paths, we employed advanced language models like DeepSeek-R1~\cite{guo2025deepseek} and O1~\cite{o1} in a multi-step reasoning approach. This methodology involved decomposing complex problems into logical steps, applying key physical and chemical principles, and implementing systematic solution strategies with result validation. The resulting dataset features detailed reasoning chains that demonstrate step-by-step problem-solving processes, making it valuable for training models in scientific reasoning and materials science problem-solving.




\paragraph{Training Dataset}
% Figure \ref{fig:question_categories_distribution} (a) illustrates the distribution of question categories in the instruction tuning dataset \textbf{Perovskite-Chat}. Device Structure represents the largest proportion at 43.9\% of all questions, followed by Performance Enhancement which accounts for 20.4\%. Device \& Recom. constitutes 13.1\% of the dataset, while Metrics comprises 8.2\%. The remaining categories - Stability, Materials, and Interface - make up smaller portions at 9.8\%, 2.9\%, and 1.7\% respectively. Figure \ref{fig:question_categories_distribution} (b) shows the wordcloud visualization of the most frequent terms in our dataset, where "perovskite solar" and "solar cell" emerge as the dominant phrases, reflecting the core focus of our research. Other prominent terms like "device structure", "configuration", and "stability" highlight the key technical aspects covered in the dataset. This distribution reveals a clear emphasis on device structural aspects in the dataset, with performance-related queries forming the second most prominent category.

Device Structure dominates with 43.9\% of all questions, followed by Performance Enhancement at 20.4\%. Device \& Recom. comprises 13.1\%, while Metrics accounts for 8.2\%. The remaining categories include Stability (9.8\%), Materials (2.9\%), and Interface (1.7\%). Figure \ref{fig:question_categories_distribution} (b) displays a wordcloud visualization of the dataset's most frequent terms, with "perovskite solar" and "solar cell" appearing as predominant phrases, reflecting the dataset's core focus. Other frequently occurring terms such as "device structure," "configuration," and "stability" underscore the key technical aspects addressed. This distribution demonstrates the dataset's strong emphasis on device structural aspects, with performance-related queries forming the second largest category.


% Figure \ref{fig:total_length_distribution} illustrates the length distribution patterns across different categories in our perovskite instruction tuning dataset. The distributions exhibit similar characteristics: the majority of sequences fall within the range of 100 to 500 tokens, with a median length of 400 tokens. This analysis provides crucial insights into the structural composition of our dataset and informs our model design choices, particularly for determining appropriate sequence length limitations and tokenization strategies. The independent normalization of each category's distribution enables direct comparison of distributional patterns regardless of the varying sample sizes across categories.

All categories display similar characteristics, with sequence lengths predominantly ranging from 100 to 500 tokens and a median length of 400 tokens. This analysis informs our model design decisions, particularly regarding sequence length limitations and tokenization strategies. The distributions are independently normalized for each category, enabling direct pattern comparison despite varying sample sizes.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Evaluation Dataset}
For better evaluation, we design the evaluation dataset including multiple choice questions and question answering in the perovskite domain. The evaluation dataset also extract from the top level publications in perovskite domain with our multi-agent framework and extral expert double check. The evaluation dataset contains 1,103 question answering named \textbf{Perovskite QA} and 1,103 multiple choice questions named \textbf{Perovskite MCQ}.

For question answering, we set the Rouge-L score and LLM-as-a-Judge~\citep{zheng2023judging} score as the evaluation metric. In our experiments, we find that the both metrics can effectively measure the quality of question answering and consistency with each other.

For multiple choice questions, we set the accuracy as the evaluation metric. And We using LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\citep{llama3} as the baseline model, the difficulty level of each question is determined by its zero-shot performance. Specifically, if LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct can correctly answer a question in a zero-shot setting (without any task-specific training or prompt engineering), we classify it as an "Easy" question. Conversely, questions that LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct fails to answer correctly are categorized as "Hard". This classification method resulted in 823 Easy questions and 280 Hard questions in our evaluation dataset, providing a balanced assessment of model capabilities across different difficulty levels.

For evaluate the performance of \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning}, we incorporated Minerva~\cite{lewkowycz2022solving} and GPQA Diamond~\cite{rein2023gpqa} as the benchmark. These contains undergraduate and PhD level science questions from Biology, Chemistry and Physics. 
\section{Perovskite-LLM}
\subsection{Experiment Design}
In this section, we conduct the instruction tuning experiments on the \textbf{Perovskite-Chat} and \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning} dataset. We select the LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct~\citep{llama3} and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct~\citep{yang2024qwen2} as the baseline model, and \textbf{Perovskite-Chat-LLM} and \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM} are fine-tuned version of LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with \textbf{Perovskite-Chat} and \textbf{Perovskite-Reasoning} dataset. 
%  add sentence about the performance of Perovskite-LLM

For the training process, we use the full parameter fine-tuning method to fine-tune the Perovskite-LLM. The experiment is conducted on the A800 GPU server, with flash attention~\citep{dao2023flashattention2} and mixed precision training for efficient training. For more details about the training process, please refer to Appendix \ref{appendix:instruction_tuning}.

For the evaluation process, we use the perplexity (PPL), Rouge-L score, and LLM-Judge score to evaluate the performance on the Perovskite QA benchmark, the accuracy to evaluate the performance on the Perovskite MCQ benchmark  to evaluate the performance of Perovskite-Chat-LLM. And the pass@1 rate on Minerva and GPQA benchmarks to evaluate the performance on the Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM. All experiments are conducted with zero-shot setting and three times to get the average results.

\subsection{Results and analysis}
\paragraph{Perovskite-Chat-LLM}
Table \ref{tab:val_qa_scores} presents the evaluation results of various models on the Perovskite QA dataset, comparing three key metrics: perplexity (PPL), Rouge-L score, and LLM-Judge score. The baseline models include GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o-Mini, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B. Among these, Perovskite-Chat-LLM demonstrates superior performance across all metrics, achieving a perplexity of 2.97, a Rouge-L score of 41.25, and an LLM-Judge score of 2.97. This represents a significant improvement over the baseline LLaMA-3.1-8B model, which scored 6.77, 13.18, and 1.28 respectively. The GPT family of models, while competitive in terms of LLM-Judge scores, showed lower performance in Rouge-L scores compared to Perovskite-Chat-LLM, with GPT-4o achieving 11.36 for Rouge-L and 1.41 for LLM-Judge. With case study in Figure \ref{fig:example_perovskite_llm_chatgpt}, we can see that Perovskite-Chat-LLM can generate more accurate and consistent answers compared to other models, and ChatGPT only can offer a general and not specific answer which lead to the low performance on Rouge-L and LLM-Judge metrics.

\paragraph{Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM}
Table \ref{tab:reasoning_benchmark} presents the evaluation results of Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM compared against various baseline models on the GPQA and Minerva benchmarks. In the 7B-scale model category, our Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance with remarkable data efficiency, requiring only 2K training examples compared to 800K for R1-Qwen2.5-7B and 114K for OpenThinker-7B. Our model achieves 43.95 on GPQA and 44.49 on Minerva, significantly outperforming other 7B models. When compared to 32B models, while our GPQA performance shows room for improvement (suggesting GPQA's sensitivity to model size), our Minerva score (44.49) is competitive with larger models like LIMO-32B (44.90) and approaches S1-32B (47.79). This demonstrates that our efficient training approach can achieve strong performance on STEM reasoning tasks even with a smaller model architecture.

\subsection{Case Study}
To illustrate the practical advantages of Perovskite-LLM over existing models, Figure \ref{fig:example_perovskite_llm_chatgpt} presents a comparative analysis of responses from Perovskite-Chat-LLM and ChatGPT to a question about high-efficiency perovskite solar cell fabrication. The responses demonstrate a clear distinction in the depth and specificity of knowledge provided by each model. For instance, Perovskite-Chat-LLM specifies precise conditions for the HTL preparation (150°C for 15 minutes) and details a two-step spin-coating procedure (1,000 rpm for 10 seconds, followed by 6,000 rpm for 30 seconds) with specific process modifications like anisole addition. This level of detail reflects Perovskite-Chat-LLM's specialized training on domain-specific literature and its ability to provide practical, implementation-ready guidance for researchers in the field. And Figure ~\ref{fig:perovskite_llm_cite_small} is a case study of Perovskite-Chat-LLM's ability to provide detailed and accurate information with references.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present a comprehensive knowledge-enhanced system for perovskite solar cell research, integrating three key components: (1) Perovskite-KG, a domain-specific knowledge graph containing 23,789 entities and 22,272 relationships; (2) multi-agent system for generating two complementary datasets, Perovskite-Chat and Perovskite-Reasoning, designed for domain-specific knowledge assistance and scientific reasoning respectively; and (3) two specialized large language models that demonstrate superior performance in both knowledge retrieval and reasoning tasks. Our experimental results show significant improvements over existing models, with Perovskite-Chat-LLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on domain-specific tasks and Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM showing competitive performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks despite using substantially fewer training examples. The system provides researchers with effective tools for literature review, experimental design, and complex problem-solving in PSC research. This work demonstrates the potential of large language models to accelerate innovation and discovery in perovskite materials science by enabling more efficient knowledge access and reasoning capabilities.


\section*{Limitations}
Despite the promising results, our current system has several limitations that warrant future investigation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Coverage}: While our knowledge graph covers a substantial portion of the PSC literature, it may not capture all emerging research directions and novel experimental techniques. Future work should focus on developing mechanisms for automatic knowledge base expansion and updates to maintain its relevance.
    
    \item \textbf{Reasoning Depth}: Although Perovskite-Reasoning-LLM shows promising results, its performance on more complex multi-step reasoning tasks still has room for improvement, particularly when compared to larger models on the GPQA benchmark. Future research will explore advanced reasoning architectures and training strategies.
    
    
    \item \textbf{Model Size Trade-offs}: While our 7B-parameter models achieve competitive performance, there might be certain complex tasks that benefit from larger model architectures, suggesting a potential trade-off between efficiency and capability. Future work will investigate model compression techniques and more efficient architectures.
\end{itemize}

To address these limitations, our future work will focus on three main directions: (1) developing a continuous knowledge integration framework that can automatically update the knowledge base with new research findings, (2) enhancing the reasoning capabilities through advanced model architectures and training strategies, and (3) improving the system's practical utility through better validation mechanisms and more efficient model designs. These improvements will make the system more robust, up-to-date, and accessible to the broader research community.

\subsection{Multi-agent systems}
The landscape of AI system architectures encompasses two distinct paradigms: multi-agent systems and autonomous agents ~\citep{zhuge2023mindstorms, hong2024data, jia2024mobile, wang2023voyager}. While autonomous agents rely on independent decision-making capabilities, multi-agent systems excel through structured collaboration between specialized components. The latter approach offers practical advantages by building upon established expertise rather than requiring complex behavioral modeling.

Research in multi-agent frameworks has evolved along two primary trajectories. The first focuses on domain-agnostic systems that leverage collective intelligence for general problem-solving ~\citep{wei2022COT, diao2023active, wang2022COTSC, madaan2023self, wang2023multipersona}. The second pathway explores domain-specific applications, with notable implementations in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Code generation and debugging ~\citep{sirui2024meta, Tal2024Alpha, li2024debug}
    \item Data analytics ~\citep{yu2024hai, yi2024gen, li2024dawn, zhou2023llm}
    \item Mathematical reasoning ~\citep{zhong2024achieving, xu2024lemur}
    \item Knowledge retrieval ~\citep{nori2023medprompt, zhou2024language}
\end{itemize}

Despite significant progress in identifying effective agent configurations for specific use cases, the field still faces the challenge of developing systematic approaches for new domains. This highlights the importance of research into automated methods for framework design and optimization.

\section{Schema in Perovskite-KG}
\label{appendix:schema_in_Perovskite_KG}

Table \ref{tab:schema_kg} presents a comprehensive schema for the Perovskite-KG, organized into three main ontological categories: Fabrication, Parameters, and Performance. The Fabrication ontology encompasses process-related attributes such as coating parameters, methods, and annealing conditions. The Parameters ontology covers structural and compositional aspects including solvents, device architecture, and additives. The Performance ontology captures various stability metrics and efficiency parameters like thermal stability, light stability, and power conversion efficiency. Each category is further detailed with specific data types and examples to ensure precise knowledge representation. This structured schema enables systematic organization and retrieval of perovskite solar cell information while maintaining data consistency across the knowledge graph.

\section{Prompts}
The system employs four specialized agents, each with carefully designed prompts to perform specific tasks in the perovskite solar cell knowledge processing pipeline:

1. \textbf{Information Extraction Agent} (Table \ref{tab:QuestionPrompts_agent_1}): Processes research papers using a structured set of 20 predefined questions across seven key categories, including device structure, performance enhancement, stability, and materials. The agent returns answers in a standardized JSON format, marking unavailable information as "Not mentioned" to maintain data quality.

2. \textbf{Verification Agent} (Table \ref{tab:VerificationPrompts_agent}): Validates extracted information by comparing it with source texts, focusing on maintaining accuracy of technical details like numerical values and material names. The agent provides both corrected content and justification for any modifications made.

3. \textbf{Organization Agent} (Table \ref{tab:OrganizationPrompts_agent}): Synthesizes verified information from multiple sources into coherent, topic-focused responses. This agent ensures that complex technical information is presented in a logical and accessible manner.

4. \textbf{LLM-Judge} (Table \ref{tab:LLM-JudgePrompts}): Evaluates response quality across four key criteria: accuracy, completeness, relevance, and clarity. Using a 1-5 scoring system, this agent provides detailed assessments and explanations for each criterion, along with an overall evaluation summary.

          To fabricate perovskite solar cells that can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25\%, several key steps and considerations are essential. First, the fabrication process should start with a clean and dry substrate, typically glass or flexible substrates, which are cleaned thoroughly using a combination of detergents and solvents. The substrates are then treated with UV ozone to enhance their wetting properties.

          For the hole transport layer (HTL), materials like PEDOT:PSS are commonly used. These materials are spin-coated onto the substrate and annealed at a temperature of \textbf{150°C} for \textbf{15 minutes}. The perovskite precursor solution is then prepared, typically using a mixed cation and halide composition, and spin-coated onto the HTL. The spin-coating process involves a two-step procedure: first at \textbf{1,000 rpm} for \textbf{10 seconds}, followed by \textbf{6,000 rpm} for \textbf{30 seconds}, with anisole added during the second step to facilitate crystallization.
          
          After spin-coating, the perovskite films are annealed at \textbf{100°C} for \textbf{10 minutes}. The electron transport layer (ETL) is then deposited, often using a solution of PC61BM in chlorobenzene, which is spin-coated at \textbf{1,000 rpm} for \textbf{30 seconds} and annealed at \textbf{100°C} for \textbf{10 minutes}. Finally, a metal electrode, typically gold, is deposited through thermal evaporation. The entire process is conducted in a nitrogen-filled glovebox to minimize exposure to moisture.

          To fabricate perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25\%, several key factors need to be considered and optimized in the fabrication process. Here are some steps that can help in achieving high-efficiency perovskite solar cells:

          1. Perovskite Material Quality: The quality of the perovskite material is crucial for achieving high efficiency. Use high-quality perovskite precursors and optimize the fabrication process to ensure uniform and defect-free perovskite films.
          
          2. Optimal Perovskite Layer Thickness: The thickness of the perovskite layer plays a significant role in determining the efficiency of the solar cell. Optimize the thickness of the perovskite layer to maximize light absorption and charge carrier generation.
          
          3. Tuning the Bandgap: By engineering the composition of the perovskite material, you can tune the bandgap to match the solar spectrum for better light absorption and improved efficiency.
          
          4. Interface Engineering: Pay attention to the interfaces between different layers in the solar cell structure. Optimize the interfaces to minimize recombination losses and improve charge carrier transport.
          
          5. Passivation Layers: Use passivation layers to reduce defects and trap states in the perovskite layer, which can improve the overall performance of the solar cell.
          
          6. Electron and Hole Transport Layers: Choose suitable electron and hole transport materials to facilitate efficient charge extraction and transport within the solar cell.

              Improving the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells involves several strategies. One effective approach is the use of thermally stable materials for the charge transporting layer, such as nickel oxide (NiO) and copper thiocyanate (CuSCN), which can enhance the thermal stability of the devices. Additionally, the incorporation of additives like 1,8-diodoctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) has been shown to improve the morphology of perovskite films, leading to better thermal stability. Furthermore, the use of thermally stable hole transport materials (HTMs) and electron transport materials (ETMs) is crucial, as they can withstand high temperatures without degrading the perovskite layer. The development of new HTMs, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), has also contributed to improved thermal stability. Lastly, the introduction of interfacial layers, like graphene oxide, can enhance the thermal stability of the perovskite layer by reducing defects and improving charge transport. \\

              Improving the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells is crucial for their long-term performance and reliability. Here are some strategies to enhance their thermal stability:

              1. Encapsulation: One of the most effective ways to improve the thermal stability of perovskite solar cells is to encapsulate them with protective materials. Encapsulation helps to shield the cells from environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, and heat, which can degrade the perovskite material.
              
              2. Improved Perovskite Composition: Researchers are constantly working on developing new perovskite compositions that are more stable at high temperatures. By tweaking the chemical composition of the perovskite material, it is possible to enhance its thermal stability. \\

                CuO refers to copper(II) oxide, a chemical compound that plays a significant role in various applications, particularly in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here are five key usages of CuO in perovskite technology:
                
                1. \textbf{Hole Transport Material}: CuO acts as an effective hole transport material (HTM) due to its suitable work function and high hole mobility. It is often used in conjunction with other materials, such as $\bm{NiO_x}$, to enhance the performance of PSCs by facilitating efficient charge extraction [1].
                
                2. \textbf{Interface Optimization}: The use of CuO helps in optimizing the interfaces within perovskite solar cells. By depositing CuO films on top of perovskite layers, it can improve the interfacial properties and reduce recombination losses at these critical junctions[2]. 
                
                3. \textbf{Thermal Stability Enhancement}: Copper oxide (CuO) has been shown to provide thermal stability to perovskite materials, which is crucial for maintaining high efficiency during prolonged operation under elevated temperatures. This property makes it an attractive choice for applications where environmental stability is a concern [3].
                
                4. \textbf{Doping and Passivation}: CuO can be utilized as a dopant in other materials used in PSCs, such as SnO2, enhancing their electrical properties like conductivity and mobility. Additionally, the doping effects can lead to improved passivation of defects at the perovskite layer, contributing to better performance metrics [4].
                
                5. \textbf{Integration with Other Materials}: In bifacial solar cells, CuO has been integrated with materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to create high-performance architectures that benefit from synergistic effects. This integration not only enhances charge transport but also improves the overall efficiency of the devices [5]. \\
