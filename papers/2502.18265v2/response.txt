From an algorithmic viewpoint, the greedy algorithm of Nemhauser et al. **Nemhauser**, "Maximizing Submodular Functions" gives an approximation ratio of $e/(e-1)$ for the algorithmic problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a knapsack constraint **Kalai**, and this approximation guarantee is best possible in polynomial-time  **Feldman et al.**, under standard complexity assumptions. More recently, Badanidiyuru et al. **Badanidiyuru et al.** presented a $(9/8+\eps)$-approximation with  polynomially many demand queries.

Singer **Singer** was the first to study the approximability of budget-feasible procurement auctions by truthful mechanisms and presented a randomized $O(1)$-approximation for monotone submodular valuations. Subsequently, Chen et al. **Chen et al.** significantly improved the approximation ratio to $7.91$ (resp. $3$) for randomized and $8.34$ (resp. $2+\sqrt{2}$) for deterministic mechanisms when the buyer's valuation is monotone submodular (resp. additive), using a greedy (resp. knapsack) based strategy. Chen et al. also proved an unconditional lower bound of $1+\sqrt{2}$ (resp. $2$) on the approximability of budget-feasible auctions with additive values by deterministic truthful (resp. randomized universally truthful) mechanisms. For additive values, Gravin et al. **Gravin et al.** matched the best possible approximation ratio of $2$ for randomized mechanisms and presented a $3$-approximate deterministic mechanism. Anari et al. **Anari et al.** gave best possible $e/(e-1)$-approximation mechanisms for large markets. 

For monotone submodular valuations, Jalaly and Tardos **Jalaly and Tardos** presented a randomized polynomial-time $5$-approximation mechanism, thus improving on **Chen et al.**, 
and a deterministic (resp. randomized) $4.56$ (resp. $4$) approximation mechanism, which assumes access to an exact algorithm for value maximization.
%a polynomial-time deterministic $(1+e)$-approximation for large markets. 
The approximation ratio for large markets was improved to $2$ for deterministic (possibly exponential-time) mechanisms and to $3$ for randomized polynomial-time mechanisms by Anari et al. **Anari et al.**. Recently, Balkanksi et al. **Balkanksi et al.** presented a deterministic polynomial-time clock auction that is $4.75$-approximate for monotone submodular valuations. The best known approximation ratio for monotone submodular valuations is $4.45$ for deterministic and $4.3$ for randomized mechanisms, achieved by the polynomial-time clock auction of Han et al. **Han et al.** %The clock auctions of Balkanksi et al. **Balkanksi et al.** and Han et al. **Han et al.** achieve small constant approximation guarantees without resorting to the bidding setting, where the mechanism may ask the agents for their costs, but apply to the offline setting, where the agents may be contacted multiple times by the mechanism. 

Polynomial-time constant-factor approximations are also known for non-monotone submodular valuations **Chen et al.**, where the best known ratio is $64$ for deterministic  **Chen et al.** and $12$ for randomized mechanisms **Balkanski et al.** (both achieved by clock auctions). Moreover, constant-factor approximation mechanisms (albeit non-polynomial time ones) are known for XOS valuations **Balcan et al.**, while for subadditive valuations the best known approximation guarantee is $O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$ due to Balkanski et al. **Balkanski et al.**, which is achieved by a clock auction, matches the randomized approximation of **Goel et al.** and improves on the $O(\log^3 n)$ deterministic approximation of **Saha et al.**. We refer an interested reader to the survey of Liu et al. **Liu et al.** for a detailed discussion of previous work on budget-feasible procurement. 

The online version of budget-feasible auctions, where the agents arrive sequentially in random order and the decision about their acceptance in the solution is online and irrevocable, was introduced by Singer and Mittal **Singer and Mittal** and Badanidiyuru et al. **Badanidiyuru et al.** %____ focused on the posted-price setting that we consider in this work.
Amanatidis et al. **Amanatidis et al.** presented $O(1)$-competitive randomized online universally truthful mechanisms for monotone and non-monotone submodular valuations in the bidding setting. Online budget-feasible procurement is closely related to the \emph{submodular knapsack secretary} problem **Feldman et al.**, where budget feasibility is with respect to the agent costs (which are revealed to the algorithm upon each agent's arrival). Feldman et al. **Feldman et al.** presented a randomized $20e$-approximation for submodular knapsack secretaries.



The clock auctions of Balkanksi et al. **Balkanksi et al.** and Han et al. **Han et al.** achieve small constant approximation guarantees without resorting to  bidding (i.e., the agents never report their costs to the mechanism), but
they are not online, because the agents receive multiple offers by the mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, the online $O(\log n)$-competitive mechanism of \cite[Section~4]{Bada2012} and the constant-competitive mechanisms in the Bayesian setting of **Badanidiyuru et al.** are the only known posted-price mechanisms for online budget-feasible procurement auctions with monotone submodular valuations. 

A quite standard approach to the design of efficient budget-feasible mechanisms (see e.g., \cite[Section~5]{Bada2012} and in 
\cite[Section~4]{AmanatidisKS22}) and of online algorithms for submodular knapsack secretaries (see e.g., **Feldman et al.**) is to first learn the costs of a random subset of agents. Then, based on these costs, the mechanism approximates the optimal solution of the resulting random instance and uses its value as a threshold to post linear prices to the remaining agents. We should highlight that this approach does not fit in the framework of online posted-price mechanisms, since it requires knowledge of the costs of a significant fraction of agents (which is obtained through bidding).
