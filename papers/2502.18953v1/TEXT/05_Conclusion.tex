\section{Conclusion}
 In this brief, we presented a 16nm reliable, time-predictable heterogeneous RISC-V SoC for \gls{ai}-enhanced mixed-criticality applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SoC that combines safety features for \glspl{mcs} with hardware IPs for time-predictable execution of \glspl{mct} and leading-edge domain-specialized programmable accelerators within the same heterogeneous SoC. With a peak performance of 304.9 GOPS at 1.6TOPS/W and 260.7 GOPS/mm$^2$, and 121.8 GFLOPS at 1.1TFLOPS/W and 107GFLOPS/mm$^2$, the proposed SoC offers a comprehensive solution for reliable and deterministic execution of \gls{ai}/\gls{dsp}-enhanced \gls{mc} edge applications, achieving \gls{soa} energy efficiency under \looseness=-1  1.2~W power envelope. %The hardware description of the design is released open-source to foster future research~\footnote{\texttt{\url{https://github.com/pulp-platform/carfield}}}.

%To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SoC to combine safety-critical features for MCS with HW IPs for time-predictable execution of MCTs and leading edge domain-specialized programmable processor clusters into the same heterogeneous SoC, providing a comprehensive solution for reliable and deterministic execution of ML-enhanced mixed-criticality edge applications, at state-of-the-art energy efficiency and less than 1.5W power envelope. 

%\textcolor{red}{The platform and all the non-technological IPs integrated in Carfield are released open source under a liberal licence to foster future software and hardware research on reliable, time-predictable, accelerated heterogeneous computing devices for mixed-criticality applications.}
