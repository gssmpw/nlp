\begin{abstract}
With the rapid development of blockchain technology, transaction logs play a central role in
various applications, including decentralized exchanges, wallets, cross-chain bridges, and other
third-party services. However, these logs, particularly those based on smart contract events, are
highly susceptible to manipulation and forgery, creating substantial security risks across the
ecosystem. To address this issue, we present the first in-depth security analysis of transaction
log forgery in EVM-based blockchains, a phenomenon we term Phantom Events. We systematically model
five types of attacks and propose a tool designed to detect event forgery vulnerabilities in smart
contracts. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach outperforms existing tools in identifying
potential phantom events. Furthermore, we have successfully identified real-world instances for all
five types of attacks across multiple decentralized applications. Finally, we call on community
developers to take proactive steps to address these critical security vulnerabilities.
