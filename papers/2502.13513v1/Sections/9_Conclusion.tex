\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we conducted an in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities associated with phantom events in blockchain systems. Our approach involved developing a multi-level detection framework that integrates bytecode-level, source code-level, and transaction-level analyses to address issues such as \emph{Event Counterfeiting}, \emph{Inconsistent Logging}, and \emph{Contract Imitation}. Furthermore, we identified real-world cases for each of the proposed attack vectors, underscoring the critical need for mitigation of these threats in blockchain ecosystems.
