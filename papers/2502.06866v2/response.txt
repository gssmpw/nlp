\subsection{Machine Learning for Data Imputation }
 
Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing the challenge of missing data imputation, particularly in time series datasets. Traditional imputation methods often struggle with the complexities and dependencies inherent in such data ____.  In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [10] have gained prominence due to their ability to model complex data distributions. An implementation of GAN, the Generative Adversarial Imputation Network (GAIN) has been shown to outperform conventional methods by effectively capturing the underlying data structure and generating plausible imputations for missing values in various datasets, including clinical and environmental data____. Recent developments in deep learning have introduced models such as Bidirectional Recurrent Imputation for Time Series (BRITS) [5], which specifically address the temporal dependencies in time series data. BRITS employ a recurrent neural network (RNNs) [3] architecture to handle multiple correlated missing values and adaptively update imputed values.

In addition to GANs, other machine learning models have also been explored for imputation tasks. For example, Random Forests have been combined with generative models [4] to enhance the robustness of imputations, particularly in scenarios with large gaps in data.

The data can be multifaceted, representing complex interactions between economic, institutional, social, and environmental dimensions. EOLI exhibits intricate temporal dynamics due to the diverse nature of factors like governance, public health, infrastructure, and quality of life indicators, each influenced by various external and internal processes over time. Due to such nature of our data, we require more sophisticated approaches to accurately capture and model these complexities, ensuring that the evolving trends in living standards are well-represented and analysed. Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is a widely adopted method for handling missing data in statistical analyses____. This method allows us to account for the uncertainty associated with missing data by generating several plausible imputed datasets, which can then be analysed separately and combined to produce estimates that reflect this uncertainty.  MICE works under the assumption that data is missing completely at random ____, this assumption may not be entirely appropriate for EoLI as data can be missing due to underdeveloped data collection mechanisms in developing countries, due to variables related to governance such as crime or public safety may be systematically under-reported in regions where governments are less transparent and due to inconsistencies in data reporting due to several factors such as [9]. 

Several studies have highlighted the critical role of the Ease of Living Index (EoLI) in shaping urban development and governance in India. Kumar et al.  ____ focused on Lucknow Smart City, demonstrating how EoLI is used to evaluate the impact of smart city initiatives, emphasising technology and citizen engagement as key factors for success. The study highlights the integration of ICT in urban management____ and stresses the importance of inclusive growth to address socio-economic inequalities. Similarly, Jha and Kumar (2020) critique the Union Budget 2020-21, calling for a strategic approach to fiscal policies that prioritise health, education, and social welfare to improve the ease of living ____. They advocate for budget alignment with smart city goals, stressing investments in infrastructure and gender-responsive budgeting to ensure equity and inclusivity ____.

Puri (2022) examines the EoLI’s relevance to the Master Plan of Delhi 2041, arguing for its integration to guide sustainable urban planning ____. The study identifies gaps in existing policies and stresses the importance of aligning urban development strategies with EoLI metrics to address inclusivity and accessibility across various dimensions such as transportation, health, education, and environmental sustainability ____. Puri emphasises a participatory approach, incorporating citizen feedback and continuous monitoring to ensure data-driven governance. Collectively, these studies underline the EoLI’s significance in informing urban policies, advocating for a holistic approach that combines technology, strategic budgeting, and citizen engagement to enhance the quality of life in Indian cities.

\subsubsection{Ease of Living Index: India}

In economics, the Gini coefficient, also referred to as the Gini index, is a widely used metric for assessing statistical dispersion ____. It is used primarily in the context of income, wealth, or consumption inequality within a population or social group. This measure was introduced by the Italian statistician and sociologist Corrado Gini ____ to quantify inequality by analysing the distribution of variables, such as income levels. A Gini coefficient of 0 indicates complete equality, where all individuals have identical income or wealth, whereas a coefficient of 1 (or 100\%) signifies extreme inequality, where one individual possesses all the income or wealth, and the rest have none. This metric is instrumental in understanding the degree of inequality within a given group or nation____.

The Human Development Index (HDI) is designed to measure the average achievement in three core dimensions of human development: longevity and health, education, and standard of living. The HDI is calculated as the geometric mean of normalised indices for each of these dimensions. Specifically, the health component is evaluated by life expectancy at birth, the education component is assessed through the mean years of schooling for adults (25 years and older) and the expected years of schooling for children entering school. The standard of living is measured using gross national income (GNI) per capita, where a logarithmic scale is applied to account for the diminishing returns of higher income levels. The three dimensions are combined into a single composite index through the geometric mean. The HDI can be a valuable tool in evaluating national policies by highlighting how countries with similar GNI per capita can achieve varying levels of human development ____. This discrepancy can help spark discussions on the effectiveness of government priorities and policies. However, the HDI is limited in scope and does not encompass the full range of human development aspects, and other forms of measures are being explored ____. It does not account for factors like inequality, poverty, human security, or empowerment.
