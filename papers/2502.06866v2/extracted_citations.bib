These pecuniary differences become preference-based weights in a quality of life index. Hedonic equations are estimated using micro data from the 1980 Census and assembled county-based amenity data on climatic, environmental, and urban conditions. Ranking of 253 urban counties reveals substantial variation within and among urban areas.},
