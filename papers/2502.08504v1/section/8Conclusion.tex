\section{Conclusion}\label{sec: Conclusion}

In this work, we introduce \abb{}, a fuzzing method to generate specific-module-sensitive test scenarios for ADS testing.
\abb{} first build a root analysis function to locate which modules are corresponded to the collision. Building upon this function, \abb{} calculates root cause scores and customizes the seed selection and mutation modules accordingly. 
Extensive experiments are conducted with various primary scenarios, specific modules and fuzzing methods to validate the effectiveness of \abb{}. Experimental results demonstrate that \abb{} is highly effective in generating collision scenarios caused by errors in specific modules.
