\section{Related Work}
The recent emergence of LLM agents~\cite{wang2024survey} and LLM-MAS~\cite{li2024survey} has influenced social simulations. Multi-agent strategic interactions are used to evaluate LLM reasoning~\cite{mensfelt2024logicenhancedlanguagemodelagents,duan2024gtbench}, and LLM-based simulations are leveraged for empirical investigations on strategic behaviours~\cite{mao2024alympicsllmagentsmeet,mensfelt2024autoformalizing}. Recent work on LLM-driven reasoning in BCGs focuses on studying agent rationality and reasoning levels~\cite{zhang2024klevelreasoningestablishinghigher,lu2024strategicinteractionslargelanguage,guo2024economicsarenalargelanguage}. Centralized role-based architectures rely on an umpire~\cite{STATHIS1998401} or a game manager~\cite{gamemaster-gameplayerMAS2007} to coordinate game-based interactions -- such as artificial trading~\cite{tradingagentcompetition} or utility markets~\cite{master-slave-energymanagement,masterslavegames2024}.
Hypergame theory, while effective for analyzing complex conflicts post-hoc~\cite{Bennett1980}, has seen limited practical application~\cite{BENNETT1981shippingcrisis} due to challenges in automation. Most agent-based implementations only borrow conceptually~\cite{dharmadhikari2021hypergamepathplanning,Aitchison2021deceptionhypergames}, with few examples of full integration~\cite{Kahn2021thesis,TANG2024networkattackdefense}.

While prior approaches typically implement a looser agentic concept -- a weaker notion of agency~\cite{Wooldridge_Jennings_1995} -- potentially constraining the system's flexibility and bounding LLMs' reasoning~\cite{wang2025limitsllmbasedhumansimulation}, our framework offers enhanced flexibility and depth. Our conceptually elaborate multi-agent architecture enables a more nuanced evaluation process, facilitating a systematic review of LLM reasoning and automating the generation of hypergames. This approach provides valuable insights into LLMs' capabilities for recursive reasoning, particularly their ability to form beliefs about beliefs and develop a theory of mind.
