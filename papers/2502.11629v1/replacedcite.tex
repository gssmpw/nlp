\section{Related Work}
The potential of using causal modelling as part of RE activities is not yet fully explored____. Fischbach et al. proposed an NLP-based process to extract and structure causal relationships from natural language____. A tree recursive neural network (TRNN) model was trained to detect causality in natural language requirements using logical markers such as conjunctions and negations____. They further developed an approach to converts extracted causal relationships into a DAG-like structure to automatically generate test cases____.
Maier et al. proposed modelling cause-effect relationships as part of scenario-based testing for automotive system safety____. Maier et al. also introduced the concept of ``CausalOps'', an industrial lifecycle framework for causal models____.
Gren et Brentsson Svensson proposed Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA) to evaluate the outcome of experiments on the effect of obsolete requirements on software effort estimation____. Similarly, Frattini et al. investigated the impact of requirements quality defects on domain modelling by using BDA and causal reasoning in a in a controlled experiment____. While the latter two studies do not use causal modelling as an explicit RE activity, these studies demonstrates the potential of applying causal reasoning to RE activities.
