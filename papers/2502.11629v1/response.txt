\section{Related Work}
The potential of using causal modelling as part of RE activities is not yet fully explored**Kuipers, "Requirements Engineering and Causal Modelling"**. Fischbach et al. proposed an NLP-based process to extract and structure causal relationships from natural language**Fischbach et al., "Extracting Causal Relationships with NLP"**. A tree recursive neural network (TRNN) model was trained to detect causality in natural language requirements using logical markers such as conjunctions and negations**Scheurer, "Tree Recursive Neural Network for Causality Detection"**. They further developed an approach to converts extracted causal relationships into a DAG-like structure to automatically generate test cases**Scheurer et al., "Causal Relationships to Test Cases"**.
Maier et al. proposed modelling cause-effect relationships as part of scenario-based testing for automotive system safety**Maier, "Scenario-Based Testing with Causality"**. Maier et al. also introduced the concept of ``CausalOps'', an industrial lifecycle framework for causal models**Maier et al., "CausalOps: A Lifecycle Framework"**.
Gren et Brentsson Svensson proposed Bayesian Data Analysis (BDA) to evaluate the outcome of experiments on the effect of obsolete requirements on software effort estimation**Gren, "Bayesian Data Analysis in Software Effort Estimation"**. Similarly, Frattini et al. investigated the impact of requirements quality defects on domain modelling by using BDA and causal reasoning in a in a controlled experiment**Frattini et al., "Requirements Quality Defects and Domain Modelling"**. While the latter two studies do not use causal modelling as an explicit RE activity, these studies demonstrates the potential of applying causal reasoning to RE activities.
