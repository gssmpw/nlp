\section{Conclusion} 

In this work, we have developed a theory of
one possible mechanism of composition in diffusion models.
We study how composition can be defined, and sufficient conditions
for it to be achieved.
Our theory can help understand a range of diverse
compositional phenomena in both synthetic and practical settings,
and we hope it will inspire further work on foundations of
composition.
