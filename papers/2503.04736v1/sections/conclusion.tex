GenAI is transforming how we work and perform day-to-day tasks and will continue to do so in the near future. In this paper, we view such transformation as a \textit{paradigm shift} and discuss how supporting this change can be considered \textit{a fundamental step toward building trustworthy, controllable, and responsible GenAI systems} through standard alignment. 

Based on our position, we make \textbf{two calls to action} across all stakeholder groups involved in the development of standards and GenAI:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We encourage all stakeholders to collectively recognize and adapt to the paradigm shift introduced by GenAI, which can serve as a powerful tool for assisting with compliance to regulations and standards, provided it is used responsibly and ethically.
    \item We advocate for a global, unified effort among stakeholders to fully realize the potential of this research direction and ensure that GenAI remains a force for good in regulated domains.
\end{enumerate}

We look forward to welcoming new research ideas, global partnerships, initiatives, and collaborations, whether they complement or contrast with the position we introduced, in line with the promising direction of aligning GenAI for regulatory and operational compliance through standards.
