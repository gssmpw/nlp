\section{Acoustic variation within-between wards}
\label{sec:diff_loc}

Building on the findings from \Cref{sec:diff_mic}, acoustic differences between and within wards were further analysed using only the binaural channels. The analysis focused on three bed positions: HD-A, NICU-A, and NICU-B, omitting HD-B due to the limited duration of data collection, as noted in \Cref{tab:bedmovement}. For each A- and C-weighted metric, LME-ART-ANOVA was performed with bed position as a fixed effect, and microphones and time as random effects. Post-hoc contrast tests were conducted for results with significance at the \SI{1}{\percent} level.

\subsection{A- and C-weighted metrics}

The LME-ART-ANOVA revealed statistically significant differences between bed positions for all A- and C-weighted metrics at the \SI{1}{\percent} significance level. Large effect sizes were consistently observed across most metrics, except for \Lx{ASmax} and \Lx{CSmax}, which exhibited small and medium effect sizes, respectively, as summarised in \Cref{tab:artloc}. In the post-hoc contrast tests for A-weighted metrics, significant differences were found across all bed position pairs with large effect sizes, except for HD-A vs. NICU-B in \Lx{AS10} and HD-A vs. NICU-A in \Lx{ASmax}. Similarly, post-hoc tests for C-weighted metrics indicated significant differences with large effect sizes for all bed position pairs, except for HD-A vs. NICU-B in both \Lx{CS} and \Lx{CS50}.

In general, NICU-A exhibited significantly higher A- and C-weighted metrics compared to both HD-A and NICU-B, as shown in \Cref{fig:byhourmetrics}, Between HD-A and NICU-B, \Lx{AS}, \Lx{AS50}, and \Lx{CS50} levels were higher at NICU-B, while \Lx{ASmax}, \Lx{CS10}, and \Lx{CSmax} were higher at HD-A.

\subsection{Acoustic guidelines}

Measurements of \Lx{AS10} and \Lx{AS50} across HD-A, NICU-A, and NICU-B were evaluated primarily using the 9\textsuperscript{th} and 10\textsuperscript{th} editions of the CC NICU design recommendations, as outlined in \Cref{tab:sound-standards}. For comparison, additional assessments were conducted based on \Lx{AS} and \Lx{ASmax} using the 8\textsuperscript{th} edition guidelines.

At HD-A, compliance with the \Lx{AS10} guideline was achieved for up to \SI{97}{\percent} of the $N=981$ 1-hour measurement periods, while the \Lx{AS50} limits were up to \SI{40}{\percent} compliant, as shown in \Cref{tab:reg_subloc}. Compliance rates for \Lx{AS10} and \Lx{AS50} varied depending on the microphone type, with binaural measurements showing up to \SI{8}{\percent} higher compliance for \Lx{AS10} and up to \SI{9}{\percent} higher compliance for \Lx{AS50}.

At NICU-A, compliance with the \Lx{AS10} guideline was achieved for up to \SI{99}{\percent} of the $N=492$ 1-hour measurement periods, while the \Lx{AS50} limits were consistently exceeded. Notably, microphone type influenced compliance, with binaural measurements resulting in up to \SI{8}{\percent} lower compliance for \Lx{AS10}.

At NICU-B, a similar trend to NICU-A was observed regarding adherence to \Lx{AS10} and \Lx{AS50} guidelines across the $N=98$ 1-hour measurement periods, although compliance rates remained consistent across different microphone types.

The \Lx{ASmax} and \Lx{AS} guidelines from the 8\textsuperscript{th} edition were exceeded almost consistently at across HD-A, NICU-A and NICU-B, suggesting the presence of very loud events near neonates (\Lx{ASmax} $\ge \SI{65}{\decibelA}$), though these events were infrequent, occurring less than \SI{10}{\percent} of the time. 

\chadded[]{
While \Lx{AS} exceedance patterns were consistent with previous studies irrespective of microphone placement \cite{andy_systematic_2025}, \Lx{AS} levels recorded near neonates' ears in this study aligned closely with those reported in similar NICU environments \cite{Krueger2007,Smith2018}. However, \Lx{AS} levels measured within enclosed incubators in prior studies were generally up to \dba{6} higher \cite{Romeu2016,Parra2017}, as summarized in \Cref{tab:niculevels}.}

\chadded[comment=R4.3]{Compared to \cite{Krueger2007,Parra2017}, \Lx{ASmax} levels in this study were up to \dba{23} lower, while \Lx{AS10} levels were comparable. The discrepancy in \Lx{ASmax} levels may reasonably be attributed to the absence of bedside medical devices during our measurements, though the specific cause cannot be definitively determined.}

\subsection{Occurrence rates}

Significant differences in the frequency of loud events ($\textit{OR}_\text{SNR}^h(5)$) were found across HD-A, NICU-A, and NICU-B. Post-hoc contrasts revealed that loud events occurred significantly more frequently at HD-A than at both NICU-A and NICU-B, as depicted in \Cref{fig:ORbyhour}. Although slightly higher at NICU-A than NICU-B, the difference in $\textit{OR}_\text{SNR}^h(5)$ was still statistically significant.

The hourly variation in loud event occurrences remained relatively stable throughout the measurement period, as indicated by the standard error in \Cref{fig:ORbyhour}. At HD-A, the average occurrence remained consistent throughout the day, whereas at NICU-A and NICU-B, loud events were more frequent between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.

Significant differences were also noted in the occurrence of tonal events ($\textit{OR}_\text{T}^h(0.4)$) across HD-A, NICU-A, and NICU-B. Post-hoc tests showed that the $\textit{OR}_\text{T}^h(0.4)$ values for NICU-A and NICU-B were statistically similar, but both were significantly higher than those for HD-A.

At NICU-A and NICU-B, tonal or modulated signals were present almost continuously ($T>0.4$), while at HD-A, such signals occurred consistently only between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m.
