To our knowledge, no peer-reviewed publications have explored training agents on Pokémon Red or its successors.  
Recent works have, however, introduced Large Language Model (LLM) agents.
A preprint presented an agent focused solely on Pokémon battles, achieving human-parity performance \cite{hu2024pokellmonhumanparityagentpokemon}.
The startup nunu.ai demonstrated an agent that reached the third badge in Pokémon Emerald, relying on human intervention and a pathfinding algorithm.
More recently, Anthropic announced efforts to develop an agent capable of earning the third badge in Pokémon Red \cite{Anthropic2025}.
This is particularly noteworthy, as Gym 3 requires both using Cut and solving a hidden button puzzle.
Although details on these agents remain limited, the increasing interest in Pokémon as an LLM testbed highlights its growing relevance in AI research.
A promising direction for future work is an agent similar to Minecraft Voyager \cite{wang2023voyager}, which generates and evaluates code to perform actions.


% Because of the multi-task challenges and the prolonged horizons, we believe Pokémon features a level of complexity that is akin to DotA~2, StarCraft \rom{2}, and Minecraft.
% Out of those, Minecraft is the only open-ended single agent environment, which normally does not have a storyline or a distinct end goal \cite{minedojo2022}.
% However, a commonly defined task in Minecraft is to mine a diamond, which demands several milestones (akin to Pokémon Red's events), where some must be completed in a linear order (e.g., a stone pick axe is needed to mine iron, which allows for an iron pick axe to mine diamonds).

% Starcraft 2 "Each game consists of tens of thousands of time-steps and thousands of actions, selected in real-time throughout approximately ten minutes of gameplay."
% OpenAI Five selects an action every fourth frame, yielding approximately 20,000 steps per episode
% Learning to play Minecraft with Video PreTraining: This is the first time anyone has shown a computer agent capable of crafting diamond tools in Minecraft, which takes humans over 20 minutes (24,000 actions) on average.
