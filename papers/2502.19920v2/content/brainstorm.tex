\section{Visualizations and figures}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achievements and Milestones of the Game
    \begin{itemize}
        \item maybe demonstrating non-linearity of the game
    \end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Ablation Study}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

What impact do we observe when shaping rewards and adding or removing domain knowledge?
This also accounts for simplifications as choosing squirtle as the default starter.

\begin{itemize}
\color{teal}
    \item remove explore map
    \item keep map but set exploration bonus to 0
    \item reward functions weights (especially scaling the exploration reward bonus)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item event
        \item level
        \item heal
        \item op lvl
        \item dead
        \item badge
        \item explore
    \end{itemize}
    \item Start from the beginning and not with pokedex and balls
    \item Different starter pokemon
\end{itemize}

Out of scope:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ablate NN architecture
    \item Remove frame stacks
    \item Hyperparameter tuning
\end{itemize}
