In 2022, over 14 thousand complaints were made against the companies due to their inferior commitment to resolving performance. Subsequently, SEBI tried to resolve 2838 complaints through platform score in March  2023____.
The intricate nature of complaints can lead to ambiguity in representing reviews ____. At times, the indication of a complaint is explicit, clearly identifying the party at fault. However, in other instances, the complaint's nature is implicit, lacking explicit blame attribution ____.

In the field of pragmatics, the work by ____ pioneered the classification of complaints into five distinct types: a) Beyond Reproach, b) Explicit Complaint, c) Statement of Disapproval, d) Warning, and e) Allegation. However, Trosborg et al.'s foundational study ____ identified four primary levels of complaint severity: a) Implicit Reproach Absent, b) Disapproval, c) Accusation, and d) Blame. Gradually, Transformers-based Complaint categorization based on their severity criteria was developed by  ____. Nonetheless, companies must categorize financial complaints according to their severity and offer comprehensive explanations ____. Subsequently, in 2023, the influence of generative AI was illustrated in the domain of financial unimodal complaint identification, incorporating the provision of causal explanations ____. A research endeavour was showcased focusing on binary complaint classification in a multimodal information setting, devoid of considering the financial aspect context ____. The research presented in ____ has connected vision and language within the associated field of polarity and emotion recognition. The recent multimodal predictive classifier, CMA-CLIP ____, has garnered attention for its ability to predict attributes for predefined classes. However, it faces limitations in handling unseen data. In contrast, the generative model developed by Roy et al.____ approaches the classification task as a generation task. 
In multilabel classification, the co-occurrence of labels can be effectively modeled using probabilistic graph models ____. However, to address the computational burden of these models, neural network-based solutions have gained prevalence. For instance, Wang et al. ____ used recurrent networks to encode labels into embedding vectors for label correlation modeling, while Lin et al. ____ utilized a context-gating strategy to integrate label re-ranking into the network architecture. Additionally, attention mechanisms have been leveraged to model label relationships.\\
\textbf{Our research solution standing:}
Past research explored task-specific layers for complaint detection through fine-tuning pre-trained language models and different attention mechanisms to model multiple-label representations. As of our present understanding, an ultimate comprehensive tool that offers a generalized solution for aspect-based financial multimodal complaints, along with an accompanying dataset, remains absent. We aim to bridge the research gap by presenting our novel model and dataset.\\
