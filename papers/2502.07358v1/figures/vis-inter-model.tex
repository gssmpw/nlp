\caption{Visualization results of our foundational interactive model. We show five actions (High-five, Pat on back, Handshake, Block, and Push) of human-robot interaction and two actions (Kick box and Rotate box) of robot-object interaction. By observing dynamic real human motions (orange), our model can generate reasonable corresponding actions of the robot (white) in real time.}
