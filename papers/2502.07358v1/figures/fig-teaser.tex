\caption {Demonstration of the human-robot interaction process in SymbioSim. In this system, human interacts with a virtual robot in 3D space through AR. The robot perceives human actions and generates real-time responses. Feedback from the human experience is continuously collected to optimize the robotâ€™s model, improving its performance. Concurrently, humans gradually develop a deeper understanding and trust in the robot. Ultimately, SymbioSim fosters bidirectional learning and adaptation, with the potential to promote human-robot symbiosis.}
