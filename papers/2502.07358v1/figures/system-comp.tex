\caption{System overview. In SymbioSim, humans interact with virtual robots in 3D physical space through AR technology with a strong sense of realism. The robot perceives human actions via the motion capture module and generates corresponding responses through the interactive model. These actions are then processed by a physical simulation module, ensuring their physical plausibility and minimizing the sim-to-real gap. Leveraging the human-in-the-loop advantage, human feedback is collected and used to identify valuable data for model fine-tuning, further enhancing the performance of the interactive model. Through the blue loop in the system, humans can repeatedly engage with the robot, refining their understanding and trust in its behavior. Meanwhile, the yellow loop enables the robot to continuously refine its interactions based on human feedback, progressively aligning its actions with human preferences.}
