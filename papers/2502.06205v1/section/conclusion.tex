\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented \modelname, a proxy-centric alignment framework that bridges retrievers and LLMs through a lightweight multi-agent system. By leveraging MARL with our proposed tree-structured rollout and Monte Carlo credit assignment, our framework effectively optimizes multiple specialized agents toward the system-level performance without modifying existing RAG components.
Extensive experiments demonstrate \modelname's superior performance and strong generalization capability across different out-of-distribution datasets, retrievers, and LLMs, establishing it as a practical plug-and-play solution for RAG systems.

\section*{Impact Statement}

The advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, such as those proposed in this work, hold significant potential for diverse applications. 
By enhancing modularity, generalization, and plug-and-play capabilities, these systems can empower applications in edge deployment at relatively low computational cost. 
However, the deployment of RAG systems still poses risks that need to be carefully considered, despite our efforts to mitigate them. 
These systems heavily rely on external retrieval sources, which may include biased or unreliable data, leading to the propagation of misinformation. 
In high-stakes applications like medical or legal advice, incorrect or incomplete retrieval could have severe consequences. 
Although our proxy is not directly responsible for the content retrieved by the retriever, future research can focus on improving alignment in fairness, robustness, and transparency during information filtering.
