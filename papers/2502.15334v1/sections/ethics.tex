\section{Ethical Considerations}


This research explores \textit{jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs)} to understand their vulnerabilities and improve alignment robustness. While Attention Eclipse demonstrates how targeted attention manipulation can effectively bypass safety constraints, we acknowledge the potential risks associated with adversarial techniques.

Our work is conducted purely for academic and security research purposes, aiming to \textit{identify weaknesses in LLM safety mechanisms} rather than to promote or enable misuse. Understanding these vulnerabilities is a critical step toward designing stronger defences, as demonstrated by prior research in adversarial AI and model robustness. By highlighting how \textit{attention-based attacks} exploit model internals, we hope to inform researchers and industry practitioners about new potential threats that must be mitigated.

To minimize misuse, we strictly adhere to ethical AI research guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Responsible Disclosure:} We recommend that LLM developers and AI safety teams incorporate \textit{adaptive attention-aware defences} to counteract similar jailbreak strategies.
    \item \textbf{Dataset \& Model Use:} Our experiments were conducted exclusively on \textit{publicly available, open-source models} (Llama2, Vicuna) and do not involve \textit{real-world deployment or malicious applications}.
    \item \textbf{No Real-World Harm:} Our research does not endorse or support any malicious use of LLM jailbreak techniques, such as \textit{generating harmful content, misinformation, or unethical automation}.
    \item \textbf{Transparency \& Reproducibility:} The methods and findings in this paper are \textit{fully documented} to support research into \textit{robust AI alignment} while ensuring transparency in adversarial AI research.
\end{itemize}

Ultimately, this work reinforces the importance of proactive AI safety measures and the need for \textit{continuous adversarial testing} to strengthen LLM security. We encourage collaboration between \textit{AI researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners} to address evolving threats while ensuring that powerful AI models remain safe and aligned with ethical standards.
