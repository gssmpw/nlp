\section{Attention Granularity}
\label{sec: Attention Granularity}

Understanding how attention mechanisms operate at different levels of granularity is essential for analyzing and manipulating large language models (LLMs). Attention granularity defines how the focus is distributed across different linguistic structures—ranging from individual tokens to entire sentences. This section explores three key levels of attention: token-level, word-level, and sentence-level attention.

\subsection{Token-Level Attention}
Token-level attention refers to the attention that one token assigns to another within an input sequence. This is the most fine-grained level of attention and serves as the foundation for higher-level aggregations. Each attention score is computed separately for every attention head and layer in the model.

To extract token-level attention, we first process an input prompt through the LLM to obtain its attention matrix \( AM \), which contains attention scores for all token pairs. The attention of token \( T_{i} \) on \( T_{j} \) at layer \( l \) and head \( h \) is given by the element \( (h,l,i,j) \) of the matrix:

\[
AM_{h,l,i,j}
\]

This score quantifies how much focus the model places on \( T_j \) when processing \( T_i \). Token-level attention is particularly useful in analyzing how information propagates across transformer layers and has been widely used in interpretability studies \cite{clark2019does, kobayashi2020attention, vig2019multiscale}.

\subsection{Word-Level Attention}
Since language models process text at the subword-token level, individual words may be split into multiple tokens by the tokenizer (e.g., "running" might be split into ["run", "ning"]). Word-level attention aggregates the token-level scores across all tokens that belong to a given word.

Suppose we need to compute the attention from Word\textsubscript{1} to Word\textsubscript{2}, where: Word\textsubscript{1} spans tokens \( i \) to \( j \), and Word\textsubscript{2} spans tokens \( k \) to \( m \)

The aggregated word-level attention at layer \( l \) and head \( h \) is computed as:

\[
\text{Attn}(w_1, w_2) = \sum_{t_1=i}^{j} \sum_{t_2=k}^{m} AM_{h,l,t_1,t_2}
\]

By aggregating token attention into words, we can better interpret how the model processes meaningful linguistic units rather than subword fragments. This technique is often used in saliency analysis for understanding attention-based neural networks \cite{hao2021self}.

\subsection{Sentence-Level Attention}
Sentence-level attention refers to how much attention a model assigns from one entire sentence to another. This level of granularity is useful for discourse analysis, coreference resolution, and long-range dependency tracking.

To compute sentence-level attention from Sentence\textsubscript{1} to Sentence\textsubscript{2}, where: Sentence\textsubscript{1} spans tokens \( i \) to \( j \), and Sentence\textsubscript{2} spans tokens \( k \) to \( m \)

The aggregated sentence-level attention at layer \( l \) and head \( h \) is:

\[
\text{Attn}(s_1, s_2) = \sum_{t_1=i}^{j} \sum_{t_2=k}^{m} AM_{h,l,t_1,t_2}
\]

Sentence-level attention is particularly important in document-level transformers, where attention needs to be distributed efficiently across long texts. Some recent models optimize sentence-level dependencies to improve coherence and contextual retention \cite{beltagy2020longformer, zaheer2020big}.

\subsection{Relevance to Jailbreak Attacks}
Understanding attention granularity is crucial for designing adversarial attacks such as Attention Eclipse. By precisely manipulating attention weights at different levels: Token-level optimization allows fine-grained control over which words receive focus. Word-level aggregation ensures that adversarial tokens interact with meaningful text units. Sentence-level adjustments enable larger-scale bypasses of alignment mechanisms.

This structured approach helps attackers exploit LLM vulnerabilities while preserving coherence and fluency in generated outputs.



%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{appendix: Evaluation Metrics}

To assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we evaluate it using three key metrics: Attack Success Rate (ASR), Time Cost Per Prompt (TCPP), and Noise Budget. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of both the success and efficiency of jailbreak amplification.

\subsection{Attack Success Rate (ASR)}
ASR is the primary metric used to evaluate jailbreak performance. It measures the percentage of prompts that successfully bypass the alignment mechanisms of an LLM. ASR is computed as follows:

\[
\text{ASR} = \frac{ \text{Number of successful jailbreak prompts}}{\text{Total number of prompts in the dataset}}
\]

A higher ASR indicates a more effective attack, demonstrating the ability of the amplified jailbreak prompts to circumvent model safeguards. ASR is widely used in adversarial robustness evaluations of LLMs \cite{perez2022ignore, greshake2023not}.

\subsection{Time Cost Per Prompt (TCPP)}
\label{sebsec: TCPP experiment}
Computational efficiency is another crucial factor in evaluating jailbreak attacks. The Time Cost Per Prompt (TCPP) quantifies the average time required to generate a successful jailbreak attack. The first step is computing the average number of queries (AQ) per successful attack:

\[
\text{AQ} = \frac{\sum \text{\#Queries within a successful attack}}{\text{Number of successful attacks}}
\]

Using AQ, we calculate TCPP as:

\[
\text{TCPP} = \text{AQ} \times \text{Average Time per Iteration}
\]

Lower TCPP values indicate a more efficient jailbreak method, as fewer queries and less computational time are needed to bypass alignment.


To fill out Table \ref{table: timing}, we select 16 samples of AdvBench from those where multiple methods achieve successful jailbreaks, to calculate the TCPP of each method required to successfully jailbreak each sample \cite{ding2023wolf}. The IDs of these samples are [67, 96, 128, 143, 204, 218,
272, 310, 315, 342, 370, 371, 411, 465, 481, 517] (starting from 0). The target model is Llama2-7b-chat and experiments are done on a single NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB GPU.


\subsection{Analysis of Query Distributions}

Figures \ref{fig: iteration_distribution_HarmBench_ReNeLLM} to \ref{fig: iteration_distribution_HarmBench_GCG} illustrate the distribution of the number of queries required for baseline attacks jailbreak prompts for different methods on the HarmBench dataset using the Llama2-7b-chat model.

ReNeLLM exhibits the lowest resistance to amplification, with a highly concentrated query distribution and a median iteration count of 1.0 (Figure \ref{fig: iteration_distribution_HarmBench_ReNeLLM}). This indicates that minimal effort is required to craft an effective jailbreak prompt.

AutoDAN demonstrates a slightly higher resistance, requiring a median of 2.0 iterations (Figure \ref{fig: iteration_distribution_HarmBench_AutoDAN}). This suggests that while AutoDAN is more resilient than ReNeLLM, it is still relatively easy to amplify.

GCG presents the greatest resistance to amplification, with a median of 5.5 iterations (Figure \ref{fig: iteration_distribution_HarmBench_GCG}). This wider distribution reflects a higher degree of variability in amplification effectiveness across different prompts.

Overall, these findings provide insights into the relative robustness of different jailbreak strategies. GCG resists amplification the most, while ReNeLLM is the most susceptible.

    \label{fig: iteration_distribution_HarmBench_GCG}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Noise Budget}
The final metric, Noise Budget, quantifies the additional tokens introduced by our amplification method. Since Attention Eclipse modifies jailbreak prompts by appending $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$, the noise budget is defined as:

\[
\text{Noise Budget} = \text{Size($\varphi_1$)} + \text{Size($\varphi_2$)}
\]

This metric ensures that the amplified jailbreak prompt remains concise and efficient.

The noise budget we consider for running for each of the amplified attacks is as below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Amplified ReNeLLM: Noise Budget = 10 + 10 = 20
    \item Amplified AutoDAN: Noise Budget = 5 + 20 = 25
    \item Amplified GCG: Noise Budget = 5 + 10 + 20 = 35
\end{itemize}

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Optimization Approach}
\label{sec: optimization}


Since $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ have distinct objectives, we adopt an interval optimization strategy to optimize them iteratively. Given that our optimization space is the text domain, where tokens must be updated discretely, we leverage the HotFlip method \cite{ebrahimi2017hotflip, wallace2019universal} to find optimal token replacements. HotFlip identifies the best token candidates that degrade the loss function most effectively, ensuring efficient updates.

To balance the optimization of both $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$, we alternate their updates as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Update the first token of $\varphi_1$.
    \item Switch to update the first token of $\varphi_2$.
    \item Repeat for the second token of $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$.
    \item Continue this alternating process until all tokens have been optimized.
\end{itemize}

This alternating strategy ensures that both $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ evolve in parallel while maintaining their respective roles—Recomposition and Camouflaging. Algorithm \ref{alg:jailbreak_framework} provides a pseudo-code representation of our optimization framework.

\begin{algorithm}[ht]

\State Decompose Goal into $G_h$ and $G_s$
\State Reconstruct new jailbreak prompt as: 
\Statex \hspace{1em} $J \gets G_{h}$ \, $AP$ \, [$\varphi_1$] \, $G_s$ \, [$\varphi_2$] \, $AS$
\State \textbf{Step 2: Optimization}
\For{$i = 1$ to $N$}
    \State Query $LLM_\text{mut}$ with $J$
    \If{$LLM_\text{judge}(J)$ detects related and harmful response}
        \State \textbf{return} $J$ as $J_{amp}$
    \EndIf
    \State Optimize next token of $\varphi_1$
    \State Query $LLM_\text{mut}$ with updated $J$
    \If{$LLM_\text{judge}(J)$ detects related and harmful response}
        \State \textbf{return} $J$ as $J_{amp}$
    \EndIf
    \State Optimize next token of $\varphi_2$
    \If{Termination condition met}
        \State \textbf{return} \textbf{Unsuccessful Jailbreak}
    \EndIf
\EndFor

\State \textbf{return} \textbf{Unsuccessful Jailbreak}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

% This section details the optimization process used in our jailbreak attack. As discussed, we introduce two sets of attention manipulator tokens, AMT\textsubscript{1} and AMT\textsubscript{2}, which are optimized to modify attention weights strategically. The goal of optimization is to update these tokens iteratively to construct an effective jailbreak prompt.

% \subsection{Loss Functions for Optimization}

% To optimize AMTs, we define two loss functions:

% \begin{equation}
% \mathcal{L}_{a1} = - \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{t_2 \in Goal_S} \sum_{t_1 \in Goal_H} \text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
% \mathcal{L}_{a2} = \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{t_2 \in Part_2} \sum_{t_1 \in Goal_H} \text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)
% \end{equation}

% where $\text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)$ represents the attention of token \(t_2\) on token \(t_1\) at layer \(l\) and head \(h\).

% \noindent The optimization objective for AMT\textsubscript{1} and AMT\textsubscript{2} is formulated as:

% \begin{equation}
%    AMT_1^* = \underset{AMT_1}{\arg\min}\big[ \mathcal{L}_{a1} \big]
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
%    AMT_2^* = \underset{AMT_2}{\arg\min}\big[ \mathcal{L}_{a2} \big]
% \end{equation}

% Minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{a1}$ increases the summed attention weights of Goal\textsubscript{S} tokens on Goal\textsubscript{H}, effectively reconstructing the original meaning of Goal that may have been disrupted by the decomposition step. This ensures that the LLM generates a response related to the attacker's intent.

% Conversely, minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{a2}$ decreases the summed attention weights of Part\textsubscript{2} tokens on Goal\textsubscript{H}, reducing the model’s focus on the harmful content. This modification decreases the likelihood of triggering the model’s alignment mechanisms, making the jailbreak prompt appear less harmful.



%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Datasets}
\label{appendix: dataset}

To evaluate the effectiveness of our jailbreak amplification method, we conducted experiments using two publicly available datasets: AdvBench and HarmBench. These datasets provide diverse scenarios of harmful prompts, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of jailbreak performance across different categories of misuse.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AdvBench}: This dataset consists of 520 prompts designed to elicit malicious or harmful responses from LLMs. Each prompt was classified based on OpenAI’s usage policy, which defines 13 distinct categories of harmful behaviour. To enhance organization, GPT-4 further grouped these prompts into seven broader classes \cite{ding2023wolf}. These categories capture real-world challenges that LLMs may face, and Table \ref{table: datasets_statistics} shows all 7 different categories and the number of prompts in each category. By leveraging this structured dataset, we were able to test how effectively jailbreak attacks can be amplified across different harmful prompt types. This is under the MIT license.

    \item \textbf{HarmBench}: This dataset contains 200 harmful behaviour prompts, organized into six broad categories. These categories encompass a wide range of misuse cases, where Table \ref{table: datasets_statistics} illustrates all 6 different categories and the number of prompts in each category. Each category reflects potential real-world misuse cases of LLMs, making HarmBench a valuable resource for evaluating safety vulnerabilities. This is under the MIT license.
\end{itemize}

By utilizing these datasets, we aimed to systematically analyze the potential for LLM misuse while rigorously evaluating the effectiveness of our jailbreak amplification method. The diversity of harmful behaviours covered in AdvBench and HarmBench allowed us to assess our approach under various adversarial conditions. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and limitations of attention-based jailbreak attacks, offering a foundation for future research on improving LLM security.

\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec: baseline_settings}

To reproduce the results of baseline attacks, we run their original code with the following hyperparameters mentioned for each of them. Also, for all of the baseline attacks and our proposed method, Attention Eclipse, all the results are driven by omitting system prompts. The models we utilize for amplification and comparing original attacks and their amplified versions are some open-source models including Llama2-7b-chat, Llama2-13b-chat, Llama2-70b-chat, and Vicuna-13b-v1.5. \\

\noindent \textbf{ReNeLLM}: The original code exists in \href{https://github.com/NJUNLP/ReNeLLM}{ReNeLLM GitHub}. We run the code with the same hyperparameters as they used to evaluate their proposed attack.  \\

% Moreover, for all baseline attacks, we reproduce the results by omitting the system prompt, the same as what \citet{ding2023wolf} has done.


\noindent \textbf{AutoDAN}: There are some versions of the AutoDAN attack and we evaluate AutoDAN\_GA which is proposed by \citet{liu2023autodan}. Compared to their existing code on \href{https://github.com/SheltonLiu-N/AutoDAN}{AutoDAN GitHub}, we just changed the number of steps to 50, and set the batch size to 64. The rest of the settings are the same as its original code. \\



\noindent \textbf{GCG}: The code exists on \href{https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks}{GCG GitHub}. We run the code by setting Adversarial\_Suffix noise budget to 25, batch\_size to 8, and n\_steps to 1000.

% \section{Analysis of Attention Patterns}

% \noindent Our method consists of two main steps for crafting jailbreak prompts, and we aim to analyze attention heatmaps to understand how attention patterns evolve during these steps. Figure \ref{fig: Analysis_Pattern_Normal} \mamun{Missing reference??} presents a case study where we first decompose the goal and then apply $AMT_{1}$ to establish a connection between $Goal_{S}$ and $Goal_{H}$. The colour of each word represents its attention weight on $Goal_{H}$, which, in this example, is 'bomb'.

% \noindent In the first input, representing the raw $Goal$, only the last two words have attention on 'bomb' as models like Llama2 typically focus each token’s attention on prior tokens and itself. The second input illustrates the decomposed prompt, where attention shifts predominantly to the initial words compared to the final ones. The third input demonstrates how adding $AMT_{1}$ bridges the two components. As observed, it increases the attention of 'this object' referring to 'bomb' thereby guiding the model to generate responses related to the original $Goal$. \\

% \noindent \textbf{Amplified ReNeLLM}
% Figure \ref{fig: Analysis_Pattern_ReNeLLM} analyze how our amplification changes the attention pattern within the jailbreak prompt to make it less harmful to bypass alignment. The second input shows the decomposed $Goal$ that shifts the attention from the final tokens to the previous one. The last input is amplified, showing that attention manipulator tokens could shift the attention on $Goal_{H}$ from final tokens to the initial tokens of input and decrease the harmfulness to bypass alignment. \\
