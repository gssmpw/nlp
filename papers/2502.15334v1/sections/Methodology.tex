\section{Methodology}

In this section, we introduce Attention Eclipse, a framework that enhances jailbreak attacks by leveraging the internal attention mechanisms of LLMs.
%Unlike existing jailbreak techniques that primarily rely on crafting jailbreak prompts by focusing on optimizing the traditional output loss function, Attention Eclipse provides an additional degree of freedom to the attackers which enables them to target the model's attention by back-propagating from internal attention weights of the model to the text input domain. It provides the power to control the model's attention by controlling text input. 
Conventional jailbreak algorithms optimize a global loss function typically capturing the difference between the model's output and a desired target output (typically, an affirmative response, leading the model to agree to respond to the unsafe prompt). In contrast, our approach introduces an attention-based intermediate loss function, where input tokens are explicitly integrated into the loss formulation, to increase or decrease attention among selected tokens. This allows for dynamic weighting of different prompt components, effectively modulating their influence on the model's inference/generation process.

% Unlike existing jailbreak techniques that primarily rely on adversarial suffixes or prompt modifications, our approach directly manipulates attention weights, allowing for more effective alignment bypassing. Attention Eclipse operates in two key phases: prompt decomposition and attention manipulator token optimization. The first phase restructures the jailbreak prompt by separating harmful and safe components, making the prompt less detectable while maintaining intent. The second phase optimizes attention manipulator tokens (AMTs) to modify attention weights, ensuring the model retains contextual associations necessary for successful jailbreak execution. These optimizations amplify existing jailbreak strategies, improving ASR while maintaining computational efficiency. \\



\subsection{Attention Loss for Jailbreak Attacks}

\noindent\textit{Traditional Output Loss for Jailbreak Attacks. }
%\ihsen{I don't think it's a good idea to have a subsection here; we want to keep the attention on our work. Could be a brief part in our Attention Loss}
Jailbreak attacks often rely on optimizing a crafted adversarial prompt to induce the model to generate a target and desired output. This prompt is achieved by crafting adversarial tokens to minimize a loss function that senses the deviation of the model's output from a desired target response \cite{liu2024autodan}.  %$\mathcal{L}_{\text{output}}$ is defined based on the divergence between the model's output distribution and desired target text $Y^*$:
Given a sequence of tokens $< x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m >$, the LLM estimates the probability distribution over the vocabulary for the next token $x_{m+1}$:
\begin{align}
    x_{m+j} \sim P(\cdot | x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{m+j-1}), \quad \forall j = 1 \dots k
\end{align}

The goal of jailbreak attacks is to prompt the model to produce output starting with a specific target (e.g. \textit{"Sure, here is how to ..."}),  denoted as  $< r_{m+1}, r_{m+2}, \dots, r_{m+k} >$. Given input $T_i =  < t_1, t_2, \dots, t_m >$, the goal is, for example, to optimize the jailbreak prompt $J_i$ to %maximize the probability: $P(r_{m+1}, \dots, r_{m+k} | t_1, \dots, t_m)$, e.g., by minimizing 
minimize the log-likelihood loss: 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{J_i} = -\log\left(P\left(r_{m+1}, \dots, r_{m+k} \mid t_1, \dots, t_m \right)\right)
\end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
%     \mathcal{L}_{\text{output}}(X) = D(LLM_{target}(X), Y^*)
% \end{equation}

%where $X$ represents the adversarially crafted input tokens, $LLM_{target}(X)$ denotes the model's predicted output distribution given input $X$, and $D(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a divergence measure like a cross-entropy loss:

% \begin{equation}
%     \mathcal{L}_{\text{output}}(X) = - \sum_{t} P_{Y^*}(t) \log P_{LLM_{target}(X)}(t).
% \end{equation}

% To craft the adversarial input, the attacker iteratively updates the input tokens $X$ to minimize $\mathcal{L}_{\text{output}}$.


Attention Eclipse uses a new loss function that leverages the model's attention weights, increasing or decreasing the attention among selected tokens in a way that leads to more effective jailbreak prompts that bypass alignment constraints. The attention-based loss function, $\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}$, quantifies the aggregated attention that selected tokens of the jailbreak prompt allocate to other selected tokens, across all layers and heads.

Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be sets of tokens within a prompt $X$. We define the attention loss $\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}$ as:
%\ihsen{-- Note to myself-- I need to redefine what is X properly, and make it more generic-- need to recall recomposition, etc etc -- or maybe sto at defining the loss for this section and bring evrything later in the subsequent sections...}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lattn}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}(S_1, S_2) = \mathlarger{\mathlarger{\sum}}_{l, h } \sum_{t_p \in S_2} \sum_{t_r \in S_1} A_{l,h}(t_p, t_r)
\end{equation}

\noindent
where the attention score $A_{l,h}(t_p, t_r)$ is computed using the scaled dot-product attention mechanism:
\begin{equation}
A_{l,h}(t_p, t_r) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{Q_{l,h}(t_p) \cdot K_{l,h}(t_r)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)
\end{equation}

\noindent 
Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0in} 
    \item \( Q_{l,h}(t_2) \) and \( K_{l,h}(t_1) \) are the query and key vectors for tokens \( t_2 \) and \( t_1 \), respectively, at layer \( l \) and attention head \( h \).
    \item \( d_k \) is the dimensionality of the key vectors.
    % \item The softmax function ensures that the attention scores sum to 1 across all tokens.
\end{itemize}

%The sets \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \) represent the tokens of two different sentences within the jailbreak prompt. 
 This loss formulation measures how much attention the model assigns to interactions between two tokens or groups of tokens. It is worth noting that in Equation \ref{eq:Lattn}, the specific "tokens of interest" appear explicitly in the loss function, which enables surgical manipulation of these tokens' impact. In the following section, we'll leverage $\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}$ to amplify the jailbreak impact.   %, potentially revealing vulnerabilities in alignment mechanisms.


% Attention Eclipse proposes a new loss function which is based on the attention weights of the model and provides more capacity to the attackers in crafting jailbreak prompts to bypass alignments.  $\mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}$ is defined based on summed attention weights of one sentence of the jailbreak prompt  on another sentence at all heads and layers of the model:


% \begin{equation}
% \mathcal{L}_{\text{attn}}(X) = \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{t_2 \in S_2} \sum_{t_1 \in S_1} \text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)
% \end{equation}

% where $\text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)$ represents amount of attention token \(t_2\) pays to token \(t_1\) at layer \(l\) and head \(h\), S\textsubscript{2} denotes set of tokens within second sentence, and S\textsubscript{1} denotes set of tokens within first sentence. For more details about attention granularity in LLMs, read Appendix \ref{sec: Attention Granularity}.

\subsection{Amplifying Jailbreaks using attention}

%\noindent \textbf{Notation} 
Let $J_i$ be an initial prompt that may be a jailbreak attempt. We assume the following generic composition of the initial prompt $J_i$: 
\begin{equation}
J_i = <AP, Goal , AS>  
\end{equation}

where, 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0in}
    \item $Goal$ is the harmful prompt that we aim to force the LLM to respond to. 
    \item $AP$ are tokens appearing before $Goal$ as "Adversarial Prefix". Notice that in some settings such as GCG, $AP= \emptyset$
    \item $AS$ are tokens appearing after $Goal$, i.e., "Adversarial Suffix". 
\end{itemize}



\noindent \textbf{Attack Mechanism.} 
Given an initial prompt, $J_{i}$, our objective is to generate an amplified prompt, $J_{amp}$, that escapes alignment, using the strategies illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig: General Framework}.
% Table \ref{tab: Goal_JPs} provides examples illustrating this transformation.
% \ihsen{We need to reference a generic illustration like Figure 2}
%To construct our amplified jailbreak, we decompose $Goal$ into 2 different set of tokens to enable embedding harmful content within a benign-looking prompt. Specifically, we split $Goal$ into two components: $G_h$, which contains the harmful content, and $G_s$, a rewritten version designed to appear safe (using recomposition). Table \ref{tab: explain_JP_old} shows examples of $J_{i}$ and marks these components. By isolating $G_h$, we dilute its alignment-triggering characteristics, increasing the chances of bypassing the LLM's alignment. 
Specifically, Attention Eclipse's attack template employs the following two strategies: \textbf{(i)} \textbf{Recomposing:} we split $Goal$ into two components: $G_h$, which contains the harmful content, and $G_s$, a rewritten version designed to appear safe.  Recomposition amplifies the attention between ($G_h$ and $G_s$) in the attention space; and \textbf{(ii)} \textbf{Camouflaging} the adversarial suffix, by balancing the effective impact of $G_h$ on the generative process with the level of attention that triggers the refusal process. 
To do so, we introduce two sets of tokens, $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$, which act as attention manipulation adversarial components within the prompt.  Consequently, the generic structure of $J_{amp}$ is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    J_{amp} = <G_h, AP, \varphi_1, G_s, \varphi_2, AS>
\end{equation}
The objective is then to optimize $\Phi = (\varphi_1^*, \varphi_2^*)$ such that: 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:opt}
\begin{cases}
    \varphi^*_1 = \underset{\varphi_1}{\arg\min}\big[ - \mathcal{L}_{attn}(G_s, G_h) \big] \\
    \varphi^*_2 = \underset{\varphi_2}{\arg\min}\big[ \mathcal{L}_{attn}(AS, G_h) \big] 
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

 Equation \ref{eq:opt} represents the core objectives of our approach; we first explore the token space of $\varphi_1$ to maximize the attention between the decomposed payload parts, i.e., $(G_s, G_h)$. This facilitates recomposing meaning through attention. Our second strategy amplifies an adversarial suffix generated by another Jailbreak algorithm, by ensuring that the adversarial suffix does not trigger the model’s refusal mechanism.
The second set of attention manipulator tokens, $\varphi_{2}$ are optimized to lower the attention from the adversarial suffix on the harmful part $G_h$. This effectively redirects focus away from harmful content, decreasing the likelihood of triggering the model’s alignment mechanism. Figure \ref{fig: Attention Pattern} illustrates how we add different components to create a jailbreak prompt using Attention Eclipse.

% we first decompose Goal into Goal\textsubscript{S} and Goal\textsubscript{H}. Then, we optimize AMTs to modify attention weights, ensuring the model places less focus on Goal\textsubscript{H} while maintaining the effectiveness of the jailbreak.


%where attention later bridges the safe portion with the adversarial intent.

%Let Goal represent the harmful prompt that we aim to induce the LLM to respond to. We define $J_{old}$ as a jailbreak prompt generated by an existing attack method to bypass alignment restrictions and elicit a response to the Goal. Attention Eclipse's framework enhances this prompt to produce an amplified version, J\textsubscript{amp}.

%\textcolor{cyan}{The key component of attention loss is $\text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)$ which is based on two things: 1) the semantical relation between tokens, and 2) the position of these tokens inside the input. This shows that attention loss is greatly dependent on the text input content and how it is framed.  Since the modification of the text input structure changes the model's attention, we propose: 1) Decomposition of harmful prompt which enables the adversary to embed harmful content within a benign-looking prompt where attention later bridges the safe portion with the adversarial intent. And 2) Attention manipulation facilitates camouflaging adversarial suffixes, where an adversarial suffix —generated through an existing jailbreak method— is made less conspicuous by controlling the model's attention distribution within the prompt.}





% Typically, Goal is embedded within $J_{old}$. We categorize the tokens appearing before Goal as "Adversarial Prefix" and those appearing after Goal as "Adversarial Suffix". 
% \textcolor{cyan}{During the optimization step, we introduce two attention manipulator tokens (AMT\textsubscript{1} and AMT\textsubscript{2}), strategically inserted to modify attention weights. Table \ref{tab: explain_JP_old} illustrates examples of these components. }
% Finally, in the decomposition step, Goal is divided into Goal\textsubscript{S} (a safe component) and Goal\textsubscript{H} (a harmful component).}

% }
%\subsection{Formulation}


% \noindent To construct J\textsubscript{amp}, we first decompose Goal into Goal\textsubscript{S} and Goal\textsubscript{H}. Then, we optimize AMTs to modify attention weights, ensuring the model places less focus on Goal\textsubscript{H} while maintaining the effectiveness of the jailbreak.

% \noindent Formally, the optimization of AMTs is defined as:

% \begin{equation}
%    AMT^* = \underset{AMT}{\arg\min} \big[ LLM_{Attn}(Goal\textsubscript{H})\big]
% \end{equation}

% where \( AMT^* \) represents the optimized attention manipulator tokens that minimize the model's attention on the harmful portion of the prompt.

% \textcolor{cyan}{In the following sections, we detail the steps taken to construct J\textsubscript{amp}, including the decomposition strategy and attention-based optimization techniques.}




% \subsection{Decomposing Prompts}
% \label{Methodology: Decomposing Prompts}

% Aligned LLMs are designed to detect and reject harmful prompts. As \citet{ding2023wolf} demonstrated, the security of a single prompt does not imply the security of its variations. Thus, our first step is to generate a variant of the harmful part of the prompt by decomposing it in a way that makes it more likely to bypass alignment mechanisms. 

% \noindent We achieve this by splitting the Goal in $J_{old}$ into two key components: Goal\textsubscript{H}, which contains the harmful content, and Goal\textsubscript{S}, a rewritten version designed to appear safe. Figure \ref{fig: General Framework} illustrates this decomposition process. By isolating Goal\textsubscript{H}, we dilute its alignment-triggering characteristics, increasing the chances of bypassing the LLM's defences. \\





% \noindent \textbf{Rewrite decomposed Jailbreak Prompt} 
% \vspace{0.5em}

% \noindent Typically, $J_{old}$ consists of three parts:  
% 1) Goal, 2) Adversarial Prefix (AP), and 3) Adversarial Suffix (AS). Table \ref{tab: explain_JP_old} shows examples of $J_{old}$ and marks these components.

%\textcolor{cyan}{\noindent After decomposition, we retain Goal\textsubscript{S} in its original position but move Goal\textsubscript{H} before it. This adjustment ensures that the LLM recognizes the relationship between the two components. Otherwise, the model may fail to associate them correctly and generate an unrelated response.}

%\mamun{Figure 2 does not represent the example "bomb, how to make this object anymore.Please check}

% \noindent For example, in Figure \ref{fig: General Framework}, the model might not realize that "this object" refers to "bomb" and could generate a response about a different object. To prevent this, we increase the attention weight of Goal\textsubscript{S} on Goal\textsubscript{H} using AMT\textsubscript{1}. Since LLMs typically attend to previous tokens, we place Goal\textsubscript{H} before Goal\textsubscript{S}. To further reinforce the connection, AMT\textsubscript{1} is embedded between them. Figure \ref{fig: Attention Pattern} illustrates this component placement. \\




% \noindent \textbf{Reconstructing Prompt Meaning} 
%\vspace{0.5em}

% \noindent To reconstruct meaning, we minimize the following loss function, which represents the negative summed attention weights of Goal\textsubscript{S} tokens on Goal\textsubscript{H} tokens across all layers and attention heads:

% \begin{equation}
% \mathcal{L}_{a1} = - \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{t_2 \in Goal_S} \sum_{t_1 \in Goal_H} \text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)
% \end{equation}

% where $\text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)$ represents the attention of token \(t_2\) on token \(t_1\) at layer \(l\) and head \(h\).

% \noindent To minimize this loss function, we define the following optimization problem:

% \begin{equation}
%    AMT_1^* = \underset{AMT_1}{\arg\min}\big[ \mathcal{L}_{a1} \big] 
% \end{equation}




% \subsection{Decrease Harmfulness}
% \label{Methodology: Decrease Harmfulness}

% \noindent To further reduce harmfulness, we introduce another set of attention manipulator tokens, AMT\textsubscript{2}. These tokens are optimized to lower the LLM's attention on Goal\textsubscript{H}, effectively redirecting focus away from harmful content and reducing the likelihood of triggering alignment mechanisms.

% \noindent To achieve this, we minimize the following loss function:

% \begin{equation}
% \mathcal{L}_{a2} = \sum_{l \in L} \sum_{h \in H} \sum_{t_2 \in AS} \sum_{t_1 \in Goal_H} \text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)
% \end{equation}

% where $\text{attn}(l, h, t_2, t_1)$ represents the attention of token \(t_2\) on token \(t_1\) at layer \(l\) and head \(h\).

% \noindent To minimize this loss function:

% \begin{equation}
%    AMT_2^* = \underset{AMT_2}{\arg\min}\big[ \mathcal{L}_{a2} \big] 
% \end{equation}

%\noindent This ensures that the model processes the prompt more safely while still enabling effective jailbreak execution.
