\section{Challenges and Future Trends in Multimodal Large Model Continual Learning}

\subsection{Catastrophic Forgetting}

\subsubsection{Challenges Encountered}

Catastrophic forgetting has long been a classic problem in continual learning tasks, and its presence significantly limits the adaptability and generalization ability of models in real-world dynamic environments. For multimodal large models, this issue becomes even more complex due to the need for training on large-scale data, as well as the immense computational resources and storage space required.

\subsubsection{Future Trends}

Balancing forgetting management with learning efficiency, especially as tasks increase, is a complex optimization challenge. The goal is to prevent catastrophic forgetting while maintaining learning efficiency. Future research should focus on strategies to mitigate forgetting, such as frameworks or algorithms that preserve old knowledge while learning new information, or mechanisms for periodic knowledge consolidation. In addition, techniques such as self-supervised learning and transfer learning can be utilized. By sharing latent features or representations across different modalities, these methods can reduce interference between tasks, thereby alleviating the impact of catastrophic forgetting.

\subsection{Improvement and Standardization of Evaluation Benchmarks}

\subsubsection{Challenges Encountered}

Evaluation benchmarks should not only consider a model's performance in learning new tasks but also assess its ability to retain knowledge across different modalities, the effectiveness of cross-task transfer, and its stability over long-term learning. Currently, benchmarks for evaluating continual learning in multimodal large models are still relatively scarce. As multimodal large models become increasingly complex in real-world applications, developing comprehensive and systematic evaluation benchmarks for their continual learning capabilities is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed.

\subsubsection{Future Trends}

Future research should focus on designing more comprehensive and flexible evaluation benchmarks that support the assessment of continual learning in multimodal large models within multi-task environments. Researchers need to develop evaluation metrics capable of measuring a model's performance in multi-task learning, knowledge transfer, catastrophic forgetting, and cross-modal consistency. Furthermore, the standardization of evaluation benchmarks will be a key direction for future development. By establishing unified evaluation frameworks, it will be possible to more effectively compare the strengths and weaknesses of different models, thereby advancing research in this field.

\subsection{Improving the Interpretability and Transparency of Continual Learning in Multimodal Large Models}

\subsubsection{Challenges Encountered}

In multimodal learning tasks, models need to integrate information from different modalities (such as images, text, audio, etc.), which makes their decision-making process more complex and harder to trace. In particular in continual learning environments, the model must continuously learn new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous tasks. The integration and transfer of information across different modalities during this learning process make the model's decision mechanism even more challenging to interpret. Enhancing the interpretability of multimodal large models in continual learning not only helps increase the model's trustworthiness but also provides effective debugging and error diagnosis mechanisms during the learning process.

\subsubsection{Future Trends}

In future research on continual learning for multimodal large models, to enhance model interpretability, researchers can design more transparent and traceable architectures that allow for clear tracking and analysis of the model's decision-making rationale when handling different tasks. At the model design level, researchers can integrate the latest advances in explainable AI (XAI) to incorporate highly interpretable model structures, thus improving transparency in the decision-making process. Furthermore, by combining techniques such as cross-modal learning and transfer learning, researchers can effectively facilitate the transfer and retention of cross-task knowledge during continual learning, while also enhancing the understanding and explainability of the knowledge transfer mechanisms.
