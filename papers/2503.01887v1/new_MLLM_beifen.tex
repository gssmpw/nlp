\subsection{Model Innovation}
With the continuous development of MLLMs, researchers have made various innovations in their structure, methods, and functional modules to enhance model performance, generalization ability, and adaptability. This section reviews the main innovations, which focus on three core directions: framework design, method optimization, and functional module improvements. These innovations collectively drive the performance of MLLMs in complex multimodal tasks. This section will explore the latest research advancements in these areas.

\subsubsection{Framework Innovation}
Framework innovation is the foundation of MLLM development, aiming to achieve efficient fusion and processing of cross-modal information by improving the overall architectural design. In recent years, researchers have proposed many efficient framework designs. As shown in Table \ref{MLLM_frame}, researchers have proposed several efficient framework designs, such as MaVEn, MoVA, AutoM3L, DI-MML and et. These framework innovations provide more efficient tools and methods for MLLMs to handle multimodal tasks involving language, vision, and hearing. They enable MLLMs to achieve more precise reasoning and decision-making in the interaction of multimodal data, thereby offering strong support for solving complex problems in practical applications.

More details of the innovation of MLLMs Frameworks are provided in Section \ref{appendix_MLLM_MI} of the Appendix.






\subsubsection{Method Innovation}

Method innovation is the core driving force behind the performance improvement of MLLMs. By designing more efficient training methods and optimization objectives, it helps models better adapt to dynamic task environments. As shown in Table~\ref{MLLM_method}, in recent years, researchers have proposed numerous novel and efficient methods to enhance the accuracy and robustness of MLLMs. These method research has explored cutting-edge techniques such as multimodal contrastive learning, self-supervised learning objectives, and multimodal alignment mechanisms. These methods not only enhance the model's generalization ability but also significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal tasks.

More details of the innovation of MLLMs methods are provided in Section \ref{appendix_MLLM_MI} of the Appendix.




\subsubsection{Module Innovation}

In terms of module innovation, researchers have focused on refining the internal design of models by improving specific modules to enhance cross-modal interaction and representational capabilities. These modules have increased the flexibility and efficiency of the models. As shown in Table~\ref{MLLM_module}, in recent years, many efficient and streamlined modules have been proposed, further boosting the overall performance of the models.These modules, through independent optimization and joint modeling of different modalities, enable the model to perform exceptionally well in tasks such as multimodal reasoning, generation, and understanding. They allow for more accurate cross-modal knowledge fusion and semantic understanding, providing crucial support for the functional expansion and practical application of MLLMs.

More details of the innovation of MLLMs Modules are provided in Section \ref{appendix_MLLM_MI} of the Appendix.

\subsection{Benchmarks}
As MLLMs continue to achieve breakthroughs in multimodal tasks such as vision, language, and speech, comprehensive benchmarks have become crucial for systematically evaluating and comparing model performance. These benchmarks not only provide standardized datasets and tasks but also define metrics for assessing models' abilities in cross-modal reasoning, generation, classification, and other areas. They play a key role in guiding research directions, identifying model limitations, and advancing technological progress. This section will introduce some of the recent representative benchmarks, covering a wide range of scenarios from academic research to practical applications, reflecting the diverse needs and challenges in the multimodal field.



\subsubsection{ROPE: Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation Benchmark}
Despite the impressive performance of MLLMs in various downstream applications, they often encounter the issue of object hallucination~\cite{rohrbach2018object,dai2022plausible,li2023evaluating,zhang2024groundhog,zhai2023halle,liu2023mitigating,you2023ferret,zhou2023analyzing,wang2023llm}, where the model erroneously generates objects that do not exist in the image. Current benchmarks for evaluating object hallucination mainly focus on the presence of a single object category, rather than individual entities. 

Xuweiyi Chen et al.~\cite{chen2024multi} conducted a systematic study of the multi-object hallucination problem, examining how models misidentify objects when attending to multiple objects simultaneously (e.g., inventing non-existent objects or being distracted). They introduced an automated evaluation protocol called Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), which considers the distribution of object categories within a single image during testing. By using visual reference to disambiguate, the protocol systematically analyzes multi-object hallucination, revealing the hallucination behaviors and influencing factors when models process multiple objects. In addition, ROPE designs multiple task prompts, including Default Multi-Object, Student-Forcing, Teacher-Forcing, and Single-Object. The dataset is divided into four subsets, each considering different object category distributions: 1) Homogeneous: All test objects belong to the same category. 2) Heterogeneous: All test objects belong to different categories. 3) In-the-Wild: A mixed object category distribution, with test objects randomly selected and ordered. 4) Adversarial: After multiple repetitions of the same category, a different category object is introduced. The dataset is further divided into Seen and Unseen based on whether the model has encountered these images during instruction tuning. 

More details of the overview of MLLM performance on the ROPE are provided in Section \ref{appendix_rope} of the Appendix.




\subsubsection{CVQA: Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering Benchmark}
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a crucial task in MLLMs, designed to test their understanding and reasoning capabilities across visual and textual data~\cite{antol2015vqa, mathew2021docvqa,masry2022chartqa,kafle2018dvqa,chen2021geoqa}. However, most existing VQA datasets primarily focus on English and a few major world languages, with images often being Western-centric. While recent efforts have expanded the linguistic coverage of VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. Moreover, these datasets typically extend their language range through translation or other methods while keeping the images unchanged, leading to limited cultural representation. To address these limitations, David Romero et al.~\cite{wang2023llm} developed a new benchmark, CVQA, which aims to encompass rich linguistic and cultural diversity. This benchmark involves native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process to ensure authenticity and inclusivity. 

More details of the scale and diversity of the CVQA benchmark and an overview of MLLM performance on the CVQA are provided in Section \ref{appendix_cvqa} of the Appendix.

\subsubsection{II-Bench: Image Implication Understanding Benchmark}
Images often contain rich emotional and cultural narratives, and understanding their meaning and exploring the human emotions and cultural context they reflect requires attention to detail~\cite{bubeck2023sparks,achiam2023gpt,wachowiak2023does}. While MLLMs have made significant progress in understanding and generating cross-modal content, achieving new breakthroughs in benchmarks like image captioning~\cite{lin2014microsoft,sharma2018conceptual,sidorov2020textcaps,gurari2020captioning,pont2020connecting,agrawal2019nocaps} and visual question answering~\cite{antol2015vqa, mathew2021docvqa, masry2022chartqa,kafle2018dvqa,chen2021geoqa}, there has been insufficient exploration of their higher-order perceptual abilities. Ziqiang Liu et al.~\cite{liu2024ii} introduced a new benchmark, II-Bench, designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to understand and reason about the complex implicit meanings in images, addressing the gap in existing benchmarks for assessing higher-order perceptual abilities in MLLMs.

More details of the scale and diversity of the II-Bench benchmark and an overview of MLLM performance on the II-Bench are provided in Section \ref{appendix_II-Bench} of the Appendix.

\subsubsection{ConBench: MLLMs Answer Consistency Evaluation Benchmark}
MLLMs have made rapid progress in visual information perception and reasoning. Although MLLMs are capable of generating high-quality task prompt responses, simply modifying the prompt can lead to contradictory answers, even when the correct answer is provided. Specifically, under different prompt space sizes, these models lack consistency in answers to the same knowledge point, which significantly undermines trust in these models~\cite{li2023benchmarking,lin2023generating}. To ensure that MLLMs can predict correct and consistent answers when faced with various query formats, Yuan Zhang et al.~\cite{zhang2024unveiling} proposed a multimodal benchmark tool, ConBench, designed to comprehensively assess the consistency of MLLMsâ€”specifically, their ability to provide the same answer to the same knowledge point across different query formats.

ConBench evaluates MLLMs by offering a diverse set of question formats, including true/false questions, multiple-choice questions, and limited visual question answering (VQA) problems. It also introduces two multidimensional evaluation metrics: 1)Discriminative Domain Evaluation Metric (ConScore[D]): Assesses consistency based on the accuracy of the model's answers to discriminative questions. 2)Generative Domain Evaluation Metric (ConScore[C]): Evaluates consistency by comparing the coherence between the model-generated captions and the discriminative answers.

More details of the scale and diversity of the ConBench benchmark and an overview of MLLM performance on the ConBench are provided in Section \ref{appendix_ConBench} of the Appendix.



\subsubsection{COMPBENCH: Comparative Reasoning Benchmark}
The ability to compare objects, scenes, or situations is crucial for decision-making and problem-solving in everyday life~\cite{masry2022chartqa,hudson2019gqa,lu2022learn}. Although this ability is widespread in human cognition, it has not been fully explored in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Jihyung Kil et al.~\cite{kil2024compbench} proposed a benchmark, COMPBENCH, designed to evaluate the comparative reasoning ability of MLLMs.

More details of the scale and diversity of the COMPBENCH benchmark and an overview of MLLM performance on the COMPBENCH are provided in Section \ref{appendix_COMPBENCH} of the Appendix.





\subsubsection{Hallu-PI: Evaluating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models within Perturbed Inputs}
Similarly, in the context of the hallucination problem faced by MLLMs in visual-language understanding and generation tasks~\cite{rohrbach2018object,dai2022plausible,li2023evaluating,zhang2024groundhog,zhai2023halle,liu2023mitigating,you2023ferret,zhou2023analyzing,wang2023llm}, Peng Ding et al.~\cite{ding2024hallu} pointed out that previous studies have mainly focused on evaluating hallucinations on standard, undisturbed benchmarks, neglecting the prevalent interference inputs in the real world. This is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of hallucinations in MLLMs. They proposed the first benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs under disturbed inputs, called Hallu-PI, which includes seven types of disturbed scenarios: noise, blur, weather, digits, image stitching, image cropping, and prompt misdirection.

More details of the overview of MLLM performance on the Hallu-PI are provided in Section \ref{appendix_Hallu-PI} of the Appendix.



\subsubsection{ReForm-Eval: Evaluating MLLMs via Unified Re-Formulation of Task-Oriented Benchmarks}

MLLMs have made significant progress in understanding and reasoning about visual information~\cite{achiam2023gpt,zhu2023minigpt,liu2024visual,ye2023mplug,chen2023shikra}. However, this has posed challenges for the automatic evaluation of free-form text outputs from MLLMs. To leverage annotations from existing benchmarks and reduce the manual effort required to construct new benchmarks, Zejun Li et al.~\cite{li2024reform} proposed a method for reformatting existing benchmarks into a unified format compatible with MLLMs. Through systematic data collection and reformatting, they introduced the ReForm-Eval benchmark, which is designed to comprehensively and quantitatively assess the capabilities of MLLMs. This approach overcomes the structural differences between existing task-oriented multimodal benchmarks and MLLMs.

More details of the scale and diversity of the ReForm-Eval benchmark and an overview of MLLM performance on the ReForm-Eval are provided in Section \ref{appendix_ReForm-Eval} of the Appendix.




\subsubsection{VisionGraph: Graph Theory Problems Benchmark in Visual Context}

MLLMs have achieved significant success in visual understanding and reasoning~\cite{luo2023wizardmath,liu2024visual,chen2023shikra,achiam2023gpt}, but multimodal graph reasoning remains a challenging task~\cite{wang2024can}. It requires MLLMs to accurately understand graph structures and perform multi-step reasoning on visual graphs. To explore the ability of advanced MLLMs to address multimodal graph reasoning tasks, Yunxin Li et al.~\cite{li2024visiongraph} designed a benchmark called VisionGraph, which includes a series of graph reasoning problems aimed at testing MLLMs' understanding of graph structures and their multi-step reasoning capabilities.

More details of the overview of MLLM performance on the VisionGraph are provided in Section \ref{appendix_VisionGraph} of the Appendix.







\subsection{Applications of MLLMs}

Multimodal large models (MLLMs) have emerged as a significant direction in artificial intelligence research in recent years~\cite{zhan2024anygpt,chiang2023vicuna,jiang2023motiongpt,zhang2024motiongpt,huang2023visual,li2023large,liu2024improved,mu2024embodiedgpt}. With the rapid development of technologies such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition, single-modal intelligent systems can no longer meet the increasingly complex requirements of real-world applications~\cite{park2023generative,radford2021learning,rocamonde2023vision,sun2023aligning}. Multimodal learning, by integrating different types of data inputs, simulates the diversity and complexity of human information processing, offering more comprehensive and flexible intelligent services. The emergence of multimodal models like CLIP~\cite{radford2021learning} and GPT-4~\cite{achiam2023gpt} marks the rapid progress in this field, showcasing exceptional performance in tasks such as image generation, text generation, and cross-modal retrieval~\cite{snell2022offline,wang2022self,wei2022chain,betker2023improving,brooks2023instructpix2pix}. The ability to integrate information from various modalities enables MLLMs to demonstrate tremendous potential across multiple domains, particularly in applications such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, and robotics, where they can significantly enhance system robustness and intelligence levels~\cite{brohan2023rt,driess2023palm,chen2023shikra,huang2023instruct2act,huang2022language,huang2022inner,huang2022inner,liu2024visual,chen2024llm,lv2024robomp}.With the increasing richness of data sources and the continuous improvement of computational power, multimodal large models (MLLMs) are expected to see widespread application in more practical scenarios. At the same time, with the deepening of interdisciplinary research, MLLMs will not only play a role in traditional AI tasks but will also expand into more edge domains, driving artificial intelligence from closed systems to a more open and intelligent ecosystem.

More details of the applications of MLLMs are provided in Section \ref{applications_MLLM} of the Appendix.

In summary, the application prospects of multimodal large models are vast. However, to fully unleash their potential, this requires the combined advancement of technological innovation and theoretical breakthroughs. It is anticipated that, in the future, with the ongoing progress in algorithms, hardware, and cross-domain collaboration, MLLMs will achieve more efficient and intelligent performance in a wider range of practical applications, further advancing the development of artificial intelligence.
