abstract = {Throughout the history of software engineering, the human aspects have repeatedly been recognized as important. Even though research that investigates them has been growing in the past decade, these aspects should be more generally considered. The main objective of this study is to clarify the research area concerned with human aspects of software engineering and to create a common platform for future research. In order to meet the objective, we propose a definition of the research area behavioral software engineering (BSE) and present results from a systematic literature review based on the definition. The result indicates that there are knowledge gaps in the research area of behavioral software engineering and that earlier research has been focused on a few concepts, which have been applied to a limited number of software engineering areas. The individual studies have typically had a narrow perspective focusing on few concepts from a single unit of analysis. Further, the research has rarely been conducted in collaboration by researchers from both software engineering and social science. Altogether, this review can help put a broader set of human aspects higher on the agenda for future software engineering research and practice.}

author = {Arla Day and Sarah N. Crown and Meredith Ivany},
keywords = {Organisational change, Burnout, Supervisor support, Job control, Health care},
abstract = {As organisations experience rapid change, employee health and well-being has emerged as an important issue. Although organisational change can result in psychological and physical stress among employees (Hylton, 2004), providing positive organisational resources, such as support and job control, may help reduce employee burnout (e.g., Dubois et al., 2014; Leiter and Maslach, 2009; Puleo, 2011). Therefore, using a sample of Canadian health-care staff (N=202) who were involved in a large-scale organisational change, we investigated: (a) whether perceptions of organisational change stressors were associated with burnout (i.e., exhaustion, cynicism, and professional efficacy), (b) the extent to which supervisor support and job control were directly related to burnout, and (c) whether support and control moderated the relationship between change stressors and burnout. Job control was directly related to all of the burnout components, and support was related to exhaustion and cynicism. Supervisor support buffered the negative relationship between change stressors and exhaustion and between change stressors and cynicism. Job control moderated the negative relationship between change and professional efficacy.}
