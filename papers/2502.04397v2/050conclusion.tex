Tokenizing medical codes is a critical yet challenging step in developing foundation models for electronic health records (EHRs). Existing tokenizers treat medical codes as isolated textual units, failing to capture their structured relationships within large-scale medical ontologies. With more than 600,000 codes that span multiple terminologies, standard tokenization methods struggle to scale while preserving the rich semantic and relational context necessary for downstream clinical and operational tasks.

We introduced \model, a multimodal tokenizer of medical codes that integrates textual definitions and relational ontologies of medical codes to create a unified token representation. \model applies vector quantization to encode both modalities in a structured token space, preserving cross-modality relationships. We integrated \model with five EHR models, evaluating its impact across inpatient (MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV) and outpatient (EHRShot) settings, as well as in fine-tuning a medical question-answering system.

Our results establish \model as a generalizable tokenizer for medical codes, shedding light on how optimizing the tokenization process can benefit medical foundation models.
