This work presents a tokenizer for medical codes designed to assist other models in better encoding semantic knowledge.
While our tokenizer complements other models, it does not directly raise ethical concerns.
Instead, it enhances the trustworthiness of these models by providing text and graph-based information as references for tokenization.
In future work, we will explore ways to better integrate our tokenizer with other models to further improve both their performance and trustworthiness.
