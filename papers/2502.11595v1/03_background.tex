\section{Background and System Model} \label{sec:background}
Next, we provide an overview of relevant standards for Time-Sensitive Networking~(TSN) and its proposed integration with 5G.
We then introduce our system model and define the end-to-end QoS requirements for streams in wireless TSN.

\subsection{Time-Sensitive Networking} \label{sec:tsn}
TSN is a set of IEEE 802.1 standards to provide real-time communication in Ethernet networks with bounded latency and low packet delay variations for each stream.
Streams originate at exactly one talker, traverse multiple bridges, and terminate at one or more listeners.
To schedule time-triggered streams, we consider a centralized network controller~(CNC)~\cite{8514112} with a global view of the network and streams to configure the TSN mechanisms (as described next) at each bridge.
Moreover, we assume a bounded clock skew between network devices~\cite{802.1AS} and that talkers are synchronized to the network schedule.

For time-triggered streams, i.e., periodic traffic with fixed frame sizes, two TSN mechanisms are of central interest: the Time-Aware Shaper~(TAS)~\cite{802.1Qbv} and Per-Stream Filtering and Policing~(PSFP)~\cite{802.1Qci}.
Fig.~\ref{fig:tsn_model} illustrates the operation of TAS and PSFP for a bridge.
When a frame $f$ arrives at the bridge $u$, each frame is first mapped to its corresponding TSN stream via its source/destination MAC address, VLAN identifier, and priority code point~(PCP) value.
PSFP then verifies that the frame adheres to the stream specification, i.e., by arriving within an expected interval $\R{u, f} = [\text{rx}^{min}, \text{rx}^{max}]$. 
If a violation is detected, the frame is discarded; otherwise the frame is enqueued.
To determine the queue where $f$ is appended, the bridge consults its forwarding table (specifying the egress port) and the 3-bit PCP value in the frame's header (specifying one out of eight FIFO queues per egress port).

When the egress port is free, TAS uses gates (one per queue) to select the next frame for transmission.
Whether the gates are currently open or closed is determined by the active entry in the gate control list~(GCL).
While finding suitable GCLs is a computationally hard problem that is done by the CNC in advance, they simplify the transmission selection at runtime:
TAS selects the frame at the head of the highest-priority queue that is non-empty and has an open gate.
In the case of Fig.~\ref{fig:tsn_model}, the third GCL entry is currently active and only opens the gate of the highest-priority queue; 
this allows the first frame of the queue to be forwarded without any delays from lower-priority traffic.
Finally, note that the GCL is also periodic and repeats after the least common multiple of the streams' periods; we call this the hypercycle $H$ of the TSN configuration.

\subsection{The 5G System as a Logical TSN Bridge} \label{sec:5g_tsn}
To provide the same TSN mechanisms in networks that require both wired and wireless elements, e.g., free-moving robots in an industrial setting, 3GPP recently standardized an architecture to expose the 5G system as a logical TSN bridge~\cite{3gpp.23.501}. 
An overview of this integration is provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:5g_tsn_bridge}:
The TSN systems on the left show two moving robots, containing a single TSN end-station or a more complex internal network.
Each robot has a user equipment~(UE) to connect wirelessly to the 5G radio access network~(RAN).
When data is sent to the edge computing platform on the right, the RAN forwards the frames via the 5G core network (CN).

Instead of exposing the entire internal state (e.g., 5G resource allocation or session management), the 5G system provides device-side~(DS-TT) and network-side TSN translators~(NW-TT).
From the perspective of the TSN controller, the 5G system thus appears as a logical TSN bridge that supports the TSN mechanisms, as in Section~\ref{sec:tsn}.
Still, Fig.~\ref{fig:delays} shows an evident non-functional difference in the port-to-port delays of wired bridges and logical 5G-TSN bridges:
For wired bridges, the port-to-port delay corresponds to the processing delay and exhibits only small delay variations below $\qty{1}{\us}$.
For logical 5G-TSN bridges, however, the uplink port-to-port delay covers the entirety from the DS-TT transmission start until the NW-TT reception time, yielding millisecond delays and millisecond delay variations (a difference by three orders of magnitude).

The scheduler must account for this difference when synthesizing TSN configurations.
We therefore assume that the 5G system reports port-to-port delay histograms to the CNC, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:delays}(b).
Different streams can be served with different histograms.
For this work, we assume that the histograms are stationary and stay valid for any TSN scheduling decision.
However, even in this idealized setting, we show that existing approaches cannot provide any QoS guarantees or do not scale.

\subsection{System Model and Notation}
We model the network as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$.
A vertex $u \in V$ represents a network entity visible from the TSN controller (i.e., end-devices, wired TSN bridges, and TSN translators), whereas an edge $[u,v] \in E$ (i.e., $u,v \in V$) specifies an Ethernet or 5G link between two adjacent network entities.
Note that, in the case of Fig.~\ref{fig:5g_tsn_bridge}, we do not use a single vertex to model the logical 5G-TSN bridge;
instead, we use three vertices for the two DS-TTs and the NW-TT.
We argue that this way of modelling makes our results also applicable for other wireless technologies like IEEE 802.11.

We denote the set of (time-triggered) streams by $\TT$.
Each stream $F \in \TT$ defines its path $\path{F}$, period $\period{F}$, phase $\phase{F}$, and frame size $\size{F}$.
For this work, we assume unicast paths of the form $(\v{1}{F}, \ldots, \vl{F})$, where $\v{1}{F}$ is the talker and $\vl{F}$ is the listener. 
The hypercycle $H$ is defined by $\text{lcm}_{F \in \TT}(\period{F})$.
To find a feasible TSN configuration, the scheduler has to incorporate $H / \period{F}$ many frames of the stream $F$.
We denote frames of $F$ by $f \in F$, and the $i$th frame in a hypercycle is released at time
\begin{equation*}
  \release{f} = \phase{F} + i \times \period{F}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}[End-to-End QoS] \label{def:reliability}
  Each stream $F \in \TT$ specifies its minimum end-to-end reliability $\rel{F}$ w.r.t. latency $\ete{F}$ and jitter $\jitter{F}$.
The TSN configuration must ensure, with a probability of at least $\rel{F}$, that each frame $f \in F$ arrives at its listener $\vl{F}$ within a predetermined arrival interval $\R{\vl{F}, f}$, as constrained by
\begin{align}
  \Rmax{\vl{F}, f} - \release{f} &\leq \ete{F} \qquad \text{and} \label{eq:latency} \\
  \sub{\Rmax}{\Rmin}{\vl{F}, f} &\leq \jitter{F}. \label{eq:jitter}
\end{align}
\end{definition}

This work aims to compute feasible TSN configurations $\Conf = (\GCL, \R{})$ that satisfy Definition~\ref{def:reliability}.
$\Conf$ defines the gating operations $\GCL([u,v])$ of the Time-Aware Shaper at each egress port $[u,v]$ and the allowed arrival interval $\R{\v{k}{F}, f}$ of PSFP for each frame $f \in F$ at each hop $\v{k}{F} \in \path{F}$.

\subsection{Modelling TSN Runtime Behavior} \label{sec:execution_sequences}
To analyze the QoS guarantees of a TSN configuration $\Conf$, we introduce a model that captures possible runtime behavior under $\Conf$.
To this end, we define execution sequences $\E = (\T{}, \D{})$ to capture the possible transmission offsets $\T{}$ and transmission delays $\D{}$ for each frame $f \in \TT$ and each hop $[u,v] \in \path{f}$.
In detail, $\E$ encodes the following semantic:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\T{[u,v], f}$ denotes the time when the bridge $u$ starts the transmission of $f$ at the egress port $[u,v]$, and
  \item $\D{[u,v], f}$ denotes the delay until $f$ is enqueued at $v$.
\end{itemize}
For Ethernet links, $\D{[u,v], f}$ equals the sum of the serialization delay $\size{f} / \drate{[u,v]}$, the propagation delay $\dprop{[u,v]}$, and the processing delay $\dproc{v}$ of $v$.
For 5G links, $\D{[u,v], f}$ is the outcome of the random variable capturing the 5G port-to-port delay, as described in Section~\ref{sec:5g_tsn}.
In both cases, the arrival time of frame $f$ at bridge $v$ equals
\begin{equation*}
  \add{\T}{\D}{[u,v], f} = \T{[u,v], f} + \D{[u,v], f}.
\end{equation*}
Moreover, $\E$ is constrained to satisfy the following:

\textbf{FIFO Queueing:}
The transmission of a frame $f$ via $[u,v]$ can only start after $f$ arrived at $u$. 
If another frame $f'$ is enqueued in the same FIFO queue at $[u,v]$ before $f$, then $u$ can only start the transmission of $f$ once that of $f'$ is completed.

\textbf{Multiplexing:}
Only a single frame can be transmitted over an Ethernet link at once.
In contrast, frequency-division multiplexing allows multiple frames to be sent over 5G links in parallel.
As noted in Section~\ref{sec:5g_tsn}, we assume that the induced traffic load is captured by the 5G packet delay histograms.

\textbf{GCL Consistency:}
A frame can be transmitted via $[u,v]$ if the gate configured by $\GCL([u,v])$ is open.
At the same time, the first frame of the egress queue must immediately start its transmission once the gate opens.

\textbf{Stream Policing:}
A frame $f$ is discarded by PSFP at bridge $u$ if and only if $f$ arrives at $u$ outside the interval $\R{u, f}$.
