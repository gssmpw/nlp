\begin{abstract}
  Industrial cyber-physical systems require dependable network communication with formal end-to-end reliability guarantees.
  Striving towards this goal, recent efforts aim to advance the integration of 5G into Time-Sensitive Networking~(TSN).
  However, we show that IEEE~802.1Qbv TSN schedulers that are unattuned to 5G packet delay variations may jeopardize any reliability guarantees provided by the 5G system.
  We demonstrate this on a case where a $\qty{99.99}{\percent}$ reliability in the inner 5G network diminishes to below $\qty{10}{\percent}$ when looking at end-to-end communication in TSN.
  In this paper, we overcome this shortcoming by introducing Full Interleaving Packet Scheduling~(FIPS) as a wireless-friendly IEEE~802.1Qbv scheduler.
  To the best of our knowledge, FIPS is the first to provide formal end-to-end QoS guarantees in wireless TSN.
  FIPS allows a controlled batching of TSN streams, which improves schedulability in terms of the number of wireless TSN streams by a factor of up to~$\times 45$.
  Even in failure cases, FIPS isolates the otherwise cascading QoS violations to the affected streams and protects all other streams.  
  With formal end-to-end reliability, improved schedulability, and fault isolation, FIPS makes a substantial advance towards dependability in wireless TSN.
