\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We presented FIPS, a wireless-friendly IEEE 802.1Qbv scheduler that provides formal end-to-end QoS guarantees for each stream.
With the high susceptibility of IEEE 802.1Qbv schedulers to runtime uncertainty, FIPS overcomes the major challenges of \textit{staying robust} against 5G packet delay variations and \textit{remaining scalable} even in 5G bottleneck scenarios.

In future work, we plan to extend the coordination between FIPS and the 5G system, allowing for more fine-grained 5G QoS provisioning that is captured by the 5G PDB contracts.
