abstract = { The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o into robotic systems represents a significant advancement in embodied artificial intelligence. These models can process multi-modal prompts, enabling them to generate more context-aware responses. However, this integration is not without challenges. One of the primary concerns is the potential security risks associated with using LLMs in robotic navigation tasks. These tasks require precise and reliable responses to ensure safe and effective operation. Multi-modal prompts, while enhancing the robot’s understanding, also introduce complexities that can be exploited maliciously. For instance, adversarial inputs designed to mislead the model can lead to incorrect or dangerous navigational decisions. This study investigates the impact of prompt injections on mobile robot performance in LLM-integrated systems and explores secure prompt strategies to mitigate these risks. Our findings demonstrate a substantial overall improvement of approximately 30.8% in both attack detection and system performance with the implementation of robust defence mechanisms, highlighting their critical role in enhancing security and reliability in mission-oriented tasks. },

abstract = {We explore how generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain-of-thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting.Experiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a PaLM 540B with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},
