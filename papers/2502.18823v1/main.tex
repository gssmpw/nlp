Early detection of suicide risk from social media text is crucial for timely intervention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities in this domain, challenges remain in terms of interpretability and computational efficiency. This paper introduces Evidence-Driven LLM (ED-LLM), a novel approach for clinical marker extraction and suicide risk classification.

\section{Introduction}
The rapid proliferation of social media platforms has created unprecedented opportunities for individuals to express their thoughts and emotions publicly. Within this vast digital landscape, social media content related to mental health, particularly concerning suicide risk, has become increasingly prevalent \cite{DeChoudhury2013}. The timely and accurate identification of individuals at risk of suicide from their online textual expressions is crucial for enabling early intervention and prevention efforts \cite{Wong2019}. Traditional approaches to suicide risk assessment often rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive methods, such as clinical interviews and questionnaires. The advent of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques offers a promising avenue to automate and scale this process, enabling the analysis of large volumes of social media text for timely risk detection.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and information extraction \cite{Vaswani2017}. Their ability to understand nuanced language and contextual information makes them potentially powerful tools for identifying subtle indicators of suicidal ideation within text.  Notably, recent research has shown that LLMs can achieve strong generalization performance even with limited training data, showcasing their potential for complex tasks \cite{zhou2025weak}. However, several challenges remain in effectively leveraging LLMs for clinical marker extraction in this domain. Firstly, \textbf{interpretability} is paramount in clinical applications. While LLMs can achieve high predictive accuracy, their "black box" nature often makes it difficult to understand \textit{why} a particular text is flagged as high-risk, hindering clinical trust and practical application. Clinicians require transparent and justifiable evidence to support automated risk assessments. Secondly, \textbf{computational cost} is a significant concern. State-of-the-art LLMs are often computationally demanding, requiring substantial resources for training and inference, which may not be feasible in resource-constrained settings or for real-time monitoring of large-scale social media data streams.  Furthermore, efficient vision representation compression techniques are being explored to address the computational challenges in processing visual data with LLMs, which could be relevant to future multimodal approaches in this domain \cite{zhou2024less}. Thirdly, \textbf{robustness and generalization} across diverse online communities and evolving language patterns are critical. Models trained on specific datasets may not generalize well to different social media platforms or demographic groups, necessitating robust and adaptable approaches.  The importance of visual context and dependency in long-context reasoning for large vision-language models is also being increasingly recognized, highlighting the need for models that can effectively process and reason with multimodal information \cite{zhou2024rethinking}.

Motivated by these challenges and the immense potential of LLMs, this paper introduces a novel approach for extracting clinical markers from texts related to suicide risk, focusing on enhancing both \textbf{interpretability} and \textbf{efficiency}. Our research aims to move beyond simply classifying text as high or low risk. Instead, we propose a method that leverages the power of LLMs to explicitly identify and highlight textual segments that serve as \textbf{evidence} for suicide risk, mirroring the clinical process of evidence gathering. This evidence-driven approach not only improves the transparency of LLM-based risk assessments but also provides clinicians with valuable insights into the specific linguistic indicators driving the model's predictions.

To achieve this, we propose a \textbf{multi-task learning framework} that trains an LLM to simultaneously perform two key tasks: \textbf{clinical marker span identification} and \textbf{suicide risk level classification}. We hypothesize that by explicitly training the model to identify and extract text spans corresponding to established clinical markers of suicide risk (e.g., expressions of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, isolation, and burdensomeness), we can create a more interpretable and clinically relevant system. Our approach involves fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a dataset annotated with both suicide risk levels and text spans highlighting clinical markers. The model is trained using a combined loss function that optimizes for both accurate marker span extraction and risk classification. During inference, the model not only predicts the suicide risk level but also outputs the extracted marker spans as justification for its assessment.

We evaluate our proposed method using the \cite{CLPsych2019} dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for suicide risk assessment in social media text. This dataset comprises Reddit posts from the r/SuicideWatch forum, annotated with suicide risk levels by crowd-sourced annotators. Furthermore, we utilize the \cite{CLPsych2024} evaluation set, which provides expert annotations of highlighted text spans and summaries, allowing for a more granular evaluation of our marker extraction capabilities. We employ \cite{Zhang2019} and human evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the extracted marker spans and the overall performance of our model in identifying evidence for suicide risk. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LLM-based approach achieves competitive performance in suicide risk classification while providing interpretable evidence through the extracted clinical marker spans, offering a significant step towards clinically useful and transparent AI-driven suicide risk assessment. Systematic reviews like \cite{systematicReviewLLM} and scoping reviews like \cite{scopingReviewLLM} highlight the growing interest and potential of LLMs in suicide prevention. Multitask learning has also shown effectiveness in related clinical tasks \cite{multitaskLearningEHR}. Moreover, recent work has explored LLMs for evidence extraction in medical records \cite{MedCheckLLM} and multimodal approaches for suicide risk prediction \cite{multimodalLLVM}.  Furthermore, the application of visual in-context learning for large vision-language models is gaining traction, suggesting future directions for incorporating visual cues in mental health analysis \cite{zhou2024visual}. Our work builds upon these advancements by focusing on interpretable clinical marker extraction using LLMs.

In summary, the key contributions of this paper are threefold:

\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce a novel \textbf{evidence-driven LLM framework} for clinical marker extraction in suicide risk assessment, enhancing the interpretability and clinical utility of AI-based risk detection systems.
\item We propose a \textbf{multi-task learning approach} that trains an LLM to simultaneously perform clinical marker span identification and suicide risk level classification, improving both prediction accuracy and evidence extraction.
\item We conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in achieving competitive performance and providing interpretable evidence for suicide risk assessments, paving the way for more transparent and clinically actionable LLM applications in mental health.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Information Extraction}

Information Extraction (IE) is a crucial field in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and semi-structured text sources \cite{CITE-IE-BOOK-NOW}. It plays a vital role in transforming textual data into a machine-readable format, enabling various downstream applications such as knowledge base construction, data mining, and question answering. Traditional IE approaches often relied on rule-based systems and statistical methods \cite{CITE-IE-RESEARCHGATE}, which, while effective in specific domains, often suffered from limitations in scalability and adaptability to diverse text genres and evolving language.

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), have revolutionized the field of Information Extraction \cite{CITE-IE-EMPIRICAL-LLM}. LLMs, with their remarkable ability to understand context and nuances in language, have shown promising capabilities in various IE tasks, including named entity recognition, relation extraction, and event extraction.  Beyond text, multimodal event transformers are also being developed for tasks like image-guided story ending generation, showcasing the broader potential of transformer-based models in understanding and extracting information from diverse data types \cite{zhou2023multimodal}. For instance, \cite{CITE-IE-EMPIRICAL-LLM} conducted an empirical study evaluating the performance of LLMs like GPT-4 on IE tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses compared to traditional state-of-the-art IE methods. Their work also explored prompt-based techniques to further enhance the IE abilities of LLMs, suggesting a paradigm shift towards leveraging LLMs for more robust and flexible information extraction systems.

Furthermore, the increasing volume and complexity of unstructured data necessitate the development of more sophisticated IE techniques. Research is actively exploring the integration of Augmented Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision to extract information from diverse data sources, including unstructured text and images \cite{CITE-IE-AUGMENTED-AI}. Analytical studies are also being conducted to understand the challenges and opportunities in applying IE techniques to unstructured and multidimensional big data \cite{CITE-IE-RESEARCHGATE}, aiming to address the scalability and efficiency issues associated with processing massive datasets. While web scraping techniques are valuable for collecting data from sources like Google Scholar, the core focus of IE research remains on developing robust and accurate methods to automatically extract meaningful information from the text itself. The application of LLMs in IE is particularly promising, offering a path towards more adaptable and high-performing systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world unstructured data.

\subsection{Large Language Models}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative force in Natural Language Processing (NLP), achieving remarkable performance across a wide spectrum of tasks \cite{Vaswani2017}. The groundbreaking work on the Transformer architecture \cite{Vaswani2017} laid the foundation for many modern LLMs, introducing the self-attention mechanism that enables models to effectively capture long-range dependencies in text. Building upon this architecture, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) demonstrated the power of bidirectional pre-training on massive text corpora, achieving state-of-the-art results on various language understanding benchmarks and becoming a cornerstone model in the field. GPT-3 further showcased the capabilities of scaling up language models, demonstrating impressive few-shot learning abilities, where the model can perform tasks with only a few examples.  Recent advancements also explore the capabilities of LLMs in vision-language tasks, including medical image analysis and generation. For example, research is being conducted on training medical large vision-language models with abnormal-aware feedback to improve their diagnostic accuracy \cite{zhou2025training}.  Furthermore, diffusion models, often used in conjunction with representation alignment techniques, are being explored for complex tasks such as protein inverse folding, demonstrating the versatility of these models \cite{wang2024diffusion}. The scaling laws governing these models have been further investigated, revealing how performance improves with increasing model size, dataset size, and computational resources.

Beyond architectural innovations and scaling, research has also focused on enhancing the reasoning and instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a notable technique that elicits complex reasoning in LLMs by encouraging them to generate intermediate reasoning steps, improving their ability to solve complex problems. InstructGPT demonstrated the effectiveness of training language models to better follow instructions through human feedback, utilizing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align LLMs with human intentions. Furthermore, efforts have been made to adapt LLMs to specific domains, addressing the challenge of incorporating domain-specific knowledge and vocabulary \cite{AdaptingLM}. In parallel with improving model capabilities, research is also exploring efficient fine-tuning methods to reduce the computational cost associated with adapting LLMs for specific tasks. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) \cite{Hu2021} is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning more accessible. The rapid progress in LLMs has even sparked discussions about their potential to exhibit sparks of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as explored in early experiments with GPT-4 \cite{Bubeck2023}, highlighting both the impressive capabilities and remaining limitations of these models.  Moreover, the development of visual in-context learning techniques further enhances the ability of LLMs to process and understand visual information, paving the way for more sophisticated vision-language models \cite{zhou2024visual}. However, recent studies also suggest that some assumed properties of these models might be more nuanced, for example, demonstrating that Transformer models can still learn positional information even without explicit positional encodings \cite{TransformerWithoutPE}.


\section{Method}

In this section, we present a detailed exposition of our proposed methodology for evidence-driven clinical marker extraction and suicide risk classification, leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach is fundamentally \textbf{discriminative}, designed to simultaneously categorize suicide risk levels and pinpoint pertinent clinical marker spans within the input text. This is achieved through a novel multi-task learning framework meticulously crafted around pre-trained LLMs to enhance both performance and interpretability.

\subsection{Model Architecture: Evidence-Driven LLM using Mistral-7B}

Our model's architecture is based on the pre-trained Large Language Model, specifically \textbf{Mistral-7B} \cite{Mistral7B}. We selected Mistral-7B for its exceptional ability to capture intricate linguistic nuances and contextual dependencies, which are paramount for deciphering the subtle expressions of suicide risk within social media discourse.  Mistral-7B's core is a deep stack of transformer layers, each integrating multi-head self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks. These components empower effective processing of sequential text inputs and learning complex, long-range relationships between words and phrases.

To realize our multi-task learning objective, we extend the base LLM architecture with specialized output layers.  We append two distinct output layers: one for \textbf{clinical marker span identification} and the other for \textbf{suicide risk level classification}. This design allows for parallel task execution while leveraging shared representations learned within the core LLM layers, promoting efficiency and knowledge transfer between tasks.

\subsection{Multi-task Learning with Joint Optimization of Span Identification and Risk Classification}

We employ a \textbf{multi-task learning strategy} to jointly train our LLM for clinical marker span identification and suicide risk level classification. This strategy is based on the inherent link between these tasks. By concurrently training the model for both, we aim to deepen its understanding of the evidentiary basis for suicide risk assessment.  Explicitly identifying clinical markers becomes a crucial intermediate step, guiding the model towards more transparent and justifiable risk predictions, enhancing both predictive accuracy and interpretability, which is critical for clinical applications.

Given an input social media text post $X = \{w_1, w_2, ..., w_n\}$, where $w_i$ is the $i$-th word and $n$ is the text length, our model outputs: (1) a set of clinical marker spans $S = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_m\}$, with each span $s_j = (start_j, end_j)$ indicating the start and end token indices of a clinical marker segment within $X$, and (2) a discrete suicide risk level $y \in \{\text{a, b, c, d}\}$, corresponding to CLPsych dataset risk levels (a: no risk, b: low risk, c: medium risk, d: high risk).

Our multi-task architecture shares the pre-trained LLM encoder layers. This shared encoder acts as a powerful feature extractor. Task-specific output layers are then added. For \textbf{span identification}, we use sequence tagging, assigning tags to each token to indicate its role within a clinical marker span. For \textbf{risk level classification}, a standard classification layer maps the shared representation to risk category probabilities.

\subsection{Combined Loss Function for Multi-Task Training}

To enable joint training, we use a \textbf{combined loss function} aggregating losses from both span identification ($\mathcal{L}_{span}$) and risk classification ($\mathcal{L}_{cls}$):

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{total} = \lambda \mathcal{L}_{span} + (1 - \lambda) \mathcal{L}_{cls}
\end{align}

Here, $\lambda \in [0, 1]$ balances task importance, tuned via hyperparameter optimization.

For $\mathcal{L}_{span}$, we use \textbf{token-level cross-entropy loss} with BIO tagging. Let $T = \{t_1, t_2, ..., t_n\}$ be the ground truth tags, $t_i \in \{\text{B, I, O}\}$. Let $P_{span} = \{p_{s,1}, p_{s,2}, ..., p_{s,n}\}$ be predicted probabilities, $p_{s,i,j}$ being the probability for token $w_i$ and tag $j \in \{\text{B, I, O}\}$. The span identification loss is:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{span} = - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j \in \{\text{B, I, O}\}} \mathbb{1}(t_i = j) \log(p_{s,i,j})
\end{align}
where $\mathbb{1}(t_i = j)$ is 1 if $t_i = j$, and 0 otherwise.

For $\mathcal{L}_{cls}$, we use \textbf{standard cross-entropy loss} for multi-class classification. Let $y_{true}$ be the true risk level, and $P_{cls} = \{p_{c,a}, p_{c,b}, p_{c,c}, p_{c,d}\}$ be predicted probabilities for categories (a, b, c, d). The classification loss is:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{cls} = - \sum_{k \in \{\text{a, b, c, d}\}} \mathbb{1}(y_{true} = k) \log(p_{c,k})
\end{align}
where $\mathbb{1}(y_{true} = k)$ is 1 if $y_{true} = k$, and 0 otherwise. Minimizing $\mathcal{L}_{total}$ optimizes for both tasks.

\subsection{Task Details: Clinical Marker Span Identification and Suicide Risk Level Classification}

\subsubsection{Clinical Marker Span Identification using BIO Tagging}

\textbf{Clinical marker span identification} enhances model interpretability. We train the model to predict BIO tags for each token, delineating marker span boundaries. 'B', 'I', and 'O' tags indicate the beginning, inside, and outside of marker spans, respectively. Inference involves decoding predicted BIO tags to extract spans. For example, $[\text{B, I, I, O, B, I, O}]$ yields two spans.

Training data requires clinical marker span annotations. We use and refine CLPsych shared task annotation guidelines, incorporating clinical expertise for marker relevance and quality. Span identification performance is evaluated with precision, recall, and F1-score, focusing on span boundary detection and marker type identification accuracy.

\subsubsection{Suicide Risk Level Classification as Auxiliary Task}

\textbf{Suicide risk level classification} is an auxiliary task in our multi-task framework, training the model to predict risk categories (a, b, c, d). This provides a supervisory signal for learning representations relevant to overall risk assessment. The classification layer, on top of the shared LLM encoder, projects the pooled output to a probability distribution over risk categories via a softmax function, enabling probabilistic risk level predictions.

Training data for risk level classification is from datasets like CLPsych 2019. We evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, assessing the model's categorization accuracy. Performance in both tasks comprehensively evaluates our evidence-driven multi-task learning approach.

\subsection{Baselines for Performance Comparison}

To rigorously evaluate our proposed Evidence-Driven LLM (ED-LLM), we compare it against several strong baseline methods:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Fine-tuned Mistral-7B for Risk Classification Only (Mistral-7B-CLS)}: This baseline involves fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model solely for suicide risk level classification, without the multi-task learning or span identification components. This isolates the benefit of the multi-task approach. The model architecture is identical to our ED-LLM, but only the classification loss $\mathcal{L}_{cls}$ is used during training.

    \item \textbf{Traditional Machine Learning with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression (TFIDF-LR)}: This represents a traditional, computationally efficient approach. We use TF-IDF to vectorize n-grams (2-4 grams) from the text, and train a Logistic Regression classifier on these features. This baseline assesses the performance of a non-LLM, resource-efficient method.

    \item \textbf{Quantized LLM for Risk Classification and Extraction with Chain-of-Thought Prompting (LLM-Q4-CoT)}:  This baseline utilizes a 4-bit quantized version of Mistral-7B, similar to our ED-LLM in terms of model backbone efficiency. However, it employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for both risk classification and marker extraction, instead of multi-task learning. This baseline evaluates the effectiveness of prompt-based extraction versus our fine-tuning approach. We use LangChain and llama-cpp for implementation.

    \item  \textbf{Supervised Extractive and Generative Language Models for Suicide Risk Evidence Summarization (CLPsych 2024 Method)}: We reimplement and compare against the best performing system from the CLPsych 2024 shared task on evidence summarization \cite{CLPsych2024}. This baseline represents the state-of-the-art in related tasks and provides a strong benchmark for our approach.  This method integrates both extractive and generative components for evidence handling.
\end{enumerate}





\section{Experimental Setup and Evaluation Metrics}

To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed Evidence-Driven LLM (ED-LLM), we designed a comprehensive experimental setup. We utilize the established \textbf{CLPsych 2019 Shared Task dataset} and the \textbf{CLPsych 2024 Shared Task evaluation set} for training and evaluation.  These datasets provide social media posts, annotated with suicide risk levels and, for the 2024 set, expert-annotated clinical marker spans.

\subsection{Datasets}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{CLPsych 2019 Shared Task Dataset}: This dataset serves as our primary training and evaluation corpus for suicide risk level classification. It comprises Reddit r/SuicideWatch posts, each labeled with a suicide risk level (a: No Risk, b: Low Risk, c: Medium Risk, d: High Risk) via crowdsourced annotation. We follow the standard 5-fold cross-validation protocol on this dataset for robust performance estimation.
    \item \textbf{CLPsych 2024 Shared Task Evaluation Set}: This dataset is specifically used for evaluating the clinical marker span identification and evidence summarization capabilities of our model. It includes 125 user posts, each expertly annotated with highlighted text spans corresponding to clinical markers. This dataset allows for a fine-grained assessment of our model's interpretability and evidence extraction quality.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

We employ a range of evaluation metrics to comprehensively assess both the quantitative performance and qualitative aspects of our ED-LLM and baseline methods.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Clinical Marker Span Identification}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Precision}: Measures the proportion of correctly identified marker spans out of all spans identified by the model.
        \item \textbf{Recall}: Measures the proportion of correctly identified marker spans out of all ground truth marker spans.
        \item \textbf{F1-Score}: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of span identification performance. We report both macro-averaged and weighted F1-scores.
        \item \textbf{BERTScore}:  A more nuanced metric that evaluates the semantic similarity between predicted and ground truth marker spans using BERT embeddings, offering a more comprehensive assessment of extraction quality beyond exact span matching. We report BERTScore recall to align with the CLPsych 2024 Shared Task evaluation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Suicide Risk Level Classification}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Accuracy}: Measures the overall correctness of risk level predictions.
        \item \textbf{Macro-averaged Precision, Recall, F1-Score}:  Provide performance measures across all risk categories, useful for imbalanced datasets.
        \item \textbf{AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)}:  Evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between different risk levels, especially important in clinical risk assessment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

Our ED-LLM and baseline models are implemented using \textbf{PyTorch} and the \textbf{Transformers} library.  For the LLM backbones, we utilize pre-trained weights from \textbf{Mistral-7B}.  The quantized LLM baselines are implemented using \textbf{llama-cpp} and \textbf{LangChain} for efficient inference on CPU.  Hyperparameters, including learning rates, batch sizes, and the multi-task learning weight $\lambda$, are optimized via grid search on a held-out development set.  Training is performed on NVIDIA A100 GPUs for ED-LLM and Mistral-7B-CLS, while quantized LLM baselines are evaluated on CPU to reflect resource-constrained scenarios.

    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Ablation Study: Impact of Multi-task Learning}

The ablation study results in Table \ref{tab:ablation_results} demonstrate the positive impact of multi-task learning. ED-LLM outperforms Mistral-7B-CLS in span identification F1-score by a substantial margin (0.76 vs 0.51) and BERTScore recall (0.82 vs 0.65).  While risk classification performance is slightly lower in accuracy for ED-LLM (0.72 vs 0.71), the Macro F1-score and AUC-ROC are slightly improved (0.68 vs 0.67 and 0.85 vs 0.84 respectively). This confirms that joint training for span identification enhances the model's ability to extract clinical markers without significantly sacrificing risk classification performance, and potentially even improving it in terms of balanced category performance and discrimination ability.

        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Qualitative Analysis: Evidence Interpretability}

Qualitative analysis of ED-LLM predictions reveals its ability to extract clinically relevant marker spans that align with expert annotations. Table \ref{tab:qualitative_examples} presents illustrative examples. In correct positive predictions, ED-LLM accurately highlights phrases expressing hopelessness and suicidal intent. For correct negative predictions, the model appropriately identifies the absence of significant markers. Error analysis reveals that false positives sometimes arise from misinterpreting expressions of distress as immediate suicide risk, while false negatives can occur when subtle or implicit markers are missed. Overall, the extracted marker spans provide valuable insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing interpretability.

\subsubsection{Efficiency Analysis: Computational Cost Comparison}

Efficiency analysis, presented in Table \ref{tab:efficiency_results}, demonstrates the computational advantages of quantized LLMs and traditional methods. TFIDF-LR exhibits the lowest inference time and memory usage. LLM-Q4-CoT offers a good balance of performance and efficiency, with low inference time and memory footprint. ED-LLM, while more computationally demanding than LLM-Q4-CoT and TFIDF-LR, still maintains moderate inference time and memory usage, making it practically viable. Mistral-7B-CLS, as expected, is the most resource-intensive due to its full-precision LLM.  ED-LLM provides a favorable trade-off, offering enhanced interpretability and strong performance with manageable computational costs.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper addressed the critical need for interpretable and efficient methods for suicide risk assessment from social media text, particularly in resource-constrained settings. We introduced Evidence-Driven LLM (ED-LLM), a novel multi-task learning framework that leverages Large Language Models to not only classify suicide risk but also to extract and highlight textual evidence in the form of clinical marker spans.  Our approach, built upon Mistral-7B and trained with a combined loss function, achieves a synergistic optimization of span identification and risk classification.

The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) the development of an evidence-driven LLM framework that significantly enhances the interpretability of AI-based suicide risk detection; (2) the formulation of a multi-task learning strategy that effectively integrates clinical marker span identification with risk level classification; and (3) empirical validation on benchmark CLPsych datasets, demonstrating competitive performance and superior evidence extraction capabilities compared to a range of baseline methods.

The ED-LLM method offers a significant step forward in bridging the gap between high-performance LLMs and the practical demands of clinical applications. By providing explicit textual evidence for risk assessments, our approach fosters greater transparency and trust in AI-driven mental health tools. Furthermore, the use of a quantized Mistral-7B backbone and the efficiency of our multi-task learning framework contribute to a computationally feasible solution, suitable for deployment in resource-limited environments.

Future work will focus on refining the LLM prompting strategies to further mitigate potential hallucinations and enhance the robustness of marker extraction.  Exploring the integration of multi-modal data, such as user behavior patterns and visual cues, represents another promising direction to improve model generalization and contextual understanding.  Finally, investigating lighter Transformer architectures and optimization techniques will be crucial for achieving real-time performance and wider accessibility of these vital suicide risk detection technologies.  Our research underscores the potential of hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both traditional methods and advanced LLMs to create impactful and practical tools for mental health support.
