Motion planning for multiple MMRs for objection transportation is a significant challenge, especially for MMRs with a non-holonomic base, due to the kinodynamic constraints that must be included in the planning and the rigid connection between the object and the manipulators. The proposed nonlinear MPC-based motion planning technique derives kinodynamically feasible collision-free trajectories in dynamic environments for non-holonomic MMRs. The proposed method optimizes control inputs for the base and the manipulators of the MMRs. Our simulations and hardware experiments indicate that the trajectory at the intersection of the obstacle-free polytope is non-smooth. In the future, we will address this shortcoming.
