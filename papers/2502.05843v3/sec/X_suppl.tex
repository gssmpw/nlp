\section{Ablation Study}
\noindent
\textbf{Analysis of Component Contributions.} To understand the contribution of each component in our framework, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies examining the individual and combined effects of LLM reasoning and symbolic regression. Starting with a baseline using only manual logic expressions (67.00\% average performance), the addition of symbolic regression significantly improves performance to 85.36\%. This substantial improvement (+18.36\%) suggests that automated pattern discovery through symbolic regression is significantly more effective than human-designed rules, likely due to its ability to explore a broader space of logical combinations and capture subtle patterns that might not be immediately apparent to human experts. \par

% \noindent \textbf{Impact of LLM Integration.} Figure \ref{fig:wo_llm} shows further integration of LLM reasoning not only enhances detection accuracy but accelerates the convergence of symbolic regression, showing a synergistic effect between semantic understanding and pattern discovery. A detailed analysis of the convergence process reveals that LLM guidance helps avoid many unnecessary exploration paths in the symbolic search space, effectively pruning unpromising directions based on semantic understanding. Moreover, we observe the quality of discovered patterns improves with LLM guidance, as the patterns tend to be more semantically meaningful and better aligned with human intuition about anomalies.

\noindent
\textbf{Impact of LLM Integration.} Figure \ref{fig:wo_llm} illustrates the substantial impact of different LLM integration on both the effectiveness and efficiency of our symbolic pattern discovery process. When examining convergence trajectories across generations, we observe that LLM guidance not only enhances the ultimate detection accuracy but also significantly accelerates the convergence speed of symbolic regression. The analysis compares performance curves with and without LLM guidance, as well as across different LLM scales.
\textit{Finding: Effective event detection through symbolic reasoning benefits from the complementary strengths of systematic pattern discovery (through evolutionary search) and semantic guidance (through LLM reasoning). The symbolic component provides the expressive framework for capturing complex relationships, while the LLM component contributes domain knowledge and conceptual understanding that steers the search toward meaningful patterns.} \par

\noindent
\textbf{Effect of Search Scale on Performance.} To further explore the robustness of our framework, we investigate the effect of varying search scales on event detection accuracy, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:search_scale}. The search scale defines the proportion of samples allocated for constructing the logical search space, with the remainder used for pattern evaluation.
Our results reveal a clear pattern: increasing the search scale consistently enhances AUROC performance across both the Helmet and Fishing datasets using APE and GLIP strategies. Notably, in the Helmet dataset, both strategies show a significant improvement, reaching peak performance at the highest search scale of 8.16\%. The Fishing dataset demonstrates a similar upward trend, highlighting the benefits of expanding the search space.
\textit{Finding:} The increase in performance with larger search scales underscores the efficacy of our approach in utilizing more extensive logical reasoning. The findings suggest that even without traditional fine-tuning, enlarging the search space enables the framework to uncover more accurate and interpretable patterns. This scalability evidences the flexibility and potency of SymbolicDet in capitalizing on the latent potential of standard object detectors, reinforcing its applicability across diverse scenarios.
