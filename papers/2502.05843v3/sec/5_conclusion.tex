\section{Conclusion}
\label{con}
% 
% In this paper, we present \underline{SymbolicDet}, a novel approach that addresses visual event detection through symbolic logical reasoning. Our framework makes three key contributions to the field: First, we establish a new paradigm by uniquely combining symbolic regression for logical pattern search with Large Language Models (LLMs) for symbolic reasoning. This integration successfully transforms complex anomaly event patterns into human-readable symbolic expressions while achieving performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a training-free framework that eliminates the need for task-specific fine-tuning while maintaining competitive performance. This achievement suggests a promising direction for developing more efficient and adaptable event detection systems. Third, we introduce a new benchmark dataset containing over 5,000 annotated samples for visual event detection, providing a valuable resource for future research in this domain. Looking forward, several promising directions emerge for extending this work, including expanding the symbolic logic search space, automating prompt space construction, and integrating with object detection and active learning frameworks. These developments could further advance the field of visual event detection while maintaining the interpretability and efficiency advantages demonstrated in our work.

In this paper, we introduce \underline{SymbolicDet}, a framework that unlocks event understanding capabilities within standard object detectors through LLM-guided symbolic reasoning. Our approach demonstrates that object detectors contain sufficient visual information for complex event understanding when enhanced with appropriate reasoning mechanisms.
Our key contributions include: First, establishing a paradigm that bridges visual perception and symbolic reasoning through evolutionary pattern discovery and LLM guidance, achieving competitive performance with interpretable reasoning. Second, demonstrating an effective training-free framework that eliminates task-specific fine-tuning. Third, contributing two new benchmark datasets for visual event detection research.
Our results show that combining pre-trained detectors with explicit symbolic reasoning offers a powerful alternative to specialized, training-intensive approaches while enhancing interpretability and adaptability through human-readable symbolic expressions.
Looking forward, while demonstrated in event detection, our approach of enhancing pre-trained visual models with explicit reasoning has broader potential. Future work could extend this framework to relationship detection, behavioral analysis, and intention recognition --- further bridging the gap between perception and reasoning in visual understanding systems.
