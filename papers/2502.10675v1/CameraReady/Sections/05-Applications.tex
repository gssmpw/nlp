\section{Applications}

\noindent\textbf{Open-vocabulary scene synthesis.} To demonstrate the generalization of our approach, we show the open-vocabulary scene synthesis results in Figure~\ref{scene_diversity}. By removing object category constraints in the LLM prompt, we generate scenes of a dining room, museum, and arcade room, not trained on by our model, to validate its practical usage. The results show that the LLM generates reasonable hierarchical structures for arbitrary requirements, while our generalizable hierarchy-aware network and divide-and-conquer optimization produce realistic scenes with various descriptions.

\noindent\textbf{Interactive scene editing.} Our approach also supports user-friendly language-guided interactive scene editing. Specifically, we describe the current state of the scene and an editing instruction as the input to LLM, and add an additional constraint to the divide-and-conquer optimization to maintain the placements of unchanged objects as much as possible. As shown in Figure~\ref{scene_editing}, the LLM can modify the scene by adding and removing objects. Moreover, with the hierarchical scene structure and our approach, the edited scenes exhibit minimal changes from the original scenes while satisfying the LLM arrangments and the expectations of users.
