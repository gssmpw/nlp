\section{Conclusions}

We present an LLM-assisted hierarchical indoor scene synthesis approach to produce customized and diverse scenes. Our approach fully takes advantage of the three-level hierarchical structure, where the LLM generates the descriptions of hierarchical scenes, a hierarchy-aware network infers the fine-grained relative placements, and a divide-and-conquer optimization solves the feasible layout.

Our approach still holds some limitations. First, for the simplicity of optimization, we assume rectangular floors for the generated scene. It is possible to utilize the spatial-aware optimization with simulated annealing algorithms~\cite{Yu2011MakeIH} for irregular floors. Second, LLM sometimes generates infeasible configurations with too many or large objects and we randomly remove some areas or objects to address this, affecting scene quality. Third, since our hierarchical scene representation takes each object as its oriented bounding boxes without geometric details, our generated scenes are not sensitive to object shapes, such as L-shaped sofa.
