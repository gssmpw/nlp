\caption{Compared to LLM-generated (a) numerical layouts and (b) scene graphs with dense relations, we use (c) LLM-generated hierarchical scene descriptions, whose internal nodes represent functional areas with compact and generalizable prior, to generate more reasonable and physically feasible scene layouts aligned with the descriptions.}
