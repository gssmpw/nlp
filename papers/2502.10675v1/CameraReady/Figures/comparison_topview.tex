\caption{The scenes generated from different approaches. The end-to-end data-driven approaches often produce infeasible object placements including overlap and out-of-boundary cases (red boxes). On the other hand, HOLODECK sometimes produces unreasonable results such as two nightstands on the same side of the bed (top row) or a tv stand on the left side of the sofa (second row). By contrast, our approach is able to more effectively produce reasonable and physically feasible scene layouts.}
