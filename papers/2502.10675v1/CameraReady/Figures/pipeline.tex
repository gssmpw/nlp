\caption{Our hierarchically-structured scene synthesis pipeline involves three stages. First, given a user requirement, we prompt the LLM to generate a hierarchical structure with text descriptions. Second, we train a hierarchy-aware network to infer the fine-grained relative placements between objects. Third, we use a divide-and-conquer optimization algorithm to arrange each functional area separately and then organize them into the entire scene. $z_e$ indicates the random sampling from the Gaussian distribution $Z$, and $\hat{r}_e$ indicates the relative position information after decoding.}

% Our hierarchically-structured scene synthesis pipeline \color{red}involves three stages. \color{black} First, given a user requirement, we prompt the LLM to generate a hierarchical structure with text descriptions. Second, we train a hierarchy-aware network to infer the fine-grained relative placements between objects corresponding to the LLM-generated textual spatial relations. Third, we use a divide-and-conquer optimization algorithm to arrange each functional area separately and then organize them into the entire scene.
