\section{Conclusion}

This paper has explored the synergistic integration of FL and FM, which offers a promising framework for advancing AI technologies while adhering to data privacy and security standards. FL provides significant advantages in data privacy, distributed model training, and scalability. Concurrently, FM contributes with its pre-trained capabilities and robust performance across various domains. Our study has particularly concentrated on the efficient fine-tuning of large FMs within a federated framework. We addressed the critical challenges associated with the memory, runtime, and computational demands of deploying large FMs, along with ensuring data privacy, confidentiality, and system security in decentralized environments.
