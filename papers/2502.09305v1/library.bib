abstract = {Detailed propagation tests for land-mobile radio service were carried out at VHF (200 MHz) and UHF bands (453, 922, 1310, 1920 MHz) over various situation of irregular terrain and of environmental clutter. The results analyzed statistically are described for distance and frequency dependences of median field strength, location variabilities and antenna height gain factors for the base and the vehicular station, in urban, suburban and open areas over quasi-smooth terrain. The correction factors corresponding to respective terrain parameters for irregular terrain, such as rolling-hill terrain, isolated mountain area, general sloped terrain, and mixed land-sea path are discussed. As a result, a method is presented for predicting the field strength and service area for a given terrain of the land-mobile radio system, over the frequency range of 150 to 2000 MHz, for distances of 1 to 100 km, and for base station effective antenna heights of 30 to 1000m. The results of comparison of predicted field strength with measured data published in another paper suggests that a reasonable degree of accuracy is obtainable.},

abstract = {Drive testing continues to play a key role in mobile network optimization for operators but its high cost is a big concern. Alternative approaches like virtual drive testing (VDT) target device testing in the lab whereas MDT or crowdsourcing based approaches are limited by the incentives users have to participate and contribute measurements. With the aim of augmenting drive testing and significantly reducing its cost, we propose GenDT, a novel deep generative model that synthesizes high-fidelity time series of key radio network key performance indicators (KPIs). The training of GenDT relies on a relatively small amount of real-world measurement data along with corresponding and easily accessible network and environment context data. Through this, GenDT learns the relationship between context and radio network KPIs as they vary over time, and therefore trained GenDT model can subsequently be relied on to generate time series for different KPIs for new drive test routes (trajectories) without having to collect field measurements. GenDT represents an initial attempt at enabling efficient drive testing via generative modeling. Evaluations with real-world mobile network drive testing measurement datasets from two countries demonstrate that GenDT can synthesize significantly more dependable data than a range of baselines. We further show that GenDT has the potential to significantly reduce the drive testing related measurement effort, and that GenDT-generated data yields similar results to that with real data in the context of two downstream use cases - QoE prediction and handover analysis.},

   abstract = {In this thesis we forecast the future signal strength of base stations in mobile networks. Better forecasts might improve handover of mobile phones between base stations, thus improving overall user experience. Future values are forecast using a series of past sig- nal strength measurements. We use vector autoregression (VAR), a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network. Hyperparameters, including the set of lags, of these models are optimised using Bayesian optimisation (BO) with Gaussian pro- cess (GP) priors. In addition to BO of the VAR model, we optimise the set of lags in it using a standard bottom-up and top-down heuristic. Both approaches result in similar predictive mean squared error (MSE) for the VAR model, but BO requires fewer model estimations. The GRU model provides the best predictive performance out of the three models. How- ever, none of the models (VAR, MLP, or GRU) achieves the accuracy required for practical applicability of the results. Therefore, we suggest adding more information to the model or reformulating the problem. },

abstract = {This study introduces a groundbreaking method for predicting network quality in LTE and 5G environments using only GPS data, focusing on pinpointing specific locations within a designated area to determine network quality as either good or poor. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we have successfully demonstrated that geographical location can be a key indicator of network performance. Our research involved initially classifying network quality using traditional signal strength metrics and then shifting to rely exclusively on GPS coordinates for prediction. Employing a variety of classifiers, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and K-Nearest Neighbors, we uncovered notable correlations between location data and network quality. This methodology provides network operators with a cost-effective and efficient tool for identifying and addressing network quality issues based on geographic insights. Additionally, we explored the potential implications of our study in various use cases, including healthcare, education, and urban industrialization, highlighting its versatility across different sectors. Our findings pave the way for innovative network management strategies, especially critical in the contexts of both LTE and the rapidly evolving landscape of 5G technology.}
