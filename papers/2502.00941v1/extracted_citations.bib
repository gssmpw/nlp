	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has enjoyed signiﬁcant popularity in recent years. Where navigation has been a fundamental appeal of 3D applications for decades, facilitating this in VR has been quite a challenge. Over the past decades, various virtual locomotion techniques (VLTs) have been developed that aim to offer natural, usable and efﬁcient ways of navigating VR without inducing VR sickness. Several studies of these techniques have been conducted in order to evaluate their performance in various study conditions and virtual contexts. Taxonomies have also been proposed to either place similar techniques in meaningful categories or decompose them to their underlying design components. In this survey, we aim to aggregate and understand the current state of the art of VR locomotion research and discuss the design implications of VLTs in terms of strengths, weaknesses and applicability.},

	abstract = {Navigation speed for most navigation interfaces is still determined by rate-control devices (e.g. joystick). The interface designer is in charge of adjusting the range of optimal speeds according to the scale of the environment and the desired user experience. However, this approach is not valid for complex environments (e.g. multi-scale environments). Optimal speeds might vary for each section of the environment, leading to non-desired side effects such as collisions or simulator sickness. Thereby, we propose a speedadaptation algorithm based on the spatial relationship between the user and the environment and the user’s perception of motion. The computed information is used to adjust the navigation speed in order to provide an optimal navigation speed and avoid collisions. Two main beneﬁts of our approach is ﬁrstly, the ability to adapt the navigation speed in multi-scale environments and secondly, the capacity to provide a smooth navigation experience by decreasing the jerkiness of described trajectories. The evaluation showed that our approach provides comparable performance as existing navigation techniques but it signiﬁcantly decreases the jerkiness of described trajectories.},

In particular, in immersive stereoscopic systems, e.g. when performing zoom-in and zoomout operations, the navigation speed and the stereoscopic rendering parameters have to be adjusted accordingly. Although this adjustment can be done manually by the user, it can be complex, tedious and strongly depends on the virtual environment. In this work we propose a new multi-scale navigation technique named GiAnt (GIant/ANT) which automatically and seamlessly adjusts the navigation speed and the scale factor of the virtual environment based on the user’s perceived navigation speed. The adjustment ensures an almost-constant perceived navigation speed while avoiding diplopia effects or diminished depth perception due to improper stereoscopic rendering conﬁgurations. The results from the conducted user evaluation shows that GiAnt is an efﬁcient multi-scale navigation which minimizes the changes of the scale factor of the virtual environment compared to state-of-the-art multi-scale navigation techniques.},

Hence, this work focuses on the understanding and classiﬁcation of information needed for travel, as well as on the design of navigation techniques that provide this information. To this end, we ﬁrst identiﬁed two kinds of information necessary for traveling effectively in this kind of environment: hierarchical information, based on the hierarchical structure formed by the levels of scale; and spatial information, related to orientation, distance between objects in different levels of scale and spatial localization. Based on this, we designed and implemented one technique for each kind of information. The developed techniques were evaluated and compared to a baseline set of travel and wayﬁnding aid techniques for traveling through multiple scales. Results show that the developed techniques perform better and provide a better solution for both travel and wayﬁnding aid.},

Therefore, we propose to automatically adjust travel speed based on viewpoint quality, originally a measure of the informativeness of a viewpoint.

Our approach is motivated by large molecular models, for which the traditional single-scale navigational metaphors are not suitable. Multi-scale phenomena, e. g., in astronomy or geography, are complex to navigate due to their large data spaces and multi-level organization. Models from structural biology are in addition also densely crowded in space and scale. Cutaways are needed to show individual model subparts. The camera has to support exploration on the level of a whole virus, as well as on the level of a small molecule. We address these challenges by employing HyperLabels: active labels that—in addition to their annotational role—also support user interaction. Clicks on HyperLabels select the next structure to be explored. Then, we adjust the visualization to showcase the inner composition of the selected subpart and enable further exploration. Finally, we use a breadcrumbs panel for orientation and as a mechanism to traverse upwards in the model hierarchy. We demonstrate our concept of hierarchical 3D model browsing using two exemplary models from meso-scale biology.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a set of interaction techniques for hands-free multi-scale navigation through virtual environments. We believe that hands-free navigation, unlike the majority of navigation techniques based on hand motions, has the greatest potential for maximizing the interactivity of virtual environments since navigation modes are ofﬂoaded from modal hand gestures to more direct motions of the feet and torso. Not only are the users’ hands freed to perform tasks such as modeling, notetaking and object manipulation, but we also believe that foot and torso movements may inherently be more natural for some navigation tasks. The particular interactions that we developed include a leaning technique for moving small and medium distances, a foot-gesture controlled Step WIM that acts as a ﬂoor map for moving larger distances, and a viewing technique that enables a user to view a full 360 degrees in only a three-walled semi-immersive environment by subtly amplifying the mapping between their torso rotation and the virtual world. We formatively designed and evaluated our techniques in existing projects related to archaeological reconstructions, free-form modeling, and interior design. In each case, our informal observations have indicated that motions such as walking and leaning are both appropriate for navigation and are effective in cognitively simplifying complex virtual environment interactions since functionality is more evenly distributed across the body.},

Such a path is convenient for users and ensures coverage of critical areas throughout the scene. Traditional applications use constant camera speed, allow for fully user-controlled manual speed adjustment, or use automatic speed adjustment based on heuristics from the scene. We introduce two novel methods for constrained path navigation and exploration in virtual environments which rely on the natural orientation of the user’s head during scene exploration. Utilizing head tracking to obtain the user’s area of focus, we perform automatic camera speed adjustment to allow for natural off-axis scene examination. We expand this to include automatic camera navigation along the pre-computed path, abrogating the need for any navigational inputs from the user. Our techniques are applicable for any scene with a pre-computed navigation path, including medical applications such as virtual colonoscopy, coronary ﬂy-through, or virtual angioscopy, and graph navigation. We compare the traditional methods (constant speed and manual speed adjustment) and our two methods (automatic speed adjustment and automatic speed/direction control) to determine the effect of speed adjustment on system usability, mental load, performance, and user accuracy. Through this evaluation we observe the effect of automatic speed adjustment compared to traditional methods. We observed no negative impact from automatic navigation, and the users performed as well as with the manual navigation.},

This work could enable remote collaboration at a larger scale such as building construction. We conducted a user study with three experiments. The first experiment compared two interfaces, static and dynamic IPD, on simulator sickness and body size perception. The second experiment tested the user perception of a virtual object size under three levels of IPD and movement gain manipulation with a fixed eye height in a virtual environment having reduced or rich visual cues. Our last experiment investigated the participant’s body size perception for two levels of manipulation of the IPDs and heights using stereo video footage to simulate a flying telepresence experience. The studies found that manipulating IPDs and eye height influenced the user’s size perception. We present our findings and share the recommendations for designing a multi-scale MR flying telepresence interface.},

We call this interface technique the Worlds in Miniature (WIM) metaphor. In addition to the first-person perspective offered by a virtual reality system, a World in Miniature offers a second dynamic viewport onto the virtual environment. Objects may be directly manipulated either through the immersive viewport or through the three-dimensional viewport offered by the WIM.},

In this regard, a good design of the navigation interfaces is critical to ensure that the users navigate with the best possible eﬃciency and comfort. In this paper, we present improvements made to two well-known interfaces: ﬂy, including support to collision treatment and automatic navigation speed adjustment in relation to scale, and examine, with automatic pivot point. Such techniques are based on the cubemap structure. Usability tests have shown a signiﬁcant improvement in the execution of navigation tasks.},

	abstract = {The requirement to change scale frequently is common t o many 2D and 3D applications. Users must “zoom in” t o examine details and “zoom out” to appreciate the context. This presents a problem in the context of “fly by” interfaces that use a flying metaphor to enable the user to change the point of view and explore a data space. The problem is that radical changes in velocity sensitivity may needed when working at different scales. A method is described that uses continous depth sampling to modulate the flying speed. The distribution of depths in the current frame of animation i s used to set the Device to Control ratio so that it is always comfortable when operating over a range of scales. This i s called Depth Modulated Flying (DMF). A family of related methods are evaluated in a task that requires subjects to search for small targets in a scene. The results show that scaling the velocity control by the near point in the scene and by the average point in the scene are equally effective.},

	abstract = {The World In Miniature (WIM) technique has effectively allowed users to interact and travel efficiently in Virtual Environments. However, WIM fails to work in worlds with tasks at various levels of scale. Such an example is using the WIM to arrange furniture and then leaving the room to travel the city using the WIM for navigation and wayfinding. To address this problem, scaling and scrolling were added to the WIM to create the Scaled Scrolling World In Miniature (SSWIM). The interface and testbed were iteratively created under expert evaluation and multiple formative user evaluations led to the final design. The WIM and SSWIM were then compared inside three differently sized cities by users who located a sphere and traveled into it to read the label at the sphere’s center. Users were administered two standard psychology tests to account for spatial orientation (Cube Comparison Test) and spatial scanning (Maze Tracing Test) factors. The results show that the SSWIM’s added functionality, and hence complexity, caused no significant hit in user performance and additionally that users were able to use SSWIM effectively after a short instructional period. To better understand the effect of experience, a follow-up experiment was performed showing performance plateaued after ten to fifteen minutes of use.},
