year = {2006},
publisher = {MIT Press},
address = {Cambridge, MA, USA},
abstract = {We present a new Bayesian skill rating system which can be viewed as a generalisation of the Elo system used in Chess. The new system tracks the uncertainty about player skills, explicitly models draws, can deal with any number of competing entities and can infer individual skills from team results. Inference is performed by approximate message passing on a factor graph representation of the model. We present experimental evidence on the increased accuracy and convergence speed of the system compared to Elo and report on our experience with the new rating system running in a large-scale commercial online gaming service under the name of TrueSkill.},

abstract="In 1971 the monetary authorities1 in the UK adopted a new approach to monetary management, a change of policy announced and described in several papers on competition and credit control. The subsequent experience of trying to operate this revised system has, however, been troublesome and at times unhappy. The purpose here is to examine certain aspects of recent monetary developments in order to illustrate a number of more general analytical themes which may have relevance among several countries.",
