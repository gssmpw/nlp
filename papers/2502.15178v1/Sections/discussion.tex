\textbf{More and Unseen Tasks}: Although our experiments involve three tasks and five datasets, they are representative as they encompass both semantic and acoustic-related tasks. PaM can be extended to other tasks, such as speech translation, which requires features similar to ASR and thus is not included in our paper. Additionally, PaM is applicable to unseen tasks and datasets. To achieve this, tasks must be categorized based on similar feature requirements, and routing during inference should be based on these categories.

\noindent \textbf{Alignment}: Although our paper primarily emphasizes the role of PaM in feature fusion, it also serves an alignment function by mapping the different fused features into the LLM's embedding space. Since we use different features for different prompts/tasks, the projections needed for feature aligment also vary. This is why each expert not only has fusion parameters but also its own FFN for projection.
