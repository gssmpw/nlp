\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we propose PaM, a MoE-based feature fusion method designed to provide Speech LLM with diverse features from multiple encoders based on users' input prompts. Experimental results indicate that PaM surpasses both single-encoder and multi-encoder baselines across a variety of tasks and datasets. We provide a detailed analysis of the feature importance of different encoders, demonstrating that PaM effectively leverages different encoders and levels of features for distinct tasks. Additionally, we present comprehensive experimental results for the selection and combination of encoders. For future work, we intend to expand the training data and incorporate additional tasks.
