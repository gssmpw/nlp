\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed an image-guided sketch colorization framework inspired by real-world animation creation workflow. We implement a novel split cross-attention layer with spatial masks and corresponding LoRA weights that facilitates separate processing for foreground and background, eliminating the spatial entanglement, and also design a switchable LoRA mechanism that enables users to choose different inference modes for various use cases. %By splitting foreground and background in cross-attention, the proposed framework effectively solves the spatial entanglement and improves the quality of colorized results.

However, the proposed methods strongly depend on the quality of extracted masks, and a corresponding failure case is given in the supplementary materials. Our future work focuses on further improving the similarity with references and extending the framework for video colorization.
