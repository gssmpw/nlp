\subsection{Changes to Training Performance from Running/Computed Mean and Variance in Batch Normalization Layers}
During training, batch normalization layers keep running estimates of its computed mean and variance, which are then used for normalization during evaluation.
We find that when using batch normalization, the ELBo and accuracy on the train set can change between \texttt{train()} and \texttt{eval()} mode (see Fig.~\ref{fig:train_eval_comparison}).
We recommend using the computed mean and variance to evaluate the ELBo on the training set for model selection since this mode is used for normalization during evaluation.
