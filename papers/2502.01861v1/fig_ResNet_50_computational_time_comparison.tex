  \caption{Test-set accuracy on CIFAR-10, Pet-37, and Flower-102 over total runtime for L2-SP with \emph{\baselineLong} and our \emph{data-emphasized ELBo} (DE ELBo) using ResNet-50. We run each method on 3 separate training sets of size $N$ (3 different marker styles).
  \textbf{Takeaway: Our DE ELBo achieves as good or better performance at small dataset sizes and similar performance at large dataset sizes with far less compute time.} To make the blue curves, we did the full grid search once (markers). Then, at each given shorter compute time, we subsampled a fraction of all hyperparameter configurations with that runtime and chose the best via validation NLL. Averaging this over 500 subsamples at each runtime created each blue line.
