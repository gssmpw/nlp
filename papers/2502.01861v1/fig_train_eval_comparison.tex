  \caption{Negative \emph{data-emphasized ELBo} (DE ELBo) and accuracy on train set for two ResNet-50s trained on CIFAR-10 $N=1000$. We use \emph{just one sample} every training step to approximate the expected log likelihood. \textbf{Takeaway: We find that when using batch normalization, the ELBo and accuracy on the train set can change between} \texttt{train()} \textbf{and} \texttt{eval()} \textbf{mode.}}
