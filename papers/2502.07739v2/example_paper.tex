\begin{abstract}
    This paper studies the crucial impact of initialization on the convergence properties of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).  We theoretically demonstrate that random initialization, a widely used schema, will likely lead LoRA to random low-rank results, rather than the best low-rank result. While this issue can be mitigated by adjusting initialization towards a well-informed direction, it relies on prior knowledge of the target, which is typically unknown in real-world scenarios. To approximate this well-informed initial direction, we propose High-Rank Preheating (HRP), which fine-tunes high-rank LoRA for a few steps and uses the singular value decomposition of the preheated result as a superior initialization. HRP initialization is theory-supported to combine the convergence strengths of high-rank LoRA and the generalization strengths of low-rank LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HRP significantly enhances LoRA's effectiveness across various models and tasks, achieving performance comparable to full-parameter fine-tuning and outperforming other initialization strategies.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
