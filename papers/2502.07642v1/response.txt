QA systems are divided into extractive and abstractive types**Voskarides et al., "Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Transfer: Multitask Training for Robust Low-Resource NLP"**.
This work focuses on extractive QA, also known as reading comprehension, where text
passages are paired with questions, and answers are directly extracted from the text. A
well-known example of an extractive QA dataset is the Stanford Question Answering
Dataset (SQuAD), which includes over 100,000 QA pairs from Wikipedia
articles**Rajpurkar et al., "SQuAD: 100,000+ Questions for Machine Comprehension of Text"**. In the case of Icelandic, a language closely related
to Faroese, several QA datasets have been developed.
**Talman et al. introduced a cross-lingual open-domain QA**
system using machine-translated data, and the Natural Questions in Icelandic, an
extractive QA dataset, which demonstrates approaches applicable to other low-resource
languages such as Faroese**. Similarly,
**Hovy et al. developed a method to gamify QA dataset**
creation. However, both approaches relied heavily on human question generation, which
bottlenecked the dataset creation process.

At the time of writing, few benchmark datasets exist for Faroese.
**Kiperwasser and Golland introduced named entity**
recognition\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/vesteinn/sosialurin-faroese-ner}}
and semantic text similarity
datasets\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/vesteinn/faroese-sts}}. The
FLORES-200 dataset**Hausmann et al., "Flores-200: A Multilingual Parallel Corpus of 200 Languages"**
is another significant contribution to Faroese
benchmarks, being a multilingual parallel corpus covering over 200 languages, including
Faroese. Additionally, **SÃ¦ttinger and Eger introduced ScaLA-Fo, a linguistic**
acceptability dataset for Faroese. Despite these resources, a dedicated Faroese QA
dataset is still lacking, which this work aims to address.
