\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce CrossVideoMAE, an effective end-to-end SSL framework for cross-modal contrastive spatiotemporal and semantic representation learning. By leveraging relationships between videos and sampled frames, our method captures rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. CrossVideoMAE employs both intra-modal and cross-modal contrastive learning, contrasting features at video and frame levels. Experimental results demonstrate that CrossVideoMAE outperforms previous SOTA methods.
