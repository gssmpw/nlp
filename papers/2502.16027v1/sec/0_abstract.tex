In the realm of autonomous driving, conventional approaches for vehicle perception and decision-making primarily rely on sensor input and rule-based algorithms. 
However, these methodologies often suffer from lack of interpretability and robustness, particularly in intricate traffic scenarios. 
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel brain-inspired driving (BID) framework. 
Diverging from traditional methods, our approach harnesses brain-inspired perception technology to achieve more efficient and robust environmental perception. 
Additionally, it employs brain-inspired decision-making techniques to facilitate intelligent decision-making. 
The experimental results show that the performance has been significantly improved across various autonomous driving tasks and achieved the end-to-end autopilot successfully. 
This contribution not only advances interpretability and robustness but also offers fancy insights and methodologies for further advancing autonomous driving technology.
