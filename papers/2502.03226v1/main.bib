%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

This paper presents and analyzes a range of learning methodologies, such as mobile learning, micro learning, personal learning, challenge-based learning, collaborative learning, and ubiquitous learning. In addition, the purpose of higher educational institutions and use of emerging technologies are also discussed. A systematic literature review was conducted on several learning methodologies and frameworks currently available to academics today in order to meet the challenges of enhancing and cultivating innovative mobile learning in the 21st century. For analyzing the contextual framework of each methodology, the study draws upon a wide range of resources, such as journals, articles, books and online repositories. Based on the findings of this review, a theoretical framework and learning methodology for innovative mobile learning is proposed, along with suggestions on how it can be implemented into the overall learning experience.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

This paper presents and analyzes a range of learning methodologies, such as mobile learning, micro learning, personal learning, challenge-based learning, collaborative learning, and ubiquitous learning. In addition, the purpose of higher educational institutions and use of emerging technologies are also discussed. A systematic literature review was conducted on several learning methodologies and frameworks currently available to academics today in order to meet the challenges of enhancing and cultivating innovative mobile learning in the 21st century. For analyzing the contextual framework of each methodology, the study draws upon a wide range of resources, such as journals, articles, books and online repositories. Based on the findings of this review, a theoretical framework and learning methodology for innovative mobile learning is proposed, along with suggestions on how it can be implemented into the overall learning experience.},
