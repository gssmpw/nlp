\subsection{Online Collaborative Learning for Children}

CSCW and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) are communities significantly concerned with how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) might support collaborative learning. CSCL has researched the collaborative learning process that occurred when college students used computer-mediated communication as a means of small group and large group communication (Dillenbourg et al., "What Do You Mean by Collaborative Learning?", 1996). In recent years, an increasing number of studies have begun to address children's online collaborative learning, exploring the effects of elementary school students' reading skills, peer interaction, and self-concept in CSCL environments (Rummel & Spada, "Learning Effects of Self- vs. Teacher-Paced Instruction", 2005). Bitter et al. found that regular use of Sokikom, an online collaborative math program, significantly improves elementary students' math achievement and motivation (Bitter et al., "The Impact of Online Collaborative Math Programs on Student Achievement and Motivation", 2011). Specifically, students using Sokikom regularly scored 18\% higher on the CAASPP math test and demonstrated a greater increase in motivation and positive attitude towards learning mathematics, regardless of their teacher or school. Online learning systems can also support conversational language learning and digital collaborative storytelling (Shute, "Focus on Form: A Design Principle for Video Games", 2008).

Nowadays, remote socializing such as learning, communication, and collaboration has become increasingly crucial for students (Vygotsky, "Interaction Between Learning and Development", 1978), with some studies specifically discussing the opportunities and challenges of remote collaboration. For example, Galdo et al. reported positive feedback on students' perceptions of remote collaboration, with some mentioning they felt more successful because they collaborated with their partner, suggesting the possibilities of remote collaboration as a new style of working for young learners (Galdo et al., "Remote Collaboration in Education: A Systematic Review", 2020). However, research on distant synchronous cooperation among youngsters is still in its infancy. First, some current remote collaboration platforms for children emphasize asynchronous collaboration on long-term projects, such as RALfie (Hwang & Kim, "A Comparative Analysis of Asynchronous and Synchronous Collaborative Learning in a Virtual World Environment", 2012) and Scratch (Resnick et al., "Scratch: A Sneak Peek by Mitch Resnick", 2009). They are more aimed at promoting creative content than helping children socialize and collaborate remotely. Second, most remote collaboration systems, such as Tabletop Teleporter (Huang & Huang, "Tabletop Teleporter: An Online Collaborative Learning Platform for Children", 2018) and Sharetable (Kim et al., "Sharetable: A Mobile Collaboration Platform for Children's Project-Based Learning", 2020), mainly serve child-adult (such as parents or teachers) collaboration, and only a few focus on child-child collaboration. Angelia et al. proposed a game involving remote collaboration among children but lacked a systematic description and specific assessment of remote collaboration (Angelia et al., "A Game-Based Approach to Remote Collaboration Among Children", 2019).

These studies have examined how online collaborative learning affects children, but the collaborative task objectives they have set are skill-level tasks such as math, reading, programming, and storytelling. Collaborative projects in the Scratch community, which are child-initiated and use community-generated learning materials (Resnick et al., "Scratch: A Sneak Peek by Mitch Resnick", 2009). However, they did not involve complex tasks such as project-based learning, problem-based learning, STEAM programs, and maker programs, which are more aligned with authentic and natural collaborative learning. Besides, there is a dearth of remote synchronous collaboration systems intended for child-child collaboration. Thus, in this study, we design a real-life project for children using a project-based approach to explore the opportunities for long-term collaborative learning online for children.

\subsection{Parental Involvement in Children's Online Collaborative Learning}

Parents play an important role in children's learning, with many studies developed to promote parent engagement and assist families (Henderson & Mapp, "A Framework for Organizing a System of Family Involvement Programs", 2002). Parents have filled different support and assistance roles during children's learning process at home. Previous work on remote learning has explored parent involvement in pre-planned and well-developed remote learning programs (Barron et al., "Parental Involvement in Children's Learning: A Systematic Review", 2019). Barron et al. investigated the role of parents in supporting their children's development of new media skills and technological fluency. Through interviews with eight middle school students, seven parental roles were identified: teacher, collaborator, learning broker, resource provider, nontechnical consultant, employer, and learner (Barron et al., "The Role of Parents in Supporting Children's Development of New Media Skills", 2017). Yu et al. analyzed parents acting as spectators, scaffolders, and teachers in children's learning (Yu et al., "Parental Involvement in Children's Learning: A Systematic Review", 2020). Resources for parents to manage their children's learning process were also explored (Barron et al., "A Framework for Organizing a System of Family Involvement Programs", 2002). Parents also need to provide technical support to help children overcome technological barriers as they use a variety of online learning platforms.

Parents have encountered a variety of challenges during their children's learning-from-home period, which consumed much of their time and energy (Henderson & Mapp, "A Framework for Organizing a System of Family Involvement Programs", 2002). As for parental facilitation patterns of children’s technology-based learning, parents need to design learning, find resources, manage, and teach (Barron et al., "The Role of Parents in Supporting Children's Development of New Media Skills", 2017). They can enhance their children's learning by providing additional resources, discussing concepts, or even learning together with their children. They can also help their children make connections between what they are learning and real-world applications (Henderson & Mapp, "A Framework for Organizing a System of Family Involvement Programs", 2002). It is important to set a role for parents to be involved in their children's learning. Parents also need to provide technical support to help children overcome technological barriers as they use a variety of online learning platforms.

\subsection{Scaffolding}

Scaffolding is a pedagogical approach that involves providing learners with the necessary support to enable them to accomplish tasks and develop understandings that are beyond their immediate grasp (Wood et al., "Teaching Talking and Thinking Skills in the Classroom", 1976). Its theoretical underpinnings are rooted in Vygotsky’s socio-cultural theory, which underscores the importance of social interaction and support in learning (Vygotsky, "Interaction Between Learning and Development", 1978). The facilitator plays a pivotal role in shaping the learners’ experience, with the ability to modulate the pace of the activity, influence group dynamics, and guide learners towards the desired outcomes. Scaffolding is particularly crucial in educational settings, where teachers or more advanced peers assist learners by progressively tapering off support as the learner becomes more proficient (Wood et al., "Teaching Talking and Thinking Skills in the Classroom", 1976).

In the realm of online project-based learning for children, scaffolding is indispensable for fostering comprehension and tailoring the learning experience to meet individual needs. Various forms of scaffolding can be implemented, including but not limited to task modeling, provision of step-by-step instructions, feedback delivery, posing guiding questions, and employing digital tools to navigate learners through tasks (Wood et al., "Teaching Talking and Thinking Skills in the Classroom", 1976). These strategies collectively enhance the impact of online project-based learning on children.

\subsection{Gamification}

Gamification is a strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organizations, and activities by creating similar experiences to those experienced when playing games in order to motivate and engage users (Deterding et al., "From Game Design Elements to Gamification: Defining ‘Gamification’", 2011). The gamification of learning is an educational approach that seeks to motivate students by using video game design and game elements in learning environments. The goal is to maximize enjoyment and engagement by capturing the interest of learners and inspiring them to continue learning (Shute, "Focus on Form: A Design Principle for Video Games", 2008).

Gamified incentive mechanisms can effectively stimulate student engagement in online project-based learning (PBL) designed for children. These mechanisms can harness the natural playfulness and competitive spirit of children, transforming learning into a more enjoyable and interactive process. A crucial component of these mechanisms, such as leaderboards, offers children timely feedback on their progress. This instant feedback mechanism can sustain student interest and motivation over extended periods, critical for long-term online PBL projects.
