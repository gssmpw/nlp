\section{Application:  A lower bound on the computation of Pareto Sums} \label{sec:applications} \label{sec:ParetoSum}
In the following, we explore how the $3$-SUM hardness of Verification of Pareto Sum
translates to a hardness result for the problem of computing Pareto Sums.
Let us first justify the naming of the Verification of Pareto Sum problem,
by showing it to be subquadratic equivalent to the more natural extended version of Verification of Pareto Sum.
Throughout this section, we consider dimensions $d\ge 2$.
\begin{definition}[Verification of Pareto Sum (Extended version)]
	Given sets $A,B,C \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$, do 
	the following properties hold simultaneously:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item (Inclusion): $C\subseteq A+B$,
	\item (Dominance): $C$ dominates $A+B$. More formally, for every $a \in A, b \in B$ there exists $c \in C$ with $c\geq a+b$.
	\item (Minimality): There are no $c,c' \in C$ with $c\neq c'$ and $c \leq c'$. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

We make use of the following lemma and its construction for the results in this section.

\begin{lemma}
	Given sets $A,B,C \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ of size at most $n$, one can construct sets $\Tilde{A},\Tilde{B},\Tilde{C} \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ of size $\Theta(n)$ 
	in time $\Tilde{O}(n)$ such that (1) $\Tilde{A}, \Tilde{B}, \Tilde{C}$ always satisfy the minimality and inclusion condition and (2)
	$\Tilde{A},\Tilde{B},\Tilde{C}$ fulfill the dominance condition if and only if $A,B,C$ fulfill 
	the dominance condition.  
	\label{annoying_construction}
	\end{lemma}
	Due to space constraints, the proof had to be deferred to the full version. Using this construction, it is not difficult to obtain the following equivalence.

	\begin{lemma}
		There is an $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time algorithm for an $\epsilon>0$ for Verification of Pareto Sum (Extended Version)
		if and only if there is an $O(n^{2-\epsilon'})$ time algorithm for an $\epsilon'>0$ for Verification of Pareto Sum.
		\end{lemma}
	The proof can be found in the full version.
Thus, for subquadratic reductions, we can restrict ourselves to the Verification of Pareto Sum problem, which essentially
only checks the dominance condition.


Let us now consider the natural problem of computing the Pareto Sum.
\begin{definition}[Pareto Sum]
	Given sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$, compute a set $C \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$,
	such that $A,B,C$ satisfy the Inclusion, Dominance and Minimality condition.
\end{definition}


In the following, we argue why the lower bounds to Verification of Pareto Sum translate to lower bounds 
to Computation of the Pareto Sum. Formally, we prove: 



\begin{lemma}
If there is an algorithm to compute the Pareto Sum $C$ of sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ in time 
	$O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ for an $\epsilon>0$ even when $C=\Theta(n)$,
then one can also decide Verification of Pareto Sum of sets $A,B,C$ in time $O(n^{2-\epsilon'})$ for an
$\epsilon'>0$. 
\label{Verif to Comp}
\end{lemma}

We conclude this section with our resulting hardness results for computing Pareto Sums.
