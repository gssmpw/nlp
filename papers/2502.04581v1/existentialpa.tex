\section{$k$-SUM is complete for existential $\FOPZ$ formulas}\label{sec:existentialpa}
We begin with a simple completeness theorem that $k$-SUM is complete for the class of problems $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}(\exists^k)$. Since $k$-SUM is indeed a $\FOPZ(\exists^k)$-formula, it remains to show a fine-grained reduction from any $\FOPZ(\exists^k)$ formula to $k$-SUM.
The proofs in this section are deferred to the full version.
As a first step towards this Theorem, we consider how to reduce a conjunction of $m$ linear inequalities
to a vector $k$-SUM instance.
\begin{lemma}
  Consider vectors $a_1 \in \{-U, \dots, U\}^{d_1}, \dots, a_k \in \{-U ,\dots,U\}^{d_k},$ integers $S_1, \dots, S_m \in \{-U, \dots, U\},$
  for each $i \in \{1,\dots,m\}, j \in \{1,\dots,k\}$, vectors $c_{i,j} \in \mathbb{Z}^{d_j}$, and a formula $$\psi:=\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m}\left( \sum_{j=1}^{k}c_{i,j}^T a_j \geq S_i\right). $$
  There exist  $O(1)$ time computable functions $f_1^{\ell,\psi} ,\dots ,f_k^{\ell,\psi} ,g^{\ell,\psi,W}$ such that the following statements are equivalent
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The formula $\bigwedge_{i=1}^{m} \left(\sum_{j=1}^{k}c_{i,j}^T a_j \geq S_i \right)$ holds.
    \item There are $\ell \in \{1,\dots, \lceil \log_2(M)\rceil\}^m, W \in \{1,\dots ,k\}^m$ such that $f^{\ell,\psi}_1 (a_1)+\dots + f^{\ell,\psi}_k (a_k)=g^{\ell,\psi,W} (S_1,\dots,S_m).$
  \end{enumerate}
  Moreover, if the second item holds, there is a unique choice of such $\ell$ and $W$. 
      \label{Ineq_to_eq}
\end{lemma}
Essentially the above lemma enables a reduction from a conjunction of inequality checks to a conjunction of equality checks. We can now continue with our completeness theorem.

Ater applying Lemma~\ref{Ineq_to_eq}, it remains to reduce a conjunction of equality checks to $k$-SUM. To do so, we interpret the conjunction of equalities as a Vector $k$-SUM problem, which can be reduced to $k$-SUM in a straightforward way~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/AbboudLW13}.
