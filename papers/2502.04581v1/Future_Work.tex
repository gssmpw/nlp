\section{Future Work}\label{sec::ende}
While we exhibit a pair of problems that is complete for the class $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$,
one could still ask whether there is a subquadratic reduction from Hausdorff distance under $n$ Translations to Verification of Pareto Sum.
As a result there would be a single complete problem (or rather the canonical multidimensional family of a single geometric problem) for $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$.
\begin{center}
    \emph{ Is Verification of Pareto Sum complete for the class $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$?}
    \end{center}


Interestingly, previous completeness theorems \cite{GaoIKW19} were able to establish a problem of quantifier structure $\forall \forall \exists$ (the Orthogonal Vectors problem) as complete
by making use of a technique in~\cite{DBLP:conf/focs/WilliamsW10} that was originally used to show subcubic equivalence
between All-Pairs Negative Triangle and Negative Triangle.
However, a major problem we encounter is that while the third quantifier in the Orthogonal Vectors problem ranges over a sparse (intuitively: subpolynomially sized) domain (i.e., the dimensions of the vectors),
the third quantifier in Pareto Sum Verification ranges over a linearly sized domain (i.e., the set $C$).

Finally, we ask if our $3$-SUM completeness result for arbitrary quantifier structures can be  improved upon.
\begin{center}
\emph{Can we establish a $d>3$ such that $3$-SUM is complete for 
$\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ formulas of inequality dimension at most $d$?}
\end{center}
