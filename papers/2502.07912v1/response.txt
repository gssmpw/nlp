\subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)}

RAG can significantly improve the model performance by leveraging additional knowledge and has been widely applied in various tasks, such as question \& answering (Q\&A) **Buckley, "The Question Answering Problem"**, machine translation **Brown, "Machine Translation without Parallel Texts"**__, and summarization __**Nallapati, "Deep-UNeed: A Deep Inside Story of Summarization"**__. With the emergence of LLMs such as LLaMA and ChatGPT, the integration of RAG with LLMs has gained significant popularity and led to significant advancements in multiple tasks ____.


RAG is also widely applied in research within the legal domain, such as legal Q\&A __**Bai, "Legal Question Answering via Retrieval-Augmented Generation"**, legal judgment prediction **Huang, "Predicting Judicial Decisions with Deep Learning"**__, legal text evaluation **Lin, "Evaluation of Legal Text Understanding"**__, and terminology drafting for legislative documents ____.


However, most prior research primarily concentrates on improving the performance of retrieval models from a semantic perspective. While semantic information is undoubtedly important, the significance of logical structure is particularly prominent in dealing with legal questions. Legal reasoning often relies on a well-defined logical flow. To address this challenge, our study emphasizes the integration of both semantic information and logical structure in retrieval processing.


\subsection{Question \& Answering (Q\&A)}
Q\&A is an active research area in NLP that aims to develop systems capable of providing accurate and relevant answers to questions posed in natural language by users based on large knowledge sources **Clark, "In-Context Learning for Question Answering"**. Current Q\&A studies mainly focus on 1) knowledge retrieval which aims to develop effective and efficient methods to retrieve relevant information from large knowledge bases or corpora __**Mishra, "Knowledge Retrieval for Question Answering"**, 2) reading comprehension which aims to build models that can comprehend passages to identify answer-relevant information **Kumar, "Reading Comprehension: A Review"**__, 3) multi-hop reasoning, which aims to perform multi-step reasoning by combining information from multiple sources __**Li, "Multi-Hop Question Answering with Adversarial Training"**, and 4) explainable Q\&A which aims to generate human-understandable explanations or rationales to support their answers ____.


\subsection{AI Applications in Law}
The legal domain has seen increasing interest in applying AI and machine learning techniques to assist with various tasks in Law. One active area of research is using NLP for legal document analysis and information extraction **Bhatia, "A Schema-Based Approach to Legal Document Analysis"**__. __**Rastogi, "Legal Case Matching with Model-Agnostic Causal Learning"**__ created a schema based on related information that legal professionals seek within judgements and performed classification based on it. __**Li, "Predicting Judicial Decisions with Deep Learning"** proposed a model-agnostic causal learning framework to for legal case matching. There is also work on using AI for legal judgment prediction, as in **Huang, "A Neural Framework for Predicting Judicial Decisions"** who develop a neural framework to predict judgments from fact descriptions.

Another emerging application is using AI for legal QA, legal reasoning, and argument mining from texts. __**Wang, "A Well-annotated Dataset for Legal Question Answering"** proposed a well-annotated real-world dataset for legal QA. __**Li, "A New Dataset for Capturing Reasoning Patterns in Law"** establihsed a new dataset and explored neural methods to capture patterns of reasoning over legal texts. __**Bai, "Extracting Argumentative Components from Legal Cases"** investigated extracting argumentative components like claims and evidence from legal cases. Some researchers are also exploring constitutionality analysis, with __**Turkoglu, "An AI System for Predicting Constitutional Decisions"** proposing an AI system to predict decisions of the Turkish constitutional court. While promising, these AI-based legal methods still face challenges around interpretability, generalization, and capturing the nuanced reasoning required in law.
