abstract = {Navigation assistance is an active research area, where one aim is to foster independent living for people with vision impairments. Despite the fact that many navigation assistants use advanced technologies and methods, we found that they did not explicitly address two essential requirements in a navigation assistant - portability and convenience. It is equally imperative in designing a navigation assistant for the visually impaired that the device is portable and convenient to use without much training. Some navigation assistants do not provide users with detailed information about the obstacle types that can be detected, which is essential to make informed decisions when navigating in real-time. To address these gaps, we propose DeepNAVI, a smartphone-based navigation assistant that leverages deep learning competence. Besides providing information about the type of obstacles present, our system can also provide information about their position, distance from the user, motion status, and scene information. All this information is offered to users through audio mode without compromising portability and convenience. With a small model size and rapid inference time, our navigation assistant can be deployed on a portable device such as a smartphone and work seamlessly in a real-time environment. We conducted a pilot test with a user to assess the usefulness and practicality of the system. Our testing results indicate that our system has the potential to be a practical and useful navigation assistant for the visually impaired.}

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of loneliness among visually impaired elderly, and its relations with adaptation to vision loss, received social support and depression. Clients aged 55 years or older who contacted Sensis, a rehabilitation centre for visually impaired people, are approached to take part in this observational study. Exclusion criteria are hearing and cognitive impairments. The participants receive an interview by telephone in which loneliness, adaptation to vision loss, received social support and depression are investigated. The results indicate a high prevalence of loneliness (54%) among visually impaired elderly. Compared to visually impaired elderly who are not lonely, the lonely ones show a poorer adaptation to vision loss (mean=22.7 (S.D.=6.79) versus mean=27.8 (S.D.=5.32); t=6.08 (194.84); p=.000), less received social support (mean=26.3 (S.D.=5.99) versus 29.4 (S.D.=4.95); t=3.30 (136); p=.001) and more feelings of depression (mean 12.9 (S.D.=6.46) versus mean=6.7 (S.D.=4.11); t=−6.41 (107.28); p=.000). Causality cannot be determined on the basis of this observational study. Nonetheless, regarding the high prevalence of loneliness among visually impaired elderly, interventions aimed at reducing this loneliness seem to be highly indicated.}
