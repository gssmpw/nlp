               applications for healthcare, foodstamps and cash benefits in
               three yearsbecause a new computer system interprets any mistake
               as failure to cooperate. In Los Angeles, an algorithm calculates
               the comparative vulnerability of tens of thousands of homeless
               people in order to prioritize them for an inadequate pool of
               housing resources. In Pittsburgh, a child welfare agency uses a
               statistical model to try to predict which children might be
               future victims of abuse or neglect. Since the dawn of the digital
               age, decision-making in finance, employment, politics, health and
               human services has undergone revolutionary change. Today,
               automated systemsrather than humanscontrol which neighborhoods
               get policed, which families attain needed resources, and who is
               investigated for fraud. While we all live under this new regime
               of data, the most invasive and punitive systems are aimed at the
               poor. In Automating Inequality, Virginia Eubanks systematically
               investigates the impacts of data mining, policy algorithms, and
               predictive risk models on poor and working-class people in
               America. The book is full of heart-wrenching and eye-opening
               stories, from a woman in Indiana whose benefits are literally cut
               off as she lays dying to a family in Pennsylvania in daily fear
               of losing their daughter because they fit a certain statistical
               profile. The U.S. has always used its most cutting-edge science
               and technology to contain, investigate, discipline and punish the
               destitute. Like the county poorhouse and scientific charity
               before them, digital tracking and automated decision-making hide
               poverty from the middle-class public and give the nation the
               ethical distance it needs to make inhumane choices: which
               families get food and which starve, who has housing and who
               remains homeless, and which families are broken up by the state.
               In the process, they weaken democracy and betray our most
               cherished national values. This deeply researched and passionate
               book could not be more timely.",
