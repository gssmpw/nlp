IDS are essential for ensuring a robust and comprehensive security strategy. ML methods have been recently adopted for this task due to their great prediction performance. However, current ML-IDS solutions are vulnerable to under-represented attacks and constantly changing environments. Therefore, future IDS must be able to (i) generalize to unseen attacks and (ii) adapt to evolving attacks over time. To address these challenges, we present \Design{}, a continual novelty detection based IDS algorithm. \Design{} combines PCA novelty detection with a continual feature extractor. \Design{} is capable of continually learning with no attack labels, allowing it to detect attacks in a changing data stream. We have demonstrated that on realistic intrusion datasets, \Design{} is up to 6.1$\times$ more effective than SOTA unsupervised CL method for detecting seen attacks and up to 6.5$\times$ more effective at detecting future attacks. %Furthermore, by incorporating unsupervised data, \Design{} outperforms all other state-of-the-art novelty detection algorithms.
