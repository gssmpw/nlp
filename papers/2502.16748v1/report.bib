  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: As a result of advances in skin imaging technology
               and the development of suitable image processing techniques,
               during the last decade, there has been a significant increase of
               interest in the computer-aided diagnosis of melanoma. Automated
               border detection is one of the most important steps in this
               procedure, because the accuracy of the subsequent steps
               crucially depends on it. METHODS: In this article, we present a
               fast and unsupervised approach to border detection in dermoscopy
               images of pigmented skin lesions based on the statistical region
               merging algorithm. RESULTS: The method is tested on a set of 90
               dermoscopy images. The border detection error is quantified by a
               metric in which three sets of dermatologist-determined borders
               are used as the ground-truth. The proposed method is compared
               with four state-of-the-art automated methods
               (orientation-sensitive fuzzy c-means, dermatologist-like tumor
               extraction algorithm, meanshift clustering, and the modified
               JSEG method). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that the
               method presented here achieves both fast and accurate border
               detection in dermoscopy images.",
