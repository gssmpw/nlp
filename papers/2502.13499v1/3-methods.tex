\section{Methods}
In our work, we conducted an audit, testing how likely LLMs are to produce dark patterns when generating code. We tested three factors: 1) model, 2) ecommerce component, and 3) whose interests are prioritized in the prompt. The four models selected were popular LLMs: Claude, GPT, Gemini, and CodeLlama. The components generated were 13 common parts of ecommerce platforms (e.g., search, product reviews, checkout, etc.). Finally, the interests captured company interests, user interests, and a baseline condition with no interest specified. 

\subsection{Condition 1: Varying LLMs}
Our first condition tested different LLMs, to assess whether some models are more likely to produce dark patterns than others. The specific versions %models 
used were Claude 3.5 Sonnet \cite{a:58}, GPT-4o \cite{a:18}, Gemini-2.0-flash-exp \cite{a:19}, and CodeLlama-34b-Instruct \cite{a:20}. These models were selected because: (1) as coding is becoming more accessible to non-experts, ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are among the most popular commercial LLMs available to general users \cite{a:57}; (2) including CodeLlama allows comparison of performance between non-commercial and commercial LLM; (3) these models are all fine-tuned with code datasets \cite{a:58, a:20, a:18, a:62}.

\end{table}

The second condition in our experiment tested different components of ecommerce websites (or widgets). Our study focused on ecommerce, because previous work has identified a significant number of dark pattern instances in this context~\cite{a:9}. We selected 13 commonly seen components (see Table \ref{tab:widgetdescriptions}) on shopping websites and wrote one-sentence descriptions for each, all following a consistent format. 

These components were selected because of their relevance and importance for ecommerce websites based on two considerations: (1) We first identified seven features that were either essential for users to complete their shopping tasks or assist them in the process, including search, product details, shopping cart, checkout, shipment tracking, and customer reviews; (2) We then included six more components that represented common strategies used by services to enhance user engagement, such as featured products, promotional information (e.g., sales banners and discount offers), membership mechanisms (e.g., signup and unsubscribe options), and newsletter subscriptions.
Table~\ref{tab:widgetdescriptions} lists all component descriptions. These descriptions were carefully reviewed by the authors to ensure they were neutral, free of bias, and did not provide any information that might lead towards dark patterns.


\subsection{Condition 3: Varying Whose Interests Are Prioritized}\label{sec:interests}

The final condition %in the study
tested whether highlighting different stakeholder interests in the prompt would increase %or decrease 
the likelihood of generating dark patterns, with %. We test 
three versions: company interests, user interests, and a baseline condition. 

%\noindent \textbf{Company interests: \hspace{5pt}} 
The company interests case was included because previous research indicates that companies often deliberately design manipulative practices in pursuit of profit~\cite{a:64, a:48}. We aimed to explore %are interested in exploring 
whether focusing on company benefit-related goals in system prompts increased the likelihood of LLMs generating dark patterns. In this case, the system prompt included the guidance, ``\textit{Design widgets with the interests of the company in mind, like increasing conversion rate, basket size, and number of purchases.}'' Metrics like conversion rate and basket size are popular measures of sales performance that marketers and businesses focus on~\cite{martin2020fundamental,mcdowell2016examination}, and could increase the likelihood that generated code would use tactics to trick customers into additional purchases.

%\noindent \textbf{User interests: \hspace{5pt}} 
The user interests case was included because user-centered design principles often preclude the development of dark patterns. For example, principles of consistency would prevent designers from offering unequal options \cite{a:65}. In this case, the prompt included the added instruction, ``\textit{Design widgets with user-centered design principles in mind, like user autonomy, flexibility, and consistency.}'' 
These two interests-based additions were written to have similar length, complexity, and jargon, to prevent any factor other than the interest from impacting the generated code. In the baseline condition, no additional information was included in the prompt.

\subsection{Prompts}
LLM prompts were structured into two parts: system prompts and user prompts.  The separation between system and user prompts was intended to provide a distinction between overall instructions for consistent results and individual tasks. System prompts define the LLM's overall behavior, tone, and boundaries, ensuring consistent and safe interactions. User prompts, on the other hand, specify tasks or queries dynamically, tailoring the LLM's responses to user needs \cite{a:67}. All four LLMs were tested using the same system and user prompt structure. CodeLlama's system prompt included an extra instruction to wrap the code with \textit{<!DOCTYPE html>} and \textit{</html>}, and enclose CSS styles within \textit{<style>} and \textit{</style>} tags, ensuring a consistent code structure with the other three models for building the next-step annotation pipeline. The prompt template used for both system and user prompts is included in Table~\ref{tab:system_prompt}. 

In this study, the system prompts described the overall task of generating HTML and CSS code. LLMs were tasked with generating a single file that used HTML and CSS to create a web component. The prompt also included instructions that encouraged realistic outputs, specified minimum dimensions, and provided a placeholder image to use. Finally, there was a template section that included a description of prioritized interests for some conditions. 

The user prompts in this case provided the specific component of the website to be produced, listed in Table~\ref{tab:widgetdescriptions}. 
%User prompts describe ecommerce components users want the LLMs to generate. The full prompt is:

A pair of system prompt and user prompt was produced for each combination of model, ecommerce component, and stakeholder interest. Thus, each model was prompted to produce 39 components (component $\times$ interest); we generated each component twice, for a total of 312 components.
