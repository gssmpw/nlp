\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we conducted an audit of four LLMs to evaluate their likelihood of generating dark pattern designs in code for 13 ecommerce web components. Our findings revealed a significant percentage of designs containing dark patterns, performance differences among models, variations in the frequency of dark patterns across ecommerce components and different stakeholder interests. We also provided detailed examples and distributions for each dark pattern attribute produced by the LLMs. This study highlights the critical need for human intervention when using LLMs as AI-assisted programming tools for front-end development. Additionally, we call for expanding ethical design education to a broader audience, as the shift in design responsibility brought by LLMs now involves more users in addition to traditional designers.
