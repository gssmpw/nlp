\caption{Overview of the \frameworkname framework. At each time step, the model processes an untrimmed egocentric video and audio stream, classifying them in real time into three categories: background (no speech), other person speaking, and target speaker (camera wearer) speaking. These probabilities are visualized at the bottom, where the model anticipates near-future frames and enables proactive speech initiation for conversational agents.}
