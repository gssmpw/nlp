We introduced \frameworkname, a novel framework for real-time speech initiation prediction from an in-the-wild, first-person viewpoint. \frameworkname integrates four key capabilities to better handle complex, dynamic real-world conversations. We also presented YT-Conversation, a large-scale dataset of in-the-wild YouTube videos for pretraining.

Empirical results on two egocentric conversational video datasets demonstrate that \frameworkname significantly outperforms random and silence-based baselines in real time. Notably, our analysis revealed that incorporating optical flow significantly improves performance and highlighted a counterintuitive finding on context length. We encourage further exploration of large-scale conversational datasets, improved multimodal modeling techniques, and integration with large language models to generate responses, advancing turn-taking in real-world settings.
