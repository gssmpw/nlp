The listener head generation (LHG) task aims to generate natural nonverbal listener responses based on the speaker's multimodal cues.
While prior work either rely on limited modalities (e.g. audio and facial information) or employ autoregressive approaches which have limitations such as accumulating prediction errors.
To address these limitations, we propose DiffListener, a discrete diffusion based approach for non-autoregressive listener head generation. 
Our model takes the speaker's facial information, audio, and text as inputs, additionally incorporating facial differential information to represent the temporal dynamics of expressions and movements. 
With this explicit modeling of facial dynamics, DiffListener can generate coherent reaction sequences in a non-autoregressive manner.
Through comprehensive experiments, DiffListener demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. 
The user study shows that DiffListener generates natural context-aware listener reactions that are well synchronized with the speaker.
