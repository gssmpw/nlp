abstract = {In the task of talking head generation, it is hard to learn the mapping relationship between generated head image and input audio signal. To tackle this challenge, we propose to learn the mapping relationship between input audio signal and the parameters of three-dimensional morphable face model (3DMM) first, which is easier to learn. Then the parameters of 3DMM are used to guide the generation of high-quality talking head images. Prior works mostly encode audio features from short audio windows, which may influence the accuracy of lip movements sometimes because of the limited context. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based audio encoder to take full use of the long-term context from audio and then predict a sequence of 3DMM parameters accurately. Unlike prior works that only use the 3DMM parameters of expression, rotation and translation, we propose to include the parameters of identity. Since the location of 3D facial mesh point is decided by the expression and identity parameters, it is helpful to supply more subtle control of lip movement by considering the identity parameters. The experimental results reveal that our method ranks first in 4 of the total 11 evaluation metrics, which ranks first in the talking head generation track.},

abstract = {Face-to-face communication is a common scenario including roles of speakers and listeners. Most existing research methods focus on producing speaker videos, while the generation of listener heads remains largely overlooked. Responsive listening head generation is an important task that aims to model face-to-face communication scenarios by generating a listener head video given a speaker video and a listener head image. An ideal generated responsive listening video should respond to the speaker with attitude or viewpoint expressing while maintaining diversity in interaction patterns and accuracy in listener identity information. To achieve this goal, we propose the Multi-Faceted Responsive Listening Head Generation Network (MFR-Net). Specifically, MFR-Net employs the probabilistic denoising diffusion model to predict diverse head pose and expression features. In order to perform multi-faceted response to the speaker video, while maintaining accurate listener identity preservation, we design the Feature Aggregation Module to boost listener identity features and fuse them with other speaker-related features. Finally, a renderer finetuned with identity consistency loss produces the final listening head videos. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MFR-Net not only achieves multi-faceted responses in diversity and speaker identity information but also in attitude and viewpoint expression.},
