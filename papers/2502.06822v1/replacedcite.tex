\subsection{Listener Head Generation}
VICO____ 
proposes the LSTM-based model which generates the listener's responsive reactions based on the speaker's facial and audio information.
L2L____ points out the non-deterministic properties of the listener's reaction. They propose using a codebook to represent the listener's reaction.
ELP____ proposes using multiple codebooks based on the estimated emotion from the speaker.
LM-Listener____ utilizes the large language model to generate the listener's reaction only using the text information of the speaker. 
Most of the existing listener head generation models____ utilize the autoregressive approach. However, this approach has drawbacks such as accumulated error problems, so we propose the DiffListener to solve this limitation in non-autoregressive manner.

\subsection{Diffusion Model}
The denoising diffusion probabilistic model____ has shown strong performance not only in the image generation____
but also in the other various generation tasks____. 
The Argmax Flow____ extends the diffusion model to categorical random variables with transition matrices. 
The VQ-Diffusion____ improves the discrete diffusion and applies it to the image generation task, which has also been applied in various tasks ____. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time discrete diffusion is applied to the listener generation task.
