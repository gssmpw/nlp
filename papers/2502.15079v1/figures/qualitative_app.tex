         Success on binding, failure on correction: \method{} successfully assigns a higher entailment probability ($P_{yes}$) to the correct caption (top) compared to the incorrect one (bottom), outperforming the entailment-finetuned model in this regard. However, \method{} fails to produce a correction, as it erroneously indicates that the incorrect caption accurately describes the video.}

Additionally, \method{} fails to provide a correction, mistakenly asserting that the incorrect caption accurately describes the video.}
