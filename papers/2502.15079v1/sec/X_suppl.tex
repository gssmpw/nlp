\section{Rationale}
\label{sec:rationale}
Having the supplementary compiled together with the main paper means that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The supplementary can back-reference sections of the main paper, for example, we can refer to \cref{sec:intro};
\item The main paper can forward reference sub-sections within the supplementary explicitly (e.g. referring to a particular experiment); 
\item When submitted to arXiv, the supplementary will already included at the end of the paper.
\end{itemize}
To split the supplementary pages from the main paper, you can use \href{https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/preview/prvw11793/mac#:~:text=Delete%
