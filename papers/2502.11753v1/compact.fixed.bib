                  citizen participation in decision-making. Online
                  discussion forums are an important avenue for
                  enhancing citizen participation. This thesis proposal
                  1) identifies the challenges involved in facilitating
                  large-scale online discussions with Natural Language
                  Processing (NLP), 2) suggests solutions to these
                  challenges by incorporating hybrid human-AI
                  technologies, and 3) investigates what these
                  technologies can reveal about individual perspectives
                  in online discussions. We propose a three-layered
                  hierarchy for representing perspectives that can be
                  obtained by a mixture of human intelligence and large
                  language models. We illustrate how these
                  representations can draw insights into the diversity
                  of perspectives and allow us to investigate
                  interactions in online discussions.},

@inproceedings{stepanova-ross-2023-temporal,
  abstract     = {Misinformation detection models degrade in
                  performance over time, but the precise causes of this
                  remain under-researched, in particular for multimodal
                  models. We present experiments investigating the
                  impact of temporal shift on performance of multimodal
                  automatic misinformation detection classifiers.
                  Working with the r/Fakeddit dataset, we found that
                  evaluating models on temporally out-of-domain data
                  (i.e. data from time stretches unseen in training)
                  results in a non-linear, 7-8{\%} drop in macro F1 as
                  compared to traditional evaluation strategies (which
                  do not control for the effect of content change over
                  time). Focusing on two factors that make temporal
                  generalizability in misinformation detection
                  difficult, content shift and class distribution
                  shift, we found that content shift has a stronger
                  effect on recall. Within the context of
                  coarse-grained vs. fine-grained misinformation
                  detection with r/Fakeddit, we find that certain
                  misinformation classes seem to be more stable with
                  respect to content shift (e.g. Manipulated and
                  Misleading Content). Our results indicate that future
                  research efforts need to explicitly account for the
                  temporal nature of misinformation to ensure that
                  experiments reflect expected real-world performance.},

  abstract     = {Online misinformation is a prevalent societal issue,
                  with adversaries relying on tools ranging from cheap
                  fakes to sophisticated deep fakes. We are motivated
                  by the threat scenario where an image is used out of
                  context to support a certain narrative. While some
                  prior datasets for detecting image-text inconsistency
                  generate samples via text manipulation, we propose a
                  dataset where both image and text are unmanipulated
                  but mismatched. We introduce several strategies for
                  automatically retrieving convincing images for a
                  given caption, capturing cases with inconsistent
                  entities or semantic context. Our large-scale
                  automatically generated the NewsCLIPpings Dataset:
                  (1) demonstrates that machine-driven image
                  repurposing is now a realistic threat, and (2)
                  provides samples that represent challenging instances
                  of mismatch between text and image in news that are
                  able to mislead humans. We benchmark several
                  state-of-the-art multimodal models on our dataset and
                  analyze their performance across different
                  pretraining domains and visual backbones.},

@inproceedings{singal2024evidence,
  abstract     = {Given the widespread dissemination of misinformation
                  on social media, implementing fact-checking
                  mechanisms for online claims is essential. Manually
                  verifying every claim is very challenging,
                  underscoring the need for an automated fact-checking
                  system. This paper presents our system designed to
                  address this issue. We utilize the Averitec dataset
                  (Schlichtkrull et al., 2023) to assess the
                  performance of our fact-checking system. In addition
                  to veracity prediction, our system provides
                  supporting evidence, which is extracted from the
                  dataset. We develop a Retrieve and Generate (RAG)
                  pipeline to extract relevant evidence sentences from
                  a knowledge base, which are then inputted along with
                  the claim into a large language model (LLM) for
                  classification. We also evaluate the few-shot
                  In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities of multiple
                  LLMs. Our system achieves an
                  {\textquoteleft}Averitec' score of 0.33, which is a
                  22{\%} absolute improvement over the baseline. Our
                  Code is publicly available on
                  https://github.com/ronit-singhal/evidence-backed-fact-checking-using-rag-and-few-shot-in-context-learning-with-llms.},

Recent public scandals, e.g., the faces of celebrities being swapped onto pornographic videos, call for automated ways to detect these Deepfake videos. To help developing such methods, in this paper, we present the first publicly available set of Deepfake videos generated from videos of VidTIMIT database. We used open source software based on GANs to create the Deepfakes, and we emphasize that training and blending parameters can significantly impact the quality of the resulted videos. To demonstrate this impact, we generated videos with low and high visual quality (320 videos each) using differently tuned parameter sets. We showed that the state of the art face recognition systems based on VGG and Facenet neural networks are vulnerable to Deepfake videos, with 85.62\% and 95.00\% false acceptance rates (on high quality versions) respectively, which means methods for detecting Deepfake videos are necessary. By considering several baseline approaches, we found the best performing method based on visual quality metrics, which is often used in presentation attack detection domain, to lead to 8.97\% equal error rate on high quality Deepfakes. Our experiments demonstrate that GAN-generated Deepfake videos are challenging for both face recognition systems and existing detection methods, and the further development of face swapping technology will make it even more so.},

abstract = {Classification with imbalanced class distributions is a major problem in machine learning. Researchers have given considerable attention to the applications in many real-world scenarios. Although several works have utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to select potentially optimal classifiers in imbalanced classifications, limited studies have been devoted to finding the classification threshold for testing or unknown datasets. In general, the classification threshold is simply set to 0.5, which is usually unsuitable for an imbalanced classification. In this study, we analyze the drawbacks of using ROC as the sole measure of imbalance in data classification problems. In addition, a novel framework for finding the best classification threshold is proposed. Experiments with SCOP v.1.53 data reveal that, with the default threshold set to 0.5, our proposed framework demonstrated a 20.63% improvement in terms of F-score compared with that of more commonly used methods. The findings suggest that the proposed framework is both effective and efficient. A web server and software tools are available via http://datamining.xmu.edu.cn/prht/ or http://prht.sinaapp.com/.}
