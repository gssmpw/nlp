  abstract     = {Online misinformation is a prevalent societal issue,
                  with adversaries relying on tools ranging from cheap
                  fakes to sophisticated deep fakes. We are motivated
                  by the threat scenario where an image is used out of
                  context to support a certain narrative. While some
                  prior datasets for detecting image-text inconsistency
                  generate samples via text manipulation, we propose a
                  dataset where both image and text are unmanipulated
                  but mismatched. We introduce several strategies for
                  automatically retrieving convincing images for a
                  given caption, capturing cases with inconsistent
                  entities or semantic context. Our large-scale
                  automatically generated the NewsCLIPpings Dataset:
                  (1) demonstrates that machine-driven image
                  repurposing is now a realistic threat, and (2)
                  provides samples that represent challenging instances
                  of mismatch between text and image in news that are
                  able to mislead humans. We benchmark several
                  state-of-the-art multimodal models on our dataset and
                  analyze their performance across different
                  pretraining domains and visual backbones.},

@inproceedings{stepanova-ross-2023-temporal,
  abstract     = {Misinformation detection models degrade in
                  performance over time, but the precise causes of this
                  remain under-researched, in particular for multimodal
                  models. We present experiments investigating the
                  impact of temporal shift on performance of multimodal
                  automatic misinformation detection classifiers.
                  Working with the r/Fakeddit dataset, we found that
                  evaluating models on temporally out-of-domain data
                  (i.e. data from time stretches unseen in training)
                  results in a non-linear, 7-8{\%} drop in macro F1 as
                  compared to traditional evaluation strategies (which
                  do not control for the effect of content change over
                  time). Focusing on two factors that make temporal
                  generalizability in misinformation detection
                  difficult, content shift and class distribution
                  shift, we found that content shift has a stronger
                  effect on recall. Within the context of
                  coarse-grained vs. fine-grained misinformation
                  detection with r/Fakeddit, we find that certain
                  misinformation classes seem to be more stable with
                  respect to content shift (e.g. Manipulated and
                  Misleading Content). Our results indicate that future
                  research efforts need to explicitly account for the
                  temporal nature of misinformation to ensure that
                  experiments reflect expected real-world performance.},

                  citizen participation in decision-making. Online
                  discussion forums are an important avenue for
                  enhancing citizen participation. This thesis proposal
                  1) identifies the challenges involved in facilitating
                  large-scale online discussions with Natural Language
                  Processing (NLP), 2) suggests solutions to these
                  challenges by incorporating hybrid human-AI
                  technologies, and 3) investigates what these
                  technologies can reveal about individual perspectives
                  in online discussions. We propose a three-layered
                  hierarchy for representing perspectives that can be
                  obtained by a mixture of human intelligence and large
                  language models. We illustrate how these
                  representations can draw insights into the diversity
                  of perspectives and allow us to investigate
                  interactions in online discussions.},
