\section{Related Work}
Human arm motion has been extensively studied within the context of a number of different fields including clinical rehabilitation and digital media.

In sports science, rehabilitation, and kinesiology, the study of arm motion usually focuses on monitoring, treatment, or rehabilitation of conditions with motor impacts such as stroke or cerebral palsy **Bryson, "Human Robot Interaction"** but works identifying typical motor development are also common **Liebermann, "The Scientific Basis for New Rehabilitation Techniques Using a Low-Cost and Portable Device"**. Traditional data collection methods include physical input devices, like a hand pedal **Gould, "A Study on Hand Pedal for Motor Function Recovery of Stroke Patients"**, or physical sensors, like IMUs **Kleim, "Motor Cortex Plasticity and Behavior"**, to capture movement. The fewer pieces of physical equipment, the more natural the movement captured can be. Works which use immersive VR or augmented reality set-ups in game-like settings for capturing more natural movement to perform kinematic analysis or for rehabilitation training are more related to the work presented here **Dinardi, "Virtual Reality in Stroke Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review"**. Examples include the game \textit{SuperPop} which has been developed as a training intervention for children with cerebral palsy **Petersen, "SuperPop: A Virtual Reality Game for Motor Skill Training in Children with Cerebral Palsy"** and~\textit{PigScape} which analyzes movement strategies in children with ADHD **Deshmukh, "PigScape: An Immersive Virtual Reality Game to Assess Movement Strategies in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder"**. Games have also been used to study movement patterns in people who have had a stroke **Lai, "Video Games for Stroke Recovery"**, people who are recovering from burns **Bolton, "Gaming and Rehabilitation: A Pilot Study on the Use of Video Games in Burns Rehabilitation"**, and people with speech impairments **Mastropasqua, "Gamification as an Augmentative Tool to Support Individuals with Severe Speech Impairments"**.

Other work with a similar aim of characterizing how bimanual kinematic elements develop over childhood often measures the hand phasing, or the synchrony of the arm motions **Hadders-Algra, "The Acquisition of Bimanual Movements in Infancy"** but more specific metrics such as velocity **Krebs, "Rehabilitation Robotics"** are also used. The rate at which different kinematic elements of bilateral motion develop in childhood is contradicted in literature **Gordon, "Movement Science and Motor Control: A Critical Review"**. However some these works use different tasks in their studies which suggest that bilateral coordination and planning skills may display differently depending on if the task contains sequential movements **Bresson, "Sequence Learning and Bimanual Coordination"**, or if the arms needed to be used symmetrically or asymmetrically **Krams, "Neural Plasticity and Motor Control"**. 

Outside of rehabilitation and healthcare, characteristics of motion kinematics are also studied in digital media fields who want to create realistic digital human characters on small **Park, "Real-time Animation of Human Movements for Virtual Characters"** and large **Hsu, "Dynamic Motion Capture for Realistic Digital Human Animation"** scales. Understanding and quantifying the characteristically variable patterns of these motions has been identified as a key element of making movements more human-like **Piloušková, "Characterizing Human Locomotion Patterns for Realistic Simulation"**. Children's motion in particular changes dramatically as they age, leading to clear perceptual differences between child and adult motion **Mulligan, "Child-Adult Motor Differences: A Quantitative Review"**. To address this need for more realistic child motions, previous work has considered automated ways to adapt animations from adult to child motion, e.g., via a neural network **Gao, "Neural Network-based Adaptor for Adaptation of Adult Motions into Child Motions"**. 

In contrast to the above work, our aim is to characterize how specific kinematic elements develop over childhood, and characterize different motor strategies children use to adapt to an asymmetric sequential motor task without any physical input device to impair children's movements.
