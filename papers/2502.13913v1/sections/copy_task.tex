\section{Task of copy}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use only \{0, 1\} as context tokens as a starting point.
    \item Seems a two-layer transformer can do the copy task, but we can also test whether a one-layer transformer is able to do the copy.
    \item Need to check the accuracy on the whole test set (e.g., all possible 0-1 strings, which contain $2^T$ data or OOD test set (e.g., set different probability distribution from the training set).
\end{itemize}
