\section{Tasks}

We consider the following tasks. Let $K > 0$ be a positive integer. The input sequence has $K$ possible features. The $k$-th features is determined by the proportion of token $2k$ and token $2k+1$. When the proportion of token $2k$ among token $2k$ and $2k+1$ exceeds a threshold $\tau_k$, we say the input has feature $k$ (denoted as $f_k = 1$, and otherwise it does not have feature $k$ (denoted as $f_k = 0$). The final label of the input sequence (i.e., the output) is determined by $(f_k)_{k=1}^K$ and thus has $2^K$ possible choices.

Input sequence: $x = (c_1 c_2 \ldots c_K q)$, where each $c_k \in \{2k, 2k+1\}^*$. Output is the label of $x$.
