{\bf Analysis of Software Configurations.} 
Configuration issues have been  studied in many software applications~\cite{cdep,ctest-OSDI20,confu,Conferr-DSN08,spex,ConfigEverywhere-DongpuJin-ICSE14,NavigatingMazeBioinfo-MikaelaCashman-ASE18,ArielRabkin-ICSE11}. 
For example, ConfErr~\cite{Conferr-DSN08} manipulates parameters to emulate human errors;  
Ctests~\cite{ctest-OSDI20} detects failure-inducing configuration changes.
In general, these works do not analyze deep   dependencies within the  software.
The closest work is {cDEP}~\cite{cdep},
which notably observes \textit{inter-component dependencies} in  Hadoop~\cite{Hadoop} and OpenStack~\cite{OpenStack}. Unfortunately, their solution is largely inapplicable for file systems. 
This is because their target components share   configuration specifications (e.g., XML)  and libraries~\cite{ApacheCommonsConfiguraitons2}, which makes them equivalent to one single  program in terms of configuration. 
In contrast, 
the configuration dependencies in file systems may cross different programs and the user-kernel boundary, which requires  non-trivial mechanisms to extract.
In addition, cDEP relies on a Java   framework~\cite{soot} 
which cannot handle C-based file systems.

{\bf Reliability of File Systems.} 
Great efforts have been made to improve the reliability of 
file systems~\cite{bornholt2016specifying,recon12,hydra-2019,Changwoo-SOSP15-CrosscheckingFS,iron05} 
and  their  utilities~\cite{OmFAST18,Om-TOS18,SQCK,spiffy,SWIFT}.
For example, 
Prabhakaran et al.~\cite{iron05} apply fault injection to analyze the failure policies of  file
systems and propose improved designs based on the IRON taxonomy; 
Xu et al.~\cite{xu2019fuzzing} and Kim et al.~\cite{hydra-2019} use fuzzing to detect file system bugs;  
SQCK ~\cite{SQCK} and RFSCK~\cite{OmFAST18} improve the checker utilities of file systems to avoid inaccurate fixes. 
 While effective for their original  goals, these works do not consider multi-component configuration issues. 
 On the other hand, the configuration dependencies from this work may be integrated with these existing efforts to improve their coverage (see \S\ref{sec:plugins}).  
 Therefore, we view them as complementary.

{\bf Configuration Management Tools.} Faced by the increasing  challenge, practitioners have created dedicated frameworks for configuration management 
~\cite{CFEngine,Yadan2019Hydra}. 
For example,  
Facebook HYDRA~\cite{Yadan2019Hydra} supports managing hierarchical configurations elegantly. 
While helpful for developing new applications, refactoring FS ecosystems to leverage such frameworks would require substantial efforts (if possible at all).
Notably, the framework supports running a program with different compositions of configurations automatically. Nevertheless,  since it does not understand configuration dependencies, it may generate many invalid configuration states (see \S\ref{sec:state-generation-vs-fb-hydra}). This work aims to address such limitations.
