The results for molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-QM9 dataset ($\delta = 0.1\text{\AA}$) are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:qm9}. The table reports Recall and Precision metrics, with Coverage ($\uparrow$) and AMR ($\downarrow$) evaluated using both mean and median values. Our method consistently improves the performance of baseline models, as indicated by the shaded rows. Specifically, when applied to ETFlow, our approach achieves the highest mean Coverage (84.7\%) and the lowest mean AMR (0.079) for Recall, as well as the best median AMR (0.028). Similarly, notable improvements are observed when augmenting ETDiff, yielding superior AMR scores compared to the baseline. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing both the diversity and accuracy of predicted molecular conformers. Importantly, our method maintains competitive median Coverage values (100.0\%) across multiple baselines, demonstrating its robustness and consistency.
