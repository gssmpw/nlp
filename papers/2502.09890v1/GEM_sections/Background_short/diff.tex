\subsection{Diffusion Models and Equivariant Diffusion Models}

Diffusion models~\citepcolor{ho2020denoising, song2020score} generate complex data by transforming noise through a learned denoising process. The forward process corrupts data incrementally as \( x_t = \alpha_t x_0 + \sigma_t \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \). The terms \( \alpha_t \) and \( \sigma_t \) control the noise level at each timestep. At \( t = T \), \( q_t(x_T) \approx \mathcal{N}(0, I) \). The reverse process, parameterized by \( \phi_\theta(x_t, t) \), reconstructs \( x_0 \) from \( x_t \). Sampling starts from \( x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I) \). Training minimizes a weighted denoising loss: 
\begin{equation}
    \mcL = \mathbb{E}_{t \sim \mathcal{U}(0, T), (x_0, x_t) \sim q(x_0, x_t)} \left[ \omega(t) \| \phi_\theta (x_t, t) - x_0 \|^2 \right].
    \label{eqn:diff_loss}
\end{equation}
Equivariant diffusion models enforce symmetry preservation in generative tasks involving transformations like rotations or permutations. The denoiser \( \phi_\theta \) satisfies \( \phi_\theta (g \circ x_t , t) = g \circ \phi_\theta (x_t, t) \) for transformations \( g \) from a symmetry group \( G \). These models are well-suited for applications in structural biology~\citepcolor{corso2024discovery, yim2023se, schneuing2024structure} and molecular modeling~\citepcolor{hoogeboom2022equivariant, guan20233d}, ensuring physically meaningful and interpretable results.
