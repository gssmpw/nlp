\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}
In this paper, we investigate the index construction efficiency of graph-based ANNS methods on modern CPUs, using the representative HNSW index. We identify that low construction efficiency arises from high memory access latency and suboptimal arithmetic operation efficiency in distance computations. We develop three baseline methods incorporating existing compact coding techniques into the HNSW construction process, yielding valuable lessons. This leads to the design of \texttt{Flash}, tailored for the HNSW construction process. \texttt{Flash} reduces random memory accesses and leverages SIMD instructions, improving cache hits and arithmetic operations. Extensive evaluations confirm \texttt{Flash}'s superiority in accelerating graph indexing while maintaining or enhancing search performance. {We also apply \texttt{Flash} to other graph indexes, optimized HNSW implementations, and various SIMD instruction sets to verify its generality.}
