At present, the use of clustering for the analysis of in-game data has been more commonly used in the game industry. Past research has typically focused on the analysis of player behavior using clustered data (Bauckhage et al., 2015). These uses include the identification and classification of player behavior as well as player gaming styles (Sifa et al., 2013; Ide \& Hosobe, 2023). There are also papers that use more novel clustering approaches to make a more fine-grained analysis of player behavior data in games, such as Bayesian clustering (Normoyle \& Jensen, 2021). However, there are still no relevant studies that use clustering algorithms to evaluate in-game character design.
