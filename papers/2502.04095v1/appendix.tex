\section{Open-source Evaluation Framework Examples}

Below is an example question whose answer is untrue based on the source document, which does not provide a percentage. The question is also irrelevant from the perspective of a company following the reporting guidelines as it directly asks about some entity rather than how it should report on this metric.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1,label={lst:opensource_eval},caption={Sample MCQ generated using the baseline prompt method}]
"question": "What is the entity's average refrigerant emissions rate?",
    "optionA": "5%",
    "optionB": "10%",
    "optionC": "15%",
    "optionD": "20%",
    "optionE": "25%",
    "answer": "C",
    "industries": [
      "b22-food-retailers-and-distributors"
    ]
\end{lstlisting}

Using LlamaIndex (which uses binary scores), this question was given a score of 1 in both faithfulness and relevance (i.e. the highest score). DeepEval (which uses continuous scores from 0 to 1) scored it 0.9 on faithfulness and 1.0 on relevance. Our custom framework, which contains extra prompt context for how it should measure faithfulness and relevance, scored it 1 in faithfulness and 4 in relevance.
