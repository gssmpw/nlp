We proposed two benchmarks showing that pixel-level MLLMs degraded the ability in VQA and even grounding of fine-grained objects. Thus, our results questioned whether we are heading in the right direction with these models. Additionally, we provide powerful baselines with improved scores without training for pixel-level grounding.
