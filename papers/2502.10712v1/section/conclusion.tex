\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we tackle the critical challenge of generating high-fidelity airfoil geometries that effectively balance expressiveness, smoothness, and resolution flexibility. We introduce \textbf{FuncGenFoil}, a function-space generative model leveraging neural operators and flow matching, which represents airfoils as continuous, smooth geometries without resolution constraints while preserving the expressiveness of data-driven methods. Comprehensive experimental results show that FuncGenFoil outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of label error, diversity, and smoothness, highlighting its potential for high-fidelity airfoil design. Furthermore, the generated wing geometries have been validated through aerodynamic simulations. This work paves the way for more efficient, scalable, and versatile airfoil generation, with significant applications in aerodynamic shape optimization for aircraft manufacturing.
