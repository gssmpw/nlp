Fault prediction in distribution grid insulators is critical for maintaining the reliability and safety of power systems**Schreiber, "Fault Detection in Power Distribution Systems"**. Recent studies have explored various methodologies to predict insulator failures, focusing on analyzing leakage currents, employing ML techniques, and utilizing advanced signal processing methods. A way to identify faults in this context involves monitoring the time series data of the leakage current of insulators under contaminated conditions.

Several authors have applied computer vision-based methods considering convolutional neural networks (CNNs)  for insulator fault identification**Xu, "Convolutional Neural Networks for Fault Detection"**, **Liu, "YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection"**. Prominent in this area is the you only look once (YOLO) model, which was applied in its third generation by**Wang et al., "YOLOv3: An Improved Version of YOLO"**, in the fourth generation by**Zhang et al., "YOLOv4: Improved Object Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks"**, in the fifth generation by**Li et al., "YOLOv5: High-Performance Object Detection"**, considering a hypertuned version by**Kim et al., "Hybrid YOLO Model for Efficient Object Detection"**, or using a hybrid version in**Gupta et al., "Combining CNN and LSTM for Fault Prediction"**. 

**Wang, "Modified YOLO for Edge Devices"** proposed a modified YOLO that can be computed on edge devices. The modification to make the algorithm more efficient was in the backbone of the YOLO. Instead of using a CSPDarknet53 (standard for the YOLO version that they considered), they applied a lightweight network MobilieNetv3. Based on this modification, the proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 0.945 with a speed of 58.5 frames per second. **Liu et al., "Improved Fault Detection using Hybrid Model"** also applied a modified version of YOLO, considering a model called multi-fault insulator detection they achieved an accuracy of 0.939. 


**Kim, "Faster Region CNN for Insulator Fault Detection"** presented an improved faster region CNN for insulator fault detection. They considered preprocessing techniques for image segmentation, reducing the image noise, and having the focus on the insulators, even when complex backgrounds are considered. Based on their model, it was possible to achieve a mean average precision of 0.908 considering glass insulators and 0.917 when composite insulators were evaluated. Based on CNNs, **Lee et al., "Infrared Images for Insulator Defect Diagnosis"** considered infrared images for insulator defect diagnosis. Applications based on CNNs are promising, as they can be handled indirectly (without contact with the electrical network)**Xu et al., "Indirect Fault Detection using CNNs"**, while in the case of leakage current it is necessary to measure the insulators directly, making it a more challenging approach.

**Kim et al., "Leakage Current Analysis for Insulator Contamination"** subjected insulators to saline environments to simulate contamination and analyzed the progression of leakage currents leading up to disruptive discharges. The researchers evaluated several time series forecasting models, including group method of data handling (GMDH), long short-term memory (LSTM), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and various ensemble learning models. They found that integrating wavelet transforms with these models improved prediction accuracy, with the wavelet-ANFIS model achieving the best performance. In **Zhang et al., "Hybrid Time Series Forecasting"** the Christiano-Fitzgerald filter was combined with the GMDH to predict faults in contaminated insulators.

Studies of the contamination process that leads to the development of flashover, such as the one presented by**Li et al., "Contamination Process Modeling for Insulator Faults"** are rarer. Especially when it comes to applications of ML models, as presented by**Gupta et al., "ML Models for Time Series Forecasting"**, or hybrid methods for time series forecasting. In other applications, some authors have researched how to better identify faults based on time series analysis, as presented in Table~\ref{re_w}.
