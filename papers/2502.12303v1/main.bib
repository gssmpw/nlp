year = {2024},
issn = {0360-0300},
abstract = {Estimating depth from single RGB images and videos is of widespread interest due to its applications in many areas, including autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, digital entertainment, and robotics. More than 500 deep learning-based papers have been published in the past 10 years, which indicates the growing interest in the task. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the existing deep learning-based methods, the challenges they address, and how they have evolved in their architecture and supervision methods. It provides a taxonomy for classifying the current work based on their input and output modalities, network architectures, and learning methods. It also discusses the major milestones in the history of monocular depth estimation, and different pipelines, datasets, and evaluation metrics used in existing methods.},

ABSTRACT = {Depth maps produced by LiDAR-based approaches are sparse. Even high-end LiDAR sensors produce highly sparse depth maps, which are also noisy around the object boundaries. Depth completion is the task of generating a dense depth map from a sparse depth map. While the earlier approaches focused on directly completing this sparsity from the sparse depth maps, modern techniques use RGB images as a guidance tool to resolve this problem. Whilst many others rely on affinity matrices for depth completion. Based on these approaches, we have divided the literature into two major categories; unguided methods and image-guided methods. The latter is further subdivided into multi-branch and spatial propagation networks. The multi-branch networks further have a sub-category named image-guided filtering. In this paper, for the first time ever we present a comprehensive survey of depth completion methods. We present a novel taxonomy of depth completion approaches, review in detail different state-of-the-art techniques within each category for depth completion of LiDAR data, and provide quantitative results for the approaches on KITTI and NYUv2 depth completion benchmark datasets.},
