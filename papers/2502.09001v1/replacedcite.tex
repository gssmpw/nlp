\section{Related Work}
Recent advancements in privacy-preserving anomaly detection have focused on federated learning (FL), ensemble models, and homomorphic encryption to secure data while maintaining high detection accuracy. Yang et al.____ developed a federated XGBoost model, effectively balancing privacy and performance in cross-silo anomaly detection by applying differential privacy in decentralized systems.

For addressing imbalanced datasets, Maniriho et al.____ employed SMOTE to balance IoT datasets and improve machine learning model performance for detecting rare malicious events, while Liu et al.____ demonstrated the effectiveness of hybrid SVM-KNN models for capturing diverse anomaly types.

However, federated learning models are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, as Nguyen et al.____ highlighted, proposing strategies to defend FL-based systems in IoT networks from such threats. Shen et al.____ explores using FinBERT and GPT-4o for financial sentiment analysis, showing that GPT-4o with few-shot learning rivals a fine-tuned FinBERT.

These studies collectively highlight innovations in federated learning, ensemble methods, and privacy-enhancing techniques for secure and effective anomaly detection across diverse networks.
