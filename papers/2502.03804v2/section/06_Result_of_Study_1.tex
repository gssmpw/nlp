\section{Results of Study 1}
\red{Here, we first present the quantitative results of Study 1 for each research question. 
Subsequently, we include comments provided by the participants.}
\subsection{Participants' Email-Replying Process (RQ1)}
\label{sec:result1_RQ1}
\subsubsection{Efficiency of Replying to Emails (H1-a)}
\label{sec:result1_efficiency}
First, we compared the efficiency of replying to emails across three conditions.
After checking the data normality assumption with the Shapiro-Wilk test, the result of one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in participants' efficiency of replying to emails across three conditions ($F[2, 22]=14.8$, $p<0.001$\red{, $\eta_p^2=0.57$}). 
Post-hoc analysis with Holm correction revealed that participants' efficiency of replying to emails in the QA-based condition was significantly higher compared to both the No-AI $(t(11), p=0.002\red{, d=1.38})$ and the Prompt-based $(t(11), p=0.046\red{, d=0.65})$ conditions.
Thus, H1-a was supported.
The QA-based approach enhanced participants’ email replying efficiency.
% 次にPrompt Character Countsを計算した
% QA-based < Prompt-based

\subsubsection{Prompt Character Counts (H1-a)}
\label{sec:result1_prompt_character_counts}
In order to understand how participants wrote prompts differently, we calculated the prompt character counts.
After the Shapiro-Wilk test, the paired t-test revealed that participants in the QA-based condition typed significantly fewer characters in their prompts than those in the Prompt-based condition $(t(11), p=0.010\red{, d=0.90})$.

\subsubsection{Cognitive Load for Replying to Emails (H1-b)}
\label{sec:result1_cognitive_load}
% Raw-TLXの計算結果を図1に示す
The results of the Raw-TLX are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_efficiency_and_cognitiveLoad}.
According to the one-way repeated measures ANOVA with Greenhouse-Geisser correction, there was a significant difference in participants' cognitive load for replying to emails among the three conditions $(F[1.1, 12.1]=12.6, p=0.003\red{, \eta_p^2=0.53})$. 
Post-hoc analysis with Holm correction revealed that participants' cognitive load for replying to emails in the QA-based condition was significantly lower compared to both the No-AI $(t(11), p=0.008\red{, d=1.12})$ and Prompt-based $(t(11), p=0.018\red{, d=0.81})$ conditions.
% これらの結果は、H1bの妥当性について示唆している。
Therefore, H1-b was supported.
The QA-based approach reduced participants’ cognitive workload while replying to the emails.

\subsubsection{\red{Difficulty in Understanding Email Content (H1-b)}}
\label{sec:result1_difficulty_in_understanding}
% また、H1-bはアンケート調査の結果によっても裏付けられた
Additionally, H1-b was also supported by the questionnaire survey results (Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire} H1-b).
% easily understand content of email: QA-based > Prompt-based, No-AI
The Friedman test revealed a significant difference among the three conditions in terms of understanding the sender's intent and requests $(\chi^2(2)=10.6, p=0.005\red{, W=0.44})$. 
Post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction showed that participants in the QA-based condition found it significantly easier to understand the sender's intent and requests compared to those in both No-AI $(p=0.003\red{, r=0.61})$ and Prompt-based $(p=0.005\red{, r=0.73})$ conditions.
% system helped decide response strategy: QA-based > Prompt-based
% Furthermore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that participants felt significantly more supported in determining the direction of their responses in the QA-based condition than in the Prompt-based condition $(p=0.010)$.

\subsubsection{Satisfaction with Completing Task (H1-c)}
\label{sec:result1_satisfaction}
The results of the satisfaction with completing participants' tasks are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire}, H1-c.
\red{The two items measuring satisfaction showed high internal consistency, with a Cronbach's Alpha of $0.889$.}
After checking the data normality assumption with the Shapiro-Wilk test, the result of one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in participants' satisfaction with completing tasks across three conditions $(F[2, 22], p<0.001\red{, \eta_p^2=0.79})$. 
Post-hoc analysis with Holm correction revealed that participants' satisfaction with completing tasks in the QA-based condition was significantly higher compared to both the No-AI ($t(11)$, $p<0.001$\red{, $d=2.39$}) and the Prompt-based ($t(11)$, $p=0.029$\red{, $d=0.72$}) conditions.
% Additionally, the result of the Friedman test showed that there was a significant difference in participants' satisfaction with the quality of their email responses across three conditions $(\chi^2(2)=17.6, p<0.001)$. 
% Post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction showed that participants' satisfaction with the quality of their email responses in the QA-based condition was significantly higher compared to the No-AI $(p<0.001)$ condition.
Therefore, H1-c was supported.
The QA-based approach improved participants’ satisfaction with completing their tasks while replying to the emails.

% \subsubsection{\red{Future Preference (H1-c)}}
% \red{
% The questionnaire survey results about participants' future preferences are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire}, in H1-c.
% According to the Friedman test, a significant difference in participants' future preferences was observed among the three conditions $(\chi^2(2)=8.8, p=0.012, W=0.37)$.
% Post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction revealed that participants would prefer responding in the QA-based condition compared to the No-AI condition $(p=0.012, r=0.67)$.
% However, no significant difference was found between the Prompt-based and QA-based conditions $(p=0.800, r=0.27)$.
% }

\subsubsection{Difficulty in Initiating the Action for Replying to Emails (H1-d)}
\label{sec:result1_initiating}
% felt high barrier: QA-based < Prompt-based, No-AI
The questionnaire survey results about participants' difficulty in initiating the action for replying to emails are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire}, in H1-d.
According to the Friedman test, a significant difference in participants' difficulty in initiating the action for replying to emails was observed among the three conditions $(\chi^2(2)=19.8, p<0.001\red{, W=0.83})$.
Post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction revealed that participants in the QA-based condition perceived significantly higher barriers to initiating email response tasks than those in the No-AI $(p<0.001\red{, r=0.85})$ and Prompt-based $(p<0.001\red{, r=0.68})$ conditions.
% This result suggests the validity of H1-c, which ResQ lowers the barriers to initiating email response tasks.
Therefore, H1-d was supported.
The QA-based approach reduced participants’ difficulty in initiating the action to reply to emails.

\subsubsection{Sense of Agency and Control (H1-e)}
\label{sec:result1_agency}
% agency, control: QA-based < Prompt-based, No-AI
The questionnaire survey results about a sense of agency and control are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire}, H1-e.
The Friedman test revealed a significant difference among the three conditions for both the sense of agency $(\chi^2(2)=22.8, p<0.001\red{, W=0.95})$ and the sense of control $(\chi^2(2)=21.3, p<0.001$, $\red{W=0.89})$. 
Post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction showed that participants in the QA-based condition found that it significantly reduced their sense of agency compared to both the No-AI $(p<0.001\red{, r=0.88})$ and the Prompt-based $(p<0.001\red{, r=0.77})$ conditions.
Additionally, post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction showed that participants in the QA-based condition experienced a significantly reduction in their sense of control compared to both the No-AI $(p<0.001\red{, r=0.88})$ and the Prompt-based $(p=0.006\red{, r=0.56})$ conditions.
Thus, H1-e was supported.
The QA-based approach reduced participants’ sense of agency and sense of control while replying to the emails.

\subsection{Quality of the Email Responses (RQ2)}
\label{sec:result1_RQ2}
\subsubsection{Perceived Quality of the Email by Evaluators (H2)}
\label{sec:result1_quality}
In Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire}, H2 shows the results regarding the quality of the emails.
\red{The Cronbach's Alpha of three items measuring the perceived quality of the email is $0.846$.}
% \red{The three items measuring the perceived quality of the email demonstrated high internal consistency, with a Cronbach's Alpha of $0.846$.}
After checking the data normality assumption with the Shapiro-Wilk test, the result of one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in the perceived quality of the email across three conditions $(F[2, 22]=9.1, p=0.001\red{, \eta_p^2=0.45})$. 
Post-hoc analysis with Holm correction revealed that the perceived quality of the emails participants wrote in the QA-based condition was significantly higher compared to the No-AI $(t(11), p=0.005\red{, d=1.21})$ condition.
Thus, H2 was partially supported.
The QA-based approach improved the quality of the email responses compared to the No-AI condition.

\red{Tab.~\ref{tab_study1_quality_of_emails} shows the detailed results regarding the perceived quality of the emails across three evaluation dimensions (politeness, readability, and meeting demands).
These results further supported the partial acceptance of H2, showing that the AI-assisted approach tended to improve the email quality.} 
% of email responses across all dimensions.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% According to the Friedman test, a significant difference was observed among the three conditions $(\chi^2(2)=17.6, p<0.001)$.
% As a post hoc test, the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction was conducted.
% The results indicated that, compared to the No-AI condition, both the AI-assisted QA-based $(p=0.007)$ and Prompt-based $(p=0.012)$ conditions produced significantly higher-quality responses.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Relationship between Participants and Their Counterpart (RQ3)}
\label{sec:result1_RQ3}
\subsubsection{Perceived Impression of Participants by Evaluators (H3-a)}
\label{sec:result1_impression}
The results of the perceived impression of the participants rated by another group of evaluators are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire} H3-a.
\red{The two items assessing participants' impression as email senders showed high internal consistency, with a Cronbach's Alpha of $0.946$.}
After checking the data normality assumption with the Shapiro-Wilk test, the result of one-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that there was a significant difference in impression of the participants as an email sender across three conditions $(F[2, 22]=5.9, p=0.009\red{, \eta_p^2=0.35})$. 
Post-hoc analysis with Holm correction revealed that participants' impression in the QA-based condition was not significantly higher compared to both the No-AI $(t(11), p=0.058\red{, d=0.79})$ and the Prompt-based $(t(11), p=0.939\red{, d=0.02})$ conditions.
% no-AIとQA-basedには差がありそうということを書くべきか？
Thus, H3-a was not supported.
The QA-based approach didn't improve the impression of participants as email senders.
% Although there was no statistically significant difference in participants' impressions between the QA-based and No-AI conditions $(p=0.058)$, the effect size was large $(d=0.79)$. 
% This suggests that while the difference did not reach statistical significance, there is still a meaningful difference in the impression of participants as email senders between these conditions.

\subsubsection{Psychological Distance between Participants and Their Counterpart (H3-b)}
\label{sec:result1_psychological_distance}
The IOS result is shown in \red{Fig.~\ref{fig_study1_questionnaire}}.
The Friedman test showed a significant difference in psychological distance among the three conditions $(\chi^2(2)=7.47, p=0.024\red{, W=0.31})$.
Post-hoc analysis using the Durbin-Conover test with Holm correction revealed that IOS in the No-AI condition was significantly higher than in the QA-based condition $(p=0.021\red{, r=0.51})$. 
% この結果はH3-bを部分的に支持するが、Prompt-based条件とQA-based条件の間には有意差がないことから、完全には支持されなかった
This result partially supports H3-b; however, because there was no significant difference between the Prompt-based and QA-based conditions \red{$(p=0.053, r=0.30)$}, H3-b was partially supported.


\subsection{\red{Qualitative Feedback}}
\label{sec:result1_interview}
\red{This section synthesizes qualitative feedback to provide further insights into participants' experiences across three conditions.
The interview comments were translated from Japanese into English.}
\subsubsection{\red{Participants' Email-Replying Process (RQ1)}}
\label{sec:result1_interview_RQ1}
\red{Feedback from participants confirmed that the QA-based condition functioned as expected, contributing to improvements in efficiency, a reduction in workload, and a lowering of barriers to task initiation compared to the other conditions.
\begin{enumerate}[]
    \item \textit{``In the QA-based condition, AI summarized key points through questions and highlighted relevant sections of the email body, which facilitated my understanding of the email and reduced my overall burden''} [P10].
    \item \textit{``In the QA-based condition, I could easily obtain the desired output even without the technical skills to create prompts''} [P6].
    \item \textit{``By saving the time needed to read the counterpart's text, the psychological barrier to starting the task was lowered''} [P5].
\end{enumerate}}

\red{On the other hand, we found that the QA-based condition led to a reduced sense of agency and control compared to the other conditions.
\begin{enumerate}[]
    \item \textit{``Since the AI prompted me with questions at the beginning, the mental effort required to start thinking about the task was eliminated, reducing the stress associated with initiating the work''} [P10].
    \item \textit{``By saving the time needed to read the counterpart's text, the psychological barrier to starting the task was lowered''} [P5].
\end{enumerate}}

\red{This aspect was also found to have the potential to negatively impact users' willingness to adopt the system in the future.
Participants noted that they preferred the QA-based condition \textit{``when time is limited or speed is important''} [P4] or \textit{when the email is of low importance''} [P5], but in other situations, they favored writing responses themselves.}

\subsubsection{\red{Quality of the Email Responses (RQ2)}}
\label{sec:result1_interview_RQ2}
% ほとんどの参加者は、AIを使うと、構造・丁寧さ・言葉遣いが改善され、全体的に良い文章を書けたと述べた
% また参加者は、「Prompt-based条件だと、相手の要求を見落としていたかもしれないが、QA-based条件では自信を持って返信を作成することができた」 [P2]と述べた
% さらにある参加者は、「QA-based条件では、回答してもしなくても良いこと「XXの件、承知しました、など。」にも丁寧に返答を書いてくれた」 [P9]と述べ、QA-based条件によってメールの丁寧さが向上したことを強調した
\red{All participants stated that using AI improved their writing structure, politeness, and choice of words, ultimately enabling them to produce better overall responses. 
Furthermore, participants remarked, \textit{``Under the prompt-based condition, I might have overlooked the recipient's requests, but under the QA-based condition, I was able to craft responses with confidence''} [P2]. 
Additionally, one participant emphasized that \textit{``Under the QA-based condition, the AI even provided polite responses to matters where a reply was optional, such as acknowledging something with phrases like 'I Understood regarding XX, etc.'''} [P9], highlighting how the QA-based condition scaffolded user to construct a polite email in a formal setting.}
% enhanced the politeness of email communication.}

\subsubsection{Relationship between Participants and Their Counterpart (RQ3)}
\label{sec:result1_interview_RQ3}
% 参加者は、``相手との間に知覚する心理的距離は労力に比例した''と報告し、PXXは``特にQA-based条件では選択肢を選ぶだけだった相手のことを考えることが少なかった''と報告した。
% 一方でPXXは、``自分で返信を考えるより、AIを使うと相手に良い印象を与えられるメッセージを作ることができたので、関係性を近く感じた''と報告した
\red{Participants shared differing views on how AI's involvement affected their psychological distance from their counterparts.
P2, P9, and P11 reported that the psychological distance they felt from the other person was directly related to the amount of effort they put in.
Furthermore, P6 noted that \textit{``especially under QA-based condition, I barely thought about the counterpart because I only selected options to create responses.''}
In contrast, P8 reported that \textit{``compared to composing replies myself, using AI allowed me to create messages that left a better impression on my counterpart, which made the relationship feel closer.''}
These results suggested that, on the one hand, AI's mediation can potentially increase the psychological distance between senders and receivers. 
On the other hand, it can also diminish the perceived distance from the sender due to effective impression management. Thus, we conducted a field study to further clarify the impact of AI on interpersonal relationships.}
% These results suggested that while a reduction in cognitive load may decrease participants' psychological engagement with their counterparts, the perceived improvement in communication quality could, conversely, foster a greater sense of closeness in the relationship.}

% % 返信作業が楽にはなりましたが、メールを細部まで読まなくなり、内容が頭に入っていない感じがしたので、将来使いたいとは思いませんでした。[P11]
% \red{Participants expressed a preference for using the QA-based condition for email responses, citing increased efficiency, reduced workload, and the ability to produce high-quality emails as the primary reasons. 
% One participant explained, \textit{``Using AI allowed me to compose high-quality responses faster than if I had written them myself. The effect was particularly significant in the QA-based condition, which is why I would prefer to use it in the future''} [P6].}
% \red{However, some participants were hesitant to adopt the QA-based condition due to concerns about a reduced sense of agency or over-reliance on AI.
