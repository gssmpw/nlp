\red{Replying to formal emails is time-consuming and cognitively demanding, as it requires crafting polite phrasing and providing an adequate response to the sender's demands.}
% \red{Replying to formal emails, which often takes time to understand and require polite phrasing, is time-consuming and cognitively demanding.}
Although systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) were designed to simplify the email replying process, users still need to provide detailed prompts to obtain the expected output.
Therefore, we proposed and evaluated an \red{LLM-powered question-and-answer (QA)-based approach} for users to reply to emails by answering a set of simple and short questions generated from the incoming email.
We developed a prototype system, \textit{ResQ}, and conducted controlled and field experiments with 12 and \red{8} participants.
Our results demonstrated that \red{the QA-based approach} improves the efficiency of replying to emails and reduces workload while maintaining email quality, compared to a conventional prompt-based approach that requires users to craft appropriate prompts to obtain email drafts.
We discuss how \red{the QA-based approach} influences the email reply process and interpersonal relationship dynamics, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with using a QA-based approach in AI-mediated communication.

  \caption{In our system, (1) users receive an email, (2) communicate their intentions by answering AI-generated questions, (3) receive an AI-generated draft, (4) make any necessary revisions, and finally (5) send the reply.  This process allows users to craft responses efficiently, reducing their overall workload.}
  \Description{This figure illustrates the five stages of using our proposed system. First, the user receives an email on their computer, marking the beginning of the workflow. In the second stage, the user answers a set of predefined questions related to the email, which can include options like "YES" or "NO" as well as multiple-choice selections (A, B, C). Based on the user's responses, the AI then generates a draft of the email reply in the third stage. In the fourth stage, the user reviews the AI-generated draft, checking for errors or making revisions as needed. Finally, in the fifth stage, the user sends the revised email reply, completing the process.}
