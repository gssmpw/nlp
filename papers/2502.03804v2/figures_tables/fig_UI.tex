\Description{This figure illustrates the user interface of the Gmail reply box as enhanced by the prototype system. The Reply with AI button, shown in blue on the right-hand side of the toolbar, allows users to activate the AI-assisted reply generation feature. When the button is clicked, the system extracts the email content and opens the window shown in Fig.~\ref{fig_interface}. The standard Gmail toolbar options, such as send, formatting, and attachment icons, remain.}
