\Description{This figure represents the "Inclusion of Other in the Self (IOS)" scale, which is used to measure psychological closeness or relational intimacy. The diagram depicts two circles, labeled "Self" and "Other," with varying degrees of overlap. Participants were asked to choose the level of overlap that best represented their relationship with another person. On the far left (score 1), the circles are completely separate, indicating a significant psychological distance between the self and the other. In the middle (score 4), the circles partially overlap, suggesting a moderate level of psychological closeness. On the far right (score 7), the circles almost completely overlap, representing a very close and intimate relationship between the self and the other.}
