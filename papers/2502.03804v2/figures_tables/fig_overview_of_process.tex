\caption{The overview of the process of creating a reply message using ResQ. A) The LLM first generates multiple-choice questions in JSON format. B) Users select their desired responses to their counterparts. C) The LLM then generates a reply draft in JSON format based on the users' selections. D) Finally, users review and edit the LLM-generated draft before sending the reply.}

\Description{This figure illustrates the process of generating an email reply using a large language model (LLM) across four stages. In Stage A (Generate Questions), the system takes the email data and a prompt, which are then sent to the LLM server. The server processes this information and generates a set of questions to clarify the content of the reply. These questions, along with possible answer choices and context, are returned in JSON format. In Stage B (Answer Questions), the user is presented with the questions generated by the LLM. These questions may include simple "Yes" or "No" options or multiple-choice selections. The user answers the questions by choosing the appropriate options or providing custom responses. In Stage C (Generate Reply Draft), the userâ€™s answers, along with the original email data and prompt, are sent back to the LLM server. Based on this input, the server generates a draft of the email reply, which is also returned in JSON format. In Stage D (Check Reply Draft), the user reviews the draft generated by the LLM. After checking the content and making any necessary revisions, the user finalizes and sends the email reply.}
