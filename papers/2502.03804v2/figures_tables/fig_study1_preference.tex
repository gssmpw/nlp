\Description{The figure displays participants' future preferences using box plots for three experimental conditions: No-AI, Prompt-based, and QA-based. For the No-AI condition, the median overlap score is 3.5, with the first quartile at 1.75 and the third quartile at 4.25. The scores range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 7. For the Prompt-based condition, the median overlap score is 6, with the first quartile at 3 and the third quartile at 7. The scores range from 2 to 7. For the QA-based condition, the median overlap score is 6, with the first quartile at 6 and the third quartile at 7. The scores range from 3 to 7. Significant differences were observed between the No-AI condition and both the Prompt-based and QA-based conditions (p < 0.05).}
