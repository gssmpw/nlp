\Description{The table presents the comparative evaluation of three methods, No-AI, Prompt-based, and QA-based, in terms of three key attributes: Politeness, Readability, and Meeting Demands. The results are displayed as mean scores with standard deviations. For Politeness, the No-AI method received a mean score of 4.39 ± 1.00, indicating lower politeness levels compared to the AI-based methods. The Prompt-based approach showed a significant improvement, scoring 5.65 ± 0.56, slightly outperforming the QA-based method, which scored 5.49 ± 0.51. In terms of Readability, the No-AI method achieved a score of 5.24 ± 0.79, again falling behind the AI-based methods. The Prompt-based approach scored 5.65 ± 0.69, while the QA-based method scored the highest at 5.78 ± 0.49, reflecting the most consistently readable outputs among the three. Finally, for Meeting Demands, the No-AI method scored 5.19 ± 0.76, which is comparatively lower than the AI-enhanced methods. The Prompt-based approach performed better with a score of 5.68 ± 0.60, but the QA-based method emerged as the best performer in this category, scoring 5.88 ± 0.60.}
