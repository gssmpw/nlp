\caption{\red{Backgrounds of participants in Study 2, including age, gender, job roles, frequency of AI tool usage, and use of AI for email purposes.}}
\Description{The table outlines the demographic information and AI usage patterns of nine participants in Study 2, including their age, gender, job roles, general AI tool usage, and the extent to which they utilize AI for email-related tasks. The participants include university students and office workers, with a mix of both male and female representatives, and their AI adoption varies from frequent to rare use. Participant P1 is a 28-year-old male office worker who uses AI tools daily, with 20–50\% of his email tasks supported by AI. P2, a 24-year-old female university student, frequently uses AI tools but does not employ them for email-related purposes. Similarly, P3, a 20-year-old female university student, frequently uses AI tools, with 20–50\% of her email tasks facilitated by AI. Participant P4, a 24-year-old female university student, engages in daily AI tool usage, relying on AI for 50–80\% of her email activities. P5, a 31-year-old male office worker, also uses AI tools daily, supporting 20–50\% of his email tasks. Likewise, P6, a 39-year-old female office worker, uses AI tools daily, with AI assisting in 20–50\% of her email-related tasks. In contrast, Participant P7, a 25-year-old male university student, rarely uses AI tools and does not employ them for email-related purposes. P8, a 23-year-old female office worker, frequently uses AI tools but applies them to less than 20\% of her email tasks. Lastly, P9, a 38-year-old male office worker, rarely engages with AI tools, with AI playing a role in less than 20\% of his email-related tasks.}
