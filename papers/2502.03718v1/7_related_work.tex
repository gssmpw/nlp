\noindent \textbf{Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection.} Various studies and tools have been proposed to detect hidden vulnerabilities in smart contracts to prevent asset loss for users. Static analysis tools like Slither~\cite{feist2019slither}, SAILFISH~\cite{bose2022sailfish},  Securify~\cite{tsankov2018securify}, VETEOS~\cite{liveteos}, and Ethainter~\cite{brent2020ethainter} analyze source code or bytecode. Gigahorse~\cite{grech2019gigahorse, grech2022elipmoc}  and MadMax~\cite{grech2018madmax} offer a decompilation framework that translates bytecode to a custom IR. AVVERIFIER~\cite{sun2024all} performs taint analysis by simulating the process of EVM stack execution. Symbolic execution tools like Mythril~\cite{mythril}, Oyente~\cite{luu2016making}, ETHBMC~\cite{frank2020ethbmc}, EOSAFE~\cite{he2021eosafe} and Manticore~\cite{mossberg2019manticore} explore potentially vulnerable paths using constraint solvers. Dynamic analysis approaches, such as fuzzing tools~\cite{jiang2018contractfuzzer, grieco2020echidna, manes2018fuzzing, choi2021smartian, shou2023ityfuzz, wustholz2020harvey, he2019learning, ye2023detecting}, generate random inputs or reorder historical transaction sequences to test contracts. Furthermore, GPTScan~\cite{sun2024gptscan} leverages large language models~\cite{he2024large} to localize vulnerabilities by defining vulnerability scenarios.


\noindent \textbf{Price Manipulation Detection.} Price manipulation attacks have long posed a serious threat to the DeFi ecosystem. Existing tools like DeFiRange\cite{wu2023defiranger}, DeFiGuard~\cite{wang2024defiguard}, and FlashSyn~\cite{chen2024flashsyn} detect such attacks based on transaction information. DeFiTainter~\cite{kong2023defitainter} starts from contract bytecode, using cross-contract taint analysis to explore all execution paths and locate entry points of vulnerable functions.


\noindent \textbf{Attack Contract Identification.} Attackers increasingly prefer to launch attacks through contracts. Su \textit{et al.}~\cite{su2021evil} collect key threat intelligence related to DApp attack incidents through measurements and implement an automated tool for large-scale discovery of attack incidents. Forta~\cite{forta} and Lookahead~\cite{ren2024lookahead} extract statistical features of attack contracts and train machine learning models to develop classifiers. Yang \textit{et al.}~\cite{yang2024uncover} construct call chains from attack contracts to victim contracts and locate vulnerable functions based on the characteristics of reentrancy attacks.
