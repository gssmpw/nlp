\noindent \textbf{Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection.} Various studies and tools have been proposed to detect hidden vulnerabilities in smart contracts to prevent asset loss for users. Static analysis tools like Slither____, SAILFISH____,  Securify____, VETEOS____, and Ethainter____ analyze source code or bytecode. Gigahorse____  and MadMax____ offer a decompilation framework that translates bytecode to a custom IR. AVVERIFIER____ performs taint analysis by simulating the process of EVM stack execution. Symbolic execution tools like Mythril____, Oyente____, ETHBMC____, EOSAFE____ and Manticore____ explore potentially vulnerable paths using constraint solvers. Dynamic analysis approaches, such as fuzzing tools____, generate random inputs or reorder historical transaction sequences to test contracts. Furthermore, GPTScan____ leverages large language models____ to localize vulnerabilities by defining vulnerability scenarios.


\noindent \textbf{Price Manipulation Detection.} Price manipulation attacks have long posed a serious threat to the DeFi ecosystem. Existing tools like DeFiRange____, DeFiGuard____, and FlashSyn____ detect such attacks based on transaction information. DeFiTainter____ starts from contract bytecode, using cross-contract taint analysis to explore all execution paths and locate entry points of vulnerable functions.


\noindent \textbf{Attack Contract Identification.} Attackers increasingly prefer to launch attacks through contracts. Su \textit{et al.}____ collect key threat intelligence related to DApp attack incidents through measurements and implement an automated tool for large-scale discovery of attack incidents. Forta____ and Lookahead____ extract statistical features of attack contracts and train machine learning models to develop classifiers. Yang \textit{et al.}____ construct call chains from attack contracts to victim contracts and locate vulnerable functions based on the characteristics of reentrancy attacks.
