\section{Outlook} \label{sec:Outlook}
In this work, we investigated the effects of rotational accelerations on the orientation estimation for different sensor fusion algorithms using an \ac{IMU}.
We showed that this leads to non-minimum phase systems, which are known to be challenging when designing stabilizing feedback laws. 
Further, we analyzed how common filter methods behave in this case and how appropriate parameter tuning can mitigate these effects.
However, mitigation comes at the cost of a reduced filter bandwidth, leading to slower rejection of other disturbances and initial estimation errors.
Finally, we validated our theoretical findings on a real system by showing that the performance of the closed loop can deteriorate significantly if the filter is not properly tuned to mitigate angular accelerations.
Hence, the controller and filter cannot be designed independently.
Moreover, it may be interesting to investigate the effect of additional magnetometer measurements and how different adaptive filtering algorithms behave.
