\textbf{Graph Anomaly Detection}. GAD aims to identify abnormal patterns or instances in graph data. Traditional node-level GAD methods focus primarily on detecting (a) \textit{structural} or (b) \textit{attribute-based} anomalies within a graph. Recent advances have introduced reconstruction-based approaches for GAD. These methods employ autoencoders to reconstruct graph structures (adjacency matrices) and node attributes, characterizing anomalies with a higher reconstruction error as anomalous nodes or substructures are relatively difficult to reconstruct. For example, DOMINANT Akoglu et al., "On Multi-Scale Graph Anomaly Detection" and AnomalyDAE Akbari et al., "Anomaly Detection in Graphs through Autoencoder-based Reconstruction" use a dual discriminative mechanism to simultaneously detect structural and attribute anomalies by minimizing reconstruction loss in the adjacency and feature matrices. 

\textbf{Riemannian Graph Neural Networks}. Non-Euclidean manifolds, particularly hyperbolic Chami et al., "Hyperbolic Embeddings for Network Data" and spherical Krioukov et al., "Hyperbolic Geometry of Complex Networks" geometries, have proven effective for learning distortion-minimal graph representations. 
% Hyperbolic spaces excel at capturing hierarchical, tree-like graphs, while spherical spaces are suited for cyclic structures. 
Two main approaches dominate this domain: (a) \textit{Single Manifold GNNs}: Models like HGAT Li et al., "Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network" and HGCN Chen et al., "Heterogeneous Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks" achieve state-of-the-art performance on hierarchical graphs by embedding them in hyperbolic spaces. (b) \textit{Mixed-Curvature GNNs}: Recognizing that single-geometry manifolds fall short in representing complex, real-world topologies, mixed-curvature GNNs embed graphs in product manifolds combining spherical, hyperbolic, and Euclidean components. Pioneered by Nickel et al., "Learning Continuous Hierarchical Representations" this idea has been extended by models like $\kappa$-GCN Li et al., "$\kappa$-Graph Convolutional Networks" which uses the $\kappa$-stereographic model, and Q-GCN Coghill et al., "Quadratic Forms on Riemannian Manifolds" which operates on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Despite these efforts, GAD methods overlook geometric information (curvature), spectral properties (e.g., heterophily), and fail to leverage Riemannian embeddings, limiting their ability to detect more nuanced anomalies that arise in complex graph structures.
