\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI agents in debt collection negotiations (DCN), addressing both the negotiation process and its outcomes. By leveraging synthetic debt data generated through CTGAN, we evaluated various AI-driven strategies, focusing on improving debt recovery rate and efficiency. Our enhanced LLM-based multi-agent framework, which incorporates Planning and Judging modules, demonstrated significant improvements in negotiation performance. Additionally, the application of DPO with reject sampling helped optimize the agentsâ€™ focus on key objectives, leading to better results on the Qwen2.5-7B model. This work provides valuable insights into the use of AI in financial negotiations and lays the groundwork for future advancements in AI-assisted debt collection.
