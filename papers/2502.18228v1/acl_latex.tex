\begin{abstract}
Debt collection negotiations (DCN) are vital for managing non-performing loans (NPLs) and reducing creditor losses. Traditional methods are labor-intensive, while large language models (LLMs) offer promising automation potential. However, prior systems lacked dynamic negotiation and real-time decision-making capabilities. This paper explores LLMs in automating DCN and proposes a novel evaluation framework with 13 metrics across 4 aspects. Our experiments reveal that LLMs tend to over-concede compared to human negotiators. To address this, we propose the \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent \textbf{De}bt \textbf{N}egotiation \textbf{(MADeN)} framework, incorporating planning and judging modules to improve decision rationality. We also apply post-training techniques, including DPO with rejection sampling, to optimize performance. Our studies provide valuable insights for practitioners and researchers seeking to enhance efficiency and outcomes in this domain.
% Debt collection negotiations (DCN) are a crucial aspect of the financial industry, particularly in addressing non-performing loans (NPLs) and minimizing losses for creditors. Traditional debt collection methods are labor-intensive, and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer promising potential for automating these negotiations. However, previous automated debt collection systems lacked the capacity for dynamic negotiation and real-time decision-making. This paper explores the use of LLMs in supporting AI agents for conducting DCN and proposes a novel evaluation framework for assessing their performance. We introduce a synthetic debt dataset and a comprehensive evaluation system consisting of \textbf{13} metrics across 4 dimensions, including the negotiation process and outcomes. Our experiments show that LLMs tend to make excessive concessions compared to human negotiators. To address this, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent \textbf{De}bt \textbf{N}egotiation \textbf{(MADeN)} framework with two key modules: planning and judging, which improve negotiation efficiency and recovery outcomes. Additionally, we explore the use of post-training techniques such as DPO with rejection sampling to optimize model performance. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in negotiation outcomes and decision rationality, contributing to the advancement of AI-powered debt collection negotiations.
% Debt collection is a complex process that requires balancing efficiency, debtor satisfaction, and ethical considerations. This study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to optimize debt collection communication through a multi-objective perspective. By leveraging LLMs, we aim to improve the effectiveness of communication strategies, ensure fairness and empathy in debtor interactions, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. We propose a framework that integrates multi-objective decision-making techniques with LLM-driven communication, evaluating its performance across metrics such as resolution rates, response sentiment, and stakeholder satisfaction. The findings highlight the advantages and challenges of employing LLMs in real-world debt collection scenarios, providing valuable insights for practitioners and researchers seeking to enhance outcomes in this domain.

\section*{Limitations}
We study the performance and improvement methods of large models in debt collection negotiations. To simplify the research process and capture key negotiation points, we reduce the debtorâ€™s financial information to variables like assets, average income, and average expenses. However, real-world financial situations are more complex, involving factors like cash flow issues and income fluctuations during repayment. Future work should involve more detailed simulations of debtor information and comparisons with manually simulated debtors. Additionally, due to time constraints, our creditor Multi-agent framework is relatively simple. In practical applications, stricter classification processes in \textit{planning} and more standardized methods in \textit{judging} are needed. We aim to integrate existing decision models to further optimize decision-making in the dialogue.
\section*{Ethical Considerations} \label{EC}
Our study does not disclose any real client information. The acquisition of the source data was subject to strict approval by a major internet financial institution, and the process was continuously supervised by relevant personnel. All debt-related data are processed and replaced with synthetic values, and names are substituted with the pseudonym ``Zhang San''. For the debt reasons extracted from collection dialogues, we strictly anonymize any sensitive details and provide generalized summaries, ensuring that no specific information is involved. Each final data entry underwent rigorous manual verification. Additionally, the methodology proposed in this paper is exploratory and based on simulation for research purposes. Prior to its application in real-world debt collection involving actual individuals, it will undergo more rigorous validation and approval processes.

We conducted annotation tasks in two areas: scoring for the Dialogue Soundness metric (Section~\ref{sec:eval}) and comparison with the human baseline as a debt collector (Section~\ref{sec:res}). Five graduate students with engineering backgrounds and two professionals with financial industry experience participated (They are all from China, as our study focuses on the Chinese language). All annotators involved in our study have signed a disclaimer acknowledging the terms and conditions associated with their participation. They were recruited through campus forums and the internal annotation program of the company. The annotation tasks did not involve any sensitive information and posed no risk. Compensation was provided according to the time spent on each task.
