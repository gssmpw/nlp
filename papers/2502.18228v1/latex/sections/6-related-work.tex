\textbf{Debt Collection. }Debt collection is a labor-intensive and complex task. Previous research has primarily focused on using machine learning algorithms to identify optimal decisions for individual debtors based on large-scale data  \citep{Sancarlos2023TowardsAD,Jankowski2024DebtCM,Johan2022FinancialTC,Onar2019ADS}. However, these decisions are not made in real time and often require complex decision-making processes and multiple rounds of human negotiation. On the other hand, some automated debt collection dialogue models \citep{Floatbot2023GenerativeAI,Yahiya2024AutomatedDR} can only perform tasks such as information tracking and reminders, without the ability to engage in negotiations for specific goals. Our study aims to enable models to autonomously conduct negotiations and make real-time decisions, which can significantly enhance the efficiency of debt collection.

\textbf{Large Language Models in Negotiation. }In previous studies on large-scale negotiation models (including bargaining \citep{xia2024measuringbargainingabilitiesllms}, repeated games~\citep{akata2023playingrepeatedgameslarge,fu2023improvinglanguagemodelnegotiation} and social decision-making~\citep{10.5555/3618408.3619525}), the goals of the negotiators or gamers were clear, and there were clear methods for measuring the results. Debt collection is an information asymmetry game. Except for loan information, all other information is private information. How to model private information and evaluate the effectiveness of negotiation results are both difficult aspects to consider in modeling.

\textbf{AI Agents. }The memory, planning, reasoning, and communication capabilities of large-scale LLMs offer significant potential for the development of autonomous AI agents (\citealp{autogpt}; \citealp{park2023generative}; \citealp{liang2023encouraging};  \citealp{10.1162/tacl_a_00642}; \citealp{wang2025largelanguagemodelstruly}). Its potential has been demonstrated through the creation of a simulated town~\citep{park2023generative}, populated with independent agents who assume distinct roles and autonomously engage in social interactions.
