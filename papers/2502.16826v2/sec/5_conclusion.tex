\section{Conclusions}
Despite a significant amount of research effort, denoising of 3D point cloud remains a fundamental and challenging problem. The proposed Noise2Score3D framework presents a novel and effective approach for unsupervised point cloud denoising utilizing Tweedieâ€™s formula and AR-DAE based score function estimation. Experimental results show that our model achieves competitive denoising performance across various noise conditions and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in terms of Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics. Moreover, our proposed $TV_{PC}$ metric enables estimation of unknown noise parameters, enhancing the method's applicability in real world scenarios. Future works include further explore its generalization capabilities, for example extending to  color point clouds and more realistic noise setup. Another direction is to expand the method to other tasks, e.g. point cloud upsampling and completion with the estimated score field. We believe that our approach can inspire future research in point cloud denoising and the application of Bayesian methods in 3D data processing.
