\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we introduced CoKnowledge, a proof-of-concept tool designed to facilitate the assimilation of collective knowledge in online science videos. Insights from the \hyperref[formative-study]{Formative Study} informed a subsequent \hyperref[content-analysis]{Content Analysis}, which examined the patterns embedded in viewer-generated time-synced comments.
This led to the development of an NLP pipeline for processing danmaku, integrated within an interactive user interface. Results from a within-subject study demonstrated that CoKnowledge significantly enhanced viewers' comprehension and recall of collective knowledge, outperforming an interface displaying unprocessed danmaku in their original forms. We also analyzed usage patterns and gathered feedback on specific design features, guiding the formulation of design recommendations for future tools aimed at supporting knowledge assimilation. Additionally, we encouraged future investigation into the knowledge potential of danmaku.
