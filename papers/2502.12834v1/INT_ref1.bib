abstract = {Congestion control (CC) is the key to achieving ultra-low latency, high bandwidth and network stability in high-speed networks. From years of experience operating large-scale and high-speed RDMA networks, we find the existing high-speed CC schemes have inherent limitations for reaching these goals. In this paper, we present HPCC (High Precision Congestion Control), a new high-speed CC mechanism which achieves the three goals simultaneously. HPCC leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to obtain precise link load information and controls traffic precisely. By addressing challenges such as delayed INT information during congestion and overreac-tion to INT information, HPCC can quickly converge to utilize free bandwidth while avoiding congestion, and can maintain near-zero in-network queues for ultra-low latency. HPCC is also fair and easy to deploy in hardware. We implement HPCC with commodity programmable NICs and switches. In our evaluation, compared to DCQCN and TIMELY, HPCC shortens flow completion times by up to 95\%, causing little congestion even under large-scale incasts.},

abstract = {Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the problem of deploying various network service instances over geographically distributed data centers and providing inter-connectivity among them. The goal is to enable the network traffic to flow smoothly through the underlying network, resulting in an optimal quality of experience to the end-users. Proper chaining of network functions leads to optimal utilization of distributed resources. This has been a de-facto model in the telecom industry with network functions deployed over underlying hardware. Though this model has served the telecom industry well so far, it has been adapted mostly to suit the static behavior of network services and service demands due to the deployment of the services directly over physical resources. This results in network ossification with larger delays to the end-users, especially with the data-centric model in which the computational resources are moving closer to end users. A novel networking paradigm, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), meets the user demands dynamically and reduces operational expenses (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx), by implementing network functions in the software layer known as virtual network functions (VNFs). VNFs are then interconnected to form a complete end-to-end service, also known as service function chains (SFCs). In this work, we study the problem of deploying service function chains over network function virtualized architecture. Specifically, we study virtual network function placement problem for the optimal SFC formation across geographically distributed clouds. We set up the problem of minimizing inter-cloud traffic and response time in a multi-cloud scenario as an ILP optimization problem, along with important constraints such as total deployment costs and service level agreements (SLAs). We consider link delays and computational delays in our model. The link queues are modeled as M/D/1 (single server/Poisson arrival/deterministic service times) and server queues as M/M/1 (single server/Poisson arrival/exponential service times) based on the statistical analysis. In addition, we present a novel affinity-based approach (ABA) to solve the problem for larger networks. We provide a performance comparison between the proposed heuristic and simple greedy approach (SGA) used in the state-of-the-art systems. Greedy approach has already been widely studied in the literature for the VM placement problem. Especially we compare our proposed heuristic with a greedy approach using first-fit decreasing (FFD) method. By observing the results, we conclude that the affinity-based approach for placing the service functions in the network produces better results compared against the simple greedy (FFD) approach in terms of both, total delays and total resource cost. We observe that with a little compromise (gap of less than 10% of the optimal) in the solution quality (total delays and cost), affinity-based heuristic can solve the larger problem more quickly than ILP.}

abstract = {Technologies that enable network slicing are expected to be a key component of next generation mobile networks. Their promise lies in enabling tenants (such as mobile operators and/or services) to reap the cost and performance benefits of sharing resources while retaining the ability to customize their own allocations. When employing dynamic sharing mechanisms, tenants may exhibit strategic behavior, optimizing their choices in response to those of other tenants. This paper analyzes dynamic sharing in network slicing when tenants support inelastic users with <italic>minimum rate requirements</italic>. We propose a NEtwork Slicing (NES) framework combining: 1) admission control; 2) resource allocation; and 3) user dropping. We model the network slicing system with admitted users as a <italic>NES game</italic>; this is a new class of game where the inelastic nature of the traffic may lead to dropping users whose requirements cannot be met. We show that, as long as admission control guarantees that slices can satisfy the rate requirements of all their users, this game possesses a Nash equilibrium. Admission control policies (a conservative and an aggressive one) are considered, along with a resource allocation scheme and a user dropping algorithm, geared at maintaining the system in Nash equilibria. We analyze our NES framework’s performance in equilibrium, showing that it achieves the same or better utility than static resource partitioning, and bound the difference between NES and the socially optimal performance. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {As plans for network interconnection develop, the problems of internet routing and addressing become increasingly important. In one popular model of internet addressing, a hierarchical form of network and local (within network) address is used, with the source providing only the destination address while the intermediate network(s) and/or Gateways between networks take care of routing packets to that destination by various paths. This and related techniques requiring some form of routing table and knowledge at intermediate nodes are more fully discussed in [1,2,3].This paper considers another technique for internet routing in which the source of internet packets specifies the complete internet route. When the entire route accompanies each internet packet, no routing decisions or tables are required at Gateways, but the packet format is complicated and overhead increases. In particular, the packet must carry a varying number of intermediate addresses depending on the path and destination [4]. This overhead may be reduced by setting up a fixed route with connection tables [1] when a connection is established.},
