% Time-Dependent models often suffer from errors accumulated as time or sequence scales, and so does diffusion models. During the conversion of STDiT models, we initially suffered from such errors, as we could not fix the error provoked by precision conversion, which were repeated and amplified during the multiple sampling steps. To mitigate such error, we implemented a simple additional mlp-based model that narrows the gap between the original model and the converted model. As the dimension of latent output from STDiT is small compared to the final output after VAE, the additional model did not cost demanding amount of resources such as computations, time and additional memory footprints.
