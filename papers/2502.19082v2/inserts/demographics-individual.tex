 P01 & Girl & 16 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & I'm worried I will be judged or attacked for my opinion no matter how passive or considerate I am. & 39 & 27 & 20 \\
 P02 & Boy & 18 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & I'm concerned about my digital footprint being available for all & 47 & 35 & 16 \\
 P03 & Girl & 17 & Asian & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & I am concerned that people may find me bland or they don't care about what I am interested in. I also sometimes worry that my posts won't get as many likes as previous posts. & 42 & 27 & 17 \\
 P04 & Boy & 16 & White & Instagram,\newline{}Twitter & Sharing to much personal information. & 41 & 24 & 13 \\
 P05 & Girl & 16 & Asian & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, TikTok & One on my biggest concerns is safety leaks. Even with apps  like Snapchat it is so easy for your posts to get in the wrong hands. As a young teen I also often feel worried about creepy people online. Lastly, it is hard when there is people I may not want to allow to follow me, but I feel pressured to do so in order to seem cooler and gain more followers. & 41 & 32 & 17 \\
 P06 & Girl & 18 & Asian & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter & People that I know in real life will read it and judge me/treat me differently for what I share, or look down on me for different reasons & 35 & 25 & 23 \\
 P07 & Boy & 14 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter & My biggest concerns or reservation when I share about myself on social media is how people will think of myself and how I look. I have started to make my accounts private so only people I approve can see my posts.  & 45 & 29 & 12 \\
 P08 & Girl & 14 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok & That what I share will be used against me or will be seen by the wrong crowd of people and will be used in malicious ways. & 21 & 23 & 23 \\
 P09 & Girl & 13 & Black & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & People judging me and saying stuff about me & 45 & 38 & 17 \\
 P10 & Girl & 17 & Black & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & I worry about my privacy and how people might react to the information I share. & 41 & 30 & 16 \\
 P11 & NB* & 17 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok, Tumblr, Discord, Reddit & That I’m over sharing or that the people I’m sharing with don’t care. And the need to somehow maximize my life experiences to seem as interesting as possible. & 47 & 34 & 16 \\
 P12 & Boy & 15 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & Worried about future image and people I don’t want accessing my posts seeing them & 43 & 28 & 23 \\
 P13 & Girl & 15 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, TikTok & Creepy people that are stalking me & 46 & 33 & 22 \\
 P14 & Girl & 13 & White, Asian & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter & My main concern for sharing about myself on social media is privacy. Especially in the case of people with malicious motivations gaining access to my accounts, I sometimes feel nervous about posting, even on private accounts. & 45 & 34 & 15 \\
 P15 & NB* & 17 & White & Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter, TikTok & my biggest concern is that people who bullied me in high school see my posts and circulate them and make fun of me. my account has to be public for professional purposes, but i still get scared & 50 & 40 & 18 \\
 P16 & Girl & 15 & Asian & Instagram, BeReal, Reddit, Discord, YouTube & I am kind of anxious that the post won't be "right" so to speak. When I comment, it's normally about something I am passionate about or something that is personal, so I like to keep anonymity (I am still always very respectful regardless.) Many people use editing, and it feels difficult to compete with that and their perfect captions. & 40 & 28 & 20 \\
 P17 & Girl & 16 & White & Instagram,\newline{}BeReal & looking bad, looking too fake, worrying about who is seeing it and what they’re thinking about it, digital footprint, posting too much, etc & 47 & 38 & 15 \\
 P18 & Girl & 18 & Asian & Instagram,\newline{}BeReal & Privacy is my biggest concern. I think it’s mainly the worry about what’s being viewed by who, and the fear that what is shared will stay forever/can be shared to others without my knowledge. I understand that there’s always going to be a lack of privacy when posting in public spaces, but I’d prefer to know if anyone had screenshotted/shared what I have posted. & 42 & 35 & 20 \\
 P19 & Boy & 18 & Asian & Instagram, Twitter, TikTok & Among my biggest concerns with sharing things on social media is the possibility that others may not perceive me the way I want or believe them to. When I post anything, I make sure that nothing about it is embarrassing and that it gives the people who view it the impression that I am mature and self-aware.\newline{}\newline{}Above all, social media has become an important factor in how people present themselves. One of the first things that people explore about someone they meet is their social media profiles; these have become almost essential, for most, as a presentation of their identity. & 43 & 32 & 20 \\
