    % \Description {This diagram represents a multi-phase research study with five stages. The first stage is the screener survey, which has no monetary incentive and involves 47 respondents who take 5 minutes to complete the survey. The second stage is the entry interview, where 20 participants are selected from the survey respondents. They receive \$10 for participating in a 30-minute interview. The third stage is a diary study, involving 19 participants from the entry interview. This stage spans 7 days, where participants are compensated \$25 and are required to spend at least 10 minutes daily logging their diary entries. Following the diary study, the fourth stage is the co-design interview. The same 19 participants complete a 60-minute interview and receive \$20. The final stage is completion, where participants receive an additional \$5 for completing all stages of the study.}
