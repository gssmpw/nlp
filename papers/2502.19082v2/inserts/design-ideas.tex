\toprule
\textbf{Overall Design Idea} & \textbf{Associated Barrier to Trust-Enabled Privacy} & \textbf{Example Prototype} \\ 
\midrule

\textbf{Guided Disclosure}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-2-1}] & Helps clarify \textbf{\textit{Ambiguous Norms}} by providing clear guidelines and expectations around posting, reducing uncertainty and the need for users to interpret implicit social expectations independently & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(a) \\

\textbf{Mutual Commitment}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-2-2}] & Addresses \textbf{\textit{Ambiguous Loyalty}} by allowing viewers to opt in or out of content while requiring them to agree to the space's rules before joining, ensuring mutual commitment and accountability for both the sharer and the audience. & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(g) \\

\textbf{Contextual Disclosure}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-2-3}] & Counteracts \textbf{\textit{Ambiguous Relevance}} by enabling segmentation of posts for specific interest groups, ensuring content reaches the right audience & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(c) \\

\textbf{Intentional Signaling}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-2-4}] & Clarifies \textbf{\textit{Ambiguous Reactions}} by encouraging more meaningful, context-specific reactions beyond simple `Likes' & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(f) \\

\textbf{Low-Stakes Disclosure}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-3-1}] & Alleviates \textbf{\textit{Presentation Expectations}} by offering casual, subtle, or ephemeral sharing options that lower the pressure to curate perfect content & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(b) \\

\textbf{Contextual Clarity}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-3-2}] & Reduces the \textbf{\textit{Social Risk of Misrepresentation}} common in CMC by allowing users to add contextual information, reducing likelihood of misunderstandings and misjudgments & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(e) \\

\textbf{Self-Contained Disclosure}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-3-3}] & Prevents \textbf{\textit{Nonconsensual Exposure}} by ensuring that every user has a dedicated space from the start, enabling them to share without worrying about burdening others by ``clogging'' their feeds & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(d) \\

\textbf{Trust-Centered Norms}\newline{}[Section \ref{section:4-3-4}] & Tackles the \textbf{\textit{Cycle of Distrust}} and cultivates positive community norms by setting clear behavioral guidelines, enabling users with aligned intentions to join and mutually enforce these norms & Figure \ref{fig:prototypes}(h) \\
