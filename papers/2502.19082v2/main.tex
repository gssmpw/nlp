% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\begin{abstract}
Through a three-part co-design study involving 19 teens aged 13â€“18, we identify key barriers to effective boundary regulation on social media, including ambiguous audience expectations, social risks associated with oversharing, and the lack of design affordances that facilitate trust-building. Our findings reveal that while adolescents seek casual, frequent sharing to strengthen relationships, existing platform norms and designs often discourage such interactions, leading to withdrawal. To address these challenges, we introduce \textit{trust-enabled privacy} as a design framework that recognizes trust---whether building or eroding---as central to boundary regulation. When trust is supported, boundary regulation becomes more adaptive and empowering; when it erodes, users default to self-censorship or withdrawal. We propose concrete design affordances, including guided disclosure, contextual audience segmentation, intentional engagement signaling, and trust-centered norms, to help platforms foster a more dynamic and nuanced privacy experience for teen social media users. By reframing privacy as a trust-driven process rather than a rigid control-based trade-off, this work provides empirical insights and actionable guidelines for designing social media environments that empower teens to manage their online presence while fostering meaningful social connections.
