\section*{Limitations}

Despite the promising results achieved by \modelname, there are two primary limitations to this study. 
\textbf{First}, our defense method can generalize to different attacks but its application on texts in different languages remains a challenge. 
\textbf{Second}, the computational cost of training the adversarial framework, particularly for the adversary and detector, is substantial, requiring significant hardware resources that could limit its deployment in resource-constrained settings.
\textbf{Third}, the detector presented in our work is only able to attribute the origin of the text on the document-level.
However, more works are needed for fine-grained (\eg sentence-level, token-level) detection in Human-AI co-authored texts.
