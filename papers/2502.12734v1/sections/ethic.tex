\section*{Ethics Statement}

This study seeks to improve the robustness and security of machine-generated text (MGT) detection, with a focus on defending against adversarial threats. While the proposed \modelname\ framework enhances detection capabilities, it also introduces potential risks of misuse, such as creating adversarial examples to evade detection systems. To mitigate such risks, our experiments were conducted in controlled environments, and details that could enable misuse were abstracted. We emphasize that this work is intended solely for advancing detection technologies and defending against malicious applications. Ethical use of these findings is imperative, and any misuse for harmful purposes is strongly discouraged.
The artifacts used in our work are all under the restriction of the license.
