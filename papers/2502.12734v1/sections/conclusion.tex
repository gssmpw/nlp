\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
In this paper, we proposed an adversarial training framework \textbf{GRE}edy \textbf{A}dversary
Promo\textbf{T}ed Defend\textbf{ER} (\modelname) to enhance the robustness of MGT detector under different text perturbation and adversarial attacks.
We design a novel attack strategy for the adversary including Identify \& Perturb and Replace \& Refine to construct effective adversarial examples efficiently.
In \modelname, we update the adversary and the detector alternatively in the same training step for better defense generalization.
Our experiment results demonstrate the efficacy of our detector \defensename under 14 attacks along with the leading performance of adversary \attackname compared with 13 methods.
The discussion on the relationship between attack strength and defense performance reveals the importance of a powerful adversary in adversarial training for robust MGT detectors.
