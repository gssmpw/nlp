\section{Conclusion and Discussion}

In this paper, we have presented VNCA, a novel volumetric temporal texture for stylizing volumetric smoke sequences with 2D exemplars. Our method achieves 1. high-quality appearance stylization with multiview and across-frame coherence w.r.t a reference image, 2. visually plausible motion as the original smoke data, and 3. speedup training time.
Our model can be extended to mesh texturing with a texture volume to be applied on various meshes.


\subsection{Limitations. }
Since we use the NCA framework, we inherit its shortcomings in that the homogenous update rule for NCA limits the synthesized texture from achieving high heterogeneity. 
In other words, VNCA can extract repeated patterns in the style image as features for stylization, but may not be able to synthesize stylizing features with a clear foreground and background.
