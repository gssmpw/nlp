\section{Application to Mesh Texturing}
\label{sec:mesh_texturing}
VNCA can easily be extended for mesh texturing given a reference style following the line of research in Solid Texture Synthesis \cite{perlin_noise, kopf2007solid, on-demand-solid-texture}.
\Cref{fig:mesh} shows the stylized meshes by our method in comparison with the results from A. \citet{on-demand-solid-texture} and B. \citet{kopf2007solid} as two representative solid texturing methods for five different style images.
