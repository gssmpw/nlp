Reformat Answer:

To calculate the expression [x*x for x in [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]], we need to square each number in the list.
Here's the step-by-step calculation:
- For x = 1, x*x = 1*1 = 1
- For x = 2, x*x = 2*2 = 4
- For x = 3, x*x = 3*3 = 9
- For x = 5, x*x = 5*5 = 25
- For x = 8, x*x = 8*8 = 64
- For x = 13, x*x = 13*13 = 169
So, the result of the expression [x*x for x in [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]] is [1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169].
