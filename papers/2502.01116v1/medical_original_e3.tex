Original Answer:

Two Japanese scientists commenced research into inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase in 1971 reasoning that organisms might produce such products as the enzyme is important in some essential cell wall components. This work lead to the identification of the first clinically useful compound lovastatin(mevinolin)  from a mould in the mid 1970's. This agent was first used in the more severe forms of hypercholesteraemia in the 1980s followed by landmark trials  with simvastatin that showed the potential for cardio-prevention. Cerivastatin was withdrawn in 2001
