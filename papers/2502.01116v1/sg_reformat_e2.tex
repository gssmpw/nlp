Reformat Answer:

Typically, food stabilizers are additives that help maintain the texture and consistency of food products, preventing ingredients from separating and extending shelf life. Common stabilizers include gelatin, pectin, and starches derived from corn or potatoes. Durian seeds, often discarded as waste, contain a high amount of starch that can be extracted and used as a thickening agent, emulsifier, and stabilizer in food products. The process involves drying and grinding the seeds into a powder, which can then be added to food to improve texture and stability.
