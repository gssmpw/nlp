Original Answer:

I need to choose 6 people out of 14, and the order does not matter. This is a combination problem, not a permutation problem. The formula for combinations is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of choices and r is the number of selections. Plugging in the numbers, I get 14C6 = 14! / (6! * 8!) = 3003.
