## Step 1: Count the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word.
Each letter of a word must be one of $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, or $E$, so the number of 4-letter words with no restrictions on the word is $5\times 5\times 5\times 5=625$.
## Step 2: Count the number of 4-letter words with no consonants.
Each letter of a word with no consonant must be one of $A$ or $E$. So the number of all 4-letter words with no consonants is $2\times 2\times 2\times 2=16$.
## Step 3: Calculate the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant.
To find the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant, we subtract the number of 4-letter words with no consonants from the total number of 4-letter words. Therefore, the number of 4-letter words with at least one consonant is $625-16=609$.
The final answer is: $\boxed{609}$
