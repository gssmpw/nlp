\section{Conclusion}
We conducted retrospective interviews with 11 authors of computing survey articles to examine their practices for creating and updating narrative reviews. We identified three main types of updates---empirical, structural, and interpretative---each with unique motivations, challenges, and opportunities for AI assistance. Although participants supported the idea of continuously updated reviews, they were skeptical about its feasibility due to current academic incentives, suggesting the important role AI tools may serve in facilitating or automating these updates. This study takes a first step toward enriching our understanding of when, why, and how these reviews should be kept up-to-date, informing the development of future tools to enable living narrative reviews.
