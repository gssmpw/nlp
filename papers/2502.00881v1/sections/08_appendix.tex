\section{Interview Protocol} \label{sec:interview_protocol}
Our semi-structured interviews included the following guide questions. When appropriate, follow-up questions were used to encourage participants to elaborate on their responses, for instance to probe deeper into process details or recall motivations for a particular decision. In \textit{Process.}, participants were asked to describe their workflows in as much detail as possible. Guide questions for specific scholarly activities were used only if unacknowledged by participants; otherwise, the discussion proceeded naturally, e.g., ``\textit{What did you do next?}''

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Introduction.} Could you briefly describe your area of research and the survey paper?
    \item \textit{Team Composition.} Could you describe the research team involved? How large was the team? Broadly, what were the responsibilities of each member?
    \item \textit{Process.} Could you walk me through your entire process of writing this survey paper, starting from the beginning?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Ideation.} How did you come up with the idea for the survey paper?
        \item \textit{Paper Search.} Could you walk me through your initial paper search process? For instance, how did you find, filter, or organize papers?
        \item \textit{Coding.} How did you begin to make sense of the information within the papers?
        \item \textit{Writing.} How did you translate the information you collected and organized into writing the paper? 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Perceived Challenges.} What did you feel were the most challenging aspects of the process?
    \item \textit{Tedious Aspects.} Were there any parts of the process that stood out as tedious, time-consuming, or cognitively challenging?
    \item \textit{Intermediate Artifacts.} What intermediate products (e.g., documents, spreadsheets) did you create, if any, during the process? How did you use those artifacts? What was helpful or not helpful about these artifacts?
    \item \textit{Tools.} What tools did you use throughout the process of writing this paper? What worked well, and what could have worked better?
    \item \textit{Process Adjustments.} If you were to write this survey paper again, what would you have done differently?
    \item \textit{Update Process.} Could you walk me through how you would update this paper? (Including similar sub-questions as in \textit{Process.} above.)
    \item \textit{Update Elements.} Which parts of the paper do you envision would change from these updates? For instance, could you speak to potential revisions regarding the existing text, structure, figures and tables, or other elements?
    \item \textit{Update Challenges.} What do you believe are the main challenges in the process of updating this paper?
    \item \textit{Desired Support.} What kind of support would you want in the process of updating this paper?
    \item \textit{AI Perspectives.} Which parts of the survey paper authoring or updating process do you believe an AI would be capable or incapable of assisting you with? 
\end{itemize}
