We study polynomial-time approximation algorithms for two closely-related problems, namely computing shortcuts and transitive-closure spanners (TC spanner). 
For a directed unweighted graph $G=(V, E)$ and an integer $d$, a set of edges $E'\subseteq V\times V$ is called a $d$-TC spanner of $G$ if the graph $H:=(V, E')$ has  (i) the same transitive-closure as $G$ and (ii) diameter at most $d.$ The set $E''\subseteq V\times V$ is a $d$-shortcut of $G$ if $E\cup E''$ is a $d$-TC spanner of $G$. Our focus is on the following $(\alpha_D, \alpha_S)$-approximation algorithm: given a directed graph $G$ and integers $d$ and $s$ such that $G$ admits a $d$-shortcut (respectively $d$-TC spanner) of size $s$, find a $(d\alpha_D)$-shortcut (resp. $(d\alpha_D)$-TC spanner) with $s\alpha_S$ edges, for as small $\alpha_S$ and $\alpha_D$ as possible. These problems are important special cases of graph sparsification and arise naturally in the context of reachability problems across computational models. 

As our main result, we show that, under the Projection Game Conjecture (PGC), there exists a small constant $\epsilon>0$, such that no polynomial-time $(n^{\epsilon},n^{\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm exists for finding $d$-shortcuts as well as $d$-TC spanners of size $s$. Previously, super-constant lower bounds were known only for $d$-TC spanners with constant $d$ and ${\alpha_D}=1$ [Bhattacharyya, Grigorescu, Jung, Raskhodnikova, Woodruff 2009]. Similar lower bounds for super-constant $d$ were previously known only for a more general case of directed spanners [Elkin, Peleg 2000]. No hardness of approximation result was known for shortcuts prior to our result.


As a side contribution, we complement the above with an upper bound of the form $(n^{\gamma_D}, n^{\gamma_S})$-approximation which holds for $3\gamma_D + 2\gamma_S > 1$ (e.g., $(n^{1/5+o(1)}, n^{1/5+o(1)})$-approximation). The previous best approximation factor is obtained via a naive combination of known techniques from [Berman, Bhattacharyya, Makarychev, Raskhodnikova, Yaroslavtsev 2011] and [Kogan, Parter 2022], and can provide $(n^{\gamma_D}, n^{\gamma_S})$-approximation under  the condition $3\gamma_D + \gamma_S >1$; in particular, for a fixed value $\gamma_D$, our improvement is nearly quadratic.

For directed unweighted graphs $G=(V, E)$ and $H=(V, E_H)$ and an integer $d$, graph $H$ is called a {\em $d$-transitive-closure spanner ($d$-TC spanner)} of $G$ if  $H$ has (i) the same transitive-closure as $G$ and (ii) diameter at most $d$. A set of edges $E'\subseteq V\times V$ is a {\em $d$-shortcut} of $G$ if $H=(V, E\cup E')$ is a $d$-TC spanner of $G$. 

TC spanners and shortcuts have been actively studied due to their connections to distributed algorithms, parallel algorithms, data structures, property testing, etc. One ideal goal is
to efficiently compute a $(d\alpha_d)$-shortcut or $(d\alpha_d)$-TC spanner of size $s\alpha_s$, for some $\alpha_s,\alpha_d=\polylog(n)$, when we are given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ that admits a $d$-shortcut or $d$-TC spanner of size $s$. 
\danupon{How about $d\delta$ and $s\sigma$?} 
[BGJ+ SODA'09] showed that such a TC spanner cannot be computed in polynomial time under a complexity-theoretic assumption when $\alpha_s=\polylog(n)$, $\alpha_d=1$, and $d=O(1)$. 
On the positive side, 
such TC spanners and shortcuts can be computed in polynomial time for $\alpha_s=\tilde O(\min\{\sqrt{n}, n/k^3\})$ and $\alpha_d=1$ [BBM+ ICALP'11, Kogan, Parter SODA'XX].  ...


In this paper, we show that such an ideal goal cannot be achieved, but it is still possible to achieve reasonable approximation factors. In particular, under the projection game conjecture, $\alpha_s,\alpha_d\geq m^\epsilon$ for some small constant $\epsilon>0$ for both TC spanners and shortcuts.\danupon{To do: State this more carefully. Say what range of parameters are.}
On the other hand, $\alpha_s,\alpha_d=O(n^{1/7.5})=O(n^{1.34})$.\danupon{Any consequence?}
