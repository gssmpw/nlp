\section{Data Release}

We will publicly release a comprehensive dataset that includes the artifacts and question-answer pairs in both the open-ended and multiple-choice settings. The licensing terms for the artifacts will follow those set by the respective dataset creators, as referenced in this work, while the curated artifacts will be provided under the MIT License. 
Additionally, our release will include standardized evaluation protocols, and evaluation scripts to facilitate rigorous assessment. The entire project will be open-sourced, ensuring free access for research and academic purposes.
