\section{Benchmark Problem Specifications}

\input{ProblemTSP1}
\input{ProblemTSP2}

REALM-Bench comprises eleven foundational problem frameworks that systematically evaluate both sequential and reactive planning. Building on the key dimensions introduced earlier (parallel threads, inter-dependencies, and dynamic disruptions), these frameworks progress from straightforward single-thread execution to complex multi-agent scenarios with real-time challenges.

\paragraph{\textbf{Considerations \#1 Problem Complexity:}} 

Each framework can be further scaled to create more challenging variants:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=*]
\item Expanding the scale of agents and resources (e.g., from dozens to thousands)
\item Widening geographic distribution (e.g., local to global)
\item Increasing disruption frequency and severity (e.g., isolated events to cascading failures)
\item Introducing uncertainties in execution times and outcomes (e.g., probabilistic durations)
\item Adding hierarchical dependency networks (e.g., sub-networks with internal dependencies)
\item Accounting for agent properties (e.g., atomicity, idempotency)
\end{itemize}
\vspace{.1in}
This extensible design enables researchers to incrementally assess their systems’ capabilities while preserving each scenario’s fundamental planning challenge.

\paragraph{\textbf{Considerations \#2 Implementation:}}

Three main approaches can be used to tackle these problems:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em]
\item \textbf{Rudimentary Manual Approach:}  
Hand-craft a directed graph, choose a solver, and input parameter values to obtain a solution. Although direct, this method demands considerable human effort and domain expertise.

\item \textbf{LLM-Assisted Semi-automation:}  
Use an LLM to suggest algorithms, extract parameters from specifications, and assist with coding. This approach can handle moderate complexity but becomes less feasible at scale.

\item \textbf{Full Automation:}  
Provide the problem statement to a multi-agent framework (e.g., MACI~\cite{chang2025MACI}) that executes end-to-end, including validation and replanning. This approach, combined with human oversight, scales best for complex scenarios with large numbers of nodes and frequent environmental changes.

\subsection{P1: Campus Single-Tour Navigation}

\textbf{Problem Statement:} A single autonomous agent must navigate a predefined campus environment to complete a sequence of waypoints while minimizing travel time. The scenario assumes a static environment without disruptions.

\textbf{Problem Specification:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=-]
    \item \textbf{Environment:} A known map with a finite set of locations.
    \item \textbf{Goal:} Visit all designated waypoints within a given timeframe.
    \item \textbf{Constraints:} Opening hours of each location, each location at least 30 minutes, and must be completed before 5 PM.
    \item \textbf{Optimization Metric:} Shortest path (time or distance).
\end{itemize}

A meta-plan, shown in Table~\ref{tab:P1SingleTour}, provides the high-level structure and constraints for the problem. This meta-plan serves as input to specialized solvers, such as dynamic programming or Monte Carlo algorithms, which then generate detailed, executable workflows. The process transforms abstract planning requirements into concrete, implementable sequences of actions while respecting all specified constraints and optimization objectives.

\subsection{P2: Multi-Group Campus Tour}
\textbf{Problem Statement:} Multiple groups of visitors require guided tours in different locations on a university campus, with optimized scheduling of multiple tour guides. This problem shares the same metrics as
P1.

\textbf{Problem Specification:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=-]
    \item Multiple agents (tour guides) must coordinate to serve different groups of visitors.
    \item Each group has predefined preferences and time constraints.
    \item Agents must follow non-overlapping paths while minimizing idle time.
    \item Location visiting hours must be observed.
\end{itemize}

Details are provided in Table~\ref{tab:P2MultiTour}.

\subsection{P3: Urban Ride-Sharing (URS)}
\textbf{Problem Statement:} Optimize real-time ride assignments for multiple vehicles and passengers in an urban environment, balancing efficiency, fuel use, and service quality.

\textbf{Problem Specification:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=-]
    \item \textbf{City Map:} A graph $G = (V, E)$ where locations $V$ and roads $E$ have distances and travel times.
    \item \textbf{Ride Requests:} A set of requests $R$, each defined by:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=--]
        \item Passenger ID, pickup/drop-off locations, time windows.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vehicles:} A set of available vehicles $K$, each with:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=--]
        \item Location, battery/fuel level, passenger capacity and speed.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{P5: Wedding Reunion}

\noindent \textbf{Problem Specification:} Table~\ref{tab:Wedding} presents a coordinated wedding event travel problem. Several friends arrive at different times and locations before a 3:00~PM wedding photo session. The challenge includes managing two vehicles for airport pick-ups (aimed at those who cannot drive or wish to cut costs) and completing critical errands, such as collecting the wedding gift and retrieving formal attire from the tailor. All activities must be scheduled to ensure that everyone arrives at the wedding venue before the photo time.

This problem introduces more constraints than the URS problems in P3 and P4, and it also lays the groundwork for a more challenging disruption case discussed in~\textbf{P8}.

\subsection*{\textbf{P6:} Thanksgiving Dinner}

Consider a Thanksgiving dinner scenario in which a family of five must return home in a Boston suburb for dinner. The problem involves coordinating departure times, managing travel logistics (including possible traffic delays), and ensuring timely arrival. Table~\ref{tab:ThanksgivingDinner1} formalizes these challenges as a sequential planning problem.

This scenario also lays the groundwork for a more advanced disruption case, which has proven difficult for standalone LLMs, as discussed in~\textbf{P9}.

\noindent \textbf{Problem Specification:}

\noindent \underline{\textit{Setup:}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=*]
\item Mom (Sarah) hosts dinner at 6:00 PM in Boston.
\item Family arrivals:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em,]
  \item Dad (James) from San Francisco, lands at 1:00 PM ET.
  \item Sister (Emily) from Chicago lands at 2:30 PM.
  \item Brother (Michael) driving from NY arrives at 3:00 PM.
  \end{itemize}
\item Grandma, who is healthy, needs to pick up nearby.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \underline{\textit{Constraints:}}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=*]
\item James must rent a car post-landing.
\item Emily needs an airport pickup (no alternatives).
\item Turkey requires 4 hours to cook; someone must be home once it's in the oven for safety.
\item Side dishes need 2 hours of preparation.
\item Travel times:
  \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em,]
  \item Home to BOS Airport: 1 hour.
  \item BOS Airport to Grandma’s: 1 hour.
  \item Home to Grandma’s: 30 minutes.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\noindent \underline{\textit{Key Planning Questions:}}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=\arabic*.]
\item When should cooking start?
\item Who picks up Emily, and when?
\item When and by whom should Grandma be picked up?

\subsection*{P7: Disaster Relief Logistics Problem}

\noindent \textbf{Problem Specification:} Table~\ref{tab:DisasterRelief} summarizes the problem.

\input{ProblemDisasterRelief}

\subsection*{P8: Wedding Reunion with Disruptions}

\noindent \textbf{Problem Extension:}
This problem extends \textbf{P5} with road closures and dynamic rerouting.

The disruption scenario becomes more challenging because, when a road closure is announced, the planner must know each vehicle's current location to determine whether it is affected. Since LLMs are inherently stateless, they cannot keep track of previous scheduling events and thus struggle to adapt the plan in real-time. 

\subsection*{P9: Thanksgiving Dinner with Disruptions}

This problem extends \textbf{P6} by introducing flight delays. Specifically, when a flight from SFO to BOS is delayed by $t$ hours, the new arrival time is confirmed at the originally expected arrival time minus the flight’s scheduled duration. Although this early notice provides an opportunity to adjust travel and dinner plans, current LLM-based systems fail to leverage this information in a timely manner, only beginning to react at the original arrival time and missing the window for earlier intervention.

For example, consider James’s flight, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Boston at 1~PM but has been delayed to 4~PM. He learns of this new arrival time at 10~AM~EST (the flight’s intended departure from SFO), offering a three-hour lead for adjustments. However, existing LLM-based solutions do not adapt the plan until 1~PM, thus squandering the opportunity to re-optimize the schedule.



\subsection*{P10: Global Supply Chain}

\input{PoblemSupplyChain}

Table~\ref{tab:ProblemSupplyChain} presents a comprehensive problem in data center GPU deployment that captures the complexity of large-scale infrastructure projects. The objective is to complete a 1 million GPU data center in 15 months while minimizing total costs. The problem encompasses procurement decisions between NVIDIA ($15$k/unit) and AMD ($10$k/unit) GPUs, where each vendor has different maintenance risks (20\% vs 50\% of unit price over one year) and quarterly shipment capacities.

The construction process is organized around 50,000 GPU clusters, which require coordinated deployment of power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. Each cluster demands significant resources: 150 MW of power capacity and 1 million gallons per day of cooling water. Infrastructure development follows strict dependencies: Power and cooling systems must be operational before networking installation can begin, and each cluster must complete testing before becoming operational.

The problem incorporates real-world complexities such as risks of natural disasters (10\% probability per quarter for both earthquakes and typhoons), which can cause cascading delays and cost increases. Management can expedite various components; power / cooling installation can be accelerated from 4 to 2.5 months for a 80\% cost premium, while testing can be shortened from 2 to 1 month by doubling the cost.

The financial implications are significant, as each month of delay incurs $60$M in combined revenue loss and additional operating costs. This creates a complex optimization challenge: balancing procurement costs, expedition premiums, and risk mitigation strategies while adhering to physical and temporal constraints in the construction sequence.

\subsection*{P11: Stock Prediction/Forecasting}
\label{sec:p11}

Consider a stock market prediction scenario where an automated system must forecast future stock prices while integrating multiple data streams and accounting for market dynamics. The problem involves processing real-time data, managing prediction updates, and responding to market events. Table~\ref{tab:StockPrediction} formalizes this as a sequential planning problem, presenting a comprehensive framework for building an adaptive prediction system. The problem statement details the requirements for creating a robust prediction pipeline that can handle real-time market data, maintain high accuracy, and adapt to changing market conditions. A sample workflow demonstrating the system's architecture and data flow is provided in Table~\ref{tab:StockPrediction}.
