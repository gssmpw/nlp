\subsection{Execution Example: Urban Ride Sharing }

For a benchmark suite, we encourage users to
devise novel methodologies to solve the problems. However, for this illustrative example of Urban Ride Sharing (URS) (P3), we employ a customized specification language that extends PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) and workflow networks to support:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=-]
    \item Dynamic constraints and real-time updates.
    \item Integration with streaming data sources.
    \item Explicit representation of uncertainty.
    \item Temporal and spatial dependencies.
\end{itemize}

The solver, whether manual or automatic, approaches the planning problem in three steps:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.0em, topsep=-.0em, parsep=-.0em, label=\arabic*.]
    \item Convert the problem statement into a formal specification:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, topsep=-0em, parsep=-0em, label=-]
        \item Key objectives and constraints.
        \item Required resources and their capabilities.
        \item Performance metrics and success criteria.
        \item Temporal and spatial dependencies.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Transform the specification into a workflow graph:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, topsep=-0em, parsep=-0em, label=-]
        \item Nodes represent processing stages, decision points, or actions.
        \item Edges capture dependencies, data flow, and execution sequence.
        \item Agents are assigned to both nodes and edges.
        \item Concrete parameters and thresholds are specified.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Select and apply solving algorithms:
    \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, topsep=0em, parsep=0em, label=-]
        \item Test multiple solution approaches (e.g., dynamic programming, Monte Carlo).
        \item Evaluate solutions against specified metrics.
        \item Select and validate the best-performing solution.
        \item Present results with performance analyses.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

We walk through these three steps to solve the URS problem.

\subsubsection{URS Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:ALASmonte-carlo} presents an optimal solution with a total travel distance of 87 km, outperforming both GPT-4o-Task and DeepSeek R1 (Figure~\ref{fig:GPTDS-schedule}), which require 123 km. This represents a significant improvement of 41.37\%.

\paragraph{Extended Materials}

We also used LangGraph to implement both \textbf{P3} and \textbf{P4}, as presented in \textbf{Appendix}~\ref{app:p3p4}. Furthermore, we provide a solution to \textbf{P11} for the prediction of the stock value. These sample implementations validate the completeness of the problem statements in this benchmark.
