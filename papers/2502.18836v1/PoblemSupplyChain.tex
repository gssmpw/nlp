\begin{tabular}{|p{3.3cm}|p{13.6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Details} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{GPU Procurement \& Shipments}} \\
\hline
Total GPU Target & 100,000 units \\
\hline
Vendors & 
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{NVIDIA:} \$15k/unit, 200k units/quarter capacity, 20\% maintenance risk (of unit price over 1 year)\\
\textbf{AMD:} \$10k/unit, 150k units/quarter capacity,  50\% maintenance risk (of unit price over 1 year)
\end{tabular} \\
\hline
Order Timing & All orders placed on Day 1 \\
\hline
Shipment Schedule & Quarterly shipments; e.g., a 600,000 unit order results in 3 shipments of 200,000 units at the end of Q1, Q2, and Q3 \\
\hline
Payment Terms & 50\% deposit at order (day 1), 50\% at delivery (each quarter) \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Natural Disaster Impacts}} \\
\hline
Risk Probabilities & Earthquake: 10\% per quarter; Typhoon: 10\% per quarter (assessed over entire project) \\
\hline
Delay Impact & Cascading 1-month delay on all subsequent shipments if a disaster occurs in a quarter \\
\hline
Cost Impact & 30\% price increase applied only to the affected quarterâ€™s shipment \\
\hline
Shipment Expedition Impact & Expedite one shipment by 1 month and all subsequent shipments are moved up by 1 month (lock stepped) \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Cluster Construction \& Infrastructure}} \\
\hline
Cluster Definition & Each cluster requires 50,000 GPUs; clusters can be built concurrently once required GPUs are delivered \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Networking Infrastructure (per cluster)}} \\
\hline
Duration & 1 months \\
\hline
Cost & \$25 million \\
\hline
Dependencies & Can begin only after GPUs have arrived, power is ready, and cooling is operational \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Power \& Cooling (per cluster)}} \\
\hline
Requirements & Power: 150 MW; Cooling: 1M gallons/day \\
\hline
Lead Time Options & 
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Regular: 2 months at \$30M per cluster\\ Expedited: 1 months at \$75M per cluster (150\% cost premium)\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Testing \& Certification (per cluster)}} \\
\hline
Normal Process & 2 months, \$15 million \\
\hline
Expedited Process & 1 month, \$45 million (150\% cost premium) \\
\hline
Expedition Options & Expedite power/cooling, networking (50\% time reduction, 150\% cost premium), and testing independently per cluster \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Business Impact of Delays}} \\
\hline
Delay Costs & \$50 million lost revenue + \$10 million additional operating costs per month of delay \\
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{\textbf{Overall Objective}} \\
\hline
Objective & Minimize the end-to-end construction cost (procurement, construction, maintenance, delay costs, expedition premiums) while meeting the 15-month deadline. If the 15-month not met, adding delay costs \\
