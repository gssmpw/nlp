\section{Conclusion}

We propose a novel hybrid-domain FP CIM architecture based on SRAM, integrating both digital and analog CIM elements. 
Detailed circuit designs were developed for the hybrid-domain mantissa MAC unit, and circuit-level evaluations demonstrate notable energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital baselines, with minimal area overhead and negligible accuracy loss.

We propose a novel hybrid-domain FP CIM architecture based SRAM that integrates both digital and analog CIM. Since mantissa MAC is most complicated and energy-cost part in whole architecture, we developed some optimal structures to save energy and area and also we built a 4x4 array circuit schematics and physical layouts for verification. According to the rule that mantissa addition take 3/4 weight in FP multiplication, so we use fully digital circuit to ensure the accuracy, and a sub-add for adder structure which only increase 55.7\% area overhead; mantissa multiplication take only 1/4 weight in FP operation, so we use an analog circuit to lower the energy consumption and area overhead. Also we use a capacitance sharing way to decrease the operation times of shift and add so that we can obtain higher energy efficiency. Last, comprehensive evaluation show it improve energy efficiency and area overhead with accuracy.
