% \par The primary objective of color constancy is to estimate the chromaticity of the illuminant. Subsequently, image color correction is performed using the estimated illuminant chromaticity within the existing transformation framework, most commonly the von Kries model**Finlayson, "Color Constancy"**. In the following section, we will first analyze the imaging equation. Then, we will review the research focus of this paperâ€”deep neural networks-driven color constancy and the data augmentation strategy employed.
\subsection{Image Formation for Color Constancy} \label{sec2.1}
\par Based on the Dichromatic Reflection Model**Shi, "Dichromatic Reflection Model"**, the image $\boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x}) = \left( f_R(x), f_G(x), f_B(x) \right)^\top$ is determined by the scene illuminant $I(\boldsymbol{x}, \lambda)$, the camera sensor response function $\boldsymbol{\rho}(\lambda) = \left( \rho_R(\lambda), \rho_G(\lambda), \rho_B(\lambda) \right)^\top$, the surface reflectance $S(\boldsymbol{x}, \lambda)$, and the parameters $m_b(\boldsymbol{x})$ and $m_s(\boldsymbol{x})$ which represent body reflection and surface reflection, respectively____, such that:
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{aligned}
  f_R(x) & = k_R I(x), \\
  f_G(x) & = k_G I(x), \\
  f_B(x) & = k_B I(x).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data Augmentation for DNNCC} \label{sec2.3}
\par Data augmentation diversifies the training data through various transformations. Common geometric transformations, such as random flipping, cropping, and rotating, are also used for color constancy____. Nevertheless, due to the high sensitivity to color variations, most color transformations, such as channel dropping and swapping, are unsuitable for color constancy**Vonikakis, "Color Constancy"**. The most prevalent color augmentation technique for color constancy involves linearly scaling the illuminant and adjusting image colors simultaneously____, thus creating richer scene-light combinations. A more precise method**Gao, "Adversarial Attack Defense"**, identifies 24-color swatch values and uses a transformation matrix to swap illuminants between images.
Although the aforementioned data augmentation significantly enhanced the performance of DNNCC, these strategies did not explicitly consider brightness transformations. Our study reveals a general issue with the brightness robustness of DNNCC models. To tackle this challenge, we propose an adversarial brightness augmentation strategy. This approach effectively mitigates performance degradation caused by brightness sensitivity by learning from high-risk brightness transformations, demonstrating its effectiveness as an innovative augmentation method for DNNCC models.
\subsection{Adversarial Attack and Defense} \label{sec2.4}
DNN have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks. However, extensive research has revealed that DNN are highly susceptible to adversarial examples**Goodfellow, "Adversarial Examples"**. Subsequently, numerous attack variants such as PGD____ and C\&W____ have been proposed**Madry, "Towards Deep Learning"**. Additionally, some research has shifted focus from pursuing powerful attacks to expanding perturbation types through techniques such as altering color temperature____ and retouching____
