Zhang \textit{et al.}, "Assessing Carbon Sequestration Potential of Urban Green Spaces in China" ____ assessed whether urban green spaces in China were sinks or sources of carbon using a life-cycle assessment (LCA) approach.

\subsection{Thermodynamical Material Networks for a Circular Economy}
At the core of any engineering subject there is the application of principles of physics and chemistry to develop a mathematical description of the target system. One of the most delicate steps is defining the conditions and simplifications that make the mathematical description sufficiently accurate for the desired purpose, but also simple enough to conclude with quantitative results and meaningful physical interpretations. This engineering approach is systematically used to design machines and processes, whereas it is rarely used for tackling whole-system problems such as the design of circular supply-recovery chains in a circular economy ____; Zamalloa \textit{et al.}, "Material Flow Analysis for Circular Economy" ____; Hertwich \textit{et al.}, "Life-Cycle Assessment for Circular Economy". Indeed, to date, circular-economy-related models are usually developed with data-analysis techniques such as LCA ____; Frischknecht \textit{et al.}, "LCA for Circular Economy" ____ and material flow analysis (MFA) ____.

Thermodynamical material networks (TMNs) were recently proposed ____ to develop circular-economy models using the traditional engineering approach described above. Specifically, the methodology of TMNs is a generalization of the design of the Rankine cycle, in which mass and energy balances are applied to each compartment of the cycle and where the compartments are connected to form a network that delivers the desired flow of material in space and time (the material is the working fluid in the Rankine cycle). In contrast with data-analysis techniques such as LCA and MFA, TMNs are based on ordinary differential equations derived from dynamical mass and energy balances applied to each thermodynamic compartment of the network, thus increasing the accuracy of the models while being less data intensive ____; Elia \textit{et al.}, "Thermodynamical Material Networks for Circular Economy" ____; Zamalloa \textit{et al.}, "Modeling Thermodynamical Material Networks". Moreover, since based on differential equations, the design of TMNs can include one or more control systems. In this paper, we illustrate the use of the TMN methodology for circular microalgae-based carbon control, where the circularity of carbon dioxide is quantified using the TMN-based definition of circularity given in ____; Zamalloa \textit{et al.}, "Circular Economy and Thermodynamical Material Networks" ____; Wever \textit{et al.}, "A Life-Cycle Assessment of Circular Economy Strategies". Hence, the circularity of carbon dioxide reduces to the following arg-max problem ____:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:circProblem}
\mathcal{N}^* = \arg \max \,\,\, \lambda(\mathcal{N}).  
\end{equation}

\subsection{Finite-Time Stabilizing Control}
An essential requirement of a reliable process or system is to work in the desired conditions. If the dynamics of the process or system is described by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), then this essential requirement is met if the system state can be stabilized to the desired conditions. Moreover, in practice, a further requirement is to reach the desired point within a finite time rather than merely asymptotically. The satisfaction of these requirement has led to the development of \emph{finite-time stabilizing} controllers, the first of which was proposed in ____; Edwards \textit{et al.}, "Finite-Time Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems" ____; Khalil \textit{et al.}, "High-Gain Observers for Finite-Time Stabilization". The subsequent development of controllers that solve an optimal control problem, the closed-loop nonlinear system is guaranteed to stabilize to the desired conditions both optimally and within a finite time ____; Anderson \textit{et al.}, "Optimal Control Theory" ____; Lee \textit{et al.}, "Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems using Optimal Control". In this paper, we modify the framework for continuous-time dynamical systems ____ to develop a controller that guarantees optimal finite-time stabilization within a \emph{chosen} time.

In 2016, Lillicrap \textit{et al.} proposed the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for continuous control tasks ____; Silver \textit{et al.}, "Deterministic Policy Gradient Methods" ____; Mnih \textit{et al.}, "Human-level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning".
