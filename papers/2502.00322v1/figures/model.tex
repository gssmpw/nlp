    \caption{\label{fig:model} \small Using a debatable query and documents as inputs, \model creates an outline of document perspectives via a panel discussion among LLM speakers. First, an Agenda Planner drafts topics for the outline. A Moderator picks speakers for these topics and tailors a query for each speaker. The speakers retrieve contexts for the tailored query and use these contexts to provide their document's perspectives, which are tracked in an outline; this outline is used as a content plan to write the final summary.}
