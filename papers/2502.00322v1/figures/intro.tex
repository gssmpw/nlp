    \caption{\label{fig:intro} Debatable Query-Focused Summarization (DQFS) with GPT-4 for two topics. The model mainly gives ``yes'' perspectives (\colorbox{myblue1}{Blue}) with few ``no'' perspectives (\colorbox{myred1}{Red}), giving an unbalanced summary. It also has poor coverage, failing to cite (\colorbox{myyellow1}{Yellow}) half the inputs.}
