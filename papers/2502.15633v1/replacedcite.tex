The current and previous frames are input as a pair into the Pointmap Regression network for pose estimation, followed by pose optimization based on the current Gaussian map. At keyframes, mapping is performed and the pointmap is processed by the Adaptive Scale Mapper for new Gaussian mapping. Camera pose and Gaussian map are jointly optimized in the local window.}

\subsection{RGB-only Dense Visual SLAM. }

Despite the success of these methods with RGB-D inputs, RGB-only SLAM presents unique challenges, primarily due to the lack of direct depth information which complicates geometric reconstruction. However, the increased difficulty makes RGB-only dense SLAM research more valuable. NeRF-SLAM ____ and Orbeez-SLAM ____ utilize DROID-SLAM ____ and ORB-SLAM2 ____ as tracking modules, respectively, both leveraging Instant-NGP ____ for volumetric neural radiance field mapping. DIM-SLAM ____ and NICER-SLAM ____ perform tracking and mapping on the same neural implicit map represented by hierarchical feature grids, but do not address global map consistency, such as loop closure. GO-SLAM ____ and Hi-SLAM ____ extend DROID-SLAM ____ to the full SLAM setting by introducing online loop closure via factor graph optimization. GlORIE-SLAM ____ employs a flexible neural point cloud representation and introduces a novel DSPO layer for bundle adjustment, optimizing keyframe poses and depth.

Recently, some works have started using 3DGS to address the challenges of RGB-only SLAM. MonoGS ____ and Photo-SLAM ____ both support RGB-only inputs and achieve performance comparable to that of RGB-D inputs. MotionGS ____ implements tracking through feature extraction and a motion filter on each frame, using compressed 3D Gaussian representation to reduce memory usage. MGS-SLAM ____ adopts DPVO ____ as tracking module and utilizes a pre-trained MVS network to estimate prior depth, adjusting its scale for Gaussian scene reconstruction. Splat-SLAM ____ combines GlORIE-SLAM ____ with Gaussian scene representation, introducing global BA into Gaussian-based SLAM. 
While substantial progress has been made, particularly in adapting SLAM technologies for indoor environments, the extension to outdoor settings remains limited. The development of robust RGB-only SLAM systems that can handle the unbounded and dynamic nature of outdoor environments is an ongoing area of research, with potential breakthroughs likely to have a significant impact on the field.
