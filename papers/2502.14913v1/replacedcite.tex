\section{Related Work}
For a long time, computer professionals have been hoping to convert natural language queries into specific database queries according to certain scenarios, in order to dramatically reduce the learning and usage costs for individuals, bridge the gap between laypersons and expert users, and enhance the efficiency of using, analyzing, and querying databases. The Text-to-SQL task is one of the most representative examples of these, and success in the Text-to-SQL task would imply that similar methods could assist in various SQL-like tasks. However, this task continues to be challenging, particularly due to the strong correlation between the SQL structure and the database structure, as well as the limitations imposed by the expression format requirements____.

\subsection{Classic Method}
Classical methods often do not directly generate SQL but assemble it through various means. These methods handle components like SELECT, WHERE, etc., separately to construct SQL clauses. An example of such a method is SQLNET____, which employs a sketch-based approach where the sketch contains a dependency graph, allowing one prediction to take into account only the previous predictions it depends on. RYANSQL____ and SyntaxSQLNet____ have tried to generalize sketch-based decoding, attempting not only to fill in the gaps of a sketch but also to generate the appropriate sketch for a given text. Additionally, there are methods that utilize graph representation____ and employ intermediate languages____ to enhance the capabilities of LLMs. These methods may be constrained by the inherent capabilities of the models, which may lead to inferior performance. For the Text-to-SQL task, their theoretical value outweighs their practical value.
