\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We draw from Online Convex Optimization theory and introduce a light-weight and model-agnostic framework to aggregate multiple trajectory predictors online. Our framework leverages the \squint algorithm originally designed for hedging and extends it to the case of nonconvex and nonstationary environments. Results on the \nuscenes and the \lyft datasets show that our framework effectively combines multiple singular models to form a stronger mixture model.

{\bf Limitation}.
(i) Aggregating multiple models comes at the cost of running several models online. While this overhead can be mitigated through GPU parallelization, future work should explore using smaller neural networks as individual experts to reduce runtime costs. (ii) Due to the scarcity of data splits, we aggregated only three and four models. Future work should investigate the aggregation of tens or even hundreds of models for trajectory prediction or other applications.
