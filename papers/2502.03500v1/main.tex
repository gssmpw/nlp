\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in generative image restoration (IR) have demonstrated impressive results. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR operates in latent space by first predicting the latent representation of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator and then transporting this estimate to high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. Consequently, ELIR is more than 4x faster compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches. Moreover, ELIR is also more than 4x smaller, making it well-suited for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks show that ELIR achieves competitive results, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while offering improved efficiency in terms of memory and computation.

optimize the encoder, MMSE estimator, and the vector field for a specific IR task, to establish direct paths from LQ to HQ image distribution. During inference, we utilize the MMSE estimator and predict a consistent linear direction from LQ toward the HQ images, yielding high-quality results, and balancing distortion and perception. Both training and inference are conducted in latent space. }

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
This study introduces Efficient Latent Image Restoration (ELIR), an efficient IR method that operates within the latent space. \name consists of two stages: latent MMSE estimator, whose goal is to estimate the latent presentation of a clean image, followed by latent consistency flow matching (LCFM). The LCFM is a combination of latent flow matching and consistency flow matching that enables a small number of NFEs and a reduction of the evaluation cost. In addition, we propose an efficient neural network to significantly reduce computational complexity and model size. We have evaluated ELIR on several IR tasks and shown state-of-the-art performance in terms of model efficiency. In terms of distortion and perceptual quality, we have shown competitive results with state-of-the-art methods. This makes \name an efficient image restoration method that can be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.
