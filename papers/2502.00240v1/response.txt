\section{Related work}
\paragraph{Data-driven regularization:} There have been several lines of work that aim to learn regularizers in a data-driven fashion. As mentioned previously, early works include the field of dictionary learning or sparse coding __Mallat et al., "Dictionary Learning for Sparse Representation"__. Such approaches can be described as learning a polyhedral regularizer from data. Regularization by Denoising ____Chen et al., "Regularization by Denoising"__ constructs an explicit regularization functional using an off-the-shelf deep neural network-based denoiser. The works ____Mirza et al., "Conditional Adversarial Autoencoders"__, learn a regularizer via the critic-based adversarial loss inspired by the Wasserstein distance. The difference in these works lie in the way the neural network is parametrized to enforce certain properties, such as convexity or weak convexity. The latter ____Zhang et al., "Input-Output Weakly Convex Neural Network"__ also establishes convergence guarantees of the Input Weakly Convex Neural Network (IWCNN) regularizer. Similarly, ____Ravikumar et al., "Convex and Weakly Convex Regularizers via Convolutional Ridge Functions"__ developed convex and weakly convex regularizers given by convolutional ridge functions with provable convergence guarantees. There have also been other works ____Jaggi et al., "Provable Methods for Finding the Proximal Operator of a Nonconvex Function"__ that have aimed to approximate the proximal operator of a potentially nonconvex data-driven regularizer.

\paragraph{DC programming and regularization:} Our work is inspired by the rich literature on DC programming and its use in regularization. For a general survey, please see ____Horst and Tuy, "On Convex Maximization"__. In terms of DC structure in sparse regularization, several works have analyzed the use of the DC function $x \mapsto \|x\|_1 - \|x\|_2$ as a sparsity inducing regularizer ____Chen et al., "Sparse Regularization via Nonconvex DC Functions"__ as its zeros correspond to $1$-sparse vectors. Many popular nonconvex regularizers have also been shown to have a DC decomposition ____, such as SCAD ____Fan and Li, "Variable Selection via Maximum Constrained Likelihood"__, MCP ____Zhang et al., "Nearly Uniform Universal Thresholding for Support Recovery with Noisy High-Dimensional Data"__, or the Logarithmic penalty ____Li et al., "The Logarithmic Penalty Function: A New Approach to Nonconvex Sparse Regularization".
