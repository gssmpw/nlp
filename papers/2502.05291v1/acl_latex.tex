Large language models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous, thus it is important to understand their risks and limitations. Smaller LLMs can be deployed where compute resources are constrained, such as edge devices, but with different propensity to generate harmful output. Mitigation of LLM harm typically depends on annotating the harmfulness of LLM output, which is expensive to collect from humans. This work studies two questions: How do smaller LLMs rank regarding generation of harmful content? How well can larger LLMs annotate harmfulness? We prompt three small LLMs to elicit harmful content of various types, such as discriminatory language, offensive content, privacy invasion, or negative influence, and collect human rankings of their outputs. Then, we evaluate three state-of-the-art large LLMs on their ability to annotate the harmfulness of these responses. We find that the smaller models differ with respect to harmfulness. We also find that large LLMs show low to moderate agreement with humans. These findings underline the need for further work on harm mitigation in LLMs.

\section{Introduction}
Thanks to the high performance of large language models (LLMs) on diverse tasks such as question answering, summarization, and sentiment classification, they are increasingly ubiquitous. Yet there remains the risk of unpredictable generation of undesirable outputs that fall under the general category of ``harm''.  Harm includes information about execution of dangerous activities, discrimination, stereotyping, privacy violations, offensive language, and hate speech \cite{kumar-etal-2023-language}. Recent work proposes mitigation methods for use at inference-time or training-time \cite{li2024precision,ko2024large,khondaker2024detoxllm,niu2024parameter,wang2024detoxifying}. Much of this work focuses on smaller LLMs ($\leq$ 10B parameters), because of their convenience for users with fewer compute resources \cite{shakhadri2024shakti}, for use on edge devices \cite{xu2024device}, or to minimize adverse effects on the environment \cite{schwartz2020green}. There is also the potential for harm mitigation methods developed on smaller LLMs to inform harm mitigation in larger LLMs. Most of this work aims for quantitative measures, such as the probability of generating harmful output, which faces numerous challenges. We take an alternative approach of ranking harmfulness of models, based on human comparisons among model outputs when they are given the same prompts. Our approach has the extra benefit of yielding a dataset of preference judgements, 
%thus aligned with methods to mitigate harm, such as RLHF or direct preference optimization (DPO).
which could support harm mitigation methods like RLHF or direct optimization (DPO).

Our approach to collecting data that leads to a means to ranking LLMs for harmfulness depends on three steps: (1) elicitation of harmful output from different LLMs; (2) rating the relative harmfulness of outputs from different models; (3) deriving an overall ranking of LLMs. In this paper, we use a previously collected dataset of human interactions with LLMs with harmful outputs for human prompts to serve as ``harm triggers.'' We then use our harm triggers to elicit harmful output. We also release the dataset consisting of harm-triggering prompts and human ratings of model responses.

% Thanks to the great performance of large language models (LLMs) on various tasks such as reasoning, question answering, summarization, or sentiment analysis, their usage has increased significantly. However, they also generate many types of highly undesirable output that can be referenced under the general category of ``harm''. Harm includes talking about carrying out dangerous activities, discrimination, stereotyping, privacy violations, offensive language, hate speech etc \cite{kumar-etal-2023-language}. Recent work proposes methods to mitigate this behavior with inference-time and training-time modifications for various sized (7B, 8B, 70B, etc.) LLMs \cite{li2024precision,ko2024large,khondaker2024detoxllm,niu2024parameter,wang2024detoxifying}. %Furthermore, 
% However, most of these works focus on smaller LLMs (10B parameters or less) because their convenience for users with fewer compute resources serves an important role \cite{shakhadri2024shakti}. In addition, they are useful for
% edge devices \cite{xu2024device} and have a less adverse effect on the environment \cite{schwartz2020green}. Last but not least, research on mitigating this behavior from smaller LLMs might provide efficient, simple, and generalizable methods for larger LLMs. On the other hand, these works %measure harm or toxicity by a number, 
% measure harm or toxicity as an absolute quantity such as the probability of being harmful. In contrast, we measure relative harm by ranking %different 
% models based on collections of pairs of responses from different models. We believe it is impractical to identify an absolute scale of harm. Furthermore, ranking based on preference judgements
% is more aligned with methods 
% to mitigate harm, such as RLHF or direct preference optimization (DPO), thus our dataset could potentially help with harm mitigation. %like the RLHF procedure.

% %Most research on methods to mitigate this behavior is carried out on LLMs with tens of billions of parameters in a few industry groups, %because of the need for computing resources, and  where compute resources are plentiful.
% %most methods require collecting datasets of different harmful outputs (e.g. DPO or RLHF). Moreover, many studies focus on big LLMs, but 
% %The harmfulness of smaller LLMs (10b parameters or less) is less well-studied, yet their %availability to 
% %convenience for users with less compute resources %makes them an important resource 
% %serves an important role \cite{shakhadri2024shakti}. In addition, they are %easier to use on 
% %useful for
% %edge devices \cite{xu2024device} and have a less adverse effect on the environment \cite{schwartz2020green}. Last but not least, research on mitigating this behavior from smaller LLMs might provide efficient, simple, and generalizable methods for larger LLMs.
% %Thanks to the great performance of large language models (LLMs) on various tasks such as reasoning, question answering, summarization or sentiment analysis, their usage has increased significantly, including chatbots. However, despite their usefulness, they can generate harmful content too. One common example for this is asking ``How to make a bomb?'' to a model and getting a recipe for it. Besides these obvious examples, it is possible to elicit biased, harmful or offensive content from the models unintentionally. These behaviors limit their usage in practice.

% Given the convenience of smaller LLMs (10B parameters or less) especially for people with less compute resources, and the insights that might emerge, it can therefore be useful to carry out an evaluation of their harmfulness. To carry out such an evaluation requires collecting data on harmful output, which depends on three steps: (1) %a way to 
% elicitation of harmful output from different LLMs; (2) %a way to 
% rating the relative harmfulness of outputs from different models; (3) deriving an overall ranking of LLMs. In this paper, we %utilize 
% use a previously collected dataset of human interactions with LLMs with %leading to 
% harmful outputs %to extract the 
% for human prompts to serve as ``harm triggers.'' %Afterward, 
% We then use our harm triggers to elicit harmful output. %so we can rank the harmfulness of smaller LLMs. 
% We also release the dataset consisting of harm-triggering prompts and human ratings of model responses. %, which while 
%On its own, it is too small to be used with RLHF or DPO methods, but %on these models 
%could help augment other datasets for this purpose. %that could be used in this way.

We also study whether larger and more powerful LLMs with strong reasoning skills, such as GPT4o \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport} or Sonnet \cite{anthropic2024claude}, can reliably evaluate the harmfulness of smaller LLMs. At best, we find moderate agreement between larger LLMs and humans. This demonstrates the need for further research into LLMs for data annotation in subjective tasks. % to enhance consistency.
%In short 
Our contributions are:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item We collect a dataset of harm-triggering prompts and human ratings of the relative harmfulness of responses to those prompts generated by three smaller ($\leq$ 10B) LLMs.\footnote{URL will be provided if paper is accepted.}
    \item We use human ratings on the output triples to rank the smaller models.
    \item We evaluate agreement of similar ratings from large LLMs with the human ratings. %with powerful reasoning capabilities can rate the relative harmfulness of model output
\end{enumerate}

%A second %question 
%issue we study pertains to the high cost of acquiring human ratings. We investigate whether larger and powerful LLMs such as Gpt4o \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport} or Sonnet \cite{anthropic2024claude}, whose harmfulness has been deeply studied and reduced \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport,anthropic2024claude,bai2022training}, can rank the harmfulness %of the data 
%of output from smaller LLMs
%as well as humans do. This adds to the growing literature LLMs for
%data annotation, %using LLMs, 
%highlighting the role of these models not only in reducing annotation costs but also in enhancing the consistency and scalability of annotation %processes
%tasks.
%LLMs can also identify the offensiveness of a text as a classification \cite{pavlovic-poesio-2024-effectiveness,zhu2023can,he2023annollm,inan2023llama}
%In this work, we first show the possibility of eliciting harmful content from small LLMs. Then, we evaluate the harmfulness ranking capability of state-of-the-art LLMs as judges. Our experiments show that models are still behind humans to rank harmfulness responses, but some models behave similarly, resulting in high correlations.

\section{Related Work}
Alongside a discussion of what is meant by LLM harmfulness,
this section covers two distinct strands of related work: measuring types of harm in LLMs, and LLMs for diverse annotation tasks. %First,

%Different kinds of 
Diverse undesirable LLM outputs, from toxic language to privacy invasion, have been discussed in the observed \cite{banko-etal-2020-unified}. Here we review the ones we include in our definition of ``harm.'' %definition. Plus, we review LLMs as judges. 
Toxic content can be elicited from both generative  \cite{deshpande2023toxicity} and masked LLMs \cite{ousidhoum-etal-2021-probing}. 
%Among ways 
To measure toxic or hateful language, some use APIs such as PerspectiveAPI \cite{lees2022new} or HateBERT \cite{caselli-etal-2021-hatebert}. \citet{openai2024gpt4technicalreport} report that GPT4 produces toxic content 0.78\% of the time, versus 6.48\% in GPT3.5.
%as opposed to GPT3.5 with 6.48\%. On the other hand,
\citet{dubey2024llama} report that llama3-70B produces harmful content 5\% of the time, %whereas the 405B model generates harm 3\% of the time. 
compared to 3\% in the 405B model.
Instead of %single value classifiers to measure harm, 
reporting an absolute rate, we focus on relative harmfulness of different LLMs. %, so we point to recent work on LLMs for annotation.

The first category of harm we consider is social stereotyping and bias. %discrimination. It has been shown that 
LLMs can perpetuate social bias based on gender, race, religion etc. \cite{lin-etal-2022-gendered,bender2021dangers,field-etal-2021-survey,gupta-etal-2024-sociodemographic,andriushchenko2024agentharm,mazeika2024harmbench}. This can marginalize these groups more, and results in less fair model performance. \citet{guo2024hey} designed a competition to elicit biased output from LLMs to assess the perception of bias from non-expert users. %The first part of our work is similar to this analysis, but 
We also intentionally elicit harmful output, going %we look at other types of harms besides bias.
beyond social bias.

%When the models become stronger, they become more robust to jailbreaking attacks to elicit harmful content. However, there are datasets that can still jailbreak models to produce harmful content \cite{andriushchenko2024agentharm,mazeika2024harmbench}.

Our second category of harm is offensiveness and toxicity, which %. As opposed to stereotyping or social discrimination, this harm 
%is more subjective and harder to define than the previous category, so there 
lacks an established definition due to its greater subjectivity \cite{dev-etal-2022-measures,korre-etal-2023-harmful}. We include hate speech (HS) and abusive language as toxic content. HS can be defined as expressions of offensive and discriminatory discourse towards a group or an individual based on characteristics such as race, religion, nationality, or other group characteristics \cite{john2000hate,jahan2023systematic,basile2019semeval,davidson2017automated}. It includes racism, negative stereotyping, and sexist language. On the other hand, abusive language is content with inappropriate words such as profanity or disrespectful terms. It also includes psychological threats such as humiliation. %or constant criticism. %Toxic content can be elicited from both generative models \cite{deshpande2023toxicity} and masked language models \cite{ousidhoum-etal-2021-probing}.

%In addition to obvious toxic content, LLMs can generate diverse implicit toxic outputs using reinforcement learning with favoring toxic content in the reward function \cite{wen-etal-2023-unveiling}.  Regarding the subjectivity of this task, \cite{korre-etal-2023-harmful} reannotate the existing datasets with different definitions of toxicity and show that broader definitions result in more robust annotations, but interannotator agreements are still lower than 0.5. \cite{dev-etal-2022-measures} also point out the lack of definition for bias and harm in general and propose a framework to guide researchers during the development of bias measures.

Harm can be implicit, such as privacy invasion
%We are also interested in privacy invasion,
where there is 
leakage of personal information. %leakage from the model. 
%LLMs can memorize details of the training data and then leak private information such as 
This includes social security numbers, phone numbers, or bank account information \cite{carlini2021extracting,brown2022does}. 
%There are several frameworks to test the privacy of LLMs \cite{li2024llm} and generate data for personal attribute inference \cite{yukhymenko2024synthetic,kim2024propile}.

%Our definition of harm includes hate speech (HS) as well. HS can be defined as \textcolor{red}{expressions of} hatred towards a social group, the humiliation of the members of a group, or %communication disparaging  extreme disparagement of a person or a group based on race, color, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other group characteristics .

For data annotation, LLMs
%Besides text generation, 
%LLMs have been used to annotate data because they 
can %be comparable to 
replace humans for some tasks, %and make the annotation process faster and cheaper 
with gains in efficiency and economy \cite{tan2024large}. They have been used for sociological annotations such as for classification of stance, bots or humor  \cite{ziems2024can,zhu2023can}. For tasks such as topic and frame detection or sentence segmentation they can surpass crowd-workers
%Some works show that they can surpass crowd-workers for some tasks such as topic and frame detection or sentence segmentation %into research aspects 
\cite{he2024if,gilardi2023chatgpt}. Some have argued that human-LLM collaboration results in more reliable annotation \cite{he2024if,zhang2023llmaaa,kim2024meganno+}. In addition to more objective tasks,
%LLMs have been used to annotate data %even 
they have been applied to subjective annotations such as offensiveness and abusiveness \cite{pavlovic-poesio-2024-effectiveness,zhu2023can,he2023annollm}, %. For example, LLMs are used as judges to rank responses from different LLMs 
or to rank outputs from different LLMs based on helpfulness, accuracy, or relevance \cite{zheng2023judging,lin2024wildbench,dubois2024length}. These works tend to focus on human-large LLM interactions, whereas we focus on single-turn responses from smaller LLMs. We inspire from \citet{zheng2023judging} but we only measure harm instead of overall performance. Plus, we use 3 LLMs to evaluate smaller LLMs.

\section{Data Collection}

The data was collected %as homework 
in a graduate-level NLP course in Spring 2024 at a public university, %The students worked in pairs and there were 17 groups. 
from 17 pairs of students.
We randomly sampled %human text from HH-RLHF \cite{bai2022training} to have 60 different prompts for each student pair, 
60 different prompts for each student pair (1,020 total human prompts) from the HH-RLHF dataset of human-LLM interactions \cite{bai2022training}.
%leading to 1,020 prompts. %Students were expected 
We selected three LLMs
% Students were instructed to use three models: Mistral 7B-Instruct \cite{jiang2023mistral}, MPT 7B-Instruct \cite{MosaicML2023Introducing}, and StableLM-tuned-alpha-7B \cite{alpaca} because they 
that were open-source, reasonably sized to fit a single GPU, and among the currently best performing models: Mistral 7B-Instruct \cite{jiang2023mistral}, MPT 7B-Instruct \cite{MosaicML2023Introducing}, and StableLM-tuned-alpha-7B \cite{alpaca}. 
Students were instructed to use the same prompts for the three models, %to collect responses, %Then, they 
and to rate %the models based on 
the harmfulness of the three responses, with 0 for not harmful, and harmfulness from 1 to 3 (most) %1 being the least harmful and 3 the most. %If the response was not harmful, that model needed to be labeled as ``N/A''. 
%Responses that were not harmful were labeled "N/A."

Since harm or offensive language is subjective, there is no established definition in the literature. However, for better consistency, we provided students with the following criteria: 
(1) Including %discriminatory or biased 
language that discriminates against, marginalizes, or shows bias towards particular groups based on race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other group characteristic; (2) offensive content, including text that is vulgar, violent, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive to individuals or groups; (3) encouraging or glorifying violence, self-harm, substance abuse, or activities that are illegal, immoral, or unethical; (4) privacy invasion, meaning personal information leakage; (5) encouraging negative social behavior such as bullying, harassment, or spreading hate speech. 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Including discriminatory or biased language that discriminates against, marginalizes, or shows bias towards particular groups based on race, gender, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic
%     \item Offensive Content, text that is vulgar violent, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive to individuals or groups.
%     \item Encouraging or glorifying violence, self-harm, substance abuse, illegal, immoral, or unethical activities.
%     \item Privacy Invasion, where there is a personal information leakage.
%     \item Encouraging negative social behavior such as bullying, harassment, or spreading hate speech
% \end{itemize}
We intentionally excluded misinformation or factuality errors because this requires external knowledge. % hard to evaluate.

%\subsection{Preprocessing For Consistency}
\subsection{Data Cleaning}

% Before analyzing the data, we performed some data cleaning.
Because %of human involvement in the ranking of the models, 
there were some inconsistencies in the data 
returned by the students, %. We, first, cleaned it up and made sure each group has the same 
we standardized the data
format. %In addition to this, some models sometimes did not generate any output, so 
We also discarded cases where the model generated no output.
%because it is not meaningful to decide if an empty text is harmful. After these steps, we have 
These steps left us with 984 distinct prompts (96.5\% of the original), and three labeled responses for each prompt, including 0. To measure the quality of student annotations, two experts (co-authors) annotated 5 examples from each student pair. %These experts were NLP PhD students and are co-authors.
%In addition to annotations from the students, two NLP PhD student \textcolor{red}{co-authors} (experts) annotated 5 examples from each group %to evaluate the relability of students, and we end up with 81 cases after preprocessing.

\section{Results}
%\subsection{Qualitative Results}

%\subsection{General Observations}
%Based on our observations, 
%We observed 
Each model produced harmful output, sometimes in the extreme. %to an extreme degree in quality. %being extremely harsh. %while sometimes outputs extreme harshness or offensive outputs. 
%In addition, 
Although all prompts were in English, some StableLM outputs were in Korean, %, which never happens for the others. This might indicate that 
suggesting exposure to more Korean in its training data.
%This suggeststhere might be more Korean data in the training data of StableLM. 
Repetitiveness and nonsense responses were common for all models, but less so for Mistral, %that suggest 
suggesting a potential issue with fine-tuning. %However, Mistral produced higher quality output, whereas the other two produce nonsensical or unrelated outputs more often. 
Furthermore, Mistral output was more detailed and user-oriented, 
%which comes with the problem of generating 
even including detailed guidance for harmful actions. In addition, we %realize that there is some 
observed output
similar to content present in online websites, such as inclusion of usernames from social media platforms such as Reddit, % in model outputs. This indicates that it is possible to elicit training data from models, that is against privacy preservation.
which is related to the issue of leakage of private information. Below we present the ranking and automated labeling results.

\subsection{Quantitative Ranking Results}
%There are two common behaviors of smaller and weaker LLMs: repeating the question and repeating the answer itself. These behaviors are undesired because they do not provide any useful information and increase the output length unnecessarily. First, we look at these behaviors for these models. These models do not repeat themselves much, Mistral 7b-Instruct model has 3 answer repetitions, MPT 7B-Instruct has 7, and StableLM-tuned-alpha-7b has 6 out of 1020 responses (see Table \ref{tab:repetition_question}). However, the results are more interesting for repeating the question. Mistral 7b-Instruct and StableLM-tuned-alpha-7b repeat the question 62 (6\%) and 65 (6\%) times respectively, whereas MPT 7B-Instruct repeats the question 266 (26\%)  times. These might indicate some problems during instruction fine-tuning of the models or incapability of instruction following. 

%We also look at quantitative results for each model. First, 
During data collection, none of the models were restricted as to the output length. 
Interestingly, sometimes very long outputs of up to 2000 words were generated, usually consisting largely of repetitions and nonsense responses. %, so they stopped generation when the end-of-sequence token was generated. 
%We provide output length distributions in Figure \ref{fig:output_distributions} of the Appendix. The length distributions are %not normal and skewed left. highly left skewed.
%Therefore, in 
Table \ref{tab:output_length} shows the min, median, and max output lengths for each model across the 984 prompts (cf. Appendix Figure \ref{fig:output_distributions} for length plots). % instead of the average and standard deviation. 
 %Interestingly, 
While StableLM %is the model that 
generated the longest output,  it has the lowest median length. %is the lowest.

Mistral, MPT, and StableLM produced harmful content 58\%, 61\%, and  49\% of the time, respectively, in response to our harm triggers. Figure \ref{fig:model_rankings_wo_na},
which excludes examples with at least one 0 rating,
shows that StableLM produced the least harmful output % than the others. 
%This figure excludes examples where at least one model is found non-harmful because including N/A labels changes the meaning of 1, 2, and 3 
. %Moreover, Mistral is mostly rated as 3 (the most harmful). %, indicating its stronger harmfulness. 
Mistral had the most 3s, although Mistral and MPT had similar average ratings; StableLM had the lowest rating. Figure \ref{fig:conf_int_model_ranking} gives the 95\% confidence intervals for the average ratings of each model. %Lastly, Mistral, MPT, and StableLM produced harmful content 58\%, 61\%, and  49\% of the time, respectively, in response to our harm triggers. 

%Regarding the harmfulness of each model for the cases all models are harmful, Figure \ref{fig:model_rankings_wo_na} shows that StableLM produces less harmful output than the others (see Figure \ref{fig:model_rankings} in Appendix for rankings including non-harmful cases). Mistral has more ``rank 3'' examples (the most harmful). %, which is the most harmful ranking. 
%In Figure \ref{fig:conf_int_model_ranking}, we provide the 95\% confidence intervals for the average rankings of the models (Note that N/A is considered as a ranking of 0). StableLM is the most benign model, however, the harmfulness of Mistral and MPT are very similar and the difference is insignificant. In addition, Mistral, MPT, and StableLM produced harmful content 58\%, 61\%, and  49\% of the times respectively.

  \caption{Pairwise wins (least harm).}
  \label{fig:pairwise_comp}
\end{figure}

Besides looking at the overall harmfulness and ratings of the models, we also compare them pairwise. Figure \ref{fig:pairwise_comp} shows that StableLM frequently wins (is less harmful) over the other two; between the other two, there is no clear winner. This is consistent with the previous observation that StableLM produces a lower proportion of harmful output.
%less harmful content than the Mistral and MPT, whereas Mistral and MPT are similar.



\subsection{Automated Harm Detection}

To investigate whether larger LLMs can rate models' harmfulness similarly to humans,
%To rank the harm generated by smaller LLMs, 
we prompt three state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT4o \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport}, Claude3.5 Sonnet \cite{anthropic2024claude}, and LLama3.1 70b-instruct \cite{dubey2024llama}. We provide the same definition of harm we provided to students, and use zero-shot and zero-shot CoT \cite{wei2022chain}. %You can find 
The exact prompts 
can be found 
in Tables \ref{tab:prompt} and \ref{tab:prompt_cot} of the Appendix.

The relative ratings in our data range from 0 (non-harmful) to 3 (the most harmful). %They are relative to each other, so they are not categorical values. In addition, 
Note that when there is at least one non-harmful response, the meaning of the relative values changes. For example, 
consider the %one ranking 
examples %could be 
``$1,2,3$'' and %another could be 
``$0,0,1$'': ``1'' means the least harmful in the first example but the most harmful in the latter. Due to the relative nature of the labels, Pearson is not applicable, and %Therefore, it is tricky to measure the correlations between rankings. 
rank correlation coefficients are not suitable because they are not defined if the array is constant (e.g., all 0s). Inter-annotator agreement metrics such as Krippendorf's alpha \cite{krippendorff11}, which rely on frequency of label values, are also not applicable. We use Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) \cite{webber2010similarity}. RBO measures the similarity of indefinite rankings, where some items %do not exist in the ranking, 
might not be given a rank,
top elements are more important than the tail, and the decision to truncate the ranking at any depth is arbitrary. %% Becky: could not understand these
%% next sentences: Very Unclear
%% We formulate our ranking as returning the most harmful responses. This way, if the response is labeled as not harmful, it is not included. Therefore, we do not need to deal with ties, although RBO can handle them. 
RBO can handle ties, and can measure the similarity between different length arrays, so it fits well to our case. RBO provides a value between 0 and 1 where 1 means perfect similarity, calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}  
(1-p) \sum^{\infty}_{d=0} p^{d-1} A_d
\end{equation} 
The parameter $p$ adjusts the importance of top rankings relative to the tails; $d$ represents a position/depth in the ranking; $A_d$, % represents 
the agreement at depth $d$, is calculated as the intersection of the rankings at depth $d$ divided by $d$. We set $p$ close to 1, so each label value %rank position 
is equally important.

%Table \ref{tab:spearman_all} and Table \ref{tab:spearman_expert} show the Spearman correlations for the whole data and data annotated by the experts, respectively. Results show that LLMs are not as good as average humans with zero-shot setting. Among the models, GPT4o is the best model, followed by Sonnet. Interestingly, the correlation between GPT4o and Sonnet is as high as that between experts and students. This shows the similarity of these models in harm detection.

\section{Conclusion}

While alignment methods applied to larger LLMs have led to relatively low rates of harmfulness, smaller LLMs can also benefit from harm mitigation. Our results indicate that harm triggers applied to small LLMs ($\leq$ 10B) can lead to harmful outputs over half the time. Our dataset of 984 harm triggers and rating triples for three models' outputs has potential use for harm mitigation.  We also assessed large LLM harmfulness ranking as a means of  automating the collection of harmfulness preference data. However, pairwise RBO scores show that harmfulness ratings from large LLMs are not commensurate with human ratings.

%In this work, we showed that more work is needed to mitigate the harmfulness from small LLMs. Our results show that they generate harm more frequently than larger ones. By prompting small LLMs with harm triggers, it is possible to elicit harmful content 50\% of the time. In addition to the generation of harmfulness, we investigated the potential use of large LLMs to rate the harmfulness of responses from small LLMs. We evaluated three state-of-the-art models. The best model, Sonnet, results in a 0.67 RBO score with students and 0.57 with experts. This indicate that LLMs cannot yet replace humans for this task. We believe that our work underscores the need to create safer LLMs and to be cautious in the use of LLMs as judges in subjective tasks. 

%In this work, we showed the possibility of eliciting harmful content from small LLMs and the ineffectiveness of larger LLMs in ranking output with respect to harmfullness. Small LLMs can produce harmful content at least 50\% of the time by only prompting. On the other hand, larger LLMs do not correlate well with the student annotators and expert annotators in terms of rankings. The best model is Sonnet with a 0.67 RBO score with students and 0.57 with the experts. Human correlations are still higher than LLM correlations, indicating the need for improvement. We believe that our work underscores the need to create safer LLMs and to be cautious to use LLMs as judges in subjective tasks. 

\section{Limitations}
We experiment with three small LLMs and there are stronger LLMs such as Llama3.1-8b. We also did not apply any sophisticated methods to elicit harmful content because we would like to simulate an average user. Furthermore, we use three SOTA LLMs as judges with two different prompting. There might be better models or prompts that can improve the correlation of LLMs with humans.
