\par In this section, we review research on UAV-assisted hybrid MEC-DC architecture, joint optimization for MEC and DC, and optimization approaches. Moreover, Table~\ref{tab:works comparison} illustrates the differences between the state-of-the-art works and this work.

\subsection{UAV-Assisted Hybrid MEC-DC Architecture}

\par UAVs have been widely applied to assist MEC services in some scenarios. For example, Yu \textit{et al.}, "Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV Aided Edge Computing" studied the optimization problem of collaborative services on UAV and edge clouds, and they proposed a system to control a UAV to provide MEC service in areas where existing edge clouds are inaccessible to IoT devices. Moreover, Zhan \textit{et al.}, "Multi-UAV Assisted MEC System for Time-Sensitive Tasks" developed a framework for a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs with edge servers offer flexible computing support to IoT devices with time-sensitive requirements. Due to their flexibility and mobility, UAVs can directly collect data from GUs by flying close to them and have drawn significant attention from researchers. For instance, Dandapat \textit{et al.}, "Optimization of Three-Dimensional Trajectory of UAV-Assisted DC Network" studied a multi-UAV-assisted DC network, optimizing the three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of the UAVs as well as resource allocation for DC from mobile nodes. Moreover, Liu \textit{et al.}, "UAV Assisted DC System with Multiple Monitoring Regions and Base Stations" investigated the trajectory optimization problem of a UAV performing DC tasks in an area containing multiple monitoring regions and multiple base stations in a UAV-assisted DC system. 

\par Previous works on UAV-assisted MEC or UAV-assisted DC primarily focused on separate studies while ignoring the requirements for the scenarios containing both MEC and DC users. Specifically, in real-world scenarios, there may not only compute-intensive tasks to perform, but also large amounts of stored data that require UAV to perform additional data collection tasks. For example, in a smart city environment, UAVs may be required to assist with real-time video analysis for traffic management while simultaneously gathering sensor data from distributed IoT devices, such as air quality sensors, temperature monitors, or noise detectors. Therefore, the UAV assisted hybrid MEC-DC scenarios need further exploration.

\par There have been some studies involving both MEC and DC. For example, Zeng \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Assisted DC and MEC: A Joint Optimization Model" investigated the UAV-assisted DC and MEC scenario, constructed a new theoretical model for DC rate, and defined the quality of requirement (QoR) for real-time processing. By optimizing the UAV trajectory, resource allocation and task duration, while meeting quality of service and UAV mobility constraints, they were able to reduce the energy consumption of the UAV and task completion time. However, in this work, the UAV only supports data acquisition and relies on nearby MEC servers to fulfill computational requirements. Liu \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Enabled Wireless Power Transfer for IoT Devices" investigated a space-air-ground power IoT system and proposed a UAV-enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) framework, where UAVs transfer energy to devices for DC via WPT, utilize MEC for data processing, and eventually forward the data to low earth orbit satellites. Subsequently, they aimed to minimize the average age of information (AoI) of devices by optimizing the number of UAV hovering positions, hovering locations, UAV-device connections, energy transmission, DC time, UAV computational resources, flight speed, and trajectory. However, in Wang \textit{et al.}, "Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for Multi-UAV Aided Edge Computing", both DC and MEC are completed on the same UAV, and the collected data is actually the data needed for task offloading, which did not consider the conflict between separate MEC and DC systems. Moreover, neither Chen \textit{et al.}, "Multi-UAV Assisted MEC System for Time-Sensitive Tasks" nor Yu \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Assisted Wireless-Powered IoT Network: A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Approach" considered the co-channel interference among UAVs.

\subsection{Joint Optimization and Resource Allocation}

\par In recent years, researchers have focused on joint optimization and resource allocation for UAV-assisted MEC-DC systems. For instance, Zeng \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Assisted DC and MEC: A Joint Optimization Model" proposed a joint optimization model that considers both MEC and DC tasks. This model optimizes the UAV's trajectory, resource allocation, and task duration to minimize energy consumption and task completion time. Similarly, Liu \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Enabled Wireless Power Transfer for IoT Devices" proposed a WPT framework that enables UAVs to transfer energy to devices for DC via WPT.

\subsection{Optimization Methods}

\par Various optimization methods have been employed in the literature to optimize UAV-assisted MEC-DC systems. For example, Zeng \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Assisted DC and MEC: A Joint Optimization Model" used a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to solve the joint optimization problem. Liu \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Enabled Wireless Power Transfer for IoT Devices" employed a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to optimize the WPT framework.

\subsection{Simulation and Experimentation}

\par To evaluate the performance of UAV-assisted MEC-DC systems, researchers have conducted simulations and experiments using various tools and platforms. For instance, Zeng \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Assisted DC and MEC: A Joint Optimization Model" used MATLAB to simulate the joint optimization problem and evaluate the system's performance. Liu \textit{et al.}, "UAV-Enabled Wireless Power Transfer for IoT Devices" conducted experiments using a WPT testbed to demonstrate the feasibility of their proposed framework.
