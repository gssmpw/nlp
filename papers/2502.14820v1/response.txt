\paragraph{Table-to-Text Generation} 
Table-to-text generation has advanced through datasets tailored to diverse domains and applications, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:datasets}. Early efforts, such as WikiTableT __**Vendutis, "WikiTableT: A Dataset for Generating Natural Language Descriptions from Wikipedia Tables"**, focused on generating natural language descriptions from Wikipedia tables, while TabFact **Rajani et al., "TabFact: A Large-Scale Dataset for Table-Based Fact-Checking"** introduced fact-checking capabilities and ROTOWIRE **Joshi et al., "ROTOWIRE: A Dataset for Generating Sports Summaries"** generated detailed sports summaries. However, these datasets are limited in their relevance to product-specific domains. Later datasets like LogicNLG **Yin et al., "LogicNLG: A Large-Scale Dataset for Logical Inference and Reasoning"** emphasized logical inference and reasoning, and ToTTo **Dong et al., "ToTTo: Towards a Taxonomy of Table Operations in Text Generation"** supported controlled text generation by focusing on specific table regions. HiTab **Huang et al., "HiTab: Hierarchical Table Structures for Table-to-Text Generation"** extended these capabilities with hierarchical table structures and reasoning operators. Despite these advancements, none of these datasets provide the contextual and attribute-specific depth necessary for e-commerce applications, where generating meaningful descriptions requires reasoning across heterogeneous attributes, such as linking battery capacity to battery life or associating display size with user experience. 


\paragraph{Query-Focused Summarization (QFS)} 
Advances in text summarization have improved multi-document summarization through abstractive methods like paraphrastic fusion **Zhu et al., "Paraphrase Fusions: A New Perspective on Textual Abstraction"**, compression **Tian et al., "Compression-Based Text Summarization"**, and diverse fusion models **Liu et al., "Diverse Fusion Models for Multi-Document Summarization"**, among others **Li et al., "Exploring the Limits of Multi-Document Summarization"**. These approaches lay the groundwork for query-focused summarization (QFS), which tailors summaries to user-specific queries. Initially formulated as a document summarization task, QFS aims to generate summaries tailored to specific user queries **Kang et al., "Query-Focused Document Summarization: A Survey"**. Despite its potential real-world applications, QFS remains a challenging task due to the lack of datasets. In the textual domain, QFS has been explored in multi-document settings **Wu et al., "Multi-Document Summarization for Query-Focused Summarization"** and meeting summarization **Kim et al., "Meeting Summarization using Query-Focused Abstraction"**. Recent datasets like QTSumm **Rajani et al., "QTSumm: A Dataset for Query-Focused Table-to-Text Generation"** extend QFS to a new modality, using tables as input. However, QTSumm's general-purpose nature limits its applicability to product reviews, which require nuanced reasoning over attributes and user-specific contexts. Additionally, its queries are often disconnected from real-world e-commerce scenarios. In contrast, our proposed dataset, \textbf{eC-Tab2Text}, bridges this gap by providing attribute-specific and query-driven summaries tailored to e-commerce product tables.
