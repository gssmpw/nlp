\paragraph{Table-to-Text Generation} 
Table-to-text generation has advanced through datasets tailored to diverse domains and applications, as summarized in Table \ref{tab:datasets}. Early efforts, such as WikiTableT ____, focused on generating natural language descriptions from Wikipedia tables, while TabFact ____ introduced fact-checking capabilities and ROTOWIRE ____ generated detailed sports summaries. However, these datasets are limited in their relevance to product-specific domains. Later datasets like LogicNLG ____ emphasized logical inference and reasoning, and ToTTo ____ supported controlled text generation by focusing on specific table regions. HiTab ____ extended these capabilities with hierarchical table structures and reasoning operators. Despite these advancements, none of these datasets provide the contextual and attribute-specific depth necessary for e-commerce applications, where generating meaningful descriptions requires reasoning across heterogeneous attributes, such as linking battery capacity to battery life or associating display size with user experience. 


\paragraph{Query-Focused Summarization (QFS)} 
Advances in text summarization have improved multi-document summarization through abstractive methods like paraphrastic fusion ____, compression ____, and diverse fusion models ____, among others ____. These approaches lay the groundwork for query-focused summarization (QFS), which tailors summaries to user-specific queries. Initially formulated as a document summarization task, QFS aims to generate summaries tailored to specific user queries ____. Despite its potential real-world applications, QFS remains a challenging task due to the lack of datasets. In the textual domain, QFS has been explored in multi-document settings ____ and meeting summarization ____. Recent datasets like QTSumm ____ extend QFS to a new modality, using tables as input. However, QTSumm's general-purpose nature limits its applicability to product reviews, which require nuanced reasoning over attributes and user-specific contexts. Additionally, its queries are often disconnected from real-world e-commerce scenarios. In contrast, our proposed dataset, \textbf{eC-Tab2Text}, bridges this gap by providing attribute-specific and query-driven summaries tailored to e-commerce product tables.
