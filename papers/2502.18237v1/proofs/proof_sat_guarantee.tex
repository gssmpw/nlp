\begin{thm}%
    Let $\Pi$ be a finite and satisfiable set of constraints. For any sample $\sample$ and variable ordering, the corresponding sample $\lsymb(\sample)$ satisfies $\Pi$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    We prove the statement by induction over the number $n$ of variables appearing in $\Pi$. 

    Let $n=0$. In this case $\Pi$  is satisfied by any sample $\sample$, and $\lsymb(\sample) = \sample$.

    Let $n > 1$.     Let $x_i$ be the last variable in the ordering occurring in $\Pi$.
    Since $\Pi_{i-1}$ contains $(n-1)$ variables, $\lsymb(\sample)$ satisfies $\Pi_{i-1}$ by the inductive hypothesis. From Lemma~\ref{lemma:extendibility} we know that $\Pisi$ is satisfiable, and hence the thesis follows from Lemma~\ref{lemma:single_var}.
\end{proof}
