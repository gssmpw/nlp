\begin{thm}%
    Let $\Pi$ be a finite and satisfiable set of constraints. For any sample $\sample$ and variable ordering, the corresponding sample $\lsymb(\sample)$ is optimal wrt $\sample$, $\Pi$ and the variable ordering.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    We prove the statement by induction over the number $n$ of variables occurring in $\Pi$.

    Let $n=0$. In this case $\Pi$ is satisfied by any sample $\sample$, and $\lsymb(\sample)= \sample$.

    Let $n > 1$.     Let $x_i$ be the last variable in the ordering occurring in $\Pi$.
Since $\Pi_{i-1}$ contains only the variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots x_{i-1}$, we know that for any sample $\sample$, $\lsymb(\sample)$ is optimal with respect to $\sample$, $\Pi_{i-1}$ and the variable ordering for the inductive hypothesis. From Lemma~\ref{lemma:extendibility} we know that  $\Pisi$ is satisfiable. From Lemma~\ref{lemma:single_var} we know that for every $\sample$, $\lsymb(\sample)$ is optimal wrt to $\sample$ and $\Pisi$, and hence the thesis.
