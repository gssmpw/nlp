abstract="How to minimize misclassification errors has been the main focus of Inductive learning techniques, such as CART and C4.5. However, misclassification error is not the only error in classification problem. Recently, researchers have begun to consider both test and misclassification costs. Previous works assume the test cost and the misclassification cost must be defined on the same cost scale. However, sometimes we may meet difficulty to define the multiple costs on the same cost scale. In this paper, we address the problem by building a cost-sensitive decision tree by involving two kinds of cost scales, that minimizes the one kind of cost and control the other in a given specific budget. Our work will be useful for many diagnostic tasks involving target cost minimization and resource consumption for obtaining missing information.",

abstract = {In recent years, many accurate decision support systems have been constructed as black boxes, that is as systems that hide their internal logic to the user. This lack of explanation constitutes both a practical and an ethical issue. The literature reports many approaches aimed at overcoming this crucial weakness, sometimes at the cost of sacrificing accuracy for interpretability. The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},
