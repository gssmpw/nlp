    \Description {This is a visual chart designed to organize relationships and connections in the Harry Potter universe. There are three columns of labeled sections. In the middle, there are four sections, each representing one of the Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor (red), Hufflepuff (yellow), Slytherin (green), and Ravenclaw (blue). Each house box has its crest. To the left, there are two smaller boxes. The top-left box is labeled ``Best Friends / Romantic Relationship(s),'' featuring small images of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley, with a space for a name or nickname. Below this, there is a smaller box labeled ``House Elf,'' featuring a picture of Dobby holding a glowing object and an area for a name. 
    To the right, there are two more boxes. The top-right box is labeld ``Family,'' containing images of Sirius Black, James and Lily Potter, and the Dursley family. Below this, another box is labeld ``Profs \& Other Adults,'' displaying images of Severus Snape, Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall, and Hagrid.
    At the bottom, there are three large sections. The leftmost section is labeled ``Muggles'' with a blank space.
    The middle section, labeld ``Students from Other magical Schools,'' displays crests from Beauxbatons, Durmstrang, Ilvermorny, and Castelobruxo.
    The rightmost section, labeled ``Quidditch Team Members,'' features an image of a Quidditch team in red robes.
    Each section contains an empty space for names or details to be added.}
