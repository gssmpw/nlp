    \caption{An AI-generated illustration envisioning a platform whose design reflects a synthesis of participants' ideas. It is a 3D, open-world social media world with personal spaces---where users mirror their identity and interests---and community areas that support shared activities and memories. These homes exist in a neighborhood-based spatial design, where proximity mirrors social closeness, enabling intentional navigation and serendipitous interactions rather than passive scrolling. The neighborhood also includes themed social rooms and community spaces for public gatherings and interest-based group interactions. Users can visit friends' homes and explore shared memories and content, similar to a Pensieve, with selective access control over different areas, rooms, and objects, ensuring privacy and customizable levels of sharing. An intelligent pet guide assists in exploration, connection, and engagement, fostering personal expression and meaningful interactions beyond traditional social media.}
    \Description {A whimsical digital illustration depicting a fantasy-style virtual neighborhood at night, with warm glowing houses, cobblestone pathways, and floating orbs of light. The left side shows a village scene, where small, cozy houses are arranged in a grid, surrounded by gardens, fences, and street lamps. A blue glowing node and arrow highlight one particular house, linking it to the right-side image. The right side provides a closer view inside a warmly lit home, where a young girl in a sweater and dress interacts with a cake on a wooden table. A small holographic memory scene emerges from the cake with a floating, glowing pool of light, depicting a group of people joyfully gathered around the cake. A curious orange dog watches nearby. Shelves filled with books, a spiral staircase, and a glowing lantern enhance the cozy, magical atmosphere. The image suggests an interactive, immersive social media experience, where users can explore virtual homes and relive shared memories.}
