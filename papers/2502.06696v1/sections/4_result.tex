\section{Results}
Participants articulated frustrations with current social media and envisioned Social Media at Hogwarts (SMH) as a transformative 3D platform prioritizing authentic connections with close friends.
They proposed customizable personal spaces, communal areas fostering meaningful interactions, and immersive shared experiences like gaming or walking together.
They suggested features that allow users to share expressively, such as memory sharing and real-time updates via avatars or aesthetics alongside low-intensity interactions that offer presence and nuanced privacy. Participants prioritized user control over feed content, fostering closer relationships over unsolicited interactions. Table~\ref{tab:results-overview} summarizes this section, while Figure~\ref{fig:synthesis} visualizes the collective vision, and Appendix ~\ref{tab:participant-summary} outlines key features per participant.%presents an AI-generated visualization synthesizing the key features collectively envisioned by the participants.
