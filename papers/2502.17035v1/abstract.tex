We provide a constructive proof for the convergence of Dolev \emph{et
al}'s BFS spanning tree algorithm running under the general assumption
of an unfair daemon.  Already known proofs of this algorithm are
either using non-constructive principles (e.g., proofs by
contradiction) or are restricted to less general execution daemons
(e.g., weakly fair).  In this work, we address these limitations by
defining the well-founded orders and potential functions ensuring
convergence in the general case.  The proof has been fully formalized
in PADEC, a Coq-based framework for certification of
self-stabilization algorithm.
