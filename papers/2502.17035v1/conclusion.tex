In this paper, we provide the first constructive proof for the
convergence of the Dolev \emph{et al} BFS Spanning Tree algorithm
under the most general execution assumptions (\ie, unfair daemon,
unbounded variables).
The convergence proof has been fully formalized and automatically
checked using the PADEC framework.
Contrarily to many papers about formal certified proofs of distributed
algorithms, we do not formalize and validate an existing
proof. Rather, due to the constructive aspect of the proofs allowed in
Coq, we had to develop a new proof: we have defined a novel potential
function, allowing a finer comprehension of the system executions
towards terminal configurations.
We believe that, even though the algorithm time complexity is
exponential, this potential function will open the door to a tighter
complexity analysis.
