abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motorneurons of the bulbar, cervical, thoracic, or lumbar segments. Bulbar presentation is a devastating characteristic that impairs patients’ ability to communicate and is linked to shorter survival. Early acoustic manifestation of voice symptoms, such as dysarthria, is very variable, making its detection and classification challenging, both by human specialists and automatic systems. In this context, precision medicine, defined as “prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account”, has gained a great interest in the ALS community. Specifically, the use of innovative Artificial Intelligence techniques, such as Machine Learning, plays a pivotal role in finding specific patterns in the data set to help neurologists in clinical decision-making. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to find new markers, and new patterns, to promptly detect the possible presence of dysarthria and to correctly classify its severity. We have performed an acoustic analysis on different voice signals of various degrees of impairment acquired during outpatient visits at the ALS center of the “Federico II” University Hospital. From the collected signals, a new database containing different acoustic parameters was realized, on which several experiments were performed. The study led us to the discovery of markers that helped to develop a decision tree that separated healthy subjects from patients and, among patients, those with different severity of dysarthria. This model achieved good results in terms of dysarthria classification accuracy, 86.6%, which is excellent considering the small number of subjects in the data set.}

abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is incurable neurological disorder with rapidly progressive course. Common early symptoms of ALS are difficulty in swallowing and speech. However, early acoustic manifestation of speech and voice symptoms is very variable, that making their detection very challenging, both by human specialists and automatic systems. This study presents an approach to voice assessment for automatic system that separates healthy people from patients with ALS. In particular, this work focus on analysing of sustain phonation of vowels /a/ and/i/ to perform automatic classification of ALS patients. A wide range of acoustic features such as MFCC, formants, jitter, shimmer, vibrato, PPE, GNE, HNR, etc. were analysed. We also proposed a new set of acoustic features for characterizing harmonic structure of the vowels. Calculation of these features is based on pitch synchronized voice analysis. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to classify the phonation produced by patients with ALS and those by healthy individuals. Several algorithms of feature selection were tested to find optimal feature subset for LDA model. The study’s experiments show that the most successful LDA model based on 32 features picked out by LASSO feature selection algorithm attains 99.7% accuracy with 99.3% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity. Among the classifiers with a small number of features, we can highlight LDA model with 5 features, which has 89.0% accuracy (87.5% sensitivity and 90.4% specificity).}

abstract="Background: Bulbar involvement is a term used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that refers to motor neuron impairment in the corticobulbar area of the brainstem, which produces a dysfunction of speech and swallowing. One of the earliest symptoms of bulbar involvement is voice deterioration characterized by grossly defective articulation; extremely slow, laborious speech; marked hypernasality; and severe harshness. Bulbar involvement requires well-timed and carefully coordinated interventions. Therefore, early detection is crucial to improving the quality of life and lengthening the life expectancy of patients with ALS who present with this dysfunction. Recent research efforts have focused on voice analysis to capture bulbar involvement. Objective: The main objective of this paper was (1) to design a methodology for diagnosing bulbar involvement efficiently through the acoustic parameters of uttered vowels in Spanish, and (2) to demonstrate that the performance of the automated diagnosis of bulbar involvement is superior to human diagnosis. Methods: The study focused on the extraction of features from the phonatory subsystem---jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and pitch---from the utterance of the five Spanish vowels. Then, we used various supervised classification algorithms, preceded by principal component analysis of the features obtained. Results: To date, support vector machines have performed better (accuracy 95.8{\%}) than the models analyzed in the related work. We also show how the model can improve human diagnosis, which can often misdiagnose bulbar involvement. Conclusions: The results obtained are very encouraging and demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the automated model presented in this paper. It may be an appropriate tool to help in the diagnosis of ALS by multidisciplinary clinical teams, in particular to improve the diagnosis of bulbar involvement. ",

Monitoring the progression of ALS is of fundamental importance due to the wide variability in disease outlook that exists across patients. This progression is typically tracked using the ALS functional rating scale - revised (ALSFRS-R), which is the current clinical assessment of a patient{'}s level of functional impairment including speech and other motor tasks. In this paper, we investigated automatic estimation of the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscore from acoustic and articulatory movement samples. Experimental results demonstrated the AFSFRS-R bulbar subscore can be predicted from speech samples, which has clinical implication for automatic monitoring of the disease progression of ALS using speech information.",
