\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced SimBEV, a randomized synthetic data generation tool that is extensively configurable and scalable, supports a wide array of sensors, incorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground truth, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and 3D object detection. To showcase SimBEV, we used it to create the SimBEV dataset, a comprehensive large-scale driving dataset, which we used to benchmark BEV perception models and compare different sensing modalities. We hope that SimBEV empowers researchers in exploring a variety of computer vision tasks. Future work will focus on improving SimBEV and enabling vehicle-to-everything (V2X) data collection.
