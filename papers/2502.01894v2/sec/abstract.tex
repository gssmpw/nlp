Bird's-eye view (BEV) perception has garnered significant attention in autonomous driving in recent years, in part because BEV representation facilitates multi-modal sensor fusion. BEV representation enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation, a concise view of the environment useful for planning a vehicle's trajectory. However, this representation is not fully supported by existing datasets, and creation of new datasets for this purpose can be a time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, we introduce SimBEV. SimBEV is a randomized synthetic data generation tool that is extensively configurable and scalable, supports a wide array of sensors, incorporates information from multiple sources to capture accurate BEV ground truth, and enables a variety of perception tasks including BEV segmentation and 3D object detection. SimBEV is used to create the SimBEV dataset, a large collection of annotated perception data from diverse driving scenarios. SimBEV and the SimBEV dataset are open and available to the public.
