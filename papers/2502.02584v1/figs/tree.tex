    \caption{Illustrative example of constructing a exploration tree. Grey nodes represent the branches with a zero outcome reward. Once the leaf node with a zero outcome reward is detected, a \texttt{Stop expansion} signal will be sent back to the first unexpanded node on the branch. Green nodes are on branches where zero outcome reward is not detected and can keep expanding.}
