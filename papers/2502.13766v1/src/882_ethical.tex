\rparagraph{Country and Region Definitions}
%
\dsname adopts the country and region classifications from the UNESCO ICH dataset.
%
While these classifications are widely used, we recognize the potential for differing interpretations.
%

\rparagraph{Potentially Offensive Questions}
%
We employed semi-automatic data generation strategies to create the \sivqa dataset.
%
Here, the silver data was generated using GPT-4o, which we showed displays significant cultural biases towards Western contexts.
%
Although we provided the model with high-quality ground-truth information from the UNESCO ICH project and trained expert annotators with diverse cultural backgrounds to filter low-quality VQA samples, certain questions or their answers might still be offensive to people with certain cultural origins.
%
Since this is subjective, we need to accept it as is for now.
%
Nevertheless, we encourage contacting us if any offensive or otherwise harmful sample raises someone's attention.
