# Task Strategy

Before generating a question-answer pair, first think step-by-step and analyse the image:

1. What is visible in the image? Generate a highly detailed description of the key elements, objects, or people in the image. Take into account the textual description provided to identify details.
2. How does the visible content relate to the intangible cultural heritage item? Identify the connection between the contents of the image and the intangible cultural heritage item.

Then, think step-by-step about potential questions:

1. What can be asked about the image that is directly related to the visible content and the intangible cultural heritage item?
2. Can a concise and clear answer to the questions be inferred from the image and the provided information?

Finally, think step-by-step before generating the final question-answer pairs:

1. Does the question-answer pair strictly adhere to the guidelines provided above? Percisly check every part of the guidelines and drop the question-answer pair if it does not meet the criteria.
2. What aspect of the intangible cultural heritage item is targeted with the question?
3. What category does the question fall into?

# Output Format

For each question-answer pair, provide the following information in the following format:
