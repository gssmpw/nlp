\subsection{Cultural Knowledge QA}
\label{sec:ckqa}
%
In \dsname Cultural Knowledge QA (\ckqa), we evaluate whether current AI models capture fine-grained cultural knowledge.
%
%Unlike \coqa, which tests coarse-grained cultural origins, \ckqa focuses on detailed knowledge of CEFs.
%
The dataset supports two open-answer tasks: naming (\ckqan) and describing (\ckqad).
%
For \ckqan, the ground truth corresponds to the title of the CEF, while for \ckqad, it is the detailed description.
%
For both tasks, we leverage all 728 CEFs from UNESCO ICH.
%
As with \coqa, \ckqa supports multiple input configurations: text-only, ``image-only'', and text+image.
%
We provide examples and prompts for all variations in \S\ref{appendix:sec:ckqa:prompts}.
