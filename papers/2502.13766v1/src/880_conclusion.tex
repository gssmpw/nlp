\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%
We introduce \dsname, a comprehensive benchmark to assess various aspects of cultural knowledge of current LVLMs and LLMs and introduce six tasks built upon three novel datasets, which span 728 unique cultural events or facets (CEFs) from 144 countries grouped into six global macro-regions.
%
Through extensive analyses, we study general cultural biases and the influence of model size, input modalities, and external cues.
%
Our results consistently reveal a prominent bias toward Western cultures across all models.
%
Interestingly, when only coarse cultural knowledge is required---such as regional origins---models performed remarkably better.
%
Across all tasks, significant correlations between a model's performance and its size are evident, with a substantial gap between proprietary and open-weight models.
%
Our analyses show that while models grasp broad cultural categories, they struggle with nuanced understanding.
%
This suggests that \dsname poses a challenging benchmark and highlights the need for further advances in modeling broad cultural awareness.
