This paper formulates the alignment problem via NLL estimation and propose sampling-based solutions for better PO. Compared to DPO, our CD based MC-PO adds approximately $30 \%$ training time because of the computations required by the MCMC kernel. Also we run MC-PO's MCMC kernel for a single step and this is typically sub-optimal because executing the MCMC chain for multiple steps is essential to acquire high-quality samples \citep{hinton2002training}, which will further adds more  computational overhead to PO training. As future research, we aim to showcase the benefits of utilizing a multi-step MCMC based PO solutions and will develop more efficient training algorithms to speed up these algorithms.
