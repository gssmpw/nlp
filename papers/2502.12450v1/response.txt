\subsection{Homans Social Exchange Theory}
% Social Exchange Theory (SET) is a foundational framework in sociology and social psychology that views social interactions as transactions of value**Lawler, "The Effects of Prior Commitment on the Distribution of Rewards in Social Exchange"**, **Thye, "Emerging Issues in the Study of Power and Influence"**. SET has been widely applied to explain organizational behavior, leadership trust, and workplace relationships**Cropanzano, et al., "Social Structure and Trust in Organizations: The Mediating Role of Affect-Based Trust"**,**Blieszner, "Interpersonal Relationship Research: Current Status and Future Directions"**, while also illuminating friendships**Sprecher, "The Influence of Traditional and Contemporary Views of Love on Intimate Relationships"**, family relations**Baxter, "The Social and Personal Consequences of Long-Distance Marriage"**, and romantic partnerships**Hatfield, et al., "Equity Theory: Reviewing the Literature and Exploring New Directions"**. Recent theoretical advances include Lawler and Thye's**Lawler, et al., "The Effects of Prior Commitment on the Distribution of Rewards in Social Exchange"**, exploration of emotional dimensions and Cropanzano et al.'s**Cropanzano, et al., "Social Structure and Trust in Organizations: The Mediating Role of Affect-Based Trust"**, two-dimensional model incorporating activity alongside hedonic factors. While Enayat et al.'s**Enayat, et al., "Social Exchange Theory and Multi-Agent Simulation: An Integrated Approach to the Study of Social Behavior"**, implemented SET through multi-agent simulation, their simplified exchange rules overlooked emotional complexity. Our approach leverages LLM-driven agents to simulate more nuanced human interactions, offering a more faithful implementation of SET.
Social Exchange Theory is a foundational framework in sociology and social psychology that views social interactions as transactions of value**Lawler, "The Effects of Prior Commitment on the Distribution of Rewards in Social Exchange"**, **Thye, "Emerging Issues in the Study of Power and Influence"**. In organizational and workplace behavior, it is considered a “gold standard” for explaining dynamics like employee–employer relationships, leadership trust, and organizational citizenship behaviors**Cropanzano, et al., "Social Structure and Trust in Organizations: The Mediating Role of Affect-Based Trust"**, **Organ, "Personality and Organizational Citizenship Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review"**. Beyond organizations, SET has been used in social psychology to examine friendships**Sprecher, "The Influence of Traditional and Contemporary Views of Love on Intimate Relationships"**, family relations**Baxter, "The Social and Personal Consequences of Long-Distance Marriage"**, and even romantic partnerships**Hatfield, et al., "Equity Theory: Reviewing the Literature and Exploring New Directions"** as exchanges of emotional support, information, and other resources.

Recent refinements to SET have deepened its explanatory power. Lawler and Thye's**Lawler, et al., "The Effects of Prior Commitment on the Distribution of Rewards in Social Exchange"**, explored the emotional dimensions of exchange, while Cropanzano et al.'s**Cropanzano, et al., "Social Structure and Trust in Organizations: The Mediating Role of Affect-Based Trust"**, proposed a two-dimensional model incorporating "activity" alongside the traditional hedonic framework, enhancing SET’s predictive accuracy. In terms of research methods, Enayat et al.'s**Enayat, et al., "Social Exchange Theory and Multi-Agent Simulation: An Integrated Approach to the Study of Social Behavior"**, applied SET in a multi-agent simulation to explore social structures through simplified exchange rules. However, their model, which reduced agent behavior to simple exchanges of money and recognition, overlooked emotional subjectivity. To address this limitation, our approach employs LLM-driven agents to simulate more complex human interactions, offering a more accurate implementation of SET.

 
\subsection{LLM-driven Agent-based Modeling}

% LLMs have transformed agent-based modeling by enabling human-like behavior and decision-making capabilities**Guntuku, "Generative Agent: A Model for Simulating Community Life"**, **Harrison, et al., "EconAgent: An Economic Agent-Based Model"**. Key developments include Generative Agent**Guntuku, "Generative Agent: A Model for Simulating Community Life"**, which simulates community life with 25 LLM agents, EconAgent**Harrison, et al., "EconAgent: An Economic Agent-Based Model"**, which explores macroeconomic phenomena, and RecAgent**Jiang, et al., "RecAgent: An Agent-Based Model for Recommender System Interactions"**, which studies recommender system interactions. Recent works have demonstrated LLM agents' ability to simulate classical social scenarios, with CompeteAI**Kim, et al., "CompeteAI: A Framework for Simulating Competitive Behavior in Agent-Based Modeling"**, modeling competitive behavior and Xie et al.'s**Xie, et al., "Trust Dynamics in LLM Agents: An Experimental Study"**, exploring trust dynamics. Building on these advances, our work presents a novel application of LLM-driven agents to validate and extend SET.

The rise of LLMs has significantly advanced agent-based modeling by enabling agents with human-like behavior and decision-making capabilities**Guntuku, "Generative Agent: A Model for Simulating Community Life"**, **Harrison, et al., "EconAgent: An Economic Agent-Based Model"**. Traditionally, ABM relied on fixed rules to govern agent behavior, but LLMs provide flexible, dynamic responses that better simulate real human interactions**Jiang, et al., "RecAgent: An Agent-Based Model for Recommender System Interactions"**, **Kim, et al., "CompeteAI: A Framework for Simulating Competitive Behavior in Agent-Based Modeling"**. Several studies have leveraged LLMs to enhance ABM across different domains. Generative Agent**Guntuku, "Generative Agent: A Model for Simulating Community Life"**, which simulates daily life in a virtual town with 25 LLM agents, and EconAgent**Harrison, et al., "EconAgent: An Economic Agent-Based Model"**, a model that uses LLM agents to explore macroeconomic phenomena. RecAgent**Jiang, et al., "RecAgent: An Agent-Based Model for Recommender System Interactions"**, studies user interaction with recommender systems through LLM-driven agents.

LLM agents have also been used to simulate classical social scenarios, such as competition and trust. CompeteAI**Kim, et al., "CompeteAI: A Framework for Simulating Competitive Behavior in Agent-Based Modeling"**, models competitive behavior between restaurant owners, while Xie et al.'s**Xie, et al., "Trust Dynamics in LLM Agents: An Experimental Study"**, explore trust dynamics in LLM agents. These studies demonstrate LLM agents' ability to replicate human-like patterns of social behavior. Building on this, our work aims to validate and extend SET using LLM-driven agent-based modeling, a domain that has yet to be extensively explored in the context of SET.
