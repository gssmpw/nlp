\subsection{Homans Social Exchange Theory}
% Social Exchange Theory (SET) is a foundational framework in sociology and social psychology that views social interactions as transactions of value____. SET has been widely applied to explain organizational behavior, leadership trust, and workplace relationships____, while also illuminating friendships____, family relations____, and romantic partnerships____. Recent theoretical advances include Lawler and Thye's____ exploration of emotional dimensions and Cropanzano et al.'s____ two-dimensional model incorporating activity alongside hedonic factors. While Enayat et al.____ implemented SET through multi-agent simulation, their simplified exchange rules overlooked emotional complexity. Our approach leverages LLM-driven agents to simulate more nuanced human interactions, offering a more faithful implementation of SET.
Social Exchange Theory is a foundational framework in sociology and social psychology that views social interactions as transactions of value____. In organizational and workplace behavior, it is considered a “gold standard” for explaining dynamics like employee–employer relationships, leadership trust, and organizational citizenship behaviors____. Beyond organizations, SET has been used in social psychology to examine friendships____, family relations____, and even romantic partnerships____ as exchanges of emotional support, information, and other resources. 

Recent refinements to SET have deepened its explanatory power. Lawler and Thye____ explored the emotional dimensions of exchange, while Cropanzano et al.____ proposed a two-dimensional model incorporating "activity" alongside the traditional hedonic framework, enhancing SET’s predictive accuracy. In terms of research methods, Enayat et al.____ applied SET in a multi-agent simulation to explore social structures through simplified exchange rules. However, their model, which reduced agent behavior to simple exchanges of money and recognition, overlooked emotional subjectivity. To address this limitation, our approach employs LLM-driven agents to simulate more complex human interactions, offering a more accurate implementation of SET.

 
\subsection{LLM-driven Agent-based Modeling}

% LLMs have transformed agent-based modeling by enabling human-like behavior and decision-making capabilities____. Key developments include Generative Agent____, which simulates community life with 25 LLM agents, EconAgent____, which explores macroeconomic phenomena, and RecAgent____, which studies recommender system interactions. Recent works have demonstrated LLM agents' ability to simulate classical social scenarios, with CompeteAI____ modeling competitive behavior and Xie et al.____ exploring trust dynamics. Building on these advances, our work presents a novel application of LLM-driven agents to validate and extend SET.

The rise of LLMs has significantly advanced agent-based modeling by enabling agents with human-like behavior and decision-making capabilities. Traditionally, ABM relied on fixed rules to govern agent behavior, but LLMs provide flexible, dynamic responses that better simulate real human interactions____. Several studies have leveraged LLMs to enhance ABM across different domains. Generative Agent____, which simulates daily life in a virtual town with 25 LLM agents, and EconAgent____, a model that uses LLM agents to explore macroeconomic phenomena. RecAgent____ studies user interaction with recommender systems through LLM-driven agents.

LLM agents have also been used to simulate classical social scenarios, such as competition and trust. CompeteAI____ models competitive behavior between restaurant owners, while Xie et al.____ explore trust dynamics in LLM agents. These studies demonstrate LLM agents' ability to replicate human-like patterns of social behavior. Building on this, our work aims to validate and extend SET using LLM-driven agent-based modeling, a domain that has yet to be extensively explored in the context of SET.
