Hypothesis decomposition allows us to measure the logical consistency of models as well as better understand the structure of non-monotonic reasoning.

We find that labels of atomic sub-problems in defeasible reasoning share a more complex relation to the full problem than in traditional NLI, even within the same label class.

We introduce \textit{critical atoms} as the primary fact evaluated by a defeasible NLI example, enabling us to group examples by shared critical atoms and measure the \textit{inferential consistency} of LLMs across different contexts.
