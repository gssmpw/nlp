\paragraph{Self-correction in LLMs.} Self-correction in LLMs refers to the ability of models to correct their own generated output ____. Recent studies ____ suggest that LLMs tend to struggle with \textit{intrinsic} self-correction, especially with \emph{detecting} errors in their own output____. While most studies focus on improving the models' ability to self-correct____, our study analyzes the capacity of LLMs to detect errors from a mechanistic point of view.

\paragraph{Arithmetic and Error Detection in LLMs.} To the best of our knowledge, the underlying processes of arithmetic reasoning and error detection have been studied independently in LLMs so far. Several studies ____ use causal mediation analysis ____ to identify circuits that account for how LLMs process arithmetic operations. As of now, only few studies have analyzed self-correction in LLMs beyond the models' generated output____.
