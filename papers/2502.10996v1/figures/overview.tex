\caption{\textbf{Overview of the Retrieval-And-Structuring (RAS) framework.} RAS operates through four integrated stages: \textbf{(1) Action Planning} strategically determines knowledge retrieval needs and generates focused sub-queries; \textbf{(2) Theme-Scoped Retrieval} combines thematic and semantic matching to efficiently extract relevant context from large corpora; \textbf{(3) Knowledge Structuring and Enrichment} transforms retrieved text into an evolving knowledge graph that expands based on reasoning needs; and \textbf{(4) Knowledge-Augmented Generation} leverages the accumulated structured knowledge through a GraphLLM to produce the final output. The framework employs parameter-efficient training, fine-tuning only the graph encoder, projector components, and optionally with LoRA. The Action Planner and Answerer are two roles played by a single model, trained through multi-task learning. 
% An illustrative example is shown in Figure \ref{fig:run_example}.
