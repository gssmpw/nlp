\section{Previous Work}
Several previous studies have laid the foundation for this research. Costescu et al. ____ focused primarily on providing ideas for such a self-adaptive platform. An important idea of such a platform is to determine the focus of attention during children's play. This can be done in the game "Mushroom Hunter" to examine the ability to sustain attention. ____ focused on the development and application of datasets tailored for AI research in education, especially for children with NDD. Another study ____ explored how robotics and social AI interpret children's behaviour. Another study ____ explored how serious games combined with eye-tracking technology can provide insights to help teachers better support children with NDD. The study proposed here is based on research on the development of platforms to support NDD children ____, where we focus on three objectives in particular: Processing and analyzing datasets, supporting teachers and psychologists, explainability, and privacy.
