    \caption{Violin plot showing the distribution of embedding norms on each dataset split as a function of which dataset the model was trained on. All values are normalized by the training set's mean embedding magnitude. Black bars represent and are labeled by the mean value of each violin. We use the same augmentations for the train and test sets for consistency.}
