\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec2}

This literature review provides an in-depth analysis of various aspects related to classical AES, cryptanalytic resistance of AES over cyber-attacks, the importance of key randomness in AES security, and recent advancements in enhancing AES key strength. Through a comprehensive exploration of the existing research, methodologies, and advancements, this review aims to contribute to the understanding of these critical components of cryptography and their impact on secure communication **Jang et al., "Quantum Attack on Secret-Key Ciphers"**.

In a work by Jang et. al., the authors have undertaken the objective of evaluating the security of secret-key ciphers against potential quantum adversaries, considering the significant advancements anticipated in quantum computing. Although a fully functional quantum computer remains a future prospect, there is a growing need to assess the vulnerability of secret-key ciphers to quantum attacks. In this research, the authors explore the key recovery attack utilizing Grover's search algorithm on the three variants of AES (-128, -192, -256) in the context of quantum implementation and quantum key search using Grover's algorithm **Zou et al., "Quantum Circuit Implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard"**. A pool of implementations is developed by reducing the circuit depth metrics, primarily focusing on optimization strategies, and incorporating state-of-the-art advancements in relevant fields **Huang et al., "Generic Synthesis and Optimization Techniques for Quantum Oracles"**.

The authors present the least Toffoli depth and full-depth implementations of AES, surpassing the work done by Zou et al. in their Asiacrypt'20 paper by over 98 percent for all variants of AES **Bonnetain et al., "Post-Quantum Security of AES"**. The improvement in the product of qubit count and Toffoli depth is more than 75 percent compared to the results presented by Zou et al. Furthermore, the authors conduct a detailed analysis of the implementations proposed by Jaques et al. in their Eurocrypt'20 paper, addressing identified bugs and providing corrected benchmarks. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that their work demonstrates improvements in Toffoli/full depth and Toffoli depth - qubit count product compared to all previous research, including the recent Eprint'22 paper by Huang and Sun **Almazrooie et al., "Explicit Quantum Design of AES-128"**.

Addressing the widespread use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a block cipher, Ze. Wang et. al. ideated a design of quantum circuits for deciphering AES-128 and the sample-AES (S-AES). In the quantum circuit of AES-128, an affine transformation is performed for the SubBytes part to resolve the issue of the initial state of the output qubits in SubBytes not being the $|0\rangle \otimes 8$ state. This improvement allows for the encoding of the new round sub-key on the qubits that encode the previous round sub-key **J Zou et al., "Quantum Circuit Implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard"**. As a result, the number of utilized qubits is reduced by 224 compared to the implementation by Langenberg et al. For S-AES, the authors present a complete quantum circuit requiring only 48 qubits. This qubit count is within the achievable range of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers **S Rao et al., "Quantum Circuit for Deciphering AES-128 and Sample-AES"**.

To summarize, the authors' work focuses on designing quantum circuits for deciphering AES-128 and S-AES. In the AES-128 quantum circuit, an affine transformation is applied to resolve the issue of the initial state of the output qubits in SubBytes. This enables the encoding of the new round sub-key on the qubits encoding the previous round sub-key, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of utilized qubits compared to previous implementations. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate the feasibility of implementing S-AES by presenting a complete quantum circuit that utilizes only 48 qubits, a count well within the capabilities of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers **M Almazrooie et al., "Explicit Quantum Design of AES-128"**.

A study by S. Rao et. al. highlights the importance of cryptographic techniques in maintaining information privacy. The authors emphasize the reliability of AES as a trusted cryptographic algorithm in symmetric key cryptography **H Huang et al., "Security Analysis of AES under Quantum Computing"**. They acknowledge the potential threats posed by advancements in quantum computing and aim to address these concerns by demonstrating that AES-256, when utilized with Grover's algorithm, can withstand quantum attacks.

Scientists Chang et. al. investigated the security of AES-OTR, a third-round algorithm in the CAESAR competition, under the Q2 model. The authors construct periodic functions of the associated data by manipulating the associated data based on the parallel and serial structure characteristics of the AES-OTR algorithm during associated data processing **H Huang et al., "Security Analysis of AES under Quantum Computing"**. Utilizing the Simon quantum algorithm, they repeatedly construct the periodic functions of the associated data. Using collision pairs, two successful collision forgery attacks on the AES-OTR algorithm are executed, resulting in obtaining the period s with a high probability.

The attacks presented in this study pose a significant threat to the security of the AES-OTR algorithm. By exploiting the relative independence between different modules of the AES-OTR authentication encryption algorithm, as well as the parallel and serial structures in associated data processing and the simplicity of intermediate variable generation, the authors propose a collision forgery attack on the AES-OTR algorithm under quantum computing **H Huang et al., "Security Analysis of AES under Quantum Computing"**. They demonstrate that the AES-OTR algorithm is highly vulnerable when associated data and Nonce are reused. By analysing the collision form of the associated data and combining it with the Simon quantum algorithm, they construct the periodic function f of the associated data and obtain the period s with a high probability.

In summary, the authors' work focuses on improving quantum circuit implementations of AES through several advancements. Their proposed quantum circuits for the AES S-box and S-box-1 require fewer qubits, while introducing the S-box-1 operation optimizes the zig-zag method. Furthermore, their method to reduce the number of qubits in the key schedule significantly reduces the overall qubit requirements for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 **J Zou et al., "Quantum Circuit Implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard"**.

 
In a research work by X. Bonnetain and team, the authors undertake a novel analysis to assess the post-quantum security of AES for the first time. Their objective is to determine the new security margin by identifying the minimum number of non-attacked rounds within a time frame of less than 2128 encryptions **Bonnetain et al., "Post-Quantum Security of AES"**. To achieve this, the authors provide generalized and quantized versions of the most effective known cryptanalysis techniques on reduced-round AES, along with a discussion on attacks that do not appear to benefit significantly from a quantum speed-up. To facilitate efficient computation of the attacks' complexity, the authors propose a new framework for structured search that encompasses both classical and quantum attacks. They anticipate that this framework will prove valuable for future analyses in the field.

The authors present their best attack, which is a quantum Demirci-Sel√ßuk meet-in-the-middle attack. Surprisingly, the design principles underlying this attack also led to new and counter-intuitive classical trade-offs known as Time-Memory-Data (TMD) trade-offs **Bonnetain et al., "Post-Quantum Security of AES"**. These trade-offs enable the reduction of memory requirements in certain attacks against AES-256 and AES-128, which is an unexpected finding.
