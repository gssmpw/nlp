abstract = {Cloud computing manifests exceptional capacity to facilitate easy to manage, cost effective, flexible and powerful resources across the internet. Due to maximum and shared utilization of utilization of resources, cloud computing enhances the capabilities of resources. There is a dire need for data security in the wake of the increasing capabilities of attackers and high magnitude of sensitive data. Cryptography is employed to ensure secrecy and authentication of data. Conventional information assurance methods are facing increasing technological advances such as radical developments in mathematics, potential to perform big computations and the prospects of wide-ranging quantum computations. Quantum cryptography is a promising solution towards absolute security in cryptosystems. This paper proposes integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with quantum cryptography. The proposed scheme is robust and meets essential security requirements. The simulation results show that the Quantum AES produces complex keys which are hard to predict by adversaries than the keys generated by the AES itself.},

abstract="Methods for enumerating cryptographic keys based on partial information obtained on key bytes are important tools in cryptanalysis. This paper discusses two contributions related to the practical application and algorithmic improvement of such tools. On the one hand, we observe that the evaluation of leaking devices is generally based on distinguishers with very limited computational cost, such as Kocher's Differential Power Analysis. By contrast, classical cryptanalysis usually considers large computational costs (e.g. beyond 280 for present ciphers). Trying to bridge this gap, we show that allowing side-channel adversaries some computing power has major consequences for the security of leaking devices. For this purpose, we first propose a Bayesian extension of non-profiled side-channel attacks that allows us to rate key candidates according to their respective probabilities. Then we provide a new deterministic algorithm that allows us to optimally enumerate key candidates from any number of (possibly redundant) lists of any size, given that the subkey information is provided as probabilities, at the cost of limited (practically tractable) memory requirements. Finally, we investigate the impact of key enumeration taking advantage of this Bayesian formulation, and quantify the resulting reduction in the data complexity of various side-channel attacks.",

abstract="Collision attacks on AES-like hashing (hash functions constructed by plugging AES-like ciphers or permutations into the famous PGV modes or their variants) can be reduced to the problem of finding a pair of inputs respecting a differential of the underlying AES-like primitive whose input and output differences are the same. The rebound attack due to Mendel et al. is a powerful tool for achieving this goal, whose quantum version was first considered by Hosoyamada and Sasaki at EUROCRYPT 2020. In this work, we automate the process of searching for the configurations of rebound attacks by taking related-key differentials of the underlying block cipher into account with the MILP-based approach. In the quantum setting, our model guide the search towards characteristics that minimize the resources (e.g., QRAM) and complexities of the resulting rebound attacks. We apply our method to Saturnin-hash, SKINNY, and Whirlpool and improved results are obtained.",

abstract="With the rise in quantum computing, there is an increase in the security concerns of existing cryptographic algorithms such as Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES) along with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The problem with RSA and ECC is that they depend on the challenges of integer factorization and discrete logarithms, respectively, whereas AES can be the target of brute force attack. In the recent years, there is a huge advancement in quantum computing due to which the existing encryption standards found vulnerable as they are weak to handle quantum attacks. Hence, to solve the problems with quantum computing, a new set of algorithms came into existence called as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) which is safe and secure from quantum attacks. In this review, firstly, the quantum computers and number of classical algorithms are introduced, afterward the classification of PQC algorithms has been shown. The aim of this review is to present the technical overview about PQC algorithms and their working procedures to protect classical cryptographic-based encrypted information from quantum attacks during online transactions and communications.",

  abstract = {Quantum physics can be exploited to generate true random numbers, which have important roles in many applications, especially in cryptography. Genuine randomness from the measurement of a quantum system reveals the inherent nature of quantumness—coherence, an important feature that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. The generation of genuine randomness is generally considered impossible with only classical means. On the basis of the degree of trustworthiness on devices, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can be grouped into three categories. The first category, practical QRNG, is built on fully trusted and calibrated devices and typically can generate randomness at a high speed by properly modelling the devices. The second category is self-testing QRNG, in which verifiable randomness can be generated without trusting the actual implementation. The third category, semi-self-testing QRNG, is an intermediate category that provides a tradeoff between the trustworthiness on the device and the random number generation speed.},
