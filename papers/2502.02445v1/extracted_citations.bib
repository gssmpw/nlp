abstract="Collision attacks on AES-like hashing (hash functions constructed by plugging AES-like ciphers or permutations into the famous PGV modes or their variants) can be reduced to the problem of finding a pair of inputs respecting a differential of the underlying AES-like primitive whose input and output differences are the same. The rebound attack due to Mendel et al. is a powerful tool for achieving this goal, whose quantum version was first considered by Hosoyamada and Sasaki at EUROCRYPT 2020. In this work, we automate the process of searching for the configurations of rebound attacks by taking related-key differentials of the underlying block cipher into account with the MILP-based approach. In the quantum setting, our model guide the search towards characteristics that minimize the resources (e.g., QRAM) and complexities of the resulting rebound attacks. We apply our method to Saturnin-hash, SKINNY, and Whirlpool and improved results are obtained.",

  abstract = {Quantum physics can be exploited to generate true random numbers, which have important roles in many applications, especially in cryptography. Genuine randomness from the measurement of a quantum system reveals the inherent nature of quantumness—coherence, an important feature that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. The generation of genuine randomness is generally considered impossible with only classical means. On the basis of the degree of trustworthiness on devices, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can be grouped into three categories. The first category, practical QRNG, is built on fully trusted and calibrated devices and typically can generate randomness at a high speed by properly modelling the devices. The second category is self-testing QRNG, in which verifiable randomness can be generated without trusting the actual implementation. The third category, semi-self-testing QRNG, is an intermediate category that provides a tradeoff between the trustworthiness on the device and the random number generation speed.},

abstract="With the rise in quantum computing, there is an increase in the security concerns of existing cryptographic algorithms such as Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) and advanced encryption standard (AES) along with elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The problem with RSA and ECC is that they depend on the challenges of integer factorization and discrete logarithms, respectively, whereas AES can be the target of brute force attack. In the recent years, there is a huge advancement in quantum computing due to which the existing encryption standards found vulnerable as they are weak to handle quantum attacks. Hence, to solve the problems with quantum computing, a new set of algorithms came into existence called as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) which is safe and secure from quantum attacks. In this review, firstly, the quantum computers and number of classical algorithms are introduced, afterward the classification of PQC algorithms has been shown. The aim of this review is to present the technical overview about PQC algorithms and their working procedures to protect classical cryptographic-based encrypted information from quantum attacks during online transactions and communications.",

Secondly, we reduce the number of qubits in the zig-zag method by introducing the S-box{\$}{\$}^{\{}-1{\}}{\$}{\$}-1operation in our quantum circuits of AES. Thirdly, we present a method to reduce the number of qubits in the key schedule of AES. While the previous quantum circuits of AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 need at least 864, 896, and 1232 qubits respectively, our quantum circuit implementations of AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 only require 512, 640, and 768 qubits respectively, where the number of qubits is reduced by more than 30{\%}.",
