\section{Discussion}
%\pramod{maybe instead of general conclusion - we can write this section as two paragraphs: 1) Discussion on generality (see the last sentence), and 2) limitations.}

\underline{\bf Firstly}, we implemented \projecttitle{} with FPGA-based SmartNICs, i.e., Alveo U280~\cite{alveo_smartnics}; we believe other commercial SmartNIC vendors (e.g., Mellanox/Intel) can implement our minimalistic and generic NIC-level interface. \underline{\bf Secondly}, the emergence of SPDM/TDISP protocols~\cite{spdm,tdisp} to secure I/O devices in conjunction with confidential virtual machines (CVMs) as offered by a new generation of CPUs, e.g., AMD-SEV-SNP~\cite{amd-sev}, Intel TDX~\cite{intelTDX2}, and Arm CCA~\cite{arm-cca}, could adapt our work by augmenting \projecttitle{} with an "SPDM-broker" to build an E2E secure design since \projecttitle{} already supports remote attestation and can also support an encrypted channel between a CVM and the target NIC. \underline{\bf Lastly}, the PCIe-enabled CXL standard~\cite{cxl} is pitched to include secure extensions in the PCIe 6.0 specs~\cite{pcie6.0}. We believe \projecttitle{}'s architecture can significantly influence the design of future ``secure CXL bridges" because our minimalistic interface can also be realized on a CXL-expander card.

%In this paper, we present the design and implementation of \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture. \projecttitle{} proposes a host CPU-agnostic unified security architecture based on trustworthy network-level isolation. We materialize the \projecttitle{} architecture using SmartNICs by exposing a minimal and formally verified silicon root-of-trust with low TCB, relying on just two fundamental properties of transferable authentication and non-equivocation. Using \projecttitle{}, we implement a hardware-accelerated trustworthy network stack that efficiently transforms a range of distributed systems under the fail-stop operation model for untrusted (Byzantine) cloud environments. Notably, we realize the \projecttitle{} architecture-based FPGA-based SmartNICs on Alveo U280 cards; we believe other commercial SmartNIC vendors can implement our NIC-level interface.


%\projecttitle{} outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based trusted hardware, TEEs, while offering a unified, general, programmable, formally verified, and minimalist interface to build trustworthy distributed systems. 
%\myparagraph{Ethical considerations and artifact availability} This work raises no ethical issues and will be open-sourced.% The \projecttitle{} (HW and SW) artifact and formal security proofs will be publicly available.

% We present \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture for trustworthy distributed systems. \projecttitle{} leverages the state-of-the-art network hardware, i.e., SmartNICs and extends their security properties, implementing a minimalistic TCB, the attestation kernel that materializes the lower bound of properties---the non-equivocation and transferable authentication properties---to transform distributed systems for Byzantine settings. We formally verified the security and safety properties of \projecttitle{} while we also applied it to transform four systems: a single-node trusted log system, a state-machine-replication (SMR) protocol, a chain replication system and an accountability protocol. Our evaluation shows that \projecttitle{} outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based trusted hardware, TEEs while offering unification, generality and minimalism.



% \section{Conclusion}
% In this paper, we present the design and implementation of \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture. Our, we make the following contributions:
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%     \item We designed and built \projecttitle{}, a {\em host-agnostic unified trusted high-performant} NIC architecture for building fast and trustworthy systems in the heterogeneous cloud infrastructure. We expose a trusted network programming library that offers the powerful properties of non-equivocation and transferable authentication to system designers while we show {\em how} to strengthen existent systems with \projecttitle{}.
%     %\dimitra{Hardware level implementation + minimalism taht allows verifiable + NIC level implementation tfor high performance}
%     \item We offer a {\em unified minimalistic verifiable silicon root of trust (TCB)}  that realizes an efficient transformation between existing system under the fail-stop operation model for the Byzantine settings in the cloud. We further conduct an end-to-end formal verification of our \projecttitle{} operations from bootstrapping and remote attestation to normal operation.
%     \item We built \projecttitle{} extending the scope of the state-of-the art SmartNIC devices to boost performance. We built our minimalistic TCB, \projecttitle{} attestation kernel, in NIC-level hardware by extending and shielding an FPGA-based RDMA network stack.
    
% \end{itemize}

%  We formally verified the security and safety properties of \projecttitle{} while we also applied it to transform four distributed systems: Attested Append-Only Memory (A2M), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Chain Replication, and Accountable Distributed Systems using PeerReview. Our evaluation shows that \projecttitle{} outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based trusted hardware, TEEs while offering unification, generality and minimalism.
