% \subsection*{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
We introduce \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture for building trustworthy distributed systems deployed in heterogeneous, untrusted (Byzantine) cloud environments. \projecttitle{} builds a minimal, formally verified, silicon root-of-trust at the network interface level. We strive for three primary design goals: (1) a host CPU-agnostic unified security architecture by providing trustworthy network-level isolation; (2) a minimalistic and verifiable TCB based on a silicon root-of-trust by providing two core properties of transferable authentication and non-equivocation; and (3) a hardware-accelerated trustworthy network stack leveraging SmartNICs. Based on the \projecttitle{} architecture and associated network stack, we present a generic set of programming APIs and a recipe for building high-performance, trustworthy, distributed systems for Byzantine settings. We formally verify the safety and security properties of our \projecttitle{} while demonstrating its use by building four trustworthy distributed systems. Our evaluation of \projecttitle{} shows up to $6\times$ performance improvement compared to CPU-centric TEE systems.

%\dimitra{we could start "directly"}
%The untrusted (Byzantine) cloud infrastructure suffers from malicious attacks and arbritary failures that complicate the security and correctness semantics of an executing distributed system. CPU-based trusted hardware, i.e., Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offers a Trusted Computing Base (TCB) that can be used to build trustworthy networking operations for distributed systems. Unfortunately, in the untrusted cloud that is comprised by heterogeneous machines, TEEs {\em cannot} be adopted as a standardized solution for trustworthy systems due to their heterogeneity in security properties, mechanisms and TCBs and their limitations in performance.

%In our work, we ask the following question: {\em What is ?}


% \pramod{The following sentence repeats the first statement  ``for building trustworthy distributed systems in the untrusted cloud". you want to highlight the key security  properties offered by T-NIC.} \projecttitle{} leverages the state-of-the-art SmartNIC devices for fast networking while it further extends their security properties  with a silicon root-of-trust that offers a unified CPU-independent minimalistic networking abstraction for building trustworthy distributed systems in the untrusted cloud. Our \projecttitle{} implements in network-level hardware a small verifiable TCB, the attestation kernel, that implements the necessary security properties to transform distributed systems for Byzantine settings. We formally verify the safety and security properties of our \projecttitle{} system while we also demonstrate how to use it to design and build trustworthy systems. 

% We leverage \projecttitle{} for building four trustworthy distributed systems operating in Byzantine cloud environments: attested append-only memory (A2M), Byzantine fault tolerant state machine replication (SMR) protocol, chain replication, and the PeerReview accountability protocol---showing the generality of our approach.  Our evaluation of \projecttitle{} shows up to $6\times$ performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-centric TEE systems, while providing formally provable security properties.
