abstract = {Developers have access to a wide range of storage APIs and functionality in large-scale systems, such as relational databases, key-value stores, and namespaces. However, this diversity comes at a cost: each API is implemented by a complex distributed system that is difficult to develop and operate. Delos amortizes this cost by enabling different APIs on a shared codebase and operational platform. The primary innovation in Delos is a log-structured protocol: a fine-grained replicated state machine executing above a shared log that can be layered into reusable protocol stacks under different databases. We built and deployed two production databases using Delos at Facebook, creating nine different log-structured protocols in the process. We show via experiments and production data that log-structured protocols impose low overhead, while allowing optimizations that can improve latency by up to 100X (e.g., via leasing) and throughput by up to 2X (e.g., via batching).},

abstract = {The microservice architecture is a popular software engineering approach for building flexible, large-scale online services. Serverless functions, or function as a service (FaaS), provide a simple programming model of stateless functions which are a natural substrate for implementing the stateless RPC handlers of microservices, as an alternative to containerized RPC servers. However, current serverless platforms have millisecond-scale runtime overheads, making them unable to meet the strict sub-millisecond latency targets required by existing interactive microservices. We present Nightcore, a serverless function runtime with microsecond-scale overheads that provides container-based isolation between functions. Nightcore’s design carefully considers various factors having microsecond-scale overheads, including scheduling of function requests, communication primitives, threading models for I/O, and concurrent function executions. Nightcore currently supports serverless functions written in C/C++, Go, Node.js, and Python. Our evaluation shows that when running latency-sensitive interactive microservices, Nightcore achieves 1.36\texttimes{}–2.93\texttimes{} higher throughput and up to 69% reduction in tail latency.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) workflows are extremely complex. The typical workflow consists of distinct stages of user interaction, such as preprocessing, training, and tuning, that are repeatedly executed by users but have heterogeneous computational requirements. This complexity makes it challenging for ML users to correctly provision and manage resources and, in practice, constitutes a significant burden that frequently causes over-provisioning and impairs user productivity. Serverless computing is a compelling model to address the resource management problem, in general, but there are numerous challenges to adopt it for existing ML frameworks due to significant restrictions on local resources.This work proposes Cirrus---an ML framework that automates the end-to-end management of datacenter resources for ML workflows by efficiently taking advantage of serverless infrastructures. Cirrus combines the simplicity of the serverless interface and the scalability of the serverless infrastructure (AWS Lambdas and S3) to minimize user effort. We show a design specialized for both serverless computation and iterative ML training is needed for robust and efficient ML training on serverless infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that Cirrus outperforms frameworks specialized along a single dimension: Cirrus is 100x faster than a general purpose serverless system [36] and 3.75x faster than specialized ML frameworks for traditional infrastructures [49].},

abstract = {Distributed computing remains inaccessible to a large number of users, in spite of many open source platforms and extensive commercial offerings. While distributed computation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model, many users are still left to struggle with complex cluster management and configuration tools, even for running simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users, eliminating cluster management overhead, fulfilling the promise of elasticity. Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models, such as BSP, efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions are a natural fit for data processing in future computing environments.},

This ensures that there is a non-null intersection between every read quorum and every write quorum. Version numbers make it possible to determine which copies are current. The reliability and performance characteristics of a replicated file can be controlled by appropriately choosing r, w, and the file's voting configuration. The algorithm guarantees serial consistency, admits temporary copies in a natural way by the introduction of copies with no votes, and has been implemented in the context of an application system called Violet.},

abstract = {Sprocket is a highly configurable, stage-based, scalable, serverless video processing framework that exploits intra-video parallelism to achieve low latency. Sprocket enables developers to program a series of operations over video content in a modular, extensible manner. Programmers implement custom operations, ranging from simple video transformations to more complex computer vision tasks, in a simple pipeline specification language to construct custom video processing pipelines. Sprocket then handles the underlying access, encoding and decoding, and processing of video and image content across operations in a highly parallel manner. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of the Sprocket system on the AWS Lambda serverless cloud infrastructure, and evaluate Sprocket under a variety of conditions to show that it delivers its performance goals of high parallelism, low latency, and low cost (10s of seconds to process a 3,600 second video 1000-way parallel for less than $3).},

abstract = { Non-volatile memory technologies such as PCM, ReRAM and STT-RAM allow data to be
saved to persistent storage significantly faster than hard drives or SSDs. Many of
the use cases for non-volatile memory requires persistent logging since it enables
a set of operations to execute in an atomic manner. However, a logging protocol must
handle reordering, which causes a write to reach the non-volatile memory before a
previous write operation.  In this paper, we show that reordering results from two
parts of the system: the out-of-order execution in the CPU and the cache coherence
protocol. By carefully considering the properties of these reorderings, we present
a logging protocol that requires only one round trip to non-volatile memory while
avoiding expensive computations, thus increasing performance. We also show how the
logging protocol can be extended to building a durable set (hash map) that also requires
a single round trip to non-volatile memory for inserting, updating, or deleting operations.

store instructions. Because failures during updates may destroy transient data (e.g.,
in CPU registers), preserving data integrity in the presence of failures requires
failure-atomic bundles of updates. Prior failure atomicity approaches for persistent
memory entail overheads due to logging and CPU cache flushing. Persistent caches can
eliminate the need for flushing, but conventional logging remains complex and memory
intensive. We present the design and implementation of JUSTDO logging, a new failure
atomicity mechanism that greatly reduces the memory footprint of logs, simplifies
log management, and enables fast parallel recovery following failure. Crash-injection
tests confirm that JUSTDO logging preserves application data integrity and performance
evaluations show that it improves throughput 3x or more compared with a state-of-the-art
alternative for a spectrum of data-intensive algorithms.},

abstract = {Emerging hardware like persistent memory (PM) and high-speed NICs are promising to
build efficient key-value stores. However, we observe that the small-sized access
pattern in key-value stores doesn't match with the persistence granularity in PMs,
leaving the PM bandwidth underutilized. This paper proposes an efficient PM-based
key-value storage engine named FlatStore. Specifically, it decouples the role of a
KV store into a persistent log structure for efficient storage and a volatile index
for fast indexing. Upon it, FlatStore further incorporates two techniques: 1) compacted
log format to maximize the batching opportunity in the log; 2) pipelined horizontal
batching to steal log entries from other cores when creating a batch, thus delivering
low-latency and high-throughput performance. We implement FlatStore with the volatile
index of both a hash table and Masstree. We deploy FlatStore on Optane DC Persistent
Memory, and our experiments show that FlatStore achieves up to 35 Mops/s with a single
server node, 2.5 - 6.3 times faster than existing systems.},

abstract = {Emerging byte-addressable, non-volatile memory technologies (NVRAM) like phase-change
memory can increase the capacity of future memory systems by orders of magnitude.
Compared to systems that rely on disk storage, NVRAM-based systems promise significant
improvements in performance for key applications like online transaction processing
(OLTP). Unfortunately, NVRAM systems suffer from two drawbacks: their asymmetric read-write
performance and the notable higher cost of the new memory technologies compared to
disk. This paper investigates the cost-effective use of NVRAM in transaction systems.
It shows that using NVRAM only for the logging subsystem (NV-Logging) provides much
higher transactions per dollar than simply replacing all disk storage with NVRAM.
Specifically, for NV-Logging, we show that the software overheads associated with
centralized log buffers cause performance bottlenecks and limit scaling. The per-transaction
logging methods described in the paper help avoid these overheads, enabling concurrent
logging for multiple transactions. Experimental results with a faithful emulation
of future NVRAM-based servers using the TPCC, TATP, and TPCB benchmarks show that
NV-Logging improves throughput by 1.42 - 2.72x over the costlier option of replacing
all disk storage with NVRAM. Results also show that NV-Logging performs 1.21 - 6.71x
better than when logs are placed into the PMFS NVRAM-optimized file system. Compared
to state-of-the-art distributed logging, NV-Logging delivers 20.4% throughput improvements.},

abstract = {Scaling-out a database system typically requires partitioning the database across
multiple servers. If applications do not partition perfectly, then transactions accessing
multiple partitions end up being distributed, which has well-known scalability challenges.
To address them, we describe a high-performance transaction mechanism that uses optimistic
concurrency control on a multi-versioned tree-structured database stored in a shared
log. The system scales out by adding servers, without partitioning the database.Our
solution is modeled on the Hyder architecture, published by Bernstein, Reid, and Das
at CIDR 2011. We present the design and evaluation of the first full implementation
of that architecture. The core of the system is a log roll-forward algorithm, called
meld, that does optimistic concurrency control. Meld is inherently sequential and
is therefore the main bottleneck. Our main algorithmic contributions are optimizations
to meld that significantly increase transaction throughput. They use a pipelined design
that parallelizes meld onto multiple threads. The slowest pipeline stage is much faster
than the original meld algorithm, yielding a 3x improvement of system throughput over
the original meld algorithm.},

abstractions for storing and computing over massive datasets. However, similar abstractions
do not exist for storing and accessing meta-data. To fill this gap, Tango provides
developers with the abstraction of a replicated, in-memory data structure (such as
a map or a tree) backed by a shared log. Tango objects are easy to build and use,
replicating state via simple append and read operations on the shared log instead
of complex distributed protocols; in the process, they obtain properties such as linearizability,
persistence and high availability from the shared log. Tango also leverages the shared
log to enable fast transactions across different objects, allowing applications to
partition state across machines and scale to the limits of the underlying log without
sacrificing consistency.},

abstract = {Today's datacenter applications are underpinned by datastores that are responsible
for providing availability, consistency, and performance. For high availability in
the presence of failures, these datastores replicate data across several nodes. This
is accomplished with the help of a reliable replication protocol that is responsible
for maintaining the replicas strongly-consistent even when faults occur. Strong consistency
is preferred to weaker consistency models that cannot guarantee an intuitive behavior
for the clients. Furthermore, to accommodate high demand at real-time latencies, datastores
must deliver high throughput and low latency.This work introduces Hermes, a broadcast-based
reliable replication protocol for in-memory datastores that provides both high throughput
and low latency by enabling local reads and fully-concurrent fast writes at all replicas.
Hermes couples logical timestamps with cache-coherence-inspired invalidations to guarantee
linearizability, avoid write serialization at a centralized ordering point, resolve
write conflicts locally at each replica (hence ensuring that writes never abort) and
provide fault-tolerance via replayable writes. Our implementation of Hermes over an
RDMA-enabled reliable datastore with five replicas shows that Hermes consistently
achieves higher throughput than state-of-the-art RDMA-based reliable protocols (ZAB
and CRAQ) across all write ratios while also significantly reducing tail latency.
At 5% writes, the tail latency of Hermes is 3.6X lower than that of CRAQ and ZAB.},

abstract = {Serverless computing is gaining popularity with the Function-asa-Service (FaaS) execution model. Without incurring overheads involved in provisioning cloud instances and with high availability and scalability, serverless computing allows developers to focus on implementation of core application logic using other well-developed cloud services. By abstracting the complex resource management task, serverless computing opens new opportunities for the cloud service adoption even to non-cloud experts [2]. With the popularity, many research results have been published using the FaaS execution model. They include investigation of serverless computing opportunities [1], proposing new serverless applications, function run-time optimization, and public service comparison. Without a common test benchmark suite, authors in the previous work had evaluated proposed systems using fairly simple FaaS applications, such as micro-benchmarks that emphasize specific resources exclusively, e.g., CPU, disk I/O, and network. However, such simple workloads do not represent realistic FaaS system applications, and the evaluations might not compare proposed systems appropriately.To overcome the limitation of lacking a comprehensive benchmark suite for the serverless computing and FaaS execution model, the authors create FunctionBench that provides various FaaS workloads that are ready to be executed on public cloud function execution services - AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure functions1. Since the inception of serving the FaaS workloads, we keep working to expand the supported applications and add scenarios in big-data processing, back-end web applications, and security. To represent big-data applications, we add a MapReduce WordCount workload, which counts the number of occurrences of each word in a given partitioned input dataset from Wikipedia. To cover web back-end applications, we add Chameleon. The application renders a template using the Chameleon module in Python PIP library to create an HTML table of N rows and M columns that are provided as input arguments. Another web-related application is JSON serialize-deserialize module. The application performs JSON deserialization using a JSON-encoded string dataset (Awesome JSON Dataset) downloaded from a public object storage service, and it serializes the JSON object again. To represent security-related applications, we add Pyaes benchmark that performs private key-based encryption and decryption. It is a pure-Python implementation of the AES block-cipher algorithm in CTR mode. We also add gzip-compression benchmark to represent realistic disk IO-heavy applications. The degree (High, Medium, Low) of resource usage characteristics of newly proposed applications are summarized in Table 1. Please refer to [3] to read the description of comprehensive applications list.The proposed FunctionBench provides a variety of FaaS applications in multiple categories, and we are sure that it will enable fair evaluation of new research work in the relevant field with practical application scenarios.},

abstract = {Modern cloud providers offer dense hardware with multiple cores and large memories, hosted in global platforms. This raises the challenge of implementing high-performance software systems that can effectively scale from a single core to multicore to the globe. Conventional wisdom says that software designed for one scale point needs to be rewritten when scaling up by <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$10-100times$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>\texttimes{}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="wu-ieq1-2898401.gif"></inline-graphic></alternatives></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">[1]</xref> . In contrast, we explore how a system can be architected to scale across many orders of magnitude by design. We explore this challenge in the context of a new key-value store system called Anna: a partitioned, multi-mastered system that achieves high performance and elasticity via wait-free execution and coordination-free consistency. Our design rests on a simple architecture of coordination-free actors that perform state update via merge of lattice-based composite data structures. We demonstrate that a wide variety of consistency models can be elegantly implemented in this architecture with unprecedented consistency, smooth fine-grained elasticity, and performance that far exceeds the state of the art.},

abstract = {Serverless computing has gained attention due to its fine-grained provisioning, large-scale multi-tenancy, and on-demand scaling. However, it also forces applications to externalize state in remote storage, adding substantial overheads. To fix this "data shipping problem" we built Shredder, a low-latency multi-tenant cloud store that allows small units of computation to be performed directly within storage nodes. Storage tenants provide Shredder with JavaScript functions (or WebAssembly programs), which can interact directly with data without moving them over the network.The key challenge in Shredder is safely isolating thousands of tenant storage functions while minimizing data interaction costs. Shredder uses a unique approach where its data store and networking paths are implemented in native code to ensure performance, while isolated tenant functions interact with data using a V8-specific intermediate representation that avoids expensive cross-protection-domain calls and data copying. As a result, Shredder can execute 4 million remotely-invoked tenant functions per second spread over thousands of tenants with median and 99th-percentile response latencies of less than 50 μs and 500 μs, respectively. Our evaluation shows that Shredder achieves a 14% to 78% speedup against conventional remote storage when fetching items with just one to three data dependencies between them. We also demonstrate Shredder's effectiveness in accelerating data-intensive applications, including a k-hop query on social graphs that shows orders of magnitude gain.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms and "serverless" cloud computing are becoming increasingly popular due to ease-of-use and operational simplicity. Current FaaS offerings are targeted at stateless functions that do minimal I/O and communication. We argue that the benefits of serverless computing can be extended to a broader range of applications and algorithms while maintaining the key benefits of existing FaaS offerings. We present the design and implementation of Cloudburst, a stateful FaaS platform that provides familiar Python programming with low-latency mutable state and communication, while maintaining the autoscaling benefits of serverless computing. Cloudburst accomplishes this by leveraging Anna, an autoscaling key-value store, for state sharing and overlay routing combined with mutable caches co-located with function executors for data locality. Performant cache consistency emerges as a key challenge in this architecture. To this end, Cloudburst provides a combination of lattice-encapsulated state and new definitions and protocols for distributed session consistency. Empirical results on benchmarks and diverse applications show that Cloudburst makes stateful functions practical, reducing the state-management overheads of current FaaS platforms by orders of magnitude while also improving the state of the art in serverless consistency.},

Boki shared logs enable stateful serverless applications to manage their state with durability, consistency, and fault tolerance. Boki shared logs achieve high throughput and low latency. The key enabler is the metalog, a novel mechanism that allows Boki to address ordering, consistency and fault tolerance independently. The metalog orders shared log records with high throughput and it provides read consistency while allowing service providers to optimize the write and read path of the shared log in different ways. To demonstrate the value of shared logs for stateful serverless applications, we build Boki support libraries that implement fault-tolerant workflows, durable object storage, and message queues. Our evaluation shows that shared logs can speed up important serverless workloads by up to 4.7x.},

abstract = {Serverless is a popular choice for cloud service architects because it can provide scalability and load-based billing with minimal developer effort. Functions-as-a-service (FaaS) are originally stateless, but emerging frameworks add stateful abstractions. For instance, the widely used Durable Functions (DF) allow developers to write advanced serverless applications, including reliable workflows and actors, in a programming language of choice. DF implicitly and continuosly persists the state and progress of applications, which greatly simplifies development, but can create an IOps bottleneck.To improve efficiency, we introduce Netherite, a novel architecture for executing serverless workflows on an elastic cluster. Netherite groups the numerous application objects into a smaller number of partitions, and pipelines the state persistence of each partition. This improves latency and throughput, as it enables workflow steps to group commit, even if causally dependent. Moreover, Netherite leverages FASTER's hybrid log approach to support larger-than-memory application state, and to enable efficient partition movement between compute hosts.Our evaluation shows that (a) Netherite achieves lower latency and higher throughput than the original DF engine, by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, and (b) that Netherite has lower latency than some commonly used alternatives, like AWS Step Functions or cloud storage triggers.},

abstract = {We introduce SPEICHER, a secure storage system that not only provides strong confidentiality and integrity properties, but also ensures data freshness to protect against rollback/forking attacks. SPEICHER exports a Key-Value (KV) interface backed by Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM) for supporting secure data storage and query operations. SPEICHER enforces these security properties on an untrusted host by leveraging shielded execution based on a hardware-assisted trusted execution environment (TEE)-specifically, Intel SGX. However, the design of SPEICHER extends the trust in shielded execution beyond the secure SGX enclave memory region to ensure that the security properties are also preserved in the stateful (or non-volatile) setting of an untrusted storage medium, including system crash, reboot, or migration.More specifically, we have designed an authenticated and confidentiality-preserving LSM data structure. We have further hardened the LSM data structure to ensure data freshness by designing asynchronous trusted counters. Lastly, we designed a direct I/O library for shielded execution based on Intel SPDK to overcome the I/O bottlenecks in the SGX enclave. We have implemented SPEICHER as a fully-functional storage system by extending RocksDB, and evaluated its performance using the RocksDB benchmark. Our experimental evaluation shows that SPEICHER incurs reasonable overheads for providing strong security guarantees, while keeping the trusted computing base (TCB) small.},

abstract = {In multi-tenant environments, Linux containers managed by Docker or Kubernetes have a lower resource footprint, faster startup times, and higher I/O performance compared to virtual machines (VMs) on hypervisors. Yet their weaker isolation guarantees, enforced through software kernel mechanisms, make it easier for attackers to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of application data within containers.We describe SCONE, a secure container mechanism for Docker that uses the SGX trusted execution support of Intel CPUs to protect container processes from outside attacks. The design of SCONE leads to (i) a small trusted computing base (TCB) and (ii) a low performance overhead: SCONE offers a secure C standard library interface that transparently encrypts/decrypts I/O data; to reduce the performance impact of thread synchronization and system calls within SGX enclaves, SCONE supports user-level threading and asynchronous system calls. Our evaluation shows that it protects unmodified applications with SGX, achieving 0.6\texttimes{}-1.2\texttimes{} of native throughput.},

abstract = {Intel's SGX offers state-of-the-art security features, including confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA) when accessing sensitive pages in memory. Sensitive pages are placed in an Enclave Page Cache (EPC) within the physical memory before they can be accessed by the processor. To control the overheads imposed by CIA guarantees, the EPC operates with a limited capacity (currently 128 MB). Because of this limited EPC size, sensitive pages must be frequently swapped between EPC and non-EPC regions in memory. A page swap is expensive (about 40K cycles) because it requires an OS system call, page copying, updates to integrity trees and metadata, etc. Our analysis shows that the paging overhead can slow the system on average by 5\texttimes{}, and other studies have reported even higher slowdowns for memory-intensive workloads. The paging overhead can be reduced by growing the size of the EPC to match the size of physical memory, while allowing the EPC to also accommodate non-sensitive pages. However, at least two important problems must be addressed to enable this growth in EPC: (i) the depth of the integrity tree and its cacheability must be improved to keep memory bandwidth overheads in check, (ii) the space overheads of integrity verification (tree and MACs) must be reduced. We achieve both goals by introducing a variable arity unified tree (VAULT) organization that is more compact and has lower depth. We further reduce the space overheads with techniques that combine MAC sharing and compression. With simulations, we show that the combination of our techniques can address most inefficiencies in SGX memory access and improve overall performance by 3.7\texttimes{}, relative to an SGX baseline, while incurring a memory capacity over-head of only 4.7%.},

abstract = {Non-volatile main memory (NVMM) allows programmers to build complex, persistent, pointer-based data structures that can offer substantial performance gains over conventional approaches to managing persistent state. This programming model removes the file system from the critical path which improves performance, but it also places these data structures out of reach of file system-based fault tolerance mechanisms (e.g., block-based checksums or erasure coding). Without fault-tolerance, using NVMM to hold critical data will be much less attractive.This paper presents Pangolin, a fault-tolerant persistent object library designed for NVMM. Pangolin uses a combination of checksums, parity, and micro-buffering to protect an application's objects from both media errors and corruption due to software bugs. It provides these protections for objects of any size and supports automatic, online detection of data corruption and recovery. The required storage overhead is small (1\% for gigabyte-sized pools of NVMM). Pangolin provides stronger protection, requires orders of magnitude less storage overhead, and achieves comparable performance relative to the current state-of-the-art fault-tolerant persistent object library.},

overhead significantly compared to state-of-the-art PM file systems. SplitFS presents
a novel split of responsibilities between a user-space library file system and an
existing kernel PM file system. The user-space library file system handles data operations
by intercepting POSIX calls, memory-mapping the underlying file, and serving the read
and overwrites using processor loads and stores. Metadata operations are handled by
the kernel PM file system (ext4 DAX). SplitFS introduces a new primitive termed relink
to efficiently support file appends and atomic data operations. SplitFS provides three
consistency modes, which different applications can choose from, without interfering
with each other. SplitFS reduces software overhead by up-to 4x compared to the NOVA
PM file system, and 17x compared to ext4 DAX. On a number of micro-benchmarks and
applications such as the LevelDB key-value store running the YCSB benchmark, SplitFS
increases application performance by up to 2x compared to ext4 DAX and NOVA while
providing similar consistency guarantees.},

abstract = {Persistent memory provides data persistence at main memory with emerging non-volatile
main memories (NVMMs). Recent persistent memory file systems aggressively use direct
access, which directly copy data between user buffer and the storage layer, to avoid
the double-copy overheads through the OS page cache. However, we observe they all
suffer from slow writes due to NVMMs’ asymmetric read-write performance and much slower
performance than DRAM.In this article, we propose HiNFS, a high-performance file system
for non-volatile main memory, to combine both buffering and direct access for fine-grained
file system operations. HiNFS uses an NVMM-aware Write Buffer to buffer the lazy-persistent
file writes in DRAM, while performing direct access to NVMM for eager-persistent file
writes. It directly reads file data from both DRAM and NVMM, by ensuring read consistency
with a combination of the DRAM Block Index and Cacheline Bitmap to track the latest
data between DRAM and NVMM. HiNFS also employs a Buffer Benefit Model to identify
the eager-persistent file writes before issuing I/Os. Evaluations show that HiNFS
significantly improves throughput by up to 184% and reduces execution time by up to
64%comparing with state-of-the-art persistent memory file systems PMFS and EXT4-DAX.},

abstract = {The emergence of Intel's Optane DC persistent memory (Optane Pmem) draws much interest
in building persistent key-value (KV) stores to take advantage of its high throughput
and low latency. A major challenge in the efforts stems from the fact that Optane
Pmem is essentially a hybrid storage device with two distinct properties. On one hand,
it is a high-speed byte-addressable device similar to DRAM. On the other hand, the
write to the Optane media is conducted at the unit of 256 bytes, much like a block
storage device. Existing KV store designs for persistent memory do not take into account
of the latter property, leading to high write amplification and constraining both
write and read throughput. In the meantime, a direct re-use of a KV store design intended
for block devices, such as LSM-based ones, would cause much higher read latency due
to the former property.In this paper, we propose ChameleonDB, a KV store design specifically
for this important hybrid memory/storage device by considering and exploiting these
two properties in one design. It uses LSM tree structure to efficiently admit writes
with low write amplification. It uses an in-DRAM hash table to bypass LSM-tree's multiple
levels for fast reads. In the meantime, ChameleonDB may choose to opportunistically
maintain the LSM multi-level structure in the background to achieve short recovery
time after a system crash. ChameleonDB's hybrid structure is designed to be able to
absorb sudden bursts of a write workload, which helps avoid long-tail read latency.Our
experiment results show that ChameleonDB improves write throughput by 3.3\texttimes{} and reduces
read latency by around 60% compared with a legacy LSM-tree based KV store design.
ChameleonDB provides performance competitive even with KV stores using fully in-DRAM
index by using much less DRAM space. Compared with CCEH, a persistent hash table design,
ChameleonDB provides 6.4\texttimes{} higher write throughput.},

abstract = {The Persistent Memory (PM) technology combines the persistence of storage with the
performance approaching that of DRAM. Programs taking advantage of PM must ensure
data remains recoverable after a failure (e.g., power outage), and therefore, are
susceptible to having crash consistency bugs that lead to incorrect recovery after
a failure. Prior works have provided tools, such as Pmemcheck, PMTest, and XFDetector,
that detect these bugs by checking whether the trace of PM accesses violates the program’s
crash consistency guarantees. However, detection of crash consistency bugs highly
depends on test cases—a bug can only be detected if the buggy program path has been
executed. Therefore, using a test case generator is necessary to effectively detect
crash consistency bugs. Fuzzing is a common test case generation approach that requires
minimum knowledge about the program. We identify that PM programs have special requirements
for fuzzing. First, a PM program maintains a persistent state on PM images. Therefore,
the fuzzer needs to efficiently generate valid images as part of the test case. Second,
these PM images can also be a result of a previous crash, which requires the fuzzer
to generate crash images as well. Finally, PM programs can have various procedures
but only those performing PM operations can lead to crash consistency issues. Thus,
an efficient fuzzer should target those relevant regions. In this work, we provide
PMFuzz, a test case generator for PM programs that meets these new requirements. Our
evaluation shows that PMFuzz covers 4.6\texttimes{} more PM-related paths compared to AFL++,
a widely-used fuzzer. Further, test cases generated by PMFuzz discovered 12 new real-world
bugs in PM programs which have already been extensively tested by prior PM testing
works.},

abstract = {Recent non-volatile memory technologies such as 3D XPoint and NVDIMMs have enabled
persistent memory (PM) systems that can manipulate persistent data directly in memory.
This advancement of memory technology has spurred the development of a new set of
crash-consistent software (CCS) for PM - applications that can recover persistent
data from memory in a consistent state in the event of a crash (e.g., power failure).
CCS developed for persistent memory ranges from kernel modules to user-space libraries
and custom applications. However, ensuring crash consistency in CCS is difficult and
error-prone. Programmers typically employ low-level hardware primitives or transactional
libraries to enforce ordering and durability guarantees that are required for ensuring
crash consistency. Unfortunately, hardware can reorder instructions at runtime, making
it difficult for the programmers to test whether the implementation enforces the correct
ordering and durability guarantees. We believe that there is an urgent need for developing
a testing framework that helps programmers identify crash consistency bugs in their
CCS. We find that prior testing tools lack generality, i.e., they work only for one
specific CCS or memory persistency model and/or introduce significant performance
overhead. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose PMTest (available at https://pmtest.persistentmemory.org),
a crash consistency testing framework that is both flexible and fast. PMTest provides
flexibility by providing two basic assertion-like software checkers to test two fundamental
characteristics of all CCS: the ordering and durability guarantee. These checkers
can also serve as the building blocks of other application-specific, high-level checkers.
PMTest enables fast testing by deducing the persist order without exhausting all possible
orders. In the evaluation with eight programs, PMTest not only identified 45 synthetic
crash consistency bugs, but also detected 3 new bugs in a file system (PMFS) and in
applications developed using a transactional library (PMDK), while on average being
7.1\texttimes{} faster than the state-of-the-art tool.},

crash-consistent indexes for persistent memory (PM). The main insight behind Recipe
is that isolation provided by a certain class of concurrent in-memory indexes can
be translated with small changes to crash-consistency when the same index is used
in PM. We present a set of conditions that enable the identification of this class
of DRAM indexes, and the actions to be taken to convert each index to be persistent.
Based on these conditions and conversion actions, we modify five different DRAM indexes
based on B+ trees, tries, radix trees, and hash tables to their crash-consistent PM
counterparts. The effort involved in this conversion is minimal, requiring 30--200
lines of code. We evaluated the converted PM indexes on Intel DC Persistent Memory,
and found that they outperform state-of-the-art, hand-crafted PM indexes in multi-threaded
workloads by up-to 5.2x. For example, we built P-CLHT, our PM implementation of the
CLHT hash table by modifying only 30 LOC. When running YCSB workloads, P-CLHT performs
up to 2.4x better than Cacheline-Conscious Extendible Hashing (CCEH), the state-of-the-art

abstract = {Emerging byte-addressable nonvolatile memories (NVMs) promise persistent memory, which
allows processors to directly access persistent data in main memory. Yet, persistent
memory systems need to guarantee a consistent memory state in the event of power loss
or a system crash (i.e., crash consistency). To guarantee crash consistency, most
prior works rely on programmers to (1) partition persistent and transient memory data
and (2) use specialized software interfaces when updating persistent memory data.
As a result, taking advantage of persistent memory requires significant programmer
effort, e.g., to implement new programs as well as modify legacy programs. Use cases
and adoption of persistent memory can therefore be largely limited.In this paper,
we propose a hardware-assisted DRAM+NVM hybrid persistent memory design, Transparent
Hybrid NVM (ThyNVM), which supports software-transparent crash consistency of memory
data in a hybrid memory system. To efficiently enforce crash consistency, we design
a new dual-scheme checkpointing mechanism, which efficiently overlaps checkpointing
time with application execution time. The key novelty is to enable checkpointing of
data at multiple granularities, cache block or page granularity, in a coordinated
manner. This design is based on our insight that there is a tradeoff between the application
stall time due to checkpointing and the hardware storage overhead of the metadata
for checkpointing, both of which are dictated by the granularity of checkpointed data.
To get the best of the tradeoff, our technique adapts the checkpointing granularity
to the write locality characteristics of the data and coordinates the management of
multiple-granularity updates. Our evaluation across a variety of applications shows
that ThyNVM performs within 4.9% of an idealized DRAM-only system that can provide
crash consistency at no cost.},

abstract = {The advent of Persistent Memory (PM) devices enables systems to actively persist information
at low costs, including program state traditionally in volatile memory. However, this
trend poses a reliability challenge in which multiple classes of soft faults that
go away after restart in traditional systems turn into hard (recurring) faults in
PM systems. In this paper, we first characterize this rising problem with an empirical
study of 28 real-world bugs. We analyze how they cause hard faults in PM systems.
We then propose Arthas, a tool to effectively recover PM systems from hard faults.
Arthas checkpoints PM states via fine-grained versioning and uses program slicing
of fault instructions to revert problematic PM states to good versions. We evaluate
Arthas on 12 real-world hard faults from five large PM systems. Arthas successfully
recovers the systems for all cases while discarding 10\texttimes{} less data on average compared
to state-of-the-art checkpoint-rollback solutions.},

abstract = {Persistent memory (PM) technologies aim to revolutionize storage systems, providing
persistent storage at near-DRAM speeds. Alas, programming PM systems is error-prone,
as the misuse or omission of the durability mechanisms (i.e., cache flushes and memory
fences) can lead to durability bugs (i.e., unflushed updates in CPU caches that violate
crash consistency). PM-specific testing and debugging tools can help developers find
these bugs, however even with such tools, fixing durability bugs can be challenging.
To determine the reason behind this difficulty, we first study durability bugs and
find that although the solution to a durability bug seems simple, the actual reasoning
behind the fix can be complicated and time-consuming. Overall, the severity of these
bugs coupled with the difficultly of developing fixes for them motivates us to consider
automated approaches to fixing durability bugs. We introduce Hippocrates, a system
that automatically fixes durability bugs in PM systems. Hippocrates automatically
performs the complex reasoning behind durability bug fixes, relieving developers of
time-consuming bug fixes. Hippocrates’s fixes are guaranteed to be safe, as they are
guaranteed to not introduce new bugs (“do no harm”). We use Hippocrates to automatically
fix 23 durability bugs in realworld and research systems. We show that Hippocrates
produces fixes that are functionally equivalent to developer fixes. We then show that
solely using Hippocrates’s fixes, we can create a PM port of Redis which has performance
rivaling and exceeding the performance of a manually-developed PM-port of Redis.},

abstract = {Persistent memory (PM) technologies, such as Intel's Optane memory, deliver high performance,
byte-addressability, and persistence, allowing programs to directly manipulate persistent
data in memory without any OS intermediaries. An important requirement of these programs
is that persistent data must remain consistent across a failure, which we refer to
as the crash consistency guarantee. However, maintaining crash consistency is not
trivial. We identify that a consistent recovery critically depends not only on the
execution before the failure, but also on the recovery and resumption after failure.
We refer to these stages as the pre- and post-failure execution stages. In order to
holistically detect crash consistency bugs, we categorize the underlying causes behind
inconsistent recovery due to incorrect interactions between the pre- and post-failure
execution. First, a program is not crash-consistent if the post-failure stage reads
from locations that are not guaranteed to be persisted in all possible access interleavings
during the pre-failure stage -- a type of programming error that leads to a race that
we refer to as a cross-failure race. Second, a program is not crash-consistent if
the post-failure stage reads persistent data that has been left semantically inconsistent
during the pre-failure stage, such as a stale log or uncommitted data. We refer to
this type of bugs as a cross-failure semantic bug. Together, they form the cross-failure
bugs in PM programs. In this work, we provide XFDetector, a tool that detects cross-failure
bugs by automatically injecting failures into the pre-failure execution, and checking
for cross-failure races and semantic bugs in the post-failure continuation. XFDetector
has detected four new bugs in three pieces of PM software: one of PMDK's examples,
a PM-optimized Redis database, and a PMDK library function.},

abstract = {New storage-class memory (SCM) technologies, such as phase-change memory, STT-RAM,
and memristors, promise user-level access to non-volatile storage through regular
memory instructions. These memory devices enable fast user-mode access to persistence,
allowing regular in-memory data structures to survive system crashes.In this paper,
we present Mnemosyne, a simple interface for programming with persistent memory. Mnemosyne
addresses two challenges: how to create and manage such memory, and how to ensure
consistency in the presence of failures. Without additional mechanisms, a system failure
may leave data structures in SCM in an invalid state, crashing the program the next
time it starts.In Mnemosyne, programmers declare global persistent data with the keyword
"pstatic" or allocate it dynamically. Mnemosyne provides primitives for directly modifying
persistent variables and supports consistent updates through a lightweight transaction
mechanism. Compared to past work on disk-based persistent memory, Mnemosyne reduces
latency to storage by writing data directly to memory at the granularity of an update
rather than writing memory pages back to disk through the file system. In tests emulating
the performance characteristics of forthcoming SCMs, we show that Mnemosyne can persist
data as fast as 3 microseconds. Furthermore, it provides a 35 percent performance
increase when applied in the OpenLDAP directory server. In microbenchmark studies
we find that Mnemosyne can be up to 1400% faster than alternative persistence strategies,
such as Berkeley DB or Boost serialization, that are designed for disks.},

abstract = {New data storage technologies such as the recently introduced Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent
Memory Module (PMM) offer exciting opportunities for optimizing the query processing
performance of database workloads. In particular, the unique combination of low latency,
byte-addressability, persistence, and large capacity make persistent memory (PMem)
an attractive alternative along with DRAM and SSDs. Exploring the performance characteristics
of this new medium is the first critical step in understanding how it will impact
the design and performance of database systems. In this paper, we present one of the
first experimental studies on characterizing Intel® Optane™ DC PMM's performance behavior
in the context of analytical database workloads. First, we analyze basic access patterns
common in such workloads, such as sequential, selective, and random reads as well
as the complete Star Schema Benchmark, comparing standalone DRAM- and PMem-based implementations.
Then we extend our analysis to join algorithms over larger datasets, which require
using DRAM and PMem in a hybrid fashion while paying special attention to the read-write
asymmetry of PMem. Our study reveals interesting performance tradeoffs that can help
guide the design of next-generation OLAP systems in presence of persistent memory
in the storage hierarchy.},

become the determinant of web service performance. Traditionally, network stack is

there is a basic mismatch between fast hardware and slow software. Bypassing the kernel
and implementing the network stack in user-space have become a hot topic in both academic
and industry research areas. In this paper, we study the existing kernel-bypass techniques
and provides a comprehensive survey of user-space network stack. Our primary attention
is to propose a research overview of the state-of-the-art user-space network stack

abstract = {This paper argues for a new approach to building Byzantine fault tolerant replication systems. We observe that although recently developed BFT state machine replication protocols are quite fast, they don't tolerate Byzantine faults very well: a single faulty client or server is capable of rendering PBFT, Q/U, HQ, and Zyzzyva virtually unusable. In this paper, we (1) demonstrate that existing protocols are dangerously fragile, (2) define a set of principles for constructing BFT services that remain useful even when Byzantine faults occur, and (3) apply these principles to construct a new protocol, Aardvark. Aardvark can achieve peak performance within 40\% of that of the best existing protocol in our tests and provide a significant fraction of that performance when up to f servers and any number of clients are faulty. We observe useful throughputs between 11706 and 38667 requests per second for a broad range of injected faults.},

abstract = {Contemporary network stacks are masterpieces of generality, supporting many edge-node
and middle-node functions. Generality comes at a high performance cost: current APIs,
memory models, and implementations drastically limit the effectiveness of increasingly
powerful hardware. Generality has historically been required so that individual systems
could perform many functions. However, as providers have scaled services to support
millions of users, they have transitioned toward thousands (or millions) of dedicated
servers, each performing a few functions. We argue that the overhead of generality
is now a key obstacle to effective scaling, making specialization not only viable,
but necessary.We present Sandstorm and Namestorm, web and DNS servers that utilize
a clean-slate userspace network stack that exploits knowledge of application-specific
workloads. Based on the netmap framework, our novel approach merges application and
network-stack memory models, aggressively amortizes protocol-layer costs based on
application-layer knowledge, couples tightly with the NIC event model, and exploits
microarchitectural features. Simultaneously, the servers retain use of conventional
programming frameworks. We compare our approach with the FreeBSD and Linux stacks
using the nginx web server and NSD name server, demonstrating 2--10x and 9x improvements
in web-server and DNS throughput, lower CPU usage, linear multicore scaling, and saturated
NIC hardware.},

abstract = {The emergence of persistent memory (PM), such as Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory
Modules (DCPMM), opened up many opportunities for building high-performance indexes
directly on PM. However, the many PM indexes proposed by prior work had their evaluation
based on PM emulation using DRAM and therefore it was not clear how they would perform
on real PM hardware. Moreover, they typically used ad hoc, in-house benchmarks and
did not collect PM-specific hardware metrics that are key performance indicators and
are instrumental for users and developers to understand the performance behavior of
PM indexes. These issues call for a systematic, fair and reproducible approach for
evaluating PM indexes.This demonstration highlights the principles and lessons learned
from our recent evaluation of PM indexes on real DCPMM and showcases PiBench, a unified
benchmarking framework that enables fair and reproducible evaluation of PM indexes.
In addition to common metrics, PiBench uniquely integrates monitoring tools to collect
PM-specific hardware counters, allowing in-depth performance analysis. Our demonstration
is enabled by PiBench Online, a new interactive system built on top of PiBench. Using
PiBench Online, users can upload their own index implementations, run preset or customized
workloads, and analyze results interactively, all through an easy-to-use web interface.
PiBench is open-source and PiBench Online is deployed at https://pibench.org. We hope
PiBench Online can promote fair comparison and reproducibility in database and systems
communities.},

abstract = {Intel's SGX secure execution technology allows running computations on secret data using untrusted servers. While recent work showed how to port applications and large-scale computations to run under SGX, the performance implications of using the technology remains an open question. We present the first comprehensive quantitative study to evaluate the performance of SGX. We show that straightforward use of SGX library primitives for calling functions add between 8,200 - 17,000 cycles overhead, compared to 150 cycles of a typical system call. We quantify the performance impact of these library calls and show that in applications with high system calls frequency, such as memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd, which all have high bandwidth network requirements, the performance degradation may be as high as 79%. We investigate the sources of this performance degradation by leveraging a new set of microbenchmarks for SGX-specific operations such as enclave entry-calls and out-calls, and encrypted memory I/O accesses. We leverage the insights we gain from these analyses to design a new SGX interface framework HotCalls. HotCalls are based on a synchronization spin-lock mechanism and provide a 13-27x speedup over the default interface. It can easily be integrated into existing code, making it a practical solution. Compared to a baseline SGX implementation of memcached, openVPN, and lighttpd - we show that using the new interface boosts the throughput by 2.6-3.7x, and reduces application latency by 62-74%.},

abstract = {This article shows how to use model checking to find serious errors in file systems. Model checking is a formal verification technique tuned for finding corner-case errors by comprehensively exploring the state spaces defined by a system. File systems have two dynamics that make them attractive for such an approach. First, their errors are some of the most serious, since they can destroy persistent data and lead to unrecoverable corruption. Second, traditional testing needs an impractical, exponential number of test cases to check that the system will recover if it crashes at any point during execution. Model checking employs a variety of state-reducing techniques that allow it to explore such vast state spaces efficiently.We built a system, FiSC, for model checking file systems. We applied it to four widely-used, heavily-tested file systems: ext3, JFS, ReiserFS and XFS. We found serious bugs in all of them, 33 in total. Most have led to patches within a day of diagnosis. For each file system, FiSC found demonstrable events leading to the unrecoverable destruction of metadata and entire directories, including the file system root directory “/”.},

abstract = {Storage systems such as file systems, databases, and RAID systems have a simple, basic contract: you give them data, they do not lose or corrupt it. Often they store the only copy, making its irrevocable loss almost arbitrarily bad. Unfortunately, their code is exceptionally hard to get right, since it must correctly recover from any crash at any program point, no matter how their state was smeared across volatile and persistent memory.This paper describes EXPLODE, a system that makes it easy to systematically check real storage systems for errors. It takes user-written, potentially system-specific checkers and uses them to drive a storage system into tricky corner cases, including crash recovery errors. EXPLODE uses a novel adaptation of ideas from model checking, a comprehensive, heavy-weight formal verification technique, that makes its checking more systematic (and hopefully more effective) than a pure testing approach while being just as lightweight.EXPLODE is effective. It found serious bugs in a broad range of real storage systems (without requiring source code): three version control systems, Berkeley DB, an NFS implementation, ten file systems, a RAID system, and the popular VMware GSX virtual machine. We found bugs in every system we checked, 36 bugs in total, typically with little effort.},

abstract = {Data analytics is central to modern online services, particularly those data-driven.
Often this entails the processing of large-scale datasets which may contain private,
personal and sensitive information relating to individuals and organisations. Particular
challenges arise where cloud is used to store and process the sensitive data. In such
settings, security and privacy concerns become paramount, as the cloud provider is
trusted to guarantee the security of the services they offer, including data confidentiality.
Therefore, the issue this work tackles is “How to securely perform data analytics
in a public cloud?”To assist this question, we design and implement SGX-PySpark- a
secure distributed data analytics system which relies on a trusted execution environment
(TEE) such as Intel SGX to provide strong security guarantees. To build SGX-PySpark,
we integrate PySpark - a widely used framework for data analytics in industry to support
a wide range of queries, with SCONE - a shielded execution framework using Intel SGX.

abstract = {Data confidentiality is one of the biggest concerns that hinders enterprise customers
from moving their workloads to the cloud. Thanks to the trusted execution environment
(TEE), it is now feasible to build encrypted databases in the enclave that can process
customers' data while keeping it confidential to the cloud. Though some enclave-based
encrypted databases emerge recently, there remains a large unexplored area in between
about how confidentiality can be achieved in different ways and what influences are
implied by them. In this paper, we first provide a broad exploration of possible design
choices in building encrypted database storage engines, rendering trade-offs in security,
performance and functionality. We observe that choices on different dimensions can
be independent and their combination determines the overall trade-off of the entire
storage. We then propose Enclage, an encrypted storage engine that makes practical
trade-offs. It adopts many enclave-native designs, such as page-level encryption,
reduced enclave interaction, and hierarchical memory buffer, which offer high-level
security guarantee and high performance at the same time. To make better use of the
limited enclave memory, we derive the optimal page size in enclave and adopt delta
decryption to access large data pages with low cost. Our experiments show that Enclage
outperforms the baseline, a common storage design in many encrypted databases, by
over 13x in throughput and about 5x in storage savings.},

abstract = {As non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies are expected to replace DRAM in the near
future, new challenges have emerged. For example, NVMs have slow and power-consuming
writes, and limited write endurance. In addition, NVMs have a data remanence vulnerability,
i.e., they retain data for a long time after being powered off. NVM encryption alleviates
the vulnerability, but exacerbates the limited endurance by increasing the number
of writes to memory. We observe that, in current systems, a large percentage of main
memory writes result from data shredding in operating systems, a process of zeroing
out physical pages before mapping them to new processes, in order to protect previous
processes' data. In this paper, we propose Silent Shredder, which repurposes initialization
vectors used in standard counter mode encryption to completely eliminate the data
shredding writes. Silent Shredder also speeds up reading shredded cache lines, and
hence reduces power consumption and improves overall performance. To evaluate our
design, we run three PowerGraph applications and 26 multi-programmed workloads from
the SPEC 2006 suite, on a gem5-based full system simulator. Silent Shredder eliminates
an average of 48.6% of the writes in the initialization and graph construction phases.
It speeds up main memory reads by 3.3 times, and improves the number of instructions
per cycle (IPC) by 6.4% on average. Finally, we discuss several use cases, including
virtual machines' data isolation and user-level large data initialization, where Silent
Shredder can be used effectively at no extra cost.},

abstract = {Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an emerging Non Volatile Memory (NVM) technology that
has the potential to provide scalable high-density memory systems. While the non-volatility
of PCM is a desirable property in order to save leakage power, it also has the undesirable
effect of making PCM main memories susceptible to newer modes of security vulnerabilities,
for example, accessibility to sensitive data if a PCM DIMM gets stolen. PCM memories
can be made secure by encrypting the data. Unfortunately, such encryption comes with
a significant overhead in terms of bits written to PCM memory, causing half of the
bits in the line to change on every write, even if the actual number of bits being
written to memory is small. Our studies show that a typical writeback modifies, on
average, only 12% of the bits in the cacheline. Thus, encryption causes almost a 4x
increase in the number of bits written to PCM memories. Such extraneous bit writes
cause significant increase in write power, reduction in write endurance, and reduction
in write bandwidth. To provide the benefit of secure memory in a write efficient manner
this paper proposes Dual Counter Encryption (DEUCE). DEUCE is based on the observation
that a typical writeback only changes a few words, so DEUCE reencrypts only the words
that have changed. We show that DEUCE reduces the number of modified bits per writeback
for a secure memory from 50% to 24%, which improves performance by 27% and increases
lifetime by 2x.},

abstract = {A geo-distributed database for edge architectures spanning thousands of sites needs to assure efficient local updates while replicating sufficient state across sites to enable global management and support mobility, failover etc. To address this requirement, a new paradigm for database clustering that achieves a better balance than existing solutions between performance and strength of semantics called entry transactionality is introduced. Inspired by entry consistency in shared memory systems, entry transactionality guarantees that only a client that owns a range of keys in the database has a sequentially consistent value of the keys and can perform local and, hence, efficient transactions across these keys. Important use cases enabled by entry transactionality such as federated controllers and state management for edge applications are identified. The semantics of entry transactionality incorporating the complex failure modes in geo-distributed services are defined, and the difficult challenges in realizing these semantics are outlined. Then, a novel Middleware for Entry Transactional Clustering (METRIC) that combines existing SQL databases with an underlying geo-distributed entry consistent store to realize entry transactionality is described. This paper provides initial findings from an on-going effort.},

  abstract = {The power of two well-known consistency conditions for shared-memory multiprocessors, sequential consistency and linearizability, is compared. The cost measure studied is the worst-case response time in distributed implementations of virtual shared memory supporting one of the two conditions. Three types of shared-memory objects are considered: read/write objects, FIFO queues, and stacks. If clocks are only approximately synchronized (or do not exist), then for all three object types it is shown that linearizability is more expensive than sequential consistency. We show that, for all three data types, the worst-case response time is very sensitive to the assumptions that are made about the timing information available to the system. Under the strong assumption that processes have perfectly synchronized clocks, it is shown that sequential consistency and linearizability are equally costly. We present upper bounds for linearizability and matching lower bounds for sequential consistency. The upper bounds are shown by presenting algorithms that use atomic broadcast in a modular fashion. The lower-bound proofs for the approximate case use the technique of “shifting,” first introduced for studying the clock synchronization problem.},

  abstract = {A wait-free implementation of a concurrent data object is one that guarantees that any process can complete any operation in a finite number of steps, regardless of the execution speeds of the other processes. The problem of constructing a wait-free implementation of one data object from another lies at the heart of much recent work in concurrent algorithms, concurrent data structures, and multiprocessor architectures. First, we introduce a simple and general technique, based on reduction to a concensus protocol, for proving statements of the form, “there is no wait-free implementation of X by Y.” We derive a hierarchy of objects such that no object at one level has a wait-free implementation in terms of objects at lower levels. In particular, we show that    atomic read/write registers, which have been the focus of much recent attention, are at the bottom of the hierarchy: thay cannot be used to construct wait-free implementations of many simple and familiar data types. Moreover, classical synchronization primitives such astest&amp;set and fetch&amp;add, while more powerful than read and write, are also computationally weak, as are the standard message-passing primitives. Second, nevertheless, we show that there do exist simple universal objects from which one can construct a wait-free implementation of any sequential object.},

We show that Consensus can be solved even with unreliable failure detectors that make an infinite number of mistakes, and determine which ones can be used to solve Consensus despite any  number of crashes, and which ones require a majority of correct processes. We prove that Consensus and Atomic Broadcast are reducible to each other in asynchronous systems with crash failures; thus, the above results also apply to Atomic Broadcast. A companion paper shows that one of the failure detectors introduced here is the weakest failure detector for solving Consensus [Chandra et al. 1992].},

    abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound Δ on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound Φ on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds Δ and Φ exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds Δ and Φ exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds Δ and Φ. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.},

  abstract = {Distributed analytics systems enable users to efficiently perform computations over large distributed data sets. Recently, systems have been proposed that can additionally protect the data's privacy by keeping it encrypted even in memory and by performing the computations using trusted execution environments (TEEs). This approach has the potential to make it much safer to outsource analytics jobs to an untrusted cloud platform or to distribute it across multiple parties. TEEs, however, suffer from side channels, such as timing, memory access patterns, and message sizes that weaken their privacy guarantees. Existing privacy-preserving analytics systems only address a subset of these channels, such as memory access patterns, while largely neglecting size and timing. Moreover, previous attempts to close size and timing channels suffer from high performance costs, impracticality, or a lack of rigorous privacy guarantees.In this paper, we present an approach to mitigating timing and size side channels in analytics based on differential privacy that is both dramatically more efficient than the state-of-the-art while offering principled privacy assurances. We also sketch a design for a new analytics system we are developing called Hermetic that aims to be the first to mitigate the four most critical digital side channels simultaneously. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates the potential benefits of our method.},

abstract = {Non-volatile main memory, such as memristors or phase change memory, can revolutionize the way programs persist data. In-memory objects can themselves be persistent without the need for a separate persistent data storage format. However, the challenge is to ensure that such data remains consistent if a failure occurs during execution.In this paper, we present our system, called Atlas, which adds durability semantics to lock-based code, typically allowing us to automatically maintain a globally consistent state even in the presence of failures. We identify failure-atomic sections of code based on existing critical sections and describe a log-based implementation that can be used to recover a consistent state after a failure. We discuss several subtle semantic issues and implementation tradeoffs. We confirm the ability to rapidly flush CPU caches as a core implementation bottleneck and suggest partial solutions. Experimental results confirm the practicality of our approach and provide insight into the overheads of such a system.},

abstract = {Building persistent memory (PM) data structures is difficult because crashes interrupt operations, leaving data structures in an inconsistent state. Solving this requires augmenting code that modifies PM state to ensure that interrupted operations can be completed or undone. Today, this is done using careful, hand-crafted code, a compiler pass, or page faults. We propose a new, easy way to transform volatile data structure code to work with PM that uses a cache-coherent accelerator to do this augmentation, and we show that it may outperform existing approaches for building PM structures.},

abstract = {Security mechanisms for systems programming languages, such as fine-grained memory protection for C/C++, authorize operations at runtime using access rights associated with objects and pointers. The cost of such fine-grained capability-based security models is dominated by metadata updates and lookups, making efficient metadata management the key for minimizing performance impact. Existing approaches reduce metadata management overheads by sacrificing precision, breaking binary compatibility by changing object memory layout, or wasting space with excessive alignment or large shadow memory spaces.We propose FRAMER, a capability framework with object granularity. Its sound and deterministic per-object metadata management mechanism enables direct access to metadata by calculating their location from a tagged pointer to the object and a compact supplementary table. This may improve the performance of memory safety, type safety, thread safety and garbage collection, or any solution that needs to map pointers to metadata. FRAMER improves over previous solutions by simultaneously (1) providing a novel encoding that derives the location of per-object metadata with low memory overhead and without any assumption of objects' alignment or size, (2) offering flexibility in metadata placement and size, (3) saving space by removing any padding or re-alignment, and (4) avoiding internal object memory layout changes. We evaluate FRAMER with a use case on memory safety.},

abstract = {The GPU is a key computing platform for many application domains. While the new non-volatile memory technology has brought the promise of byte-addressable persistence (a.k.a., persistent memory, or PM) to CPU applications, the same, unfortunately, is beyond the reach of GPU programs. We take three key steps toward enabling GPU programs to access PM directly. First, enable direct access to PM from within a GPU kernel without needing to modify the hardware. Next, we demonstrate three classes of GPU-accelerated applications that benefit from PM. In the process, we create a workload suite with nine such applications. We then create a GPU library, written in CUDA, to support logging, checkpointing, and primitives for native persistence for programmers to easily leverage PM.},

abstract = {Memory errors in C and C++ programs continue to be one of the dominant sources of
security problems, accounting for over a third of the high severity vulnerabilities
reported in 2011. Wide-spread deployment of defenses such as address-space layout
randomization (ASLR) have made memory exploit development more difficult, but recent
trends indicate that attacks are evolving to overcome this defense. Techniques for
systematic detection and blocking of memory errors can provide more comprehensive
protection that can stand up to skilled adversaries, but unfortunately, these techniques
introduce much higher overheads and provide significantly less compatibility than
ASLR. We propose a new memory error detection technique that explores a part of the
design space that trades off some ability to detect bounds errors in order to obtain
good performance and excellent backwards compatibility. On the SPECINT 2000 benchmark,
the runtime overheads of our technique is about half of that reported by the fastest
previous bounds-checking technique. On the compatibility front, our technique has
been tested on over 7 million lines of code, which is much larger than that reported
for previous bounds-checking techniques.},

We focus on its unique support for shadow values-a powerful but previously little-studied
and difficult-to-implement DBA technique, which requires a tool to shadow every register
and memory value with another value that describes it. This support accounts for several
crucial design features that distinguish Valgrind from other DBI frameworks. Because
of these features, lightweight tools built with Valgrind run comparatively slowly,
but Valgrind can be used to build more interesting, heavyweight tools that are difficult
or impossible to build with other DBI frameworks such as Pin and DynamoRIO.},

and difficult-to-implement DBA technique, which requires a tool to shadow every register
and memory value with another value that describes it. This support accounts for several
crucial design features that distinguish Valgrind from other DBI frameworks. Because
of these features, lightweight tools built with Valgrind run comparatively slowly,
but Valgrind can be used to build more interesting, heavyweight tools that are difficult
or impossible to build with other DBI frameworks such as Pin and DynamoRIO.},

abstract = {Motivated by contemporary security challenges, we reevaluate and refine capability-based
addressing for the RISC era. We present CHERI, a hybrid capability model that extends
the 64-bit MIPS ISA with byte-granularity memory protection. We demonstrate that CHERI
enables language memory model enforcement and fault isolation in hardware rather than
software, and that the CHERI mechanisms are easily adopted by existing programs for
efficient in-program memory safety. In contrast to past capability models, CHERI complements,
rather than replaces, the ubiquitous page-based protection mechanism, providing a
migration path towards deconflating data-structure protection and OS memory management.
Furthermore, CHERI adheres to a strict RISC philosophy: it maintains a load-store
architecture and requires only singlecycle instructions, and supplies protection primitives
to the compiler, language runtime, and operating system. We demonstrate a mature FPGA
implementation that runs the FreeBSD operating system with a full range of software
and an open-source application suite compiled with an extended LLVM to use CHERI memory
protection. A limit study compares published memory safety mechanisms in terms of
instruction count and memory overheads. The study illustrates that CHERI is performance-competitive
even while providing assurance and greater flexibility with simpler hardware},

We present DieHard, a runtime system that tolerates these errors while probabilistically
maintaining soundness. DieHard uses randomization and replication to achieve probabilistic
memory safety by approximating an infinite-sized heap. DieHard's memory manager randomizes
the location of objects in a heap that is at least twice as large as required. This
algorithm prevents heap corruption and provides a probabilistic guarantee of avoiding
memory errors. For additional safety, DieHard can operate in a replicated mode where
multiple replicas of the same application are run simultaneously. By initializing
each replica with a different random seed and requiring agreement on output, the replicated
version of Die-Hard increases the likelihood of correct execution because errors are
unlikely to have the same effect across all replicas. We present analytical and experimental
results that show DieHard's resilience to a wide range of memory errors, including
a heap-based buffer overflow in an actual application.},

In this paper, we introduce the notion of dynamically typed C/C++, which aims to detect
such errors by dynamically checking the "effective type" of each object before use
at runtime. We also present an implementation of dynamically typed C/C++ in the form
of the Effective Type Sanitizer (EffectiveSan). EffectiveSan enforces type and memory
safety using a combination of low-fat pointers, type meta data and type/bounds check
instrumentation. We evaluate EffectiveSan against the SPEC2006 benchmark suite and
the Firefox web browser, and detect several new type and memory errors. We also show
that EffectiveSan achieves high compatibility and reasonable overheads for the given
error coverage. Finally, we highlight that EffectiveSan is one of only a few tools
that can detect sub-object bounds errors, and uses a novel approach (dynamic type
checking) to do so.},

guarantees to existing C programs. CCured attempts to verify statically that memory
errors cannot occur, and it inserts run-time checks where static verification is insufficient.CCured
extends C's type system by separating pointer types according to their usage, and
it uses a surprisingly simple type inference algorithm that is able to infer the appropriate
pointer kinds for existing C programs. CCured uses physical subtyping to recognize
and verify a large number of type casts at compile time. Additional type casts are
verified using run-time type information. CCured uses two instrumentation schemes,
one that is optimized for performance and one in which metadata is stored in a separate
data structure whose shape mirrors that of the original user data. This latter scheme
allows instrumented programs to invoke external functions directly on the program's
data without the use of a wrapper function.We have used CCured on real-world security-critical
network daemons to produce instrumented versions without memory-safety vulnerabilities,
and we have found several bugs in these programs. The instrumented code is efficient
enough to be used in day-to-day operations.},

at low costs, including program state traditionally in volatile memory. However, this
trend poses a reliability challenge in which multiple classes of soft faults that
go away after restart in traditional systems turn into hard (recurring) faults in
PM systems. In this paper, we first characterize this rising problem with an empirical
study of 28 real-world bugs. We analyze how they cause hard faults in PM systems.
We then propose Arthas, a tool to effectively recover PM systems from hard faults.
Arthas checkpoints PM states via fine-grained versioning and uses program slicing
of fault instructions to revert problematic PM states to good versions. We evaluate
Arthas on 12 real-world hard faults from five large PM systems. Arthas successfully
recovers the systems for all cases while discarding 10\texttimes{} less data on average compared
to state-of-the-art checkpoint-rollback solutions.},

abstract = {Persistent memory (PM) technologies aim to revolutionize storage systems, providing
persistent storage at near-DRAM speeds. Alas, programming PM systems is error-prone,
as the misuse or omission of the durability mechanisms (i.e., cache flushes and memory
fences) can lead to durability bugs (i.e., unflushed updates in CPU caches that violate
crash consistency). PM-specific testing and debugging tools can help developers find
these bugs, however even with such tools, fixing durability bugs can be challenging.
To determine the reason behind this difficulty, we first study durability bugs and
find that although the solution to a durability bug seems simple, the actual reasoning
behind the fix can be complicated and time-consuming. Overall, the severity of these
bugs coupled with the difficultly of developing fixes for them motivates us to consider
automated approaches to fixing durability bugs. We introduce Hippocrates, a system
that automatically fixes durability bugs in PM systems. Hippocrates automatically
performs the complex reasoning behind durability bug fixes, relieving developers of
time-consuming bug fixes. Hippocrates’s fixes are guaranteed to be safe, as they are
guaranteed to not introduce new bugs (“do no harm”). We use Hippocrates to automatically
fix 23 durability bugs in realworld and research systems. We show that Hippocrates
produces fixes that are functionally equivalent to developer fixes. We then show that
solely using Hippocrates’s fixes, we can create a PM port of Redis which has performance
rivaling and exceeding the performance of a manually-developed PM-port of Redis.},

abstract = {The Persistent Memory (PM) technology combines the persistence of storage with the
performance approaching that of DRAM. Programs taking advantage of PM must ensure
data remains recoverable after a failure (e.g., power outage), and therefore, are
susceptible to having crash consistency bugs that lead to incorrect recovery after
a failure. Prior works have provided tools, such as Pmemcheck, PMTest, and XFDetector,
that detect these bugs by checking whether the trace of PM accesses violates the program’s
crash consistency guarantees. However, detection of crash consistency bugs highly
depends on test cases—a bug can only be detected if the buggy program path has been
executed. Therefore, using a test case generator is necessary to effectively detect
crash consistency bugs. Fuzzing is a common test case generation approach that requires
minimum knowledge about the program. We identify that PM programs have special requirements
for fuzzing. First, a PM program maintains a persistent state on PM images. Therefore,
the fuzzer needs to efficiently generate valid images as part of the test case. Second,
these PM images can also be a result of a previous crash, which requires the fuzzer
to generate crash images as well. Finally, PM programs can have various procedures
but only those performing PM operations can lead to crash consistency issues. Thus,
an efficient fuzzer should target those relevant regions. In this work, we provide
PMFuzz, a test case generator for PM programs that meets these new requirements. Our
evaluation shows that PMFuzz covers 4.6\texttimes{} more PM-related paths compared to AFL++,
a widely-used fuzzer. Further, test cases generated by PMFuzz discovered 12 new real-world
bugs in PM programs which have already been extensively tested by prior PM testing
works.},

abstract = {Recent non-volatile memory technologies such as 3D XPoint and NVDIMMs have enabled
persistent memory (PM) systems that can manipulate persistent data directly in memory.
This advancement of memory technology has spurred the development of a new set of
crash-consistent software (CCS) for PM - applications that can recover persistent
data from memory in a consistent state in the event of a crash (e.g., power failure).
CCS developed for persistent memory ranges from kernel modules to user-space libraries
and custom applications. However, ensuring crash consistency in CCS is difficult and
error-prone. Programmers typically employ low-level hardware primitives or transactional
libraries to enforce ordering and durability guarantees that are required for ensuring
crash consistency. Unfortunately, hardware can reorder instructions at runtime, making
it difficult for the programmers to test whether the implementation enforces the correct
ordering and durability guarantees. We believe that there is an urgent need for developing
a testing framework that helps programmers identify crash consistency bugs in their
CCS. We find that prior testing tools lack generality, i.e., they work only for one
specific CCS or memory persistency model and/or introduce significant performance
overhead. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose PMTest (available at https://pmtest.persistentmemory.org),
a crash consistency testing framework that is both flexible and fast. PMTest provides
flexibility by providing two basic assertion-like software checkers to test two fundamental
characteristics of all CCS: the ordering and durability guarantee. These checkers
can also serve as the building blocks of other application-specific, high-level checkers.
PMTest enables fast testing by deducing the persist order without exhausting all possible
orders. In the evaluation with eight programs, PMTest not only identified 45 synthetic
crash consistency bugs, but also detected 3 new bugs in a file system (PMFS) and in
applications developed using a transactional library (PMDK), while on average being
7.1\texttimes{} faster than the state-of-the-art tool.},

In this paper, we describe a collection of techniques that dramatically reduce the
overhead of this approach, by exploiting a fine-grain partitioning of memory called
Automatic Pool Allocation. Together, these techniques bring the average overhead checks
down to only 12% for a set of benchmarks (but 69% for one case). We show that the
memory partitioning is key to bringing down this overhead. We also show that our technique
successfully detects all buffer overrun violations in a test suite modeling reported

aids. This paper presents CETS, a compile-time transformation for detecting all violations
of temporal safety in C programs. Inspired by existing approaches, CETS maintains
a unique identifier with each object, associates this metadata with the pointers in
a disjoint metadata space to retain memory layout compatibility, and checks that the
object is still allocated on pointer dereferences. A formal proof shows that this
is sufficient to provide temporal safety even in the presence of arbitrary casts if
the program contains no spatial safety violations. Our CETS prototype employs both
temporal check removal optimizations and traditional compiler optimizations to achieve
a runtime overhead of just 48% on average. When combined with a spatial-checking system,
the average overall overhead is 116% for complete memory safety},

data structures that can survive system failures. Programming for PM is challenging,
not least because it combines well-known programming challenges like locking, memory
management, and pointer safety with novel PM-specific bug types. It also requires
logging updates to PM to facilitate recovery after a crash. A misstep in any of these
areas can corrupt data, leak resources, or prevent successful recovery after a crash.
Existing PM libraries in a variety of languages -- C, C++, Java, Go -- simplify some
of these problems, but they still require the programmer to learn (and flawlessly
apply) complex rules to ensure correctness. Opportunities for data-destroying bugs
abound. This paper presents Corundum, a Rust-based library with an idiomatic PM programming
interface and leverages Rust’s type system to statically avoid most common PM programming
bugs. Corundum lets programmers develop persistent data structures using familiar
Rust constructs and have confidence that they will be free of those bugs. We have
implemented Corundum and found its performance to be as good as or better than Intel's
widely-used PMDK library, HP's Atlas, Mnemosyne, and go-pmem.},

abstract = {With the increasing adoption of containerization in cloud services, container networking has become a critical concern, as it enables the agile deployment of microservices but also introduces new vulnerabilities susceptible to network attacks, posing a threat to container environments. While several security solutions have been introduced to address this concern, they unfortunately exhibit significant shortcomings, including security vulnerabilities and limited performance. We thus propose Helios, a novel hardware-based network security extension that addresses the security and performance limitations in existing solutions. Leveraging a smartNIC, Helios enhances both the security and performance facets of container networking through two key mechanisms: (i) the establishment of physically isolated container communication channels and (ii) the network security engines fully offloaded to the smartNIC. Our evaluation shows that Helios mitigates various network threats initiated from both container- and host-side while performing up to 3x faster than the existing solutions in container communication.},

abstract = {High-performance distributed transactions require efficient remote operations on database memory and protocol metadata. The high communication cost of this workload calls for hardware acceleration. Recent research has applied RDMA to this end, leveraging the network controller to manipulate host memory without consuming CPU cycles on the target server. However, the basic read/write RDMA primitives demand trade-offs in data structure and protocol design, limiting their benefits. SmartNICs are a flexible alternative for fast distributed transactions, adding programmable compute cores and on-board memory to the network interface. Applying measured performance characteristics, we design Xenic, a SmartNIC-optimized transaction processing system. Xenic applies an asynchronous, aggregated execution model to maximize network and core efficiency. Xenic's co-designed data store achieves low-overhead remote object accesses. Additionally, Xenic uses flexible, point-to-point communication patterns between SmartNICs to minimize transaction commit latency. We compare Xenic against prior RDMA- and RPC-based transaction systems with the TPC-C, Retwis, and Smallbank benchmarks. Our results for the three benchmarks show 2.42x, 2.07x, and 2.21x throughput improvement, 59\%, 42\%, and 22\% latency reduction, while saving 2.3, 8.1, and 10.1 threads per server.},

abstract = {Persistent memory allocator is an essential component of any Non-Volatile Main Memory
(NVMM) application. A slow memory allocator can bottleneck the entire application
stack, while an unsecure memory allocator can render applications inconsistent upon
program bugs or system failure. Unlike DRAM-based memory allocators, it is indispensable
for an NVMM allocator to guarantee its heap metadata safety from both internal and
external errors. An effective NVMM memory allocator should be 1) safe, 2) scalable,
and 3) high performing. Unfortunately, none of the existing persistent memory allocators
achieve all three requisites. For example, we found that even Intel's de-facto NVMM
allocator-libpmemobj is vulnerable to silent data corruption and persistent memory
leaks resulting from a simple heap overflow.In this paper, we propose Poseidon, a
safe, fast, and scalable persistent memory allocator. The premise of Poseidon revolves
around providing a user application with per-CPU sub-heaps for scalability and high
performance, while managing the heap metadata in a segregated fashion and efficiently
protecting the metadata using a scalable hardware-based protection scheme, Intel's
Memory Protection Keys (MPK). We evaluate Poseidon with a wide array of microbenchmarks
and real-world benchmarks, noting: Poseidon outperforms the state-of-art allocators
by a significant margin, showing improved scalability and performance, while also
guaranteeing heap metadata protection.},

abstract = {Load balancers are pervasively used inside today's clouds to distribute network requests across data center servers at scale. While load balancers were initially built using dedicated and custom hardware, most cloud providers now use software-based load balancers. This allows the implementations to be more agile and also enables on-demand provisioning of load balancing workload on generic servers, but it comes with increased provisioning and operating costs.We explore offloading load balancing onto programmable SmartNICs. To fully leverage the cost and energy efficiency of SmartNICs, our design proposes three key ideas. First, we argue that a full and complex TCP/IP stack is not required even for L7 load balancers and instead propose a design that uses a lightweight forwarding agent on the SmartNIC. Second, we develop connection management data structures that provide a high degree of concurrency with minimal synchronization when executed on multi-core SmartNICs. Finally, we describe how the load balancing logic could be accelerated using custom accelerators on SmartNICs. Our proof-of-concept implementations and preliminary results show that SmartNIC is a promising choice for navigating the underlying performance-cost tradeoffs.},

abstract = {Emerging Multicore SoC SmartNICs, enclosing rich computing resources (e.g., a multicore processor, onboard DRAM, accelerators, programmable DMA engines), hold the potential to offload generic datacenter server tasks. However, it is unclear how to use a SmartNIC efficiently and maximize the offloading benefits, especially for distributed applications. Towards this end, we characterize four commodity SmartNICs and summarize the offloading performance implications from four perspectives: traffic control, computing capability, onboard memory, and host communication.Based on our characterization, we build iPipe, an actor-based framework for offloading distributed applications onto SmartNICs. At the core of iPipe is a hybrid scheduler, combining FCFS and DRR-based processor sharing, which can tolerate tasks with variable execution costs and maximize NIC compute utilization. Using iPipe, we build a real-time data analytics engine, a distributed transaction system, and a replicated key-value store, and evaluate them on commodity SmartNICs. Our evaluations show that when processing 10/25Gbps of application bandwidth, NIC-side offloading can save up to 3.1/2.2 beefy Intel cores and lower application latencies by 23.0/28.0 μs.},

It was discovered that most of the metrics considered in the study have strong relationship with bug-density. On the other hand, few metrics do not demonstrate any remarkable relationship. The study provides invaluable lessons that should facilitate software engineers to administer quality from the early phases of development.

Despite their significant benefits regarding security (attack surface reduction) and performance (fast boot times and reduced memory footprints), the state-of-the-art OS kernel debloating techniques are seldom adopted in practice, especially in production systems. We identify the limitations of existing kernel debloating techniques that hinder their practical adoption, including both accidental and essential limitations. To understand these limitations, we build an advanced debloating framework named tool which enables us to conduct a number of experiments on different types of OS kernels (including Linux and the L4 microkernel) with a wide variety of applications (including HTTPD, Memcached, MySQL, NGINX, PHP and Redis). Our experimental results reveal the challenges and opportunities towards making kernel debloating techniques practical for real-world systems. The main goal of this paper is to share these insights and our experiences to shed light on addressing the limitations of kernel debloating in future research and development efforts.},

abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have been widely used in many security-critical applications. The popularity of TEEs derives from its high security and trustworthiness supported by secure hardware. Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is one of the most representative TEEs that creates an isolated environment on an untrusted operating system, thus providing run-time protection for the execution of security-critical code and data. However, Intel SGX is far from the acme of perfection. It has become a target of various attacks due to its security vulnerabilities. Researchers and practitioners have paid attention to the security vulnerabilities of SGX and investigated optimization solutions in real applications. Unfortunately, existing literature lacks a thorough review of security vulnerabilities of SGX and their countermeasures. In this article, we fill this gap. Specifically, we propose two sets of criteria for estimating security risks of existing attacks and evaluating defense effects brought by attack countermeasures. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy of SGX security vulnerabilities and shed light on corresponding attack vectors. After that, we review published attacks and existing countermeasures, as well as evaluate them by employing our proposed criteria. At last, on the strength of our survey, we propose some open challenges and future directions in the research of SGX security.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing data in recent years requires the datacenter infrastructure
to store and process data with extremely high throughput and low latency. Fortunately,
persistent memory (PM) and RDMA technologies bring new opportunities towards this
goal. Both of them are capable of delivering more than 10 GB/s of bandwidth and sub-microsecond
latency. However, our past experiences and recent studies show that it is non-trivial
to build an efficient and distributed storage system with such new hardware. In this
article, we design and implement TH-DPMS (TsingHua
Distributed Persistent Memory
System) based on persistent memory and RDMA, which unifies
the memory, file system, and key-value interface in a single system. TH-DPMS is designed
based on a unified distributed persistent memory abstract, pDSM. pDSM acts as a generic
layer to connect the PMs of different storage nodes via high-speed RDMA network and
organizes them into a global shared address space. It provides the fundamental functionalities,
including global address management, space management, fault tolerance, and crash
consistency guarantees. Applications are enabled to access pDSM with a group of flexible
and easy-to-use APIs by using either raw read/write interfaces or the transactional
ones with ACID guarantees. Based on pDSM, we implement a distributed file system and
a key-value store named pDFS and pDKVS, respectively. Together, they uphold TH-DPMS
with high-performance, low-latency, and fault-tolerant data storage. We evaluate TH-DPMS
with both micro-benchmarks and real-world memory-intensive workloads. Experimental
results show that TH-DPMS is capable of delivering an aggregated bandwidth of 120 GB/s
with 6 nodes. When processing memory-intensive workloads such as YCSB and Graph500,
TH-DPMS improves the performance by one order of magnitude compared to existing systems
and keeps consistent high efficiency when the workload size grows to multiple terabytes.},

abstract = {Memory safety violation is a major root cause of reliability and security issues in software systems. Byte-addressable persistent memory (PM), just like its volatile counterpart, is also susceptible to memory safety violations. While there is a couple of decades of work in ensuring memory safety for programs based on volatile memory, the existing approaches are incompatible for PM since the PM programming model introduces a persistent pointer representation for persistent memory objects and allocators, where it is imperative to design a crash consistent safety mechanism.We introduce SafePM, a memory safety mechanism that transparently and comprehensively detects both spatial and temporal memory safety violations for PM-based applications. SafePM's design builds on a shadow memory approach, and augments it with crash consistent data structures and system operations to ensure memory safety even across system reboots and crashes. We implement SafePM based on the AddressSanitizer compiler pass, and integrate it with the PM development kit (PMDK) runtime library. We evaluate SafePM across three dimensions: overheads, effectiveness, and crash consistency. SafePM overall incurs reasonable overheads while providing comprehensive memory safety, and has uncovered real-world bugs in the widely-used PMDK library.},

applications running on untrusted platforms. However, memory safety attacks such as
Heartbleed can render the confidentiality and integrity properties of shielded execution
completely ineffective. To prevent these attacks, the state-of-the-art memory-safety
approaches can be used in the context of shielded execution.In this work, we first
showcase that two prominent software- and hardware-based defenses, AddressSanitizer
and Intel MPX respectively, are impractical for shielded execution due to high performance
and memory overheads. This motivated our design of SGXBounds---an efficient memory-safety
approach for shielded execution exploiting the architectural features of Intel SGX.
Our design is based on a simple combination of tagged pointers and compact memory
layout.We implemented SGXBounds based on the LLVM compiler framework targeting unmodified
multithreaded applications. Our evaluation using Phoenix, PARSEC, and RIPE benchmark
suites shows that SGXBounds has performance and memory overheads of 17% and 0.1% respectively,
while providing security guarantees similar to AddressSanitizer and Intel MPX. We
have obtained similar results with SPEC CPU2006 and four real-world case studies:
SQLite, Memcached, Apache, and Nginx.},

a generic POSIX-like file system with performance similar to or better than a kernel

to optimize the file system interface. We demonstrate a specialized file system that
reduces a hierarchical file system abstraction to a key/value store with fewer consistency

is accessed via a slow, block-based interface. However, new byte-addressable, persistent
memory technologies such as phase change memory (PCM) offer fast, fine-grained access
to persistent storage.In this paper, we present a file system and a hardware architecture
that are designed around the properties of persistent, byteaddressable memory. Our
file system, BPFS, uses a new technique called short-circuit shadow paging to provide
atomic, fine-grained updates to persistent storage. As a result, BPFS provides strong
reliability guarantees and offers better performance than traditional file systems,
even when both are run on top of byte-addressable, persistent memory. Our hardware
architecture enforces atomicity and ordering guarantees required by BPFS while still
providing the performance benefits of the L1 and L2 caches.Since these memory technologies
are not yet widely available, we evaluate BPFS on DRAM against NTFS on both a RAM
disk and a traditional disk. Then, we use microarchitectural simulations to estimate
the performance of BPFS on PCM. Despite providing strong safety and consistency guarantees,
BPFS on DRAM is typically twice as fast as NTFS on a RAM disk and 4-10 times faster
than NTFS on disk. We also show that BPFS on PCM should be significantly faster than
a traditional disk-based file system.},

abstract = {New storage-class memory (SCM) technologies, such as phase-change memory, STT-RAM,
and memristors, promise user-level access to non-volatile storage through regular
memory instructions. These memory devices enable fast user-mode access to persistence,
allowing regular in-memory data structures to survive system crashes.In this paper,
we present Mnemosyne, a simple interface for programming with persistent memory. Mnemosyne
addresses two challenges: how to create and manage such memory, and how to ensure
consistency in the presence of failures. Without additional mechanisms, a system failure
may leave data structures in SCM in an invalid state, crashing the program the next
time it starts.In Mnemosyne, programmers declare global persistent data with the keyword
"pstatic" or allocate it dynamically. Mnemosyne provides primitives for directly modifying
persistent variables and supports consistent updates through a lightweight transaction
mechanism. Compared to past work on disk-based persistent memory, Mnemosyne reduces
latency to storage by writing data directly to memory at the granularity of an update
rather than writing memory pages back to disk through the file system. In tests emulating
the performance characteristics of forthcoming SCMs, we show that Mnemosyne can persist
data as fast as 3 microseconds. Furthermore, it provides a 35 percent performance
increase when applied in the OpenLDAP directory server. In microbenchmark studies
we find that Mnemosyne can be up to 1400% faster than alternative persistence strategies,
such as Berkeley DB or Boost serialization, that are designed for disks.},

abstract = {Persistent, user-defined objects present an attractive abstraction for working with
non-volatile program state. However, the slow speed of persistent storage (i.e., disk)
has restricted their design and limited their performance. Fast, byte-addressable,
non-volatile technologies, such as phase change memory, will remove this constraint
and allow programmers to build high-performance, persistent data structures in non-volatile
storage that is almost as fast as DRAM. Creating these data structures requires a
system that is lightweight enough to expose the performance of the underlying memories
but also ensures safety in the presence of application and system failures by avoiding
familiar bugs such as dangling pointers, multiple free()s, and locking errors. In
addition, the system must prevent new types of hard-to-find pointer safety bugs that
only arise with persistent objects. These bugs are especially dangerous since any
corruption they cause will be permanent.We have implemented a lightweight, high-performance
persistent object system called NV-heaps that provides transactional semantics while
preventing these errors and providing a model for persistence that is easy to use
and reason about. We implement search trees, hash tables, sparse graphs, and arrays
using NV-heaps, BerkeleyDB, and Stasis. Our results show that NV-heap performance
scales with thread count and that data structures implemented using NV-heaps out-perform
BerkeleyDB and Stasis implementations by 32x and 244x, respectively, by avoiding the
operating system and minimizing other software overheads. We also quantify the cost
of enforcing the safety guarantees that NV-heaps provide and measure the costs of
NV-heap primitive operations.},

year = {2004},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {We present a new technique, failure-oblivious computing, that enables servers to execute through memory errors without memory corruption. Our safe compiler for C inserts checks that dynamically detect invalid memory accesses. Instead of terminating or throwing an exception, the generated code simply discards invalid writes and manufactures values to return for invalid reads, enabling the server to continue its normal execution path.We have applied failure-oblivious computing to a set of widely-used servers from the Linux-based open-source computing environment. Our results show that our techniques 1) make these servers invulnerable to known security attacks that exploit memory errors, and 2) enable the servers to continue to operate successfully to service legitimate requests and satisfy the needs of their users even after attacks trigger their memory errors.We observed several reasons for this successful continued execution. When the memory errors occur in irrelevant computations, failure-oblivious computing enables the server to execute through the memory errors to continue on to execute the relevant computation. Even when the memory errors occur in relevant computations, failure-oblivious computing converts requests that trigger unanticipated and dangerous execution paths into anticipated invalid inputs, which the error-handling logic in the server rejects. Because servers tend to have small error propagation distances (localized errors in the computation for one request tend to have little or no effect on the computations for subsequent requests), redirecting reads that would otherwise cause addressing errors and discarding writes that would otherwise corrupt critical data structures (such as the call stack) localizes the effect of the memory errors, prevents addressing exceptions from terminating the computation, and enables the server to continue on to successfully process subsequent requests. The overall result is a substantial extension of the range of requests that the server can successfully process.},

abstract = {Serverless, or Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS), is an increasingly popular paradigm for application development,
as it provides implicit elastic scaling and load based billing. However, the weak execution guarantees and
intrinsic compute-storage separation of FaaS create serious challenges when developing applications that
require persistent state, reliable progress, or synchronization. This has motivated a new generation of serverless
frameworks that provide stateful abstractions. For instance, Azure’s Durable Functions (DF) programming
model enhances FaaS with actors, workflows, and critical sections.
As a programming model, DF is interesting because it combines task and actor parallelism, which makes
it suitable for a wide range of serverless applications. We describe DF both informally, using examples, and
formally, using an idealized high-level model based on the untyped lambda calculus. Next, we demystify
how the DF runtime can (1) execute in a distributed unreliable serverless environment with compute-storage
separation, yet still conform to the fault-free high-level model, and (2) persist execution progress without
requiring checkpointing support by the language runtime. To this end we define two progressively more
complex execution models, which contain the compute-storage separation and the record-replay, and prove
that they are equivalent to the high-level model.},

We argue that the primary reason for high memory and processing overheads is the inefficient use of these resources by current commodity network interface cards (NICs). We propose FlexNIC, a flexible network DMA interface that can be used by operating systems and applications alike to reduce packet processing overheads. FlexNIC allows services to install packet processing rules into the NIC, which then executes simple operations on packets while exchanging them with host memory. Thus, our proposal moves some of the packet processing traditionally done in software to the NIC, where it can be done flexibly and at high speed.We quantify the potential benefits of FlexNIC by emulating the proposed FlexNIC functionality with existing hardware or in software. We show that significant gains in application performance are possible, in terms of both latency and throughput, for several widely used applications, including a key-value store, a stream processing system, and an intrusion detection system.},

abstract = {Emerging Multicore SoC SmartNICs, enclosing rich computing resources (e.g., a multicore processor, onboard DRAM, accelerators, programmable DMA engines), hold the potential to offload generic datacenter server tasks. However, it is unclear how to use a SmartNIC efficiently and maximize the offloading benefits, especially for distributed applications. Towards this end, we characterize four commodity SmartNICs and summarize the offloading performance implications from four perspectives: traffic control, computing capability, onboard memory, and host communication.Based on our characterization, we build iPipe, an actor-based framework for offloading distributed applications onto SmartNICs. At the core of iPipe is a hybrid scheduler, combining FCFS and DRR-based processor sharing, which can tolerate tasks with variable execution costs and maximize NIC compute utilization. Using iPipe, we build a real-time data analytics engine, a distributed transaction system, and a replicated key-value store, and evaluate them on commodity SmartNICs. Our evaluations show that when processing 10/25Gbps of application bandwidth, NIC-side offloading can save up to 3.1/2.2 beefy Intel cores and lower application latencies by 23.0/28.0 μs.},

abstract = {Highly flexible software network functions (NFs) are crucial components to enable multi-tenancy in the clouds. However, software packet processing on a commodity server has limited capacity and induces high latency. While software NFs could scale out using more servers, doing so adds significant cost. This paper focuses on accelerating NFs with programmable hardware, i.e., FPGA, which is now a mature technology and inexpensive for datacenters. However, FPGA is predominately programmed using low-level hardware description languages (HDLs), which are hard to code and difficult to debug. More importantly, HDLs are almost inaccessible for most software programmers. This paper presents ClickNP, a FPGA-accelerated platform for highly flexible and high-performance NFs with commodity servers. ClickNP is highly flexible as it is completely programmable using high-level C-like languages, and exposes a modular programming abstraction that resembles Click Modular Router. ClickNP is also high performance. Our prototype NFs show that they can process traffic at up to 200 million packets per second with ultra-low latency ($< 2mu$s). Compared to existing software counterparts, with FPGA, ClickNP improves throughput by 10x, while reducing latency by 10x. To the best of our knowledge, ClickNP is the first FPGA-accelerated platform for NFs, written completely in high-level language and achieving 40 Gbps line rate at any packet size.},

abstract = {Increasingly, smart Network Interface Cards (sNICs) are being used in data centers to offload networking functions (NFs) from host processors thereby making these processors available for tenant applications. Modern sNICs have fully programmable, energy-efficient multi-core processors on which many packet processing functions, including a full-blown programmable switch, can run. However, having multiple switch instances deployed across the host hypervisor and the attached sNICs makes controlling them difficult and data plane operations more complex.This paper proposes a generalized SDN-controlled NF offload architecture called UNO. It can transparently offload dynamically selected host processors' packet processing functions to sNICs by using multiple switches in the host while keeping the data centerwide network control and management planes unmodified. UNO exposes a single virtual control plane to the SDN controller and hides dynamic NF offload behind a unified virtual management plane. This enables UNO to make optimal use of host's and sNIC's combined packet processing capabilities with local optimization based on locally observed traffic patterns and resource consumption, and without central controller involvement. Experimental results based on a real UNO prototype in realistic scenarios show promising results: it can save processing worth up to 8 CPU cores, reduce power usage by up to 2x, and reduce the control plane overhead by more than 50\%.},

abstract = {For the past two decades, the communication channel between the NIC and CPU has largely remained the same---issuing memory requests across a slow PCIe peripheral interconnect. Today, with application service times and network fabric delays measuring hundreds of nanoseconds, the NIC--CPU interface can account for most of the overhead when programming modern warehouse-scale computers.In this paper, we tackle this issue head-on by proposing a design for a fast path between the NIC and CPU, called Lightning NIC (L-NIC), which deviates from the established norms of offloading computation onto the NIC (inflating latency), or using centralized dispatcher cores for packet scheduling (limiting throughput). L-NIC adds support for a fast path from the network to the core of the CPU by writing and reading packets directly to/from the CPU register file. This approach minimizes network IO latency, providing significant performance improvements over traditional NIC--CPU interfaces.},

abstract = {Multiple vendors have recently released SmartNICs that provide both special-purpose accelerators and programmable processing cores that allow increasingly sophisticated packet processing tasks to be offloaded from general-purpose CPUs. Indeed, leading data-center operators have designed and deployed SmartNICs at scale to support both network virtualization and application-specific tasks. Unfortunately, cloud providers have not yet opened up the full power of these devices to tenants, as current runtimes do not provide adequate isolation between individual applications running on the SmartNICs themselves.We introduce FairNIC, a system to provide performance isolation between tenants utilizing the full capabilities of a commodity SoC SmartNIC. We implement FairNIC on Cavium LiquidIO 2360s and show that we are able to isolate not only typical packet processing, but also prevent MIPS-core cache pollution and fairly share access to fixed-function hardware accelerators. We use FairNIC to implement NIC-accelerated OVS and key/value store applications and show that they both can cohabitate on a single NIC using the same port, where the performance of each is unimpacted by other tenants. We argue that our results demonstrate the feasibility of sharing SmartNICs among virtual tenants, and motivate the development of appropriate security isolation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Today's NICs are becoming programmable ("smart"). To support new network protocols, services, and offloads, there are NICs today that have on-board FPGAs, embedded processors, programmable forwarding pipelines, and specialized engines to support features like RDMA. Unfortunately, existing programmable NICs have a number of key limitations. It is difficult to chain offloads, schedule competing accesses to shared resources, and support functions that require variable processing time and thus may not run at line-rate.In this paper, we propose PANIC, a new architecture for programmable NICs that overcomes the limitations of existing NIC designs. We divide the NIC into three components: 1) self-contained offload engines, 2) a logical switch, and 3) a logical scheduler. This design overcomes the limitations of existing designs and is able to scale with increasing line-rates to a large number of offloads and long offload chains.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed requires large-scale datacenter architectures that are naturally more susceptible to faults of single components. One way to offer consistent services on such unreliable systems are replicated state machines (RSMs). Yet, traditional RSM protocols cannot deliver the needed latency and request rates for future large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose a new set of protocols based on Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) primitives. To asses these mechanisms, we use a strongly consistent key-value store; the evaluation shows that our simple protocols improve RSM performance by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that RDMA introduces various new options, such as log access management. Our protocols enable operators to fully utilize the new capabilities of the quickly growing number of RDMA-capable datacenter networks.},

abstract = {Atomic broadcast protocols ensure that messages are delivered to a group of machines in some total order, even when some of these machines can fail. These protocols are key to making distributed services fault-tolerant, as their total order guarantee allows keeping multiple service replicas in sync. But, unfortunately, atomic broadcast protocols are also notoriously expensive. We present a new protocol, called Acuerdo, that improves atomic broadcast performance by using remote direct memory addressing (RDMA). Acuerdo is built from the ground up to perform communication using one-side RDMA writes, which do not use the CPU of the remote machine, and is explicitly designed to minimize waiting on the critical path. Our experimental results demonstrate that Acuerdo provides raw throughput comparable to or exceeding other RDMA atomic broadcast protocols, while improving latency by almost 2x.},

The API provides interfaces for structuring applications into patterns of subgroups and shards, supports state machine replication within them, and includes mechanisms that assist in restart after failures. Running over 100Gbps RDMA, Derecho can send millions of events per second in each subgroup or shard and throughput peaks at 16GB/s, substantially outperforming prior solutions. Configured to run purely on TCP, Derecho is still substantially faster than comparable widely used, highly-tuned, standard tools. The key insight is that on modern hardware (including non-RDMA networks), data-intensive protocols should be built from non-blocking data-flow components.},

title = {Bootstrapping Trust in Modern Computers},
year = {2011},
month = {August},
abstract = {Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving security on the local computer (e.g., to convince the user that her computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote computer's state (e.g., to enable the user to check that a web server will adequately protect her data). Although the recent "Trusted Computing" initiative has drawn both positive and negative attention to this area, we consider the older and broader topic of bootstrapping trust in a computer. We cover issues ranging from the wide collection of secure hardware that can serve as a foundation for trust, to the usability issues that arise when trying to convey computer state information to humans. This approach unifies disparate research efforts and highlights opportunities for additional work that can guide real-world improvements in computer security.},

abstract = {A lease is an important primitive for building distributed protocols, and it is ubiquitously employed in distributed systems. However, the scope of the classic lease abstraction is restricted to the trusted computing infrastructure. Unfortunately, this important primitive cannot be employed in the untrusted computing infrastructure because the trusted execution environments (TEEs) do not provide a trusted time source. In the untrusted environment, an adversary can easily manipulate the system clock to violate the correctness properties of lease-based systems.We tackle this problem by introducing trusted lease---a lease that maintains its correctness properties even in the presence of a clock-manipulating attacker. To achieve these properties, we follow a "trust but verify" approach for an untrusted timer, and transform it into a trusted timing primitive by leveraging two hardware-assisted ISA extensions (Intel TSX and SGX) available in commodity CPUs. We provide a design and implementation of trusted lease in a system called T-Lease---the first trusted lease system that achieves high security, performance, and precision. For the application developers, T-Lease exposes an easy-to-use generic APIs that facilitate its usage to build a wide range of distributed protocols.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of Egalitarian Paxos (EPaxos), a new distributed consensus algorithm based on Paxos. EPaxos achieves three goals: (1) optimal commit latency in the wide-area when tolerating one and two failures, under realistic conditions; (2) uniform load balancing across all replicas (thus achieving high throughput); and (3) graceful performance degradation when replicas are slow or crash.Egalitarian Paxos is to our knowledge the first protocol to achieve the previously stated goals efficiently---that is, requiring only a simple majority of replicas to be non-faulty, using a number of messages linear in the number of replicas to choose a command, and committing commands after just one communication round (one round trip) in the common case or after at most two rounds in any case. We prove Egalitarian Paxos's properties theoretically and demonstrate its advantages empirically through an implementation running on Amazon EC2.},

abstract = {Confidentiality is an indispensable requirement in financial applications of blockchain technology, and supporting it along with high performance and friendly programmability is technically challenging. In this paper, we present a system design called CONFIDE to support on-chain confidentiality by leveraging Trust Execution Environment (TEE). CONFIDE's secure data transmission protocol and data encryption protocol, together with a highly efficient virtual machine run in TEE, guarantee the confidentiality in the life cycle of a transaction from end to end. CONFIDE proposes a secure data model along with an application-driven secure protocol to guarantee data confidentiality and integrity. Its smart contract language extension offers users the flexibility to define complex confidentiality models. CONFIDE is implemented as a plugin module to Antfin Blockchain's proprietary platform, and can be plugged into other blockchain platforms as well with its universal interface design. Nowadays, CONFIDE is supporting millions of commercial transactions daily on consortium blockchain running financial applications including supply chain finance, ABS, commodity provenance, and cold-chain logistics.},

abstract = {Big data applications often incur large costs in I/O, data transfer and copying overhead, especially when operating in cloud environments. Since most such computations are distributed, data processing operations offloaded to the network card (NIC) could potentially reduce the data movement overhead by enabling near-data processing at several points of a distributed system. Following this idea, in this paper we present StRoM, a programmable, FPGA-based RoCE v2 NIC supporting the offloading of application level kernels. These kernels can be used to perform memory access operations directly from the NIC such as traversal of remote data structures as well as filtering or aggregation over RDMA data streams on both the sending or receiving sides. StRoM bypasses the CPU entirely and extends the semantics of RDMA to enable multi-step data access operations and in-network processing of RDMA streams. We demonstrate the versatility and potential of StRoM with four different kernels extending one-sided RDMA commands: 1) Traversal of remote data structures through pointer chasing, 2) Consistent retrieval of remote data blocks, 3) Data shuffling on the NIC by partitioning incoming data to different memory regions or CPU cores, and 4) Cardinality estimation on data streams.},

Our approach does not require dealing with message-passing protocols -- a major complication in existing distributed systems. Instead, developers just design and manipulate data structures within our service called Sinfonia. Sinfonia keeps data for applications on a set of memory nodes, each exporting a linear address space. At the core of Sinfonia is a novel minitransaction primitive that enables efficient and consistent access to data, while hiding the complexities that arise from concurrency and failures. Using Sinfonia, we implemented two very different and complex applications in a few months: a cluster file system and a group communication service. Our implementations perform well and scale to hundreds of machines.},

  abstract = {We propose a new paradigm for building scalable distributed systems. Our approach does not require dealing with message-passing protocols -- a major complication in existing distributed systems. Instead, developers just design and manipulate data structures within our service called Sinfonia. Sinfonia keeps data for applications on a set of memory nodes, each exporting a linear address space. At the core of Sinfonia is a novel minitransaction primitive that enables efficient and consistent access to data, while hiding the complexities that arise from concurrency and failures. Using Sinfonia, we implemented two very different and complex applications in a few months: a cluster file system and a group communication service. Our implementations perform well and scale to hundreds of machines.},

year = {1976},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society Press},
address = {Washington, DC, USA},
abstract = {A technique is described which permits distributed resources to be shared (services to be offered) in a resilient manner. The essence of the technique is to a priori declare one of the server hosts primary and the others backups. Any of the servers can perform the primary duties. Thus the role of primary can migrate around the set of servers. The concept of n-host resiliency is introduced and the error detection and recovery schemes for two-host resiliency are presented. The single primary, multiple backup technique for resource sharing is shown to have minimal delay. In the general case, this is superior to multiple primary techniques.},

abstract = {Many distributed databases employ consensus protocols to ensure that data is replicated in a strongly-consistent manner on multiple machines despite failures and concurrency. Unfortunately, these protocols show widely varying performance under different network, workload, and deployment conditions, and no previous study offers a comprehensive dissection and comparison of their performance. To fill this gap, we study single-leader, multi-leader, hierarchical multi-leader, and leaderless (opportunistic leader) consensus protocols, and present a comprehensive evaluation of their performance in local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). We take a two-pronged systematic approach. We present an analytic modeling of the protocols using queuing theory and show simulations under varying controlled parameters. To cross-validate the analytic model, we also present empirical results from our prototyping and evaluation framework, Paxi. We distill our findings to simple throughput and latency formulas over the most significant parameters. These formulas enable the developers to decide which category of protocols would be most suitable under given deployment conditions.},

abstract = {In the public cloud, the software security functions that multitenants deploy in their virtual networks have limited performance. SmartNIC overcomes these limitations by implementing these security functions with hardware acceleration. However, the shared SmartNIC resources are not open for external users with security considerations. Since the security requirements of tenants are diverse, it is tedious for network operators to develop these functions from scratch with low-level APIs.This paper presents UniSec, a unified programming framework for fast security functions development while improving performance with SmartNIC acceleration. UniSec provides modular abstraction for a single function and module sharing among multiple security functions. With the well-defined APIs of UniSec, developers only need to focus on the core logic instead of complex underlying operations including resource management, matching algorithms, etc. Experimental results show that the code has been reduced by 65\% on average for each security function with UniSec. UniSec also improves processing performance up to 76\%, compared with the software-only implementation.},

abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is a significant component of modern-day internet. Despite this fact, DNS traffic is mostly unencrypted, and as such a likely target for exploitation by malicious actors. The advancement of programmable switches presents researchers with the opportunity to explore DNS traffic from a new vantage point, without sacrificing network bandwidth. In spite of the incentive, DNS research in programmable switches has been scarce, owing to the difficulty in parsing DNS packets.We present a general solution to DNS packet parsing that can handle the vast majority of DNS packets (97\%) using current hardware and can easily be scaled to parse all DNS packets as hardware improves. Our highly configurable solution can be adjusted to fit many distinct use cases. Additionally, we explore the challenges involved in parsing DNS packets and present common pitfalls appearing in previous research attempting to do so.},

abstract = {Researchers have made great strides in improving the fault tolerance of both centralized and replicated systems against arbitrary (Byzantine) faults. However, there are hard limits to how much can be done with entirely untrusted components; for example, replicated state machines cannot tolerate more than a third of their replica population being Byzantine. In this paper, we investigate how minimal trusted abstractions can push through these hard limits in practical ways. We propose Attested Append-Only Memory (A2M), a trusted system facility that is small, easy to implement and easy to verify formally. A2M provides the programming abstraction of a trusted log, which leads to protocol designs immune to equivocation -- the ability of a faulty host to lie in different ways to different clients or servers -- which is a common source of Byzantine headaches. Using A2M, we improve upon the state of the art in Byzantine-fault tolerant replicated state machines, producing A2M-enabled protocols (variants of Castro and Liskov's PBFT) that remain correct (linearizable) and keep making progress (live) even when half the replicas are faulty, in contrast to the previous upper bound. We also present an A2M-enabled single-server shared storage protocol that guarantees linearizability despite server faults. We implement A2M and our protocols, evaluate them experimentally through micro- and macro-benchmarks, and argue that the improved fault tolerance is cost-effective for a broad range of uses, opening up new avenues for practical, more reliable services.},

abstract = {Mission critical systems deployed in data centers today are facing more sophisticated failures. Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols are capable of masking these types of failures, but are rarely deployed due to their performance cost and complexity. In this work, we propose a new approach to designing high performance BFT protocols in data centers. By re-examining the ordering responsibility between the network and the BFT protocol, we advocate a new abstraction offered by the data center network infrastructure. Concretely, we design a new authenticated ordered multicast primitive (aom) that provides transferable authentication and non-equivocation guarantees. Feasibility of the design is demonstrated by two hardware implementations of aom- one using HMAC and the other using public key cryptography for authentication - on new-generation programmable switches. We then co-design a new BFT protocol, NeoBFT, that leverages the guarantees of aom to eliminate cross-replica coordination and authentication in the common case. Evaluation results show that NeoBFT outperforms state-of-the-art protocols on both latency and throughput metrics by a wide margin, demonstrating the benefit of our new network ordering abstraction for BFT systems.},

abstract = {Performance of in-memory key-value store (KVS) continues to be of great importance as modern KVS goes beyond the traditional object-caching workload and becomes a key infrastructure to support distributed main-memory computation in data centers. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase of network bandwidth in data centers, shifting the bottleneck of most KVS from the network to the CPU. RDMA-capable NIC partly alleviates the problem, but the primitives provided by RDMA abstraction are rather limited. Meanwhile, programmable NICs become available in data centers, enabling in-network processing. In this paper, we present KV-Direct, a high performance KVS that leverages programmable NIC to extend RDMA primitives and enable remote direct key-value access to the main host memory.We develop several novel techniques to maximize the throughput and hide the latency of the PCIe connection between the NIC and the host memory, which becomes the new bottleneck. Combined, these mechanisms allow a single NIC KV-Direct to achieve up to 180 M key-value operations per second, equivalent to the throughput of tens of CPU cores. Compared with CPU based KVS implementation, KV-Direct improves power efficiency by 3x, while keeping tail latency below 10 μs. Moreover, KV-Direct can achieve near linear scalability with multiple NICs. With 10 programmable NIC cards in a commodity server, we achieve 1.22 billion KV operations per second, which is almost an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing systems, setting a new milestone for a general-purpose in-memory key-value store.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of data that needs to be collected and analyzed requires large-scale datacenter architectures that are naturally more susceptible to faults of single components. One way to offer consistent services on such unreliable systems are replicated state machines (RSMs). Yet, traditional RSM protocols cannot deliver the needed latency and request rates for future large-scale systems. In this paper, we propose a new set of protocols based on Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) primitives. To asses these mechanisms, we use a strongly consistent key-value store; the evaluation shows that our simple protocols improve RSM performance by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we show that RDMA introduces various new options, such as log access management. Our protocols enable operators to fully utilize the new capabilities of the quickly growing number of RDMA-capable datacenter networks.},

abstract = {Atomic broadcast protocols ensure that messages are delivered to a group of machines in some total order, even when some of these machines can fail. These protocols are key to making distributed services fault-tolerant, as their total order guarantee allows keeping multiple service replicas in sync. But, unfortunately, atomic broadcast protocols are also notoriously expensive. We present a new protocol, called Acuerdo, that improves atomic broadcast performance by using remote direct memory addressing (RDMA). Acuerdo is built from the ground up to perform communication using one-side RDMA writes, which do not use the CPU of the remote machine, and is explicitly designed to minimize waiting on the critical path. Our experimental results demonstrate that Acuerdo provides raw throughput comparable to or exceeding other RDMA atomic broadcast protocols, while improving latency by almost 2x.},

The API provides interfaces for structuring applications into patterns of subgroups and shards, supports state machine replication within them, and includes mechanisms that assist in restart after failures. Running over 100Gbps RDMA, Derecho can send millions of events per second in each subgroup or shard and throughput peaks at 16GB/s, substantially outperforming prior solutions. Configured to run purely on TCP, Derecho is still substantially faster than comparable widely used, highly-tuned, standard tools. The key insight is that on modern hardware (including non-RDMA networks), data-intensive protocols should be built from non-blocking data-flow components.},

abstract = {Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving security on the local computer (e.g., to convince the user that her computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote computer's state (e.g., to enable the user to check that a web server will adequately protect her data). Although the recent "Trusted Computing" initiative has drawn both positive and negative attention to this area, we consider the older and broader topic of bootstrapping trust in a computer. We cover issues ranging from the wide collection of secure hardware that can serve as a foundation for trust, to the usability issues that arise when trying to convey computer state information to humans. This approach unifies disparate research efforts and highlights opportunities for additional work that can guide real-world improvements in computer security.},

abstract = {A lease is an important primitive for building distributed protocols, and it is ubiquitously employed in distributed systems. However, the scope of the classic lease abstraction is restricted to the trusted computing infrastructure. Unfortunately, this important primitive cannot be employed in the untrusted computing infrastructure because the trusted execution environments (TEEs) do not provide a trusted time source. In the untrusted environment, an adversary can easily manipulate the system clock to violate the correctness properties of lease-based systems.We tackle this problem by introducing trusted lease---a lease that maintains its correctness properties even in the presence of a clock-manipulating attacker. To achieve these properties, we follow a "trust but verify" approach for an untrusted timer, and transform it into a trusted timing primitive by leveraging two hardware-assisted ISA extensions (Intel TSX and SGX) available in commodity CPUs. We provide a design and implementation of trusted lease in a system called T-Lease---the first trusted lease system that achieves high security, performance, and precision. For the application developers, T-Lease exposes an easy-to-use generic APIs that facilitate its usage to build a wide range of distributed protocols.},

abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a feature of modern central processing units (CPUs) that aim to provide a high assurance, isolated environment in which to run workloads that demand both confidentiality and integrity. Hardware and software components in the CPU isolate workloads, commonly referred to as Trusted Applications (TAs), from the main operating system (OS). This article aims to analyse the TEE ecosystem, determine its usability, and suggest improvements where necessary to make adoption easier. To better understand TEE usage, we gathered academic and practical examples from a total of 223 references. We summarise the literature and provide a publication timeline, along with insights into the evolution of TEE research and deployment. We categorise TAs into major groups and analyse the tools available to developers. Lastly, we evaluate trusted container projects, test performance, and identify the requirements for migrating applications inside them.},

abstract = {We present an integrated open-source framework to develop, deploy, and use event-driven distributed enclaved applications across heterogeneous Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Our framework strives for strong application authenticity and integrity guarantees, and optionally confidentiality and availability, while minimizing the run-time Trusted Computing Base (TCB). For software developers, our framework provides a high level of abstraction over the platform-specific TEE layer that provides isolation, attestation and secure communication amongst distributed application components, allowing developers to focus of application logic. We provide a notion of event-driven programming to develop distributed enclave applications in Rust and C for heterogeneous TEEs, including Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone and the open-source Sancus. This heterogeneity makes our framework uniquely suitable for a broad range of use cases which combine cloud processing, mobile and edge devices, and lightweight sensing and actuation.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of Egalitarian Paxos (EPaxos), a new distributed consensus algorithm based on Paxos. EPaxos achieves three goals: (1) optimal commit latency in the wide-area when tolerating one and two failures, under realistic conditions; (2) uniform load balancing across all replicas (thus achieving high throughput); and (3) graceful performance degradation when replicas are slow or crash.Egalitarian Paxos is to our knowledge the first protocol to achieve the previously stated goals efficiently---that is, requiring only a simple majority of replicas to be non-faulty, using a number of messages linear in the number of replicas to choose a command, and committing commands after just one communication round (one round trip) in the common case or after at most two rounds in any case. We prove Egalitarian Paxos's properties theoretically and demonstrate its advantages empirically through an implementation running on Amazon EC2.},

abstract = {Confidentiality is an indispensable requirement in financial applications of blockchain technology, and supporting it along with high performance and friendly programmability is technically challenging. In this paper, we present a system design called CONFIDE to support on-chain confidentiality by leveraging Trust Execution Environment (TEE). CONFIDE's secure data transmission protocol and data encryption protocol, together with a highly efficient virtual machine run in TEE, guarantee the confidentiality in the life cycle of a transaction from end to end. CONFIDE proposes a secure data model along with an application-driven secure protocol to guarantee data confidentiality and integrity. Its smart contract language extension offers users the flexibility to define complex confidentiality models. CONFIDE is implemented as a plugin module to Antfin Blockchain's proprietary platform, and can be plugged into other blockchain platforms as well with its universal interface design. Nowadays, CONFIDE is supporting millions of commercial transactions daily on consortium blockchain running financial applications including supply chain finance, ABS, commodity provenance, and cold-chain logistics.},

abstract = {A technique is described which permits distributed resources to be shared (services to be offered) in a resilient manner. The essence of the technique is to a priori declare one of the server hosts primary and the others backups. Any of the servers can perform the primary duties. Thus the role of primary can migrate around the set of servers. The concept of n-host resiliency is introduced and the error detection and recovery schemes for two-host resiliency are presented. The single primary, multiple backup technique for resource sharing is shown to have minimal delay. In the general case, this is superior to multiple primary techniques.},
