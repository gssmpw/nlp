\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\pramod{maybe instead of general conclusion - we can write this section as two paragraphs: 1) Discussion on generality (see the last sentence), and 2) limitations.}
In this paper, we present the design and implementation of \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture. \projecttitle{} proposes a host CPU-agnostic unified security architecture based on trustworthy network-level isolation. We materialize the \projecttitle{} architecture using SmartNICs by exposing a minimal and formally verified silicon root-of-trust with low TCB, relying on just two fundamental properties of transferable authentication and non-equivocation. Using \projecttitle{}, we implement a hardware-accelerated trustworthy network stack that efficiently transforms a range of distributed systems under the fail-stop operation model for untrusted (Byzantine) cloud environments. Notably, we realize the \projecttitle{} architecture-based FPGA-based SmartNICs on Alveo U280 cards; we believe other commercial SmartNIC vendors can implement our NIC-level interface.


%\projecttitle{} outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based trusted hardware, TEEs, while offering a unified, general, programmable, formally verified, and minimalist interface to build trustworthy distributed systems. 
\myparagraph{Ethical considerations and artifact availability} This work raises no ethical issues. The \projecttitle{} (HW and SW) artifact and formal security proofs will be publicly available.

% We present \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture for trustworthy distributed systems. \projecttitle{} leverages the state-of-the-art network hardware, i.e., SmartNICs and extends their security properties, implementing a minimalistic TCB, the attestation kernel that materializes the lower bound of properties---the non-equivocation and transferable authentication properties---to transform distributed systems for Byzantine settings. We formally verified the security and safety properties of \projecttitle{} while we also applied it to transform four systems: a single-node trusted log system, a state-machine-replication (SMR) protocol, a chain replication system and an accountability protocol. Our evaluation shows that \projecttitle{} outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based trusted hardware, TEEs while offering unification, generality and minimalism.



% \section{Conclusion}
% In this paper, we present the design and implementation of \projecttitle{}, a trusted NIC architecture. Our, we make the following contributions:
% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%     \item We designed and built \projecttitle{}, a {\em host-agnostic unified trusted high-performant} NIC architecture for building fast and trustworthy systems in the heterogeneous cloud infrastructure. We expose a trusted network programming library that offers the powerful properties of non-equivocation and transferable authentication to system designers while we show {\em how} to strengthen existent systems with \projecttitle{}.
%     %\dimitra{Hardware level implementation + minimalism taht allows verifiable + NIC level implementation tfor high performance}
%     \item We offer a {\em unified minimalistic verifiable silicon root of trust (TCB)}  that realizes an efficient transformation between existing system under the fail-stop operation model for the Byzantine settings in the cloud. We further conduct an end-to-end formal verification of our \projecttitle{} operations from bootstrapping and remote attestation to normal operation.
%     \item We built \projecttitle{} extending the scope of the state-of-the art SmartNIC devices to boost performance. We built our minimalistic TCB, \projecttitle{} attestation kernel, in NIC-level hardware by extending and shielding an FPGA-based RDMA network stack.
    
% \end{itemize}

%  We formally verified the security and safety properties of \projecttitle{} while we also applied it to transform four distributed systems: Attested Append-Only Memory (A2M), Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), Chain Replication, and Accountable Distributed Systems using PeerReview. Our evaluation shows that \projecttitle{} outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based trusted hardware, TEEs while offering unification, generality and minimalism.
