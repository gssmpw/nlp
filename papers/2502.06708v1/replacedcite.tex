%\subsection*{Activity Recognition}

%Minimal-invasive surgery has improved patient outcomes and lends itself easily to the digital acquisition of video files. This has led to the development of novel teaching strategies ____. Many methods have been used in the field of surgical activity recognition, such as bag of words (BoW) models and linear dynamical systems (LDS) ____.

%In surgical procedures, activity/phase recognition is the most common task ____. The recognition of the surgical phase is to break down a surgical operation into distinct parts, each of which represents a particular task that the surgeon must complete before moving to the next phase ____. Numerous techniques have been employed to identify the surgical phase, i.e., data from sensors on tool tracking systems ____, binary signals from instrument usage ____, and surgical robots ____.

%\subsection*{Surgical Skill Assessment}

%Surgery is dependent on an operator's skills to manipulate surgical instruments to interact with part or the whole of a human organ. This leads to a specific intended outcome, for example the dissection of a large cancerous or pre-cancerous polyp from the rectal wall ____. Training and assessment of these skills in a targeted manner can positively impact patient outcomes by enabling surgeons to practice or review their surgical actions ____. To maintain patient safety and minimize adverse clinical events, critical evaluation of surgical skills and constructive feedback have become essential components of surgical training ____. A recent study indicates that over 25\% of the variance in patient outcomes can be attributed to differences in the level of surgical skills among practising surgeons ____. Therefore, to enhance patient outcomes, it is crucial to consistently provide objective feedback on surgeons' technical performance to aid their skill development ____. Performance improvement in any specialised field is greatly enhanced with a structured and constructive feedback mechanism in a controlled environment. This is analogous to the positive impact of coaching in technically challenging sports, for example squash, where focused feedback over a prolonged period can significantly improve on-court performance and rankings.


%Surgical skill assessment also requires the correct identification of a particular surgical phase as different phases may be undertaken at different levels of proficiency.
