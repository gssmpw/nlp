    \caption{\textbf{Tabular Experiments $|$ Linear Regression with Normalizing Flow}: For every regression dataset from the OpenML platform considered, we initialize the parameters of a linear regression-based probabilistic model with the amortized inference models which were trained with a normalizing flow-based model. The parameters are then further trained with maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimate with gradient descent. Reverse and Forward KL denote initialization with the correspondingly trained amortized model. Prior refers to a MAP-based optimization baseline initialized from the prior $\gN(0, I)$, whereas Xavier refers to initialization from the Xavier initialization scheme.}

\section{OpenML Datasets}
\label{appdx:datasets}

For the tabular regression problems, we consider the suite of tasks outlined in \textit{OpenML-CTR23 - A curated tabular regression benchmarking suite}~\citep{fischer2023openmlctr23}, from which we further filter out datasets that have more than 2000 examples and 100 features. We also remove datasets with missing information and NaNs. Similarly, we consider the \textit{OpenML-CC18 Curated Classification benchmark
}~\citep{bischl2019openmlcc18} suite of tasks for classification and perform a similar filtering algorithm. We remove datasets with missing information and NaNs, as well as datasets with more than 2000 examples and 100 features. In addition, we also exclude datasets that are not made for binary classification. At the end of this filtering mechanism, we end up with 9 regression and 13 classification problems, and our dataset filtration pipeline is heavily inspired by~\cite{hollmann2022tabpfn}. We provide the datasets considered for both regression and classification below:

\textbf{Regression}: \textsc{airfoil\_self\_noise}, \textsc{concrete\_compressive\_strength}, \textsc{energy\_efficiency}, \textsc{solar\_flare}, \textsc{student\_performance\_por}, \textsc{QSAR\_fish\_toxicity}, \textsc{red\_wine}, \textsc{socmob} and \textsc{cars}.

\textbf{Classification}: \textsc{credit-g}, \textsc{diabetes}, \textsc{tic-tac-toe}, \textsc{pc4}, \textsc{pc3}, \textsc{kc2}, \textsc{pc1}, \textsc{banknote-authentication}, \textsc{blood-transfusion-service-center}, \textsc{ilpd}, \textsc{qsar-biodeg}, \textsc{wdbc} and \textsc{climate-model-simulation-crashes}.
