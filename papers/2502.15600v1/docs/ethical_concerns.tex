\section{Ethical Considerations}

Our work proposes a robust approach to bias detection in pre-trained MLMs in the context of human traits. We aim to promote awareness of these biases before using these models, a crucial precursor step for the ethical use of MLMs.

More generally, the intersection of our work with gender differences in human traits in psychology raises the question of whether gender differences in pre-trained MLMs reflect bias or whether they reflect observations of differences between genders.
%
This question is pertinent to the MLM bias detection field as a whole and will require, as a start, in depth meta-analysis in both fields.
%
This larger question is also relevant to the deployment of large language models in applications impacting society.
