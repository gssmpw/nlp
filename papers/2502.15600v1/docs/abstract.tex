\noindent There has been significant prior work using templates to study bias against demographic attributes in MLMs. However, these have limitations: they overlook random variability of templates and target concepts analyzed, assume equality amongst templates, and overlook bias quantification.
%
Addressing these, we propose a systematic statistical approach\footnote{Our code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/IngrojShrestha/robust_mlm_bias_detection_human_trait_ratings}}
%
to assess bias in MLMs, using mixed models to account for random effects, pseudo-perplexity weights for sentences derived from templates and quantify bias using statistical effect sizes.
%
Replicating  prior studies, we match on bias scores in magnitude and direction with small to medium effect sizes.
%
Next, we explore the novel problem of gender bias in the context of  \textit{personality} and \textit{character} traits, across seven MLMs (base and large).
%
We find that MLMs vary; ALBERT is unbiased for binary gender but the most biased for non-binary \textit{neo}, while  RoBERTa-large is the most biased for binary gender but shows small to no bias for \textit{neo}.
%
There is some alignment of MLM bias and findings in psychology (human perspective) - in \textit{agreeableness} with RoBERTa-large and \textit{emotional stability} with BERT-large. 
%
There is general agreement for the remaining 3 personality dimensions: both sides observe at most small differences across gender.
% 
For character traits, human studies on gender bias are limited thus comparisons are not feasible.
