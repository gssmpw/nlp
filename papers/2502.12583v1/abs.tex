Despite the growing development of long-context large language models (LLMs), data-centric approaches relying on synthetic data have been hindered by issues related to faithfulness, which limit their effectiveness in enhancing model performance on tasks such as long-context reasoning and question answering (QA). These challenges are often exacerbated by misinformation caused by lack of verification, reasoning without attribution, and potential knowledge conflicts. We propose \textsc{LongFaith}, a novel pipeline for synthesizing faithful long-context reasoning instruction datasets. By integrating ground truth and citation-based reasoning prompts, we eliminate distractions and improve the accuracy of reasoning chains, thus mitigating the need for costly verification processes. We open-source two synthesized datasets—\textsc{LongFaith}-SFT and \textsc{LongFaith}-PO—which systematically address multiple dimensions of faithfulness, including verified reasoning, attribution, and contextual grounding. Extensive experiments on multi-hop reasoning datasets and LongBench demonstrate that models fine-tuned on these datasets significantly improve performance. Our ablation studies highlight the scalability and adaptability of the \textsc{LongFaith} pipeline, showcasing its broad applicability in developing long-context LLMs.
