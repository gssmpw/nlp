\section{Limitations and Future Work}
%
In this work, we have presented DualGuard-MPPI, a novel MPPI framework for addressing the safety-constrained optimal control problem. By integrating Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis with MPPI, our approach ensures strict adherence to safety constraints throughout both the sampling and control execution phases. This combination enables high-performance trajectory optimization without compromising safety, validated through extensive simulation and real-world experiments. DualGuard-MPPI stands out for its capability to eliminate safety-related terms from the cost function, thereby streamlining the optimization process to focus purely on performance objectives.

While these contributions establish DualGuard-MPPI as a robust and scalable framework, certain limitations remain that warrant further exploration.
The requirement for a precomputed BRT introduces considerable computational overhead during setup, which may hinder its implementability in rapidly changing environments. Additionally, the reliance on explicitly defined system dynamics may restrict the framework's applicability to systems with highly complex or partially unknown models. Addressing these challengesâ€”such as by leveraging online reachability methods to dynamically update BRTs~\cite{warmStart,borquez2023param_cond_reach,EfficientInit2019} or using reachability methods for black-box systems~\cite{blackboxreach2024,RL_reach2021} could significantly expand the framework's usability. In addition, we will explore the deployment of the proposed approach on other safety-critical robotics applications.

% Our key contributions include the development of a "safe hallucination" step, guaranteeing safe and efficient sampling. This innovation improves sampling relevance, reduces computational waste, and provides deterministic safety guarantees. Furthermore, the incorporation of a final output filter enhances robustness by safeguarding against potential failures in combining individually safe samples. These contributions position DualGuard-MPPI as a versatile and scalable solution for safety-critical robotic applications.
