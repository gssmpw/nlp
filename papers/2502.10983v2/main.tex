\begin{abstract}
As home robotics gains traction, robots are increasingly integrated into households, offering companionship and assistance. Quadruped robots, particularly those resembling dogs, have emerged as popular alternatives for traditional pets. However, user feedback highlights concerns about the noise these robots generate during walking at home, particularly the loud footstep sound.
To address this issue, we propose a sim-to-real
based \ac{rl} approach to minimize the foot contact velocity highly related to the footstep sound. Our framework incorporates three key elements: learning varying PD gains to actively dampen and stiffen each joint, utilizing foot contact sensors, and employing curriculum learning to gradually enforce penalties on foot contact velocity. Experiments demonstrate that our learned policy achieves superior quietness compared to a \ac{rl} baseline and the carefully handcrafted Sony commercial controllers. Furthermore, the trade-off between robustness and quietness is shown. This research contributes to developing quieter and more user-friendly robotic companions in home environments.
% This paper addresses this issue by introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) based locomotion policy learned in a simulator and successfully transferred to the real home robot, aibo. Our approach includes three key elements: learning varying PD gains, using foot contact sensors, and utilizing curriculum learning. Evaluation of the resulting locomotion controller shows that it achieves quieter locomotion than Sony's commercial locomotion and our RL baseline locomotion, as measured by sound magnitude within the audible range. This research opens avenues for quieter and thus more user-friendly robotic companions in home environments.
%Our contributions include the first implementation of a quiet walking policy in RL for quadrupedal robots, deployment on a real consumer-grade small platform, and superior performance compared to baseline RL and Sony commercial controllers. => repetitive.
