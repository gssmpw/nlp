  abstract={Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI), such as pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), is being introduced into society and is expected to transform various fields of human endeavor. Although researchers have explored how LLM-powered tools can assist in student learning, limited studies have been conducted on the adoption, acceptance, and use by ethnic minority students, a group often underserved and underrepresented in developing and deploying cutting-edge technologies. This study analyzes qualitative data from graduate students and recent alumni of a US Historically Black College and University. We implement an LLM-powered tool that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) grounded in their teaching material, then ask participants to complete tasks based on the material, with and without the presence of the tool. We conducted semi-structured interviews before and after the tasks to obtain first-hand feedback on using Gen AI tools in a practical educational scenario. This study sheds light on some of the expectations, use, and barriers to acceptance from ethnic minority groups and can inform future designs and implementations of Generative AI tools in pedagogical environments.},

abstract = {Technological advancements have made AI instructors, or more broadly machine teachers, a lived reality. However, limited information is available about how students will perceive an AI instructor that provides educational content. Thus, the present study examines the effects of an AI instructor's voice and expertise on the perceived credibility of an AI instructor through an online experiment with a 2 (voice: machinelike vs. humanlike) x 2 (expertise: novice vs. expert) between-subjects design. Findings indicate that students perceive greater credibility of an AI instructor with a humanlike voice than those with a machinelike voice. The study also finds that social presence mediates the relationship between the voice of an AI instructor and the perceived credibility of the AI instructor. Finally, the perceived credibility of an AI instructor positively influences students' intentions to enroll in future AI instructor-based online courses. These findings highlight the importance of developing AI instructors that are perceived as credible.}
