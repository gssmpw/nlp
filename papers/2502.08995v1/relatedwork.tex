Many researchers have investigated methods to enhance web browsing performance and user experience, but fewer have focused specifically on the role of images. We identify and briefly summarize three key studies in this area. WebLego~\cite{webLego} proposes an innovative solution that races semantically similar images, trading strict content fidelity for faster loading speeds. However, WebLego tends to increase the overall page size, making it unsuitable for developing regions with limited bandwidth. ScaleUp~\cite{newman2019scaling} is a browser extension that dynamically adjusts browser scaling to reduce the number of objects loaded above the fold. While ScaleUp is designed for low-bandwidth networks, its effectiveness is limited when websites load substantial content below the fold, as we observed in Pakistan (see Figure~\ref{fig:res:quality}). Moreover, ScaleUp can serve as a complementary approach to \tool. BrowseLite~\cite{browseLite} is a client-side tool that optimizes web images for data savings by opportunistically requesting alternative image encodings or partial image data. \tool builds on the ideas from BrowseLite by introducing a novel approach: requesting highly compressed images and leveraging local AI models for upscaling, further enhancing data savings and performance.
