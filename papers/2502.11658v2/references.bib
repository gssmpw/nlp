abstract = {Fitness tracking applications allow athletes to record and share their exercises online, including GPS routes of their activities. However, sharing mobility data potentially raises real-world privacy and safety risks. One strategy to mitigate that risk is a “Privacy Zone,” which conceals portions of the exercise routes that fall within a certain radius of a user-designated sensitive location. A pressing concern is whether privacy zones are an effective deterrent against common attackers, such as a bike thief that carefully scrutinizes online exercise activities in search of their next target. Further, little is known about user perceptions of privacy zones or how they fit into the broader landscape of available privacy precautions. This work presents an online user study (N=603) that investigates the privacy concerns of fitness tracking users and evaluates the efficacy of privacy zones. Participants were first asked about their privacy behaviors with respect to fitness tracking applications. Next, participants completed an interactive task in which they attempted to deduce hidden locations protected by a privacy zone; we manipulated the number of displayed exercise activities that interacted with the privacy zone, as well as its size. Finally, participants were asked further questions about their impressions of privacy zones and use of other privacy precautions. We found that participants successfully inferred protected locations; for the most common privacy zone size, 68\% of guesses fell within 50 meters of the hidden location when participants were shown just 3 activities. Further, we found that participants who viewed 3 activities were more confident about their success in the task compared to participants who viewed 1 activity. Combined, these results indicate that users’ privacy-sensitive locations are at risk even when using a privacy zone. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings on related privacy features and discuss recommendations to fitness tracking users and services to improve the privacy and safety of fitness trackers.},

abstract = {Discourse involves two perspectives: a person’s intention in making an utterance and others’ perception of that utterance. The misalignment between these perspectives can lead to undesirable outcomes, such as misunderstandings, low productivity and even overt strife. In this work, we present a computational framework for exploring and comparing both perspectives in online public discussions. We combine logged data about public comments on Facebook with a survey of over 16,000 people about their intentions in writing these comments or about their perceptions of comments that others had written. Unlike previous studies of online discussions that have largely relied on third-party labels to quantify properties such as sentiment and subjectivity, our approach also directly captures what the speakers actually intended when writing their comments. In particular, our analysis focuses on judgments of whether a comment is stating a fact or an opinion, since these concepts were shown to be often confused. We show that intentions and perceptions diverge in consequential ways. People are more likely to perceive opinions than to intend them, and linguistic cues that signal how an utterance is intended can differ from those that signal how it will be perceived. Further, this misalignment between intentions and perceptions can be linked to the future health of a conversation: when a comment whose author intended to share a fact is misperceived as sharing an opinion, the subsequent conversation is more likely to derail into uncivil behavior than when the comment is perceived as intended. Altogether, these findings may inform the design of discussion platforms that better promote positive interactions.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of handheld devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) makes mobility traces of users broadly available to third party services. These traces are collected by means of various sensors embedded in the users’ devices, including GPS, WiFi and GSM. We study in this paper the mobility of 300 users over a period up to 31 months from the perspective of the above three types of data and with a focus on two cities, i.e., Lausanne (Switzerland) and Lyon (France). We found that users’ mobility traces, no matter if they are collected using GPS, WiFi or GSM antennas, are highly unique. We show that on average only four spatio-temporal points from the WiFi, GSM and GPS traces are enough to uniquely identify 94\% of the individuals, on both datasets. In addition, we show that using the temporal dimension (i.e., whether users move or are in a meaningful location such as their home or their working place) drastically improves the capacity to uniquely identify them compared to when only exploiting the spatial dimension (by 14\% on average). In some cases, using the temporal dimension alone can represent a better mobility footprint than the spatial dimension to discriminate users. We further conduct a de-anonymisation attack to assess how mobility traces can be re-identified, and show that almost all users can be de-anonymised with a high success rate. Finally, we apply different Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs), including spatial filtering, temporal cloaking, adding spatial noise to mobility data, or using generalisation, and analyse the impact of these mechanisms on both the uniqueness of users’ mobility traces and the outcome of the de-anonymisation attack. We show that spatially obfuscating mobility data is not enough to protect users, and that classical LPPMs are not able to protect users against a de-anonymisation attack. We finally conclude this paper by drawing some insights towards future spatio-temporal LPPMs.},

abstract = {Research shows that people’s use of computers and mobile phones is often characterized by a privacy paradox: Their self-reported concerns about their online privacy appear to be in contradiction with their often careless online behaviors. Earlier research into the privacy paradox has a number of caveats. Most studies focus on intentions rather than behavior and the influence of technical knowledge, privacy awareness, and financial resources is not systematically ruled out. This study therefore tests the privacy paradox under extreme circumstances, focusing on actual behavior and eliminating the effects of a lack of technical knowledge, privacy awareness, and financial resources. We designed an experiment on the downloading and usage of a mobile phone app among technically savvy students, giving them sufficient money to buy a paid-for app. Results suggest that neither technical knowledge and privacy awareness nor financial considerations affect the paradoxical behavior observed in users in general. Technically-skilled and financially independent users risked potential privacy intrusions despite their awareness of potential risks. In their considerations for selecting and downloading an app, privacy aspects did not play a significant role; functionality, app design, and costs appeared to outweigh privacy concerns.}

abstract = {We present a generic and automated approach to re-identifying nodes in anonymized social networks which enables novel anonymization techniques to be quickly evaluated. It uses machine learning (decision forests) to matching pairs of nodes in disparate anonymized sub-graphs. The technique uncovers artefacts and invariants of any black-box anonymization scheme from a small set of examples. Despite a high degree of automation, classification succeeds with significant true positive rates even when small false positive rates are sought. Our evaluation uses publicly available real world datasets to study the performance of our approach against real-world anonymization strategies, namely the schemes used to protect datasets of The Data for Development (D4D) Challenge. We show that the technique is effective even when only small numbers of samples are used for training. Further, since it detects weaknesses in the black-box anonymization scheme it can re-identify nodes in one social network when trained on another.},

However, users reporting privacy invasion were more likely to change privacy settings than those merely hearing about others' privacy invasions.

Despite previous research, it is not yet clear whether user engagement with consent forms via different types of interactions for confirming consent may play a significant role in effectively drawing user attention to the content, even after repeated exposure. We investigate, in a laboratory study, how different types of interactions that engage users with consent forms differ in terms of their effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. In addition, we examine if and how habituation affects user attention and satisfaction, and the time they spend on giving their consent. We conducted a controlled experiment with 80 participants in four different groups where people either were engaged actively with the policy content via Drag and Drop (DAD), Swipe, or Checkboxes, or were not actively engaged with the content (as the control condition) in a first-exposure phase and in a habituation phase. We measured user attention to consent forms along multiple dimensions, including direct, objective measurements and indirect, self-reported measures. Our results show that the different types of interactions may affect user attention to certain parts of policy information. In particular, the DAD action results in significantly more user attention to the data items compared to other groups. However, with repeated exposure to consent forms, the difference disappears. We conclude that user engagement with policy content needs to be designed with care, so that attention to substantial policy information is increased and not negatively affected.},

abstract = {Linking accounts of the same user across datasets -- even when personally identifying information is removed or unavailable -- is an important open problem studied in many contexts. Beyond many practical applications, (such as cross domain analysis, recommendation, and link prediction), understanding this problem more generally informs us on the privacy implications of data disclosure. Previous work has typically addressed this question using either different portions of the same dataset or observing the same behavior across thematically similar domains. In contrast, the general cross-domain case where users have different profiles independently generated from a common but unknown pattern raises new challenges, including difficulties in validation, and remains under-explored.In this paper, we address the reconciliation problem for location-based datasets and introduce a robust method for this general setting. Location datasets are a particularly fruitful domain to study: such records are frequently produced by users in an increasing number of applications and are highly sensitive, especially when linked to other datasets. Our main contribution is a generic and self-tunable algorithm that leverages any pair of sporadic location-based datasets to determine the most likely matching between the users it contains. While making very general assumptions on the patterns of mobile users, we show that the maximum weight matching we compute is provably correct. Although true cross-domain datasets are a rarity, our experimental evaluation uses two entirely new data collections, including one we crawled, on an unprecedented scale. The method we design outperforms naive rules and prior heuristics. As it combines both sparse and dense properties of location-based data and accounts for probabilistic dynamics of observation, it can be shown to be robust even when data gets sparse.},

abstract = {Much work has been done on predicting where is one going to be in the immediate future, typically within the next hour. By contrast, we address the open problem of predicting human mobility far into the future, a scale of months and years. We propose an efficient nonparametric method that extracts significant and robust patterns in location data, learns their associations with contextual features (such as day of week), and subsequently leverages this information to predict the most likely location at any given time in the future. The entire process is formulated in a principled way as an eigendecomposition problem. Evaluation on a massive dataset with more than 32,000 days worth of GPS data across 703 diverse subjects shows that our model predicts the correct location with high accuracy, even years into the future. This result opens a number of interesting avenues for future research and applications.},

abstract = {User profiling is crucial to many online services. Several recent studies suggest that demographic attributes are predictable from different online behavioral data, such as users' "Likes" on Facebook, friendship relations, and the linguistic characteristics of tweets. But location check-ins, as a bridge of users' offline and online lives, have by and large been overlooked in inferring user profiles. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of location check-ins for inferring users' demographics and propose a simple yet general location to profile (L2P) framework. More specifically, we extract rich semantics of users' check-ins in terms of spatiality, temporality, and location knowledge, where the location knowledge is enriched with semantics mined from heterogeneous domains including both online customer review sites and social networks. Additionally, tensor factorization is employed to draw out low dimensional representations of users' intrinsic check-in preferences considering the above factors. Meanwhile, the extracted features are used to train predictive models for inferring various demographic attributes.We collect a large dataset consisting of profiles of 159,530 verified users from an online social network. Extensive experimental results based upon this dataset validate that: 1) Location check-ins are diagnostic representations of a variety of demographic attributes, such as gender, age, education background, and marital status; 2) The proposed framework substantially outperforms compared models for profile inference in terms of various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.},

abstract = {Due to the emergence of geolocated applications, more and more mobility traces are generated on a daily basis and collected in the form of geolocated datasets. If an unauthorized entity can access this data, it can used it to infer personal information about the individuals whose movements are contained within these datasets, such as learning their home and place of work or even their social network, thus causing a privacy breach. In order to protect the privacy of individuals, a sanitization process, which adds uncertainty to the data and removes some sensible information, has to be performed. The global objective of GEPETO (for GEoPrivacy Enhancing TOolkit) is to provide researchers concerned with geo-privacy with means to evaluate various sanitization techniques and inference attacks on geolocated data. In this paper, we report on our preliminary experiments with GEPETO for comparing different clustering algorithms and heuristics that can be used as inference attacks, and evaluate their efficiency for the identification of point of interests, as well as their resilience to sanitization mechanisms such as sampling and perturbation.},

Our findings include multiple sophisticated fingerprinting techniques never before measured in the wild. This measurement is made possible by our open-source web privacy measurement tool, OpenWPM, which uses an automated version of a full-fledged consumer browser. It supports parallelism for speed and scale, automatic recovery from failures of the underlying browser, and comprehensive browser instrumentation. We demonstrate our platform's strength in enabling researchers to rapidly detect, quantify, and characterize emerging online tracking behaviors.},

Another way to discriminate among customers with different willingness to pay is to steer them towards different sets of products when they search within a product category (i.e., search discrimination). Our main contribution in this paper is to empirically demonstrate the existence of signs of both price and search discrimination on the Internet, and to uncover the information vectors used to facilitate them. Supported by our findings, we outline the design of a large-scale, distributed watchdog system that allows users to detect discriminatory practices.},

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU) has granted citizens some rights regarding solely automated decision-making (SADM), including obtaining an explanation of such processing. It is unclear, however, how organizations should support people in eﬀectively exercising such rights. We conducted an online survey to understand people’s perspectives on SADM. We found that our respondents had several misunderstandings about the SADM right, such as opt-out of SADM ahead of time. We also identiﬁed various attributes of SADM that our respondents desired to understand, including new attributes (e.g., actionable information about what they can practically do to improve future decision outcomes) not covered by implementation guidelines of the GDPR. Our respondents also anticipated many challenges with SADM, including not knowing when SADM is applied to them. We discuss design implications of our results on how to support people in coping with SADM, for instance, the design of icons to represent SADM processing and explanation templates that cover a common set of attributes and can be personalized to explain a speciﬁc SADM decision.},

The German sensitivity evaluations revealed in this study are compared to results from the US and Brazil (Markos et al., 2017), in order to understand the cultural impact on evaluations. Additionally, we analyze how attitudes and demographic characteristics of the German sample influence the perception of sensitivity on an individual level. Some distinct differences in sensitivity perception between Germany, Brazil, and the US can be observed, but the rank orders of sensitivity of data types is very similar between the countries, indicating that there is a consensus on what constitutes sensitivity across nations. On an individual level, disposition to value privacy, risk propensity, and education level influence the perception of sensitivity.

	abstract = {Smart Home Devices are household objects and appliances that are augmented with network connectivity and interactive capabilities. However, the beneﬁts and conveniences of such augmentation are tempered by corresponding increases in privacy and security threats. Studies of user perceptions of these threats and user practices for addressing them are limited mostly to speciﬁc devices and/or small samples from a single region. To address this gap, we compared perceptions and practices of people in three geographic regions regarding privacy and security matters related to Smart Home Devices. Across these regions, we found diﬀerences in perceived regulatory protection and other regional factors. Our ﬁndings suggest that a co-evolution of the design and public policy related to Smart Home Devices could enhance privacy protection and drive increased adoption of these devices.},

	abstract = {Privacy issues have plagued the rapid proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Resource-constrained IoT devices often obscure transparency for end-users. The usability of privacy-preserving mechanisms and tools offers promise but relies on accurately capturing privacy preferences. Our work replicates a previous study to examine users’ privacy expectations and preferences for IoT devices. We specifically focus our effort on examining users’ feelings regarding their data collection in an IoT-based environment. Our work analyzes different contributing factors that impact users’ privacy decisions about data collection. Our analysis supports previous work that has argued users’ perceived benefit is an essential factor and motivating favor. In contrast to the previous study, we identified the workplace has now morphed into a sensitive location where users are uncomfortable sharing their private information.},
