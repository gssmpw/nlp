\subsection{Privacy and location}
\label{sec:relatedPrivacy}

The privacy issues raised by location data gained a lot of traction in the last decade Roesch et al., "A Location-Based Approach to Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing" ____, 
In particular, user location traces extracted from various data have been shown to be highly unique Sweeney, "Can you identify me?" ____.
Several other works ____, studied the perceptions of privacy and utility of users related to fitness-trackers and demonstrated a high potential for data minimization (i.e., reducing the volume of data sent to service provider) ____. 
% Debatin et al.~
____, in turn, investigated Facebook users' awareness of privacy issues and perceived benefits and risks of utilizing Facebook and recommended better privacy protection, higher transparency and more education about the risks of posting personal information to reduce risky behavior.

\subsection{User Perceptions}
Roesch et al., "A Location-Based Approach to Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing" ____ specifically analysed the user perceptions and reactions to Google's My Activity and how this web history dashboard increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. 
% Martin and Nissenbaum~
____, clearly addressed users' perceptions of location data, it is to be noted that it does so from an information science standpoint -- that is, closer to sociology -- and not from a UX/usability one.

\subsection{Data Downloads}
Veys et al., "Exploring the Design of Data Downloads" ____ conducted an online survey with n = 153 participants to understand if Google's My Activity, as an example of a privacy transparency tool, increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. 
While most participants were aware of Google's data collection, the volume and detail was surprising, but after exposure to My Activity, participants were significantly more likely to be both less concerned about data collection and to view data collection more beneficially.

\subsection{Privacy Dashboards}
Farke et al., "My Activity: A Case Study on Privacy Transparency Tools" ____ conducted an online survey with n = 153 participants to understand if Google's My Activity, as an example of a privacy transparency tool, increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. 
% Martin and Nissenbaum~
____, clearly addressed users' perceptions of location data, it is to be noted that it does so from an information science standpoint -- that is, sociology -- and not from a UX/usability one.

\subsection{Age Differences}
With regard to age differences in privacy attitudes, ____ informed us that, when it comes to Social Networks (i.e., Facebook), young adults (18-45, the typical age range for our study) tend to be less concerned about their own privacy and about others' privacy than other age ranges.

%Privacy dashboards and transparency tools help users review and manage the data collected about them online. Since 2016, Google has offered such a tool, My Activity, which allows users to review and delete their activity data from Google services.
% We conducted an online survey with n = 153 participants to understand if Google's My Activity, as an example of a privacy transparency tool, increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. 
% While most participants were aware of Google's data collection, the volume and detail was surprising, but after exposure to My Activity, participants were significantly more likely to be both less concerned about data collection and to view data collection more beneficially.
% Only 25\% indicated that they would change any settings in the My Activity service or change any behaviors. This suggests that privacy transparency tools are quite beneficial for online services as they garner trust with their users and improve their perceptions without necessarily changing users' behaviors.

Roesch et al., "A Location-Based Approach to Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing" ____ specifically analysed the user perceptions and reactions to Google's My Activity and how this web history dashboard increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. 
% Farke et al.~
____, examined privacy concerns and preferences in IoT Trigger-Action Platforms using focus groups, in which they notably called for more usable privacy settings.
% ____ compared perceptions and practices of people in three geographic regions regarding privacy and security matters related to Smart Home Devices.
% Also related to IoT devices, ____ investigated through a pre-study of 15 participants the usability of centralized privacy settings.

Roesch et al., "A Location-Based Approach to Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing" ____ specifically analysed the user perceptions and reactions to Google's My Activity and how this web history dashboard increases or decreases end-users' concerns and benefits regarding data collection. 
% Islami et al.~
____, conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 17 Swedish drivers to analyse their privacy perceptions and preferences for intelligent transportation systems, then to provide recommendations for suitable predefined privacy options.
% ____ recently examined privacy concerns and preferences in IoT Trigger-Action Platforms using focus groups, in which they notably called for more usable privacy settings.
