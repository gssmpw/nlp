Writing a significant scientific thesis is hard work and it would not possible without the support from various people. First of all, I wish to express my greatest appreciation towards my supervisor Prof Pauline Galea and co-supervisor Prof Cristiana Sebu for the intellectual guidance, valuable advice and help that was given to me during my research. The thesis would not have been written without their supervision and support.

My special appreciation to Dr. Godwin Debono who encouraged me to pursue this work and who's support have been invaluable.

I would like to thank Dr. Carlo Giunchi at Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia for providing the necessary computational resources and Dr. Elena Cuoco at EGO for the collaborations that we have had, and ones to be held.

I would like to express immense thanks to my wife Rachel, she has been extremely supportive of me throughout this entire process and has made countless sacrifices to help me get to this point. 

Last but not least, gratitude goes to to my parents, Charles and Jane, my brother Daniel, and friends for their support and love. In more ways than one, I am here because of them.
