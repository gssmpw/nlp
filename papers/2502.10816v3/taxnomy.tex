\section{Taxonomy}
In this section, we present our taxonomy for addressing the multimodal imbalance problem, categorized into four main dimensions: Objective, Optimization, Training Procedures, and Data.

\subsection{Objectives}
Objective-based methods aim to refine the objectives in the multimodal training process to enhance overall model performance. For example, MMPareto treats multimodal learning objectives as multitask objectives. It improves the Pareto optimization algorithm for multimodal learning, boosting the generalization ability of the model across modalities.
