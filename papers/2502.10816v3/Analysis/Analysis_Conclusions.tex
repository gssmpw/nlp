\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we introduce BalanceBenchmark, a unified benchmark for fair and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal imbalance algorithms. By incorporating a systematic taxonomy, diverse evaluation metrics, a comprehensive dataset collection, and the modular toolkit BalanceMM, our benchmark enables thorough assessment of existing methods and provides a convenient tool for future work.
