\section{Conclusion}
We introduced SparseFormer, a sparse Vision Transformer-based detector designed for HRW shots. It uses selective token utilization to extract fine-grained features and aggregate features across windows to extract coarse-grained features. The combination of fine and coarse granularity effectively leverages the sparsity of HRW shots, facilitating handling extreme scale variations. Our Cross-slice NMS scheme and multi-scale strategy help detect oversized and diminutive objects. Experiments on PANDA and DOTA-v1.0 benchmarks show significant improvement over existing methods, advancing state-of-the-art performance in HRW shot object detection.
