\section{Conclusions}
This paper proved that the worst-case multiplicative sensitivity
of CDAWGs is asymptotically at most 8.
Our analysis is based fully on new combinatorial properties
of maximal repeats and their right-extensions,
that are incidental to an edit operation on the strings.

The only known lower bound for the multiplicative sensitivity of CDAWGs
is asymptotically 2~\cite{FujimaruNI25}.
It is intriguing future work to close the gap between
these upper bound and lower bound.
