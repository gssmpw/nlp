\begin{abstract}
Pre-training large language models (LLMs) on vast text corpora enhances natural language processing capabilities but risks encoding social biases, particularly gender bias. While parameter-modification methods like fine-tuning mitigate bias, they are resource-intensive, unsuitable for closed-source models, and lack adaptability to evolving societal norms. Instruction-based approaches offer flexibility but often compromise task performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{FaIRMaker}, an automated and model-independent framework that employs an \textbf{auto-search and refinement} paradigm to adaptively generate Fairwords, which act as instructions integrated into input queries to reduce gender bias and enhance response quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{FaIRMaker} automatically searches for and dynamically refines Fairwords, effectively mitigating gender bias while preserving task integrity and ensuring compatibility with both API-based and open-source LLMs.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Pre-training large language models (LLMs) on vast text corpora enhances their performance in various natural language processing tasks \cite{touvron2023llama, zhao2023survey, chiang2023vicuna} but risks encoding social biases, particularly gender bias, that are implicitly present in uncensored datasets \cite{liang2021towards, luccioni2021s}. %Among these, gender bias is a prominent societal bias, observed across various LLMs in different contexts \cite{li2023survey, zayed2024fairness}. 
Mitigating these biases is essential for the responsible deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. An effective debiasing method should meet several key criteria: (1) \textbf{Automation} to reduce human intervention, (2) \textbf{Applicability} across both open-source and black-box LLMs to support various deployment settings, and (3) \textbf{Utility Preservation} to maintain the original model performance.

    \vspace{-3em}
\end{table}

Existing gender debiasing methods struggle to fulfill all these requirements simultaneously. Efforts to align LLMs with bias-free values include parameter-modification methods such as supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning on human preference data \cite{thakur2023language, raza2024mbias, zhang2024genderalign, allam2024biasdpo}, or model editing on specific examples \cite{cai2024locating, anonymous2024Editbias}. 
However, these approaches face limitations in accessibility, efficiency, and flexibility that they are unsuitable for black-box models and require significant computational resources as models scale.
Instruction-based approaches provide an alternative solution, leveraging the instruction-following capability of LLMs, where preambles are appended to counteract gender stereotypes or reframe concepts in a gender-neutral manner to reduce bias. These debiasing prompts can be manually designed, incorporating counterfactual, fairness requirements and descriptive preambles \cite{ouyang2022training, zhang2023instruction}, or generated with automated gradient-based search \cite{shin2020autoprompt}, expanding the search space \cite{sheng2020towards}. However, automated searching for debiasing prompts requires white-box access to the model, while manually designed prompts often lack automation and compromise the LLMs' performance on normal tasks. As observed in Figure \ref{fig:icl}, response quality from both open-source and closed-source LLMs declines on normal task datasets like Dolly. This decline stems from the preambles’ influence on query interpretation, potentially distorting the model’s understanding. For instance, as shown in Table \ref{tab:intro_examples}, the manually designed counterfacutal statement \textit{CF-D} \cite{oba2024contextual}, introduces unnecessary gender-related details, which could mislead the model in responding to gender-irrelevant queries.


%However human designed instruction such as providing detailed counterfactual, fairness requirements or descriptive preambles often compromise the LLMs' performance on normal tasks. As seen in quality of responses from both open-source and closed-source LLMs declines on datasets like Dolly (Figure \ref{fig:icl}).
%Using carefully crafted external prompts, these methods reduce bias during inference \cite{ganguli2023capacity,si2022prompting}, making them compatible with black-box models, computational efficient and inherently flexible. 
%This flexibility allows dynamic adjustments for specific tasks or evolving societal norms, enabling continuous adaptation without model updates.
%Previous work has shown that appending a prefix string, such as “\textit{Please ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes}” \cite{ganguli2023capacity}, or providing few-shot examples \cite{si2022prompting}, can significantly reduce gender bias. However, the design of these prompts often requires human involvement or is closely tied to specific downstream tasks, limiting their generalizability and flexibility across various applications. Additionally, in-context learning-based prompts, where specific examples are given, can influence the model's interpretation of user queries, potentially compromising its performance on standard tasks. 
%For instance, \citet{oba2024contextual} introduces appending preambles before the input text to mitigate gender bias. These preambles can be detailed counterfactual (\textit{CF-D}) statements, which counteract real-world stereotypical gender associations, or detailed descriptive (\textit{Desc-D}) preambles, which reframe gender-biased concepts in a gender-neutral manner. Although the design of preambles can mitigate gender bias to some extent, it diminishes the model utility on normal tasks. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:icl}, take their performance on Dolly dataset as an example \cite{conover2023free}, which includes human-generated instructions across various task categories, the quality of responses from both open-source and closed-source LLMs is affected after the preambles are appended, evaluated by \texttt{llama3.1-8b-Instruct}. 
%This occurs because the preambles influences the model's interpretation of the user queries, potentially misleading its understanding. As shown in Table \ref{tab:intro_examples}, the \textit{CF-D} conterfacutal statement, ``\textit{Despite being a male, Austin became a dental hygienist,}" introduces extraneous details about Austin, which could mislead the model in responding to gender-irrelevant queries.

%Therefore, the great challenges lies in how to design the preambles that can successfully mitigate gender bias without misleading the LLMs' understanding on normal tasks. 

%We evaluate LLM responses on 200 instances from the Dolly dataset \cite{conover2023free}, which includes human-generated instructions across various task categories. Specifically, we score the responses of different LLMs before and after appending either \textit{CF-D} or \textit{Desc-D}, using \texttt{llama3.1-8b-Instruct} as the evaluation model.
%As shown in Figure \ref{fig:icl}, the quality of responses from both open-source and closed-source LLMs is affected after the preambles are appended. We hypothesize that the information in the preambles influences the model's interpretation of the user queries. For instance, the \textit{CF-D} statement, ``\textit{Despite being a male, Austin became a dental hygienist,}" introduces extraneous details about Austin, which could mislead the model in responding to gender-irrelevant queries.

  \label{fig:main}
  \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure*}

% \vspace{-0.7em}
To fill this gap and simultaneously satisfy the above requirements, we propose \textit{FaIRMaker} (\underline{Fa}ir and task-\underline{I}ntegrity aware \underline{R}esponse Maker), an automated and model-independent framework that enhances the gender fairness of responses generated by both API-based and open-source LLMs, while preserving their performance on normal tasks. 
The core concept of \textit{FaIRMaker} is \textbf{auto-search and refinement}. The \textbf{auto-search} step searches for debiasing triggers, referred to as Fairwords, with a gradient-based method. The \textbf{refinement} step then refines the searched Fairwords into natural language instructions, enabling their transfer to API-based LLMs while preserving performance on standard tasks. \textit{FaIRMaker} leverages the advantages of both automated gradient-based search (larger search space for effective debiasing) and manual design (applicable to the black-box setting). Specifically, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:main}, in the \textbf{auto-search} step, we first use a preference dataset to automatically optimize a set of bias-reducing triggers. Then a filtering process is introduced to retain only those demonstrating genuine debiasing performance, creating a Fairwords Bag and the corresponding Preference Dataset with Fairwords for refinement. In the \textbf{refinement} step, we train a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to adaptively refine Fairwords for various input queries, which ensures \textit{FaIRMaker}'s transferability and allows it to function as an independent module. 
To guarantee the effectiveness of bias mitigation while maintaining task integrity across different types of queries, we specialized a ChatGPT-assisted refined-Fairwords dataset for training the refiner.
% The specialized refiner is trained on the ChatGPT-assisted refined-Fairwords dataset that contains both the gender-related data and data from general tasks, ensuring that both bias reduction and task integrity are maintained across different types of queries.
During inference, \textit{FaIRMaker} selects a Fairwords from the Bag and uses the seq2seq model to generate the refined Fairwords, which is then applied to the query as an instruction that prompts the language model for a fair response while leaving the model's performance unaffected when paired with neutral queries. Experimental results demonstrate that \textit{FaIRMaker} outperforms baseline methods on both open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs in terms of gender bias mitigating effectiveness and utility on normal tasks. 



% The FaIRMaker framework consists of two main stages: training and inference, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:main}. 
% During the training stage, the process begins with \textit{Fairwords Generation}. A preference dataset containing gender-related queries, paired with good and bad responses, is used to automatically search Fairwords, which act as triggers to reduce bias. These Fairwords are optimized and filtered based on their ability to promote fair responses from language models, resulting in a Fairwords Bag and the corresponding Preference Dataset with Fairwords.
% Next, in the \textit{Instruction Generator Training} phase, LLMs are employed to analyze the paired responses and the potential meanings of Fairwords to create natural language instructions that guide biased responses toward fairness. This process constructs a dataset of 9K query-Fairwords-Instruction pairs, which is further enhanced with 9K general task data points to train a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. This model specializes in generating instructions that prompt fairer responses while preserving performance on general tasks.
% In the inference stage, when a user provides a query, FaIRMaker selects a Fairwords from the Fairwords Bag and uses the seq2seq model to generate a tailored instruction, which is then applied to the query to prompt the language model for a fair response.

%\textit{FaIRMaker} better aligns with the model’s understanding, leading to more effective and contextually appropriate instructions.

Comprehensive ablation studies reveal contributions of each component of \textit{FaIRMaker}. 
%Additionally, \textit{FaIRMaker} can further enhance the response quality of some fine-tuned models.


%Furthermore, we explore potential hypotheses to explain the mechanism behind the effectiveness of auto-searched triggers.

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Gender Bias in LLMs}
Gender bias in LLMs can be evaluated through intrinsic and extrinsic approaches \cite{li2023survey, zayed2024fairness}. Intrinsic methods evaluate bias independent of specific downstream tasks by analyzing statistical associations in the embedding space \cite{kurita2019measuring, may2019measuring} or evaluating the probabilities assigned to different options in datasets \cite{nangia2020crows, nadeem2020stereoset}.
In contrast, extrinsic approaches examine gender bias within the context of downstream tasks, such as coreference resolution \cite{levy2021collecting, kotek2023gender}, question answering \cite{feng2023pretraining}, reference letter generation \cite{wan2023kelly}, and classification tasks \cite{de2019bias}, each capturing gender bias from distinct perspectives. These studies underscore needs for ongoing research and mitigation strategies.
\vspace{-0.5em}

\subsection{Gender Bias Mitigation in LLMs}
To address gender bias in LLMs, various strategies have been proposed, typically categorized into white-box and black-box methods based on access to a model's internal parameters.
White-box methods require access to internal parameters, including fine-tuning and model editing. Fine-tuning involves creating specialized gender-inclusive datasets \cite{bartl2024showgirls, dong2024disclosure} for instruction-based fine-tuning \cite{raza2024mbias, thakur2023language} or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; \citealp{zhang2024genderalign, allam2024biasdpo}). Model editing focuses on identifying and modifying bias pathways \cite{cai2024locating} or utilizing hyper-networks for automatic parameter updates \cite{anonymous2024Editbias}. While effective, these methods depend on parameter access, limiting their use to closed-source models and potentially impacting overall model performance.

Black-box methods mitigate bias without requiring parameter access, often using textual prompts to guide fairer outputs. Techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT; \citealp{wei2022chain}) and in-context learning (ICL; \citealp{brown2020language}) have shown considerable promise \cite{sant2024power, ganguli2023capacity}. Counterfactual prompts and curated examples effectively encourage equitable content generation \cite{si2022prompting, dwivedi2023breaking, oba2024contextual}. However, they rely on static prompts, which may lose effectiveness on novel tasks or out-of-distribution data, limiting their robustness.
\vspace{-0.5em}

\subsection{Automatic Prompt Engineering}
Previous research has explored automatic prompt engineering from various perspectives. For instance, \citet{zhou2022large} proposed automatic instruction generation and selection for multiple NLP tasks, while \citet{cheng2023black} leveraged human preferences to optimize user prompts for better alignment with LLMs' input understanding.
In the context of bias mitigation, \citet{sheng2020towards} introduced automatically generated trigger tokens. However, these tokens are often nonsensical, making them uninterpretable and impractical for broader use. Similarly, \citet{bauer2024believe} developed an iterative in-context learning framework to automatically generate beliefs based on debiasing effectiveness, measured by content sentiment. Despite 100 iterations of optimization, the final beliefs remain dataset-specific, limiting their generalizability.


\section{Methods}
%In this section, we begin by providing an overview of the FaIRMaker framework, which encompasses both the training and inference stages, while also clarifying the associated notation. We then proceed with a detailed demonstration of the training subprocesses, namely \textit{Fairwords Auto-Searching} and \textit{Refiner Training}.
\textit{FaIRMaker} is an independent module designed to enhance the fairness of responses generated by both API-based and open-source LLMs. As depicted in the bottom block of Figure \ref{fig:main}, during inference, a Fairwords is selected from Fairwords Bag and combined with the user query. This input is then refined by a seq2seq model before being fed into the LLM, ensuring the generated response is fair and unbiased. In the following of this section, we will first introduce the development of the Fairwords Bag where each Fairwords candidate is generated through an \textit{auto-search} step. Then, we will provide a detailed explanation of the \textit{refinement} step, which involves a prompt-based refinement and a seq2seq model to learn and generalize the refinement process. The whole process ensures optimal integration and fairness in the final output.
%a seq2seq model developed to refine the Fairwords candidate together with a carefully crafted refined prompt, ensuring optimal integration and fairness in the final output.



%\subsection{Overview}
%The inference process of FaIRMaker, as depicted in the bottom block of Figure \ref{fig:main}, involves the automatic generation of tailored instructions \( \boldsymbol{p} \) for user queries \( \boldsymbol{x} \), based on selected triggers (named Fairwords, denoted as \( \boldsymbol{s} \)), which guide the LLM to produce fairer responses. This process can be formalized as \( \boldsymbol{p} = \mathcal{M}(\boldsymbol{s} \oplus \boldsymbol{x}) \), where \( \mathcal{M} \) represents the instruction generator.
%The preceding steps, which belong to the training stage and are illustrated in the upper part of Figure \ref{fig:main}, involve \textit{Fairwords Generation} and \textit{Instruction Generator Training}. 

%In the \textit{Fairwords Generation} process, first, a set of Fairwords is automatically searched using a gender-related preference dataset \( \mathcal{D} \) with an optimization algorithm.
%Based on the debiasing effectiveness of each \( \boldsymbol{s} \), a subset of Fairwords is selected, which forms the Fairwords Bag \( \mathcal{S} \). The filtering process also results in a refined preference dataset, denoted as \( \mathcal{D}_{fair} \), which consists of tuples \( (\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{s}, \boldsymbol{y_g}, \boldsymbol{y_b}) \), where \( \boldsymbol{x} \) represents the query, \( \boldsymbol{s} \) is the selected Fairwords, \( \boldsymbol{y_g} \) is a relatively unbiased ``good'' response, and \( \boldsymbol{y_b} \) is a biased ``bad'' response.

%In the \textit{Refiner Training}, LLMs are employed to analyze the paired responses and the potential meaning of Fairwords. Based on the query and analysis, Fairwords are modified into natural language instructions that can steer the model toward fairer responses. This process generates query-Fairwords-refined Fairwords pairs, expressed as \( \boldsymbol{p} = \text{LLM}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{s}, \boldsymbol{y_g}, \boldsymbol{y_b}) \).
%Later, these pairs are used to train a seq2seq model, which serves as the Fairwords refiner \( \mathcal{M} \) within the FaIRMaker framework.

\subsection{Fairwords Auto-Searching}
Fairwords Auto-Searching comprises two steps: Fairwords optimization and filtering. First, a set of Fairwords, termed Fairwords Bag, is optimized on a preference dataset using prompt optimization techniques. These Fairwords, when appended to gender-relevant queries, guide LLMs in generating high-quality unbiased responses. However, since the optimization is based on auto-regressive loss, the actual effectiveness of these searched Fairwords is not guaranteed. To address this, a filtering process is introduced to evaluate the Fairwords on a held-out test set. Only those Fairwords that demonstrate genuine improving performance are retained for the next step of refinement.
%Initially, it is essential to automatically search for a set of triggers, termed the Fairwords Bag, which, when appended to gender-relevant queries, prompt the LLMs to produce more equitable responses.
%The Fairwords optimized in the previous process are based on the auto-regressive loss, and the actual debiasing effectiveness of these triggers remains uncertain. To evaluate their true performance, we test the Fairwords on a held-out test set, filtering out those that are genuinely effective. 

\partitle{Fairwords optimization} 
Fairwords Optimization can be framed as the search for universal triggers $ s $ given a preference dataset $ \mathcal{D} $. This dataset consists of gender-related queries paired with the chosen response and the rejected response. Given a gender-related query $ x $, the optimization goal is to find $s$ such that appending $s$ to $x$  maximizes the probability of generating the chosen response $ y_c $ while minimizing the probability of generating the rejected response $ y_r $.
Giving the LLM $f_{\theta}$, the process of optimizing the Fairwords $s$ can be formulated as:
\begin{equation*}
    s^* = \min_{s} -\log f_{\theta}(y_c|s \oplus x)+\alpha\log f_{\theta}(y_r|s \oplus x)
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter balancing the trade-off between promoting favorable responses and suppressing unfavorable ones.

%We refer to this strategy of simultaneous optimization as \textit{bi-opt}, while the strategy that only maximizes the probability of the favorable response is termed \textit{dir-opt}. The optimization process can be formulated as minimizing the following loss:
% \begin{align}\label{eq:loss}
% s^*_{\text{dir}} &= \arg\min_{s} \log(y_c \mid x \oplus s) \\
% s^*_{\text{bi}} &= \arg\min_{s} \left[ \log(y_c \mid x \oplus s) - \alpha \log(y_r \mid x \oplus s) \right]
% \end{align}
%The loss can be formally expressed as:
%$\mathcal{L}_{\textit{chosen}} &=-\log P(y_c|s \oplus x)$ and $\mathcal{L}_{\textit{reject}} &=\log P(y_r|s \oplus x)$. 

%In particular, we fine-tuned the \texttt{llama2-7b} model on the Alpaca dataset \cite{taori2023stanford} as the baseline model, which is an instruction-following LLM that may exhibit gender bias. We use the GenderAlign \cite{zhang2024genderalign} as the preference dataset \( \mathcal{D} \), which comprises 8k single-turn dialogues. 
The Fairwords $s$ is initialized with random tokens and iteratively optimized using Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) optimizer \cite{zou2023universal}, which updates a randomly selected token with candidate tokens at each step based on gradient information. The detailed algorithm is relegated to the Appendix \ref{app:algorithm}.

\partitle{Fairwords filtering} 
The Fairwords filtering process evaluates whether the Fairwords identified in the optimization step genuinely reduce gender bias. 
Specifically, we compare the responses to original queries and Fairwords-enhanced queries on a held-out test set. The \texttt{llama3.1-8b-instruct} model serves as a judge, assessing both response quality and bias levels using a predefined evaluation prompt (see Appendix \ref{app:score_prompt}). Fairwords that produce higher-quality responses are deemed effective and added to the Fairwords Bag. We also construct a new preference dataset with Fairwords \( \mathcal{D}_{fair} \) for further refinement in the next stage, where each sample includes a query, a randomly selected Fairwords, a good response (the Fairwords-enhanced one), and a bad response (the original one).


\begin{comment}
\subsection{Instruction Generator Training}
Although the Fairwords we generated and filtered can reduce gender bias, they are nonsensical token combinations lacking interpretability and transferability, as their search requires white-box access and cannot adapt to API-based LLMs. Additionally, directly appending Fairwords to normal queries can negatively impact the model's general performance on tasks unrelated to gender bias.

To ensure \textit{FaIRMaker} to be a model-independent module compatible with both open-source and API-based LLMs while preserving their original performance on normal tasks, we introduce a refinement step. This step first uses ChatGPT to transform the unintelligible Fairwords into human-readable prompts, enhancing their readability and transferability. Then, a seq2seq model is trained to generalize and learn how to dynamically refine the Fariword to mitigate bias and execute normal tasks. In this way, given any query and a Fairwords, our \textit{FaIRMaker} system adaptively generates a refined Fairwords, ensuring robust performance across both bias mitigation and normal task execution without compromising the model's utility.

%To address these limitations, we leverage ChatGPT \cite{achiam2023gpt} to refine the Fairwords into natural language instructions based on the dataset \( \mathcal{D}_{fair} \). 

\partitle{Prompt-based refinement} Specifically, the ChatGPT-supported refinement step processes the samples from the preference dataset with Fairwords \( \mathcal{D}_{fair} \) created during the Fairwords filtering step. It involves a comprehensive analysis comparing the response pairs, the potential meaning and function of the Fairwords, and generating the refined Fairwords. The prompt for the refined Fairwords construction is shown in Appendix \ref{app:refine_prompt}.
After this process, the dataset contains approximately 9k query-Fairwords and refined Fairwords pairs. To ensure the model retains its ability to handle general tasks, we augment the dataset with 9k examples from a normal task dataset \cite{cheng2023black} and apply a similar refinement procedure, resulting in a final dataset of 18k pairs. 
\end{comment}

\subsection{Instruction Generator Training}
Although the filtered Fairwords can prompt better-quality responses, they are nonsensical token combinations lacking interpretability and transferability across black-box LLMs. Additionally, model performance on standard tasks should be maintained.

To ensure \textit{FaIRMaker} to be a model-independent module compatible with both open-source and API-based LLMs while preserving their original performance on normal tasks, we introduce a refinement step.
This step transforms the unintelligible Fairwords into human-readable prompts, performing a reverse inference process on the preference dataset of both tasks with the assistance of ChatGPT. 
Then, a seq2seq model is trained to generalize and learn how to refine the Fariword to mitigate bias and execute normal tasks without the preference dataset. As a result, given any query and Fairwords, \textit{FaIRMaker} adaptively generates refined Fairwords, ensuring robust performance on both bias mitigation and task execution without compromising utility.

\partitle{Prompt-based refinement} 
Note that Fairwords are optimized using a preference dataset, where the difference between the chosen and rejected responses is driven not only by gender bias but also by response quality. As a result, they have the potential to prompt both less biased and higher-quality responses. To ensure that Fairwords refinement is tailored to different query types (i.e., reducing bias for gender-related queries and improving response quality for general tasks), we design a ChatGPT-assisted reverse inference process to create a balanced refined-Fairwords dataset.

Specifically, for bias-reducing data, the reverse inference process applies to the preference dataset with Fairwords \( \mathcal{D}_{fair} \) created during the filtering step. It involves a comprehensive analysis comparing the response pairs, the potential meaning and function of the Fairwords, and refining them accordingly. The prompt for refining Fairwords is shown in Appendix \ref{app:refine_prompt}. After this process, the dataset contains approximately 9k query-Fairwords-refined Fairwords pairs.
For general tasks, we sample 9k examples from a normal task preference dataset \cite{cheng2023black}, enhance the favorable responses with Fairwords, restructure them into the same format as \( \mathcal{D}_{fair} \), and apply a similar refinement process, resulting in a final dataset of 18k pairs.


\partitle{Fairwords refiner} Using this dataset, we train a small seq2seq model, $\mathcal{F}_{refine}$ referred to as the Fairwords Refiner. This model automatically generates refined Fairwords for any query and vanilla Fairwords selected from the Fairwords Bag. The training of the seq2seq model can be generalized as maximizing the probability of generating a refined Fariwords $p$ giving the input query $x$ and Faiwords $s$, where the loss function is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
    % \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^N \log P(\boldsymbol{p|\boldsymbol{s}\oplus\boldsymbol{x}})
    \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{t=1}^N \log \mathcal{F}_{refine}(p|s\oplus x)
\end{equation*}
\textit{FaIRMaker} enhances the fairness of the LLM while preserving the utility on normal tasks, and can adapt to both open-sourced and API-based LLMs with high interpretability and transferability.


\section{Experiments}
We first outline the experimental setup, including models, baselines, evaluation datasets, and metrics. Next, we evaluate \textit{FaIRMaker} on both gender-related and general tasks to demonstrate its bias mitigation effectiveness and utility preservation. We then analyze the efficiency, extendability, and present ablation studies to highlight the contribution of each component.
\subsection{Configurations}
\partitle{Models}
In the \textit{auto-search} step, Fairwords are searched on \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}, a model fine-tuned from \texttt{Llama2-7b} on the Alpaca dataset \cite{taori2023stanford}. 
%In the \textit{auto-search} step, we fine-tuned the \texttt{Llama2-7b} model on the Alpaca \cite{taori2023stanford} dataset to create \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}, which serves as the backbone for auto-searching Fairwords.
This model is intentionally selected for its inherent biases to better identify and optimize Fairwords for bias mitigation.
%Despite its instruction-following capabilities, \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} exhibits notable gender bias due to the absence of further alignment.
In the \textit{refinement} step, a seq2seq model is trained to automatically generate refined Fairwords based on the original Fairwords and query. We use \texttt{Llama3.2-3b-instruct}, a relatively small but capable model for capturing subtle relationships between Fairwords and their refinements.
During inference, \textit{FaIRMaker} operates as an auxiliary module, independent of the downstream LLMs. We evaluate its bias mitigation and utility performance across four open-source LLMs: \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}, \texttt{Llama2-7b-chat} \cite{touvron2023llama}, \texttt{Qwen2-7b-instruct} \cite{yang2024qwen2technicalreport}, and \texttt{Qwen2.5-7b-instruct} \cite{yang2024qwen2}, as well as the API-access LLM, \texttt{GPT-3.5-turbo} \cite{openaiOpenAI}. 

\partitle{Baselines}
We compare \textit{FaIRMaker} with \textit{CF-D} and \textit{Desc-D}, two instruction-based methods that use specific examples introduced in Section \ref{sec:intro}, and ``\textit{Intervention}'' \cite{si2022prompting} that reduces bias via a fixed, plain prompt (See Appendix \ref{app:baseline_prompt}). 
%In addition to in-context learning-based debias methods\textit{CF-D} and \textit{Desc-D} introduced in Section \ref{sec:intro}, we also compare our method to \citealp{si2022prompting}, referred to as ``\textit{Intervention}''.This method provides LLMs with inputs and a carefully designed instruction (see Appendix \ref{app:baseline_prompt}), serving as an intervention during inference. \textit{CF-D} and \textit{Desc-D} are in-context learning-based methods that use specific examples, whereas ``\textit{Intervention}'' reduces bias via a fixed, plain prompt.

\partitle{Dataset}
We use GenderAlign \cite{zhang2024genderalign} as the preference dataset for the Fairwords auto-search and refinement steps, which is an open-ended query task consisting of 8k gender-related single-turn dialogues, each paired with a ``chosen'' and a ``rejected'' response generated by AI assistants. For evaluation, we assess both gender-relevant and general topics.  Gender-relevant tasks include a held-out GenderAlign test set and a multiple-choice bias benchmark, BBQ-gender \cite{parrish2021bbq}. General tasks are open-ended QA tasks including Dolly Eval \cite{conover2023free}, Instruct Eval \cite{wang2022self}, and BPO Eval \cite{cheng2023black}. Detailed descriptions and examples are provided in Appendix \ref{app:dataset}.


\partitle{Evaluation Metrics}
%We involve various evaluation metrics to demonstrate the performance of our method from different aspects. 
To evaluate gender bias mitigation on GA-test, we use win-tie-loss rates. Following prior work \cite{wang2023pandalm,zheng2023judging}, \texttt{GPT4} and \texttt{llama3.1-8b-Instruct} act as a judge to score responses based on a predefined evaluation prompt (see Appendix \ref{app:score_prompt}). We compare the scores of bias-mitigated and original responses, reporting win, tie, and lose proportions. For BBQ-gender, we adopt the \textbf{sDIS} and \textbf{sAMB} metrics to measure the gender bias in disambiguated and ambiguous contexts respectively, which is defined in the original paper. In utility datasets involving open-ended QA tasks, response score (\textbf{RS}) judged by evaluators is used for performance evaluation with a custom prompt (Appendix \ref{app:score_prompt}). We also measure the time cost per query to assess efficiency.


%, and retain \textbf{sDIS} and \textbf{sAMB} metrics from the original paper for BBQ-gender. We employ \texttt{GPT4} and \texttt{llama3.1-8b-Instruct} to score responses using a predefined evaluation prompt, as prior studies show that strong LLMs can effectively serve as judges \cite{wang2023pandalm,zheng2023judging}. 
%We then compare bias-mitigated responses with the originals, recording the proportion of wins, ties, and loses. The sDIS and sAMB represent the degree of gender bias exhibited by the LLM in disambiguated and ambiguous contexts, respectively. 
%For utility datasets, which consist of open-ended QA tasks, we also use the RS to evaluate performance with a designed prompt (see aforementioned prompts in Appendix \ref{app:score_prompt}). 
%Additionally, time cost for processing a single query is measured to assess efficiency.

\subsection{Bias mitigation}
\vspace{-0.3em}
\partitle{Win-tie-loss on GA-test}
%We first demonstrate the bias mitigation \textit{FaIRMaker} can achieve across different models on GA-test. 
Figure \ref{fig:ga_gpt4} presents the win-tie-loss rates for bias degree comparison between the original model responses and responses after applying \textit{FaIRMaker}, evaluated with GPT4 as the judge (results evaluated by Llama3.1 are in Appendix \ref{app:results}). 
\textit{FaIRMaker} achieves a consistently higher win rate than loss rate across all LLMs, indicating improved responses after applying \textit{FaIRMaker}. %are consistently better than the originals. 
Notably, \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} achieves a 55.61\% win rate, signifying that more than half of the responses are improved. 
Interestingly, better-aligned LLMs, such as \texttt{Qwen2.5} and \texttt{GPT3.5}, exhibit a lower win rate but a higher tie rate, likely due to their inherently lower gender bias, resulting in higher-quality original responses.

\partitle{Results on BBQ-gender}
BBQ-gender tests gender bias using multiple-choice questions in ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. In disambiguated contexts, the ideal LLM should choose the correct answer, while in ambiguous contexts, it should select ``unknown''. The sDIS and sAMB indicate bias level with lower scores reflecting less bias. Table \ref{tab:bbq} reports results for four open-sourced LLMs, as metrics computation requires logit access.
\textit{FaIRMaker} achieves the best bias mitigation across all models, reducing bias by at least half. Furthermore, unlike other methods that sometimes increase bias, typically occurs in disambiguated contexts due to the shift in LLMs' attention from content to gender-related information, \textit{FaIRMaker} avoid such behavior. 
%This increase typically occurs in disambiguated contexts, which can be attributed to the shift in LLMs' attention from content to gender-related information caused by the prefixes offered by these methods. 
Notably, the bias in ambiguous contexts is consistently lower than in disambiguated ones, suggesting that LLMs are more cautious when the information is insufficient.

\subsection{Utility Maintaining}
In this section, we evaluate the utility of \textit{FaIRMaker}-enhanced models by assessing the quality of responses across various tasks. We measure response scores on the GA-test to demonstrate dialogue generation capability, and on Dolly Eval, Instruct Eval, and BPO Eval to assess instruction-following performance.

\end{table}

\partitle{Dialogue Generation} Table \ref{tab:rs_ga} presents the average RS achieved by each LLM, with the highest scores highlighted in bold, evaluated by GPT4 (see Appendix \ref{app:results} for Llama3.1 evaluation).
\textit{FaIRMaker} consistently improves the RS across all LLMs under both evaluators and outperforms baseline methods. The most significant improvement is observed on \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}, with a gain of 0.5 points.
An example is provided in Figure \ref{fig:examples}, where \textit{FaIRMaker} prompts the model to generate an unbiased response.
Among the original responses (column Ori.), \texttt{GPT3.5} achieves the highest score. Notably, after applying \textit{FaIRMaker}, all other LLMs except \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca}, which initially underperformed compared to \texttt{GPT3.5}, surpass its original performance. This demonstrates the capability of \textit{FaIRMaker} to preserve dialogue generation performance while enhancing response quality.
\textit{Intervention} also improves response quality to some extent, while \textit{CF-D} and \textit{Desc-D} often lead to a decline in RS (noted in red arrows), likely due to the added examples that may confuse the original query.

\end{table*}

\partitle{Instruction Following}
As shown in Table \ref{tab:utility}, \textit{FaIRMaker} generally improves or maintains the original performance, with any decrease within 0.05 points, indicating minimal impact on LLMs' utility.
Larger improvements are observed in LLMs with lower initial performance. For example, \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} gains over 1 point on Dolly Eval, and \texttt{Llama2-Chat} improves by 0.7 points on BPO Eval in GPT4 score. 
Figure \ref{fig:examples} provides an example on Dolly, where \textit{FaIRMaker} helps prevent the model from hallucinating unrelated information.
In contrast, LLMs with better utility experience slight declines on Dolly Eval and Instruct Eval, due to the task-specific requirements such as particular formatting or duplication detection. 
%Most tasks in these evaluations provide detailed requirements, such as particular formatting or the detection of duplicates, and 
\textit{FaIRMaker} sometimes introduces additional intermediate guiding instructions, which makes the output more verbose and affects scores.  
By incorporating more task-specific guidance based on the input type, \textit{FaIRMaker} could further minimize the impact on general tasks.
% Additionally, GPT4 appears to be a stricter judge, giving lower and more varied scores than Llama3.1, which may reflect the inherent bias of these evaluators.

\subsection{Efficiency}
Timely inference is crucial for real-world applications. In this section, we evaluate \textit{FaIRMaker}'s processing time during inference. All experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU with 40GB of memory, with the processing time measured from query reception to the generation of refined Fairwords.
Figure \ref{fig:refine} illustrates the relationship between the number of input query tokens and the \textit{FaIRMaker} processing time across different datasets, which is typically around 1.5 seconds, with only a few exceptions. This trend is consistent across datasets, with a slight increase in \textit{FaIRMaker} processing time as the input length grows. Even with 300 input tokens, the processing time remains under 1.7 seconds.

\partitle{Total inference time} Since \textit{FaIRMaker} modifies input queries, the number of tokens processed by models will change, affecting the total inference time.
Table \ref{tab:total_time} presents the combined inference time, including both the \textit{FaIRMaker} process and LLM processing. In most cases, \textit{FaIRMaker} adds 3-6 seconds, increasing the total processing time by around 50\%, which remains acceptable. Interestingly, for \texttt{Qwen2.5-Instruct}, \textit{FaIRMaker} reduces the inference time by an average of 0.54 seconds. This improvement is attributed to \textit{FaIRMaker}'s ability to generate instructions like ``\textit{Provide a clear, accurate, and concise answer}'', prompting the model to produce more focused and efficient responses.

\subsection{Extendability}
\textit{FaIRMaker} operates as an independent module during inference, allowing its integration with bias mitigation approaches like DPO on bias-free datasets. This section compares the performance of \textit{FaIRMaker} and DPO, and explores their potential combined effectiveness.

\partitle{\textit{FaIRMaker} v.s. DPO} We fine-tune the \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} model on the GenderAlign (GA) dataset using DPO \cite{zhang2024genderalign}. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:dpo}, DPO-based method demonstrates better performance on in-distribution data (GA-test) and struggles on out-of-distribution generalization, performing worse on BBQ-gender compared to \textit{FaIRMaker}. 
Additionally, the fine-tuning negatively affects its performance on standard tasks.

\partitle{Combining DPO with \textit{FaIRMaker}}
We then apply \textit{FaIRMaker} to the DPO fine-tuned model, with results shown by the red lines in Figure \ref{fig:dpo}. The combination of \textit{FaIRMaker} further enhances bias mitigation effectiveness on both GA-test and BBQ-gender, while also eliminating the negative impact of DPO on general tasks. These trends highlight the flexibility and extendability of \textit{FaIRMaker}, broadening its potential for real-world applications.


\subsection{Ablation Study}
In this section, we evaluate the contributions of each \textit{FaIRMaker} module through ablation studies. We define two variants: (1) \textit{w/o filtering}, where all Fairwords and responses are used without filtering in auto-search, and (2) \textit{w/o refinement}, where Fairwords from the Fairwords Bag are directly appended to queries without refinement. We evaluate these ablations on \texttt{Llama2-Alpaca} for bias mitigation and general tasks.  Table \ref{tab:ablation} presents the results, with the best scores highlighted in bold.

\noindent\textbf{Role of Filtering:} The filtering step in the auto-search ensures that only Fairwords with genuine debiasing effects move to the next stage. \textit{FaIRMaker w/o filtering} shows reduced bias mitigation and inconsistent performance on general tasks. Without filtering, noisy gender-related data disrupts the refiner’s training, impairing feature extraction and weakening bias mitigation effectiveness. \textbf{Role of refinement:} The refinement step converts Fairwords into natural language instructions, enhancing \textit{FaIRMaker}'s generalization and transferability to black-box models. \textit{FaIRMaker w/o refinement} exhibits significantly lower performance, indicating its limitations in generalization. %Figure \ref{fig:fw} demonstrates that removing refinement lowers the GA-test RS of other LLMs, showing limited transferability. Additionally, training a seq2seq model on the refined Fairwords dataset, which combines gender-relevant queries with general tasks, is crucial for preserving LLM utility.

\subsection{Interpretation}
The vanilla Fairwords optimized in the auto-search step are nonsensical token combinations generated to maximize favorable responses and minimize unfavorable ones. The mechanism by which they act as debiasing triggers or enhance some tasks is unclear. To explore this, we have ChatGPT analyze their potential meanings and emotions, with examples shown in Table \ref{tab:fw_examples}. Surprisingly, the Fairwords often express emotions like urgency and seriousness, potentially guiding the LLM toward unbiased responses, while preserving the original input intent due to their lack of specific meanings.

\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.3em}
In this work, we introduce \textit{FaIRMaker}, an automated and model-independent framework that uses a novel \textbf{auto-search and refinement} paradigm to generate Fairwords for gender bias mitigation. \textit{FaIRMaker} effectively mitigates gender bias while preserving task integrity across diverse downstream tasks for both API-based and open-source LLMs, without modifying the models. 
We also analyze the efficiency and extendability of \textit{FaIRMaker}, while highlighting the importance of its key components.
Future work includes expanding the scope of biases and further minimizing impacts on general tasks through fine-grid refinement.

\newpage
\section*{Limitations}
Despite \textit{FaIRMaker}'s effectiveness in mitigating gender bias and preserving normal task performance, we identify several limitations that require further improvement.

\partitle{Scale of Tasks and Training Data}
Although \textit{FaIRMaker} performs well in gender bias mitigation and task integrity, the scope of tasks and training data is limited. For instance, the preference dataset used for auto-searching Fairwords lacks sufficient diversity. Additionally, the refiner was trained on 18k pairs of refined Fairwords from ChatGPT feedback, covering a narrow range of scenarios. This limitation in task and dataset scale may explain the slight decrease in performance on general tasks, which is an area for future improvement.

\partitle{Bias in Evaluators}
\textit{FaIRMaker} operates without human involvement, relying on state-of-the-art LLMs for response evaluation. While we replicate experiments to confirm findings, evaluators can still introduce inherent biases, as evidenced by the differing score distributions from GPT-4 and Llama3.1. Future work will involve incorporating more evaluators and aggregation methods to provide a more comprehensive assessment.

\partitle{Fairwords Selection Strategy}
Fairwords are randomly selected from the bag during inference, sometimes resulting in intermediate guiding instructions that make the output more verbose and slightly affect general task scores. By incorporating more task-specific guidance based on input types and implementing fine-grid refinement, \textit{FaIRMaker} could further minimize the impact on general tasks.


\section*{Ethics Statements}
In this work, we utilize publicly available datasets for training and evaluating \textit{FaIRMaker}, including GenderAlign \cite{zhang2024genderalign}, Self-Instruct \cite{wang2022self}, and BPO Eval \cite{cheng2023black} (under Apache License), as well as BBQ \cite{parrish2021bbq}, Alpaca \cite{taori2023stanford}, and Free Dolly \cite{conover2023free} (under Creative Commons License). Some of these datasets contain content that may be offensive or distressing. We assert that these data are solely used for the purpose of mitigating gender bias and improving model performance. Additionally, this paper focuses solely on binary gender bias and leaves exploration of other gender definitions to the broader research community.

\section{Auto-search Algorithm}
\label{app:algorithm}
The goal of the auto-search step is to find the optimal set of Fairwords, denoted as \( s = \{t_i\}_{i=1}^{l} \), where \( l \) is the predetermined length of the sequence. Given a gender-related query \( x \) and the target LLM \( f_{\theta} \), the optimization process aims to maximize the probability of generating the chosen response \( y_c \), while minimizing the probability of generating the rejected response \( y_r \). This can be formulated as minimizing the following loss function:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:loss}
    \mathcal{L}(s) = - \log f_{\theta}(y_c| s \oplus x) + \alpha \log f_{\theta}(y_r| s \oplus x)
\end{equation*}

Here, the Fairwords \( s \) are initialized with random tokens. In each optimization round, we sequentially examine each token in the Fairwords and select candidates for potential replacements at each position.

To replace the \( i \)-th token \( t_i \) in the sequence \( s \), we use a first-order Taylor expansion around the current embedding of the Fairwords, allowing us to compute a linearized approximation of the loss for substituting \( t_i \) with a new token \( t'_i \). Specifically, we first compute the gradient of the loss with respect to the embedding \( \mathbf{e}_{t_i} \) of the token \( t_i \):
\begin{equation*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{t_i}} \mathcal{L}(s)
\end{equation*}

Next, for each token \( t'_i \) in the vocabulary \( \mathcal{V} \), we calculate the loss approximation and select the top-\textit{b} candidates based on the inner product between the gradient \( \nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{t_i}} \mathcal{L}(s) \) and the difference \( (\mathbf{e}_{t'_i} - \mathbf{e}_{t_i}) \), which measures the effect of replacing \( t_i \) with \( t'_i \). The candidate set for position \( i \) is then defined as:

\begin{equation*}
\{t_i\} \gets \mathop{\textit{top-b}}\limits_{t'_i \in \mathcal{V}} \left\{ \left[ (\mathbf{e}_{t'_i} - \mathbf{e}_{t_i}) \right]^T \nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{t_i}} \mathcal{L}(s) \right\}
\end{equation*}

This process is repeated for every position in the Fairwords, resulting in \( b \times l \) potential substitutions. From these, we randomly sample \( k \) Fairwords as candidates, denoted as \( \mathcal{K} = \{s'\} \), and compute the exact loss for each candidate using Equation \ref{eq:loss}. The token replacement that minimizes the loss is chosen as the final replacement.

The entire auto-search procedure is outlined in the pseudo-code provided in Algorithm \ref{alg:suat}.
In our experiment, we set the length of the Fairwords \( l \) to 20, the batch size \( m \) to 25, the number of top-weight candidates \( b \) to 256, and the sampling size \( k \) to 512. All searches are performed on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU, with the optimization process taking around 24 hours to complete 300 steps.

\section{Dataset Examples}
\label{app:dataset}
We use both gender-relevant and general tasks for a comprehensive assessment. The GA-test and BBQ-gender are used for gender-relevant tasks, while Dolly Eval, Instruct Eval, and BPO Eval are used for general tasks. Detailed descriptions of these datasets are provided below:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt, itemsep=2pt, parsep=0pt, partopsep=0pt, topsep=0pt] 
    \item GA-test is a subset of GenderAlign, consisting of 400 samples that are distinct from those used during training.
    \item BBQ-gender consists of gender identity queries from the standard multiple-choice bias benchmark BBQ \cite{parrish2021bbq}. Each BBQ question has an ambiguous and disambiguated version, with the latter adding context to enable the correct answer, allowing BBQ to assess LLMs' gender bias in different contexts.
    \item Dolly Eval samples 200 human-generated instructions across various task categories from dolly dataset \cite{conover2023free}.
    \item Instruct Eval \cite{wang2022self} consists of 252 expert-written tasks and instructions designed to assess the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in user-oriented applications.
    \item BPO Eval, created by \citet{cheng2023black}, consists of 200 queries sampled from four open-source prompt datasets: OASST1, HH-RLHF, Chatbot Arena, and Alpaca-GPT4.
\end{itemize}
Examples from the datasets are shown in Table \ref{tab:data_examples}.

\subsection{Interpretability}
We present the emotions expressed in Fairwords and the most common words generated by \textit{FaIRMaker} in the form of a word cloud, shown in Figure \ref{fig:wordcloud}. The Fairwords exhibit emotions like urgency, frustration, and seriousness. The most common words generated by \textit{FaIRMaker} vary across datasets. For open-ended QA tasks, words like "balanced" and "stereotypes" appear in the gender-related GA-test dataset, while terms like "detailed" and "clear" are more frequent in general tasks such as Dolly. For the multi-choice dataset BBQ-gender, the generated instructions emphasize analysis. This diversity highlights the flexibility of \textit{FaIRMaker}.

\label{app:baseline_prompt}
The prompts used by the baseline methods are shown below:

\partitle{\textit{Intervention}} We should treat people from different socioeconomic statuses, sexual orientations, religions, races, physical appearances, nationalities, gender identities, disabilities, and ages equally. When we do not have sufficient information, we should choose the unknown option, rather than making assumptions based on our stereotypes.

\partitle{\textit{CF-D}} Despite being a male, Austin became a dental hygienist.

\partitle{\textit{Desc-D}} Dental hygienists focus on promoting oral health and hygiene.
\subsection{Evaluation Prompt}
\label{app:score_prompt}
We use \texttt{Llama3.1-8b-instruct} and \texttt{gpt-4} as evaluators for assessing AI responses. The prompts used to evaluate responses to general task queries and gender-related queries are shown in Figure \ref{fig:general_eval_prompt} and Figure \ref{fig:gender_eval_prompt}, respectively.

\subsection{Refined Fairwords Construction Prompt}
\label{app:refine_prompt}
ChatGPT is employed in the refinement step to give a comprehensive analysis comparing the response pairs, the potential meaning and function of the Fairwords, and generate the refined Fairwords. The prompt for the refined Fairwords construction is shown in Figure \ref{fig:refine_prompt}.

You are a helpful assistant responsible for judging the quality of the AI response. You will receive a query and a response from an AI assistant. Please consider the following criteria and provide a score for the answer on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being the highest.\\
Criteria:\\
1. The response should be related to the query and provide as much helpful information as possible.\\
2. The response should not contain any content related to gender bias. Additionally, if the question includes gender-biased content, the response should address and point it out.\\
3. Please distinguish between inherent gender differences and gender bias, and avoid overcorrection. For instance, stating that the average lifespan of men is shorter than that of women is a statistical fact, not an example of gender bias.\\
4. Please consider the comprehensiveness, impartiality, helpfulness, and conciseness of the response.\\
Note that only one number should be provided, without any explanation.

Original query: "\{\textit{query}\}"

bad response: "\{\textit{bad response}\}"

Modified query: "[\{\textit{Fairwords}\}] \{\textit{query}\}"

good response:"\{\textit{good response}\}"

Above is a single-round conversation between a Human and an AI Assistant:
Original Query: The initial query from the human.
Bad Response: The assistant's response to the original query, which is unsatisfactory.
Modified Query: The original query with an added prefix (in square brackets) to guide the assistant toward a better response.
Good Response: The assistant's response to the modified query, which is better than the bad response.

Your Goal:
Compare the good response and bad response based on the following aspects:
1. Fairness: Does the response avoid gender bias, stereotypes, or other unfair assumptions?\\
2. Helpfulness: Is the response more insightful, creative, coherent, or useful?\\
3. Harmlessness: Does the response avoid harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content?\\

Then, as an expert prompt engineer, refine the prefix to further improve the assistant's responses. The optimized prefix should help the assistant consistently produce better responses (like the "good response") while adhering to these guidelines:\\
1. Do not modify the original query; only adjust the prefix.\\
2. Avoid adding overly specific constraints unrelated to the query.\\
3. Keep the prefix concise (no longer than 30 tokens).\\
4. Focus solely on improving the prefix, not generating responses.\\
5. Aim to improve the assistant's responses beyond the example "good response" when possible.\\
6. Minimize unnecessary changes to the prefix.\\

Remember to be brief and clear.
Please output with the following format:\\
Detailed Comparison Result: xxx\\
Prefix's Potential Meaning: xxx\\
Optimized Prefix: xxx
