abstract = {We develop conformal prediction methods for constructing valid predictive confidence sets in multiclass and multilabel problems without assumptions on the data generating distribution. A challenge here is that typical conformal prediction methods--which give marginal validity (coverage) guarantees--provide uneven coverage, in that they address easy examples at the expense of essentially ignoring difficult examples. By leveraging ideas from quantile regression, we build methods that always guarantee correct coverage but additionally provide (asymptotically consistent) conditional coverage for both multiclass and multilabel prediction problems. To address the potential challenge of exponentially large confidence sets in multilabel prediction, we build tree-structured classifiers that efficiently account for interactions between labels. Our methods can be bolted on top of any classification model--neural network, random forest, boosted tree--to guarantee its validity. We also provide an empirical evaluation, simultaneously providing new validation methods, that suggests the more robust coverage of our confidence sets.},

abstract = {Confidence calibration - the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood - is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling - a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling - is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

The three most common and typical types of references used in
IEEE publications:

an article in a journal
Note the use of the IEEE_J_EDL string, defined in the IEEEabrv.bib file,
for the journal name. IEEEtran.bst defines the BibTeX standard three
letter month codes per IEEE style.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices",
page 996, reference #16.
@article{IEEEexample:article_typical,
  author        = "S. Zhang and C. Zhu and J. K. O. Sin and P. K. T. Mok",

journal article using et al.
The (five) authors are actually: F. Delorme, S. Slempkes, G. Alibert, 
B. Rose, J. Brandon
The month (July) was not given here.
From the September 1998 issue of "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in
Communications", page 1257, reference #28.

}


a paper in a conference proceedings
"conference" can be used as an alias for "inproceedings"
From the June 2002 issue of "Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems",
page 205, reference #16.
@inproceedings{IEEEexample:conf_typical,

Other examples

journal article with large page numbers, IEEE will divide numbers 5 digits
or longer into groups of three with small spaces between them. Page ranges
can be separated via either "-" or "--", IEEEtran.bst will automatically
convert the separator dash(es) to "--".
Authors and/or IEEE do not always provide/use the journal number, but it
was used in this case. IEEEtran.bst can be configured to ignore journal
numbers if desired.

journal article to be published as a misc entry type
date information like month and year is optional 
However, the article form like that below may be a better approach.
From the May 2002 issue of "IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in 
Communication", page 725, reference #3.
@misc{IEEEexample:TBPmisc,

}


journal article to be published as an article entry type
year is required, so if absent, use the year field to hold
the "submitted for publication" in order to avoid a warning for
the missing year field.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #21.

  publisher     = "{IEEE} Press.",
  address       = "New York",
  year          = "1992"
}


book with edition, author and editor
Note that the standard BibTeX styles do not support book entries with both
author and editor fields, but IEEEtran.bst does.
The standard BibTeX way of specifying the edition is to use capitalized
ordinal words such as "First", "Second", etc. Most .bst files can convert
up to about "Fifth" into the format needed. IEEEtran.bst can convert up
to "Tenth" to the "Arabic ordinal" form IEEE uses (e.g., "10th"). For
editions over the tenth, it is best to use the "Arabic ordinal" form for
IEEE related work (e.g., "101st")
Note how "Jr." has to be entered.

U.S. patent
Use the type field to override the patent type. e.g.,
type = "Patent Application"
The address is that of the assignee. Note that IEEE does not
display the assignee, the address, and only displays one date.
(if year is not present, the filed dates are used.) However, this
information should be entered as other BibTeX styles may use it.
alternatively, nationality could be entered as "U.S."

French Patent request, the language field must be entered in lower case

capitalized. Because this is a patent request, the date filed fields are
used while the date fields are left empty/missing. In other countries,
the words "Patent Application", etc. are used instead.

It would also be nice to add a URL to these types of things.
RFCs can also be handled as electronic references.

page 181, reference #14.
@misc{IEEEexample:miscrfc,

}


a software package as an electronic reference
From the February 2003 issue of  "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking",
page 46, reference #24. If there is no author or organization, a sorting
key is required for sorting styles. It might be a good idea to include
month and year fields as well.

Ways to handle things like CCSDS's Blue Books
journal article with a URL. However, this is not a very good approach
because the Blue Books are not really journals and the author field has
to be abused.
From the June 2002 issue of "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",
page 1461, reference #7.
@article{IEEEexample:bluebookarticle,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  journal       = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a book
However, it is not a good idea to have to use the author field for
an organization (done here because the book entry type requires an
author field).
@book{IEEEexample:bluebookbook,
  author        = "{Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)}",
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  series        = "Blue Book",
  number        = "4",
  publisher     = "{CCSDS}",
  address       = "Newport Beach, {CA}",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}


CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a manual
This is a much better approach, but uses the howpublished field.
@manual{IEEEexample:bluebookmanual,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}



CCSDS's Blue Book handled as a standard
Probably the best approach for this particular case because the work
is standard related. Note that IEEE does not display the address for
standards.
@standard{IEEEexample:bluebookstandard,
  title         = "Telemetry Channel Coding",
  howpublished  = "ser. Blue Book, No. 4",
  organization  = "Consulative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)",
  address       = "Newport Beach, CA",
  type          = "Recommendation for Space Data System Standard",
  number        = "101.0-B-4",
  month         = May,
  year          = "1999",
  url           = "http://www.ccsds.org/documents/pdf/CCSDS-101.0-B-4.pdf"
}








An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
