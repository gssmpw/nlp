\section{Ethical Considerations}
We took several steps to ensure that our data collection was ethical and legal. We set the hourly rate of compensation for workers at \$20.
To ensure the safety and well-being of our workers, we maintained open communication channels, allowing them to voice any question, concerns, or feedback about the data annotation.
This also helped to improve the quality of the collected data as we promptly addressed issues reported by workers throughout the process.
