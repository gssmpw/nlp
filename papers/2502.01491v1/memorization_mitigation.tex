\section{Adaptive-SeqKD reduces memorization}
\label{sec:Adaptive-SeqKD}
We previously observed increased memorization and hallucinations in $\theta_S$ compared to $\theta_B$, but also amplified denoising on data subsets.
We now investigate whether we can reduce students' failures without harming performance otherwise. 
We apply \textbf{Adaptive-SeqKD}, which briefly fine-tunes the teacher on high-quality data before producing $\mathcal{T}_T$. Instead of costly external metrics like Comet-QE, we use intrinsic metrics for data quality by selecting 500k sequences where $\theta_T$ nearly memorized the target (\texttt{chrF}>90), $\theta_T$ is confident (normalized translation score > 0.9), and source lengths exceed 5 tokens.
We fine-tuned $\theta_T$ per language pair for 200 steps and compared it to fine-tuning on a random 500k sample meeting the length requirement.

Table~\ref{tab:Adaptive-SeqKD} shows that teachers finetuned on the high-quality data (and their students) perform similar in terms of BLEU and Comet-QE, but much better in terms of ExMem and OscHal.
Finetuning on random data reduced ExMem but not hallucinations.
We include additional metrics in \appendixshortcut~\ref{ap:Adaptive-SeqKD}.
