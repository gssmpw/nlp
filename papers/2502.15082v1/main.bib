    abstract = "The factual knowledge acquired during pre-training and stored in the parameters of Language Models (LMs) can be useful in downstream tasks (e.g., question answering or textual inference). However, some facts can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. We present KnowledgeEditor, a method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix {\textquoteleft}bugs' or unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning). In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show KnowledgeEditor`s efficacy with two popular architectures and knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method, changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated) paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded as a {\textquoteleft}probe' revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated on a small subset of components.

The CCPA came into effect on January 1, 2020, and gives California residents the right to:/p ul liLearn what personal data a business has collected about them/li liUnderstand who this data has been disclosed to/li liFind out whether their personal data has been sold to third parties, and who these third parties are/li liOpt out of such data transactions, or request that the data be deleted./li /ul pMany organizations that do business in the state of California must align to the provisions of the CCPA. Much like the EU's GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), businesses that fail to comply with the CCPA will face economic penalties./p pAchieve CCPA compliance with our implementation guide that:/p ul liProvides the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the legislation by explaining key terms/li liExplains how a business can implement strategies to comply with the CCPA/li liDiscusses potential developments of the CCPA to further aid compliance/li /ul pYour guide to understanding the CCPA and how you can implement a strategy to comply with this legislation - buy this book today to get the guidance you need!/p p strongAbout the author/strong /p p Preston Bukaty is an attorney and consultant. He specializes in data privacy GRC projects, from data inventory audits to gap analyses, contract management, and remediation planning. His compliance background and experience operationalizing compliance in a variety of industries give him a strong understanding of the legal issues presented by international regulatory frameworks. Having conducted more than 3,000 data mapping audits, he also understands the practical realities of project management in operationalizing compliance initiatives. /p p Preston's legal experience and enthusiasm for technology make him uniquely suited to understanding the business impact of privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) and the California Consumer Privacy Act ( CCPA ) . He has advised more than 250 organizations engaged in businesses as varied as SaaS platforms, mobile geolocation applications, GNSS/telematics tools, financial institutions, fleet management software, architectural/engineering design systems, and web hosting. He also teaches certification courses on GDPR compliance and ISO 27001 implementation, and writes on data privacy law topics. /p p Preston lives in Denver, Colorado. Prior to working as a data privacy consultant, he worked for an international GPS software company, advising business areas on compliance issues across 140 countries.
