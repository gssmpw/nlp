\subsection{Lower Bounds for Approximate-DP Algorithms}

The following lower bound shows that our approach is nearly optimal, up to polylogarithmic factors in $n,1/\delta$, and $\log |\cX|$. Note that the lower bounds we provide are for the expected additive accuracy of relatively accurate algorithms (more details in \Cref{def:expected_sample_accuracy}). These lower bounds apply to our algorithms, given that we provide high probability upper bounds for them, and via tail integration they enjoy in-expectation guarantees. Finally,
note that relative approximations are only nontrivial (compared to purely additive ones) when $\zeta\geq \alpha/n$. The proof of this result is deferred to \Cref{sec:pf_approx_DP_LB}.
\begin{theorem}  \label{thm:approx_DP_LB}
Let ${\cX}$ be a finite set and $k\in \N$, such that  
$|{\cX}| = \omega(\log k)$ and $k = \omega(\log|{\cX}|)$. 
Let $\frac{1}{|\cX|}\leq \delta<\frac{1}{\log|\cX|\log k}$. 
Let $\frac{2^{-\ln^{1/9}|{\cX}|}}{10}\leq  \frac{\alpha}{n} \leq \zeta<\frac{1}{10}$. Then there exists $\cF\subseteq\{0,1\}^{\cX}$ with $|\cF|=k$, such that if
${\cal A}:{\cX}^n\mapsto\R_+^{\cF}$ is an $(\eps,\delta)$-DP query-answering algorithm that is $(\zeta,\alpha,\cF)$-sample-accurate in expectation, then
\begin{align} 
n = \Omega\Big(\frac{\ln|{\cF}|\sqrt{\ln|{\cX}| \ln(1/\delta)}}{\eps \zeta^2}\Big) \quad \mbox{ and }\quad  
\alpha = \Omega\Big(\frac{\ln|{\cF}|\sqrt{\ln|{\cX}| \ln(1/\delta)}}{\eps \zeta}\Big). \label{eqn:LB_approx_DP}
\end{align}
In the case $\delta=0$, the corresponding lower bounds are
\[ n = \Omega\Big( \frac{\log|{\cF}| \log|\cX|}{\eps \zeta^2} \Big) \quad\mbox{ and }\quad  \alpha = \Omega\Big( \frac{\log|{\cF}| \log|\cX|}{\eps \zeta} \Big). \]
\end{theorem}



Note that the pure-DP lower bound does not prove near-optimality of our upper bounds, yet it shows a polylog dependence on $|{\cF}|$, $|\cX|$, and an inverse polynomial dependence on $\eps,\zeta$. Further understanding on the optimal rates with respect to $n$ is an interesting question for future work, which seems related to current barriers arising in the purely additive case \citep{DPorg-open-problem-optimal-query-release}.
