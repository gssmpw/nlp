\subsection{Self-supervised monocular depth estimation}
\label{sec:rel_selsupmono}
Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation (SSMDE) is a task that estimates a depth map from a single image without a ground truth depth map.
This approach significantly simplifies the process of data acquisition, making it scalable for a wide variety of datasets.

% However, minimizing photometric consistency loss under certain conditions (e.g. dynamic scene modeling, occlusion, non-Lambertian object) may cause the incorrect depth.

\subsection{Generalization of monocular depth estimation}
\label{sec:rel_genmono}
Recent research has expanded to consider factors such as the impact of weather variations__, "Weather-Varying Monocular Depth Estimation"__ the differences in inference capabilities between CNNs and Transformers__, "On the Transferability of Transformer-based Monocular Depth Estimation Models"__ the robustness of SSMDEs against various types of data corruption__, "Robust Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation under Data Corruption"__ and methods for accurately modeling transparent and mirrored surfaces, which are typically non-Lambertian____.
In addition, the 3D Distillation__, "3D Distillation: Robust Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation on Non-Lambertian Surfaces"__ addresses a critical flaw in traditional SSMDEs: the photometric constancy principle used in applying photometric consistency loss may not hold for non-Lambertian surfaces encountered in real-world scenarios, resulting in SSMDE models producing unreliable and low-quality depth estimates for reflective surfaces.
To counter this problem, 3D Distillation leverages the 3D mesh rendering function along with ensemble uncertainty to localize the reflective surfaces and refine the inaccurate depth on these regions.
% To counter this problem, 3D Distillation estimates aggregated depth maps from meshes reconstructed from multiple views and employs uncertainty measures across different trained models to generate pseudo-labels.
% These labels are then distilled to refine the handling of reflective surfaces.
% However, it requires a larger volume of observations for mesh reconstruction compared to standard SSMDE training methods. Additionally, accurately addressing the uncertainties inherent in the diverse network architectures is crucial for effectively generating robust pseudo-labels for reflective surfaces.

\subsection{Deep metric learning}
\label{sec:rel_deep_metric}
Deep metric learning__, "Deep Metric Learning with Online Triplets"__ seeks to develop an effective distance measure between data points.
These methods strive to minimize the distance between samples of the same class while maximizing it between samples from different classes.
While traditionally focused on classification tasks, where positive and negative pairs are defined based on class similarity, recent studies__, "Deep Metric Learning for Image Classification with Limited Label Information"__ have expanded the application of deep metric learning to regression contexts.
% These studies vary in approach; some directly use target distances to contrast samples____, while others incorporate representation learning within a semi-supervised framework____.
% These methods often applied in recognition tasks amenable to augmentation, have proven effective and reliable.
Particularly in the context of depth estimation, deep metric learning has demonstrated versatility beyond simple augmentation-based consistency.
It has been applied to enhance accuracy through contrasting depth distributions__, "Deep Metric Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation"__ and addressing issues such as edge fattening____.
In this paper, we utilize the triplet mining scheme, initially popularized by Chopra et al., "Learning a similarity metric manually"
