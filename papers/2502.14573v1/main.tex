\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Self-supervised monocular depth estimation (SSMDE) aims to predict the dense depth map of a monocular image, by learning depth from RGB image sequences, eliminating the need for ground-truth depth labels.
Although this approach simplifies data acquisition compared to supervised methods, it struggles with reflective surfaces, as they violate the assumptions of Lambertian reflectance, leading to inaccurate training on such surfaces.
To tackle this problem, we propose a novel training strategy for an SSMDE by leveraging triplet mining to pinpoint reflective regions at the pixel level, guided by the camera geometry between different viewpoints.
The proposed reflection-aware triplet mining loss specifically penalizes the inappropriate photometric error minimization on the localized reflective regions while preserving depth accuracy in non-reflective areas.
We also incorporate a reflection-aware knowledge distillation method that enables a student model to selectively learn the pixel-level knowledge from reflective and non-reflective regions. This results in robust depth estimation across areas.
Evaluation results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method effectively enhances depth quality on reflective surfaces and outperforms state-of-the-art SSMDE baselines.
% It also incorporates our reflective-aware knowledge distillation method that enables a student model to achieve improvements in both areas simultaneously.

%\section{Limitation}
\section{Conclusion}
This paper addresses the intricate challenge of self-supervised monocular depth estimation on reflective surfaces.
Our method employs a novel metric learning approach, centered around a reflection-aware triplet mining loss. 
This novel loss function significantly improves depth prediction accuracy by accurately identifying reflective regions on a per-pixel basis and effectively adjusting the minimization of photometric errors, which are typically problematic on reflective surfaces. 
It also preserves high-frequency details on non-reflective surfaces by selectively regulating photometric error minimization based on reflection region selection.
Moreover, we introduce a reflection-aware knowledge distillation method, enabling a student model to enhance performance in both reflective and non-reflective surfaces.
This method leverages the strengths of different teaching networks to produce a more robust and versatile student model.
Experimental evaluations conducted on the indoor scene datasets demonstrate our method consistently enhances depth performance across various architectural frameworks.
These results underscore the robustness and versatility of our approach, marking it as a valuable contribution to the field of self-supervised monocular depth estimation.
% This is the pioneering work of an end-to-end SSMDE training strategy that can significantly enhance the depth performances of reflective surfaces while preserving the high-frequency details on non-reflective surfaces.
