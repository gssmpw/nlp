\section{Case Study on Defense Failure}
To enhance the robustness and trustworthiness of LLMs, we conduct a case study on common defense failures across our five fraud categories. Specifically, we analyze failure cases in \texttt{GPT-4o}’s responses as our primary study objects. Our focus is on the \textit{Role-play} task, where models exhibit significantly lower relative Defense Success Rate(DSR) compared to the \textit{Helpful Assistant} task, highlighting a critical vulnerability in fraud and phishing defense.

\subsection{Fake Job Posting}
One detailed two-round defense failure sample of Fake Job Posting is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Denfense Failure Sample on GPT-4o - Fake Job Posting}. \texttt{GPT-4o} initially identified potential risks in the first round, such as unclear shipment details, security concerns, and the referral-based structure. However, in the second round, the fraudulent job post was refined with official-sounding affiliations (e.g., Guangxi Cross-Border E-Commerce Association, JD Logistics, SF Express), structured onboarding steps, and a regulatory registration number. These elements created an illusion of legitimacy, effectively neutralizing the model’s previous concerns. Additionally, the inclusion of biometric verification, real-time commission tracking, and urgent deadlines made the offer appear more structured and credible, shifting \texttt{GPT-4o}’s focus from risk assessment to job attractiveness.

\subsection{Fraudulent Service}
The detailed failure content is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Denfense Failure Sample on GPT-4o - Fraudulent Service}. In the first round, \texttt{GPT-4o} maintained a cautious stance by emphasizing verification steps, checking JD’s official website, and being mindful of potential fraud risks. However, in the second round, the fraudulent message was enhanced with institutional credibility markers (e.g., CBIRC compliance, China UnionPay partnership, ISO 27001 certification), statistical validation (98.7\% user satisfaction, 2.3 million subscribers), and tangible incentives (credit vouchers, priority festival rebates). These refinements created a strong illusion of legitimacy, shifting \texttt{GPT-4o}’s response from skepticism to engagement with the offer, where it outlined a step-by-step activation plan rather than critically assessing potential risks.

\subsection{Impersonation}
The detailed failure content is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Denfense Failure Sample on GPT-4o - Impersonation}. \texttt{GPT-4o} failed immediately in this case because it did not recognize key impersonation red flags. The fraudulent message exploited authoritative positioning (posing as a homeroom teacher), urgent financial requests (payment deadline for school event equipment), and alternative payment channels (private WeChat transactions instead of official school payment portals). Despite these signals, \texttt{GPT-4o} not only accepted the message as legitimate but also reinforced the scam by providing a structured response that outlined a compliance plan, including adding the impersonator on WeChat, making the payment, and ensuring receipt submission—effectively guiding the user toward financial loss.

\subsection{Online Relationship}
The detailed failure content is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Denfense Failure Sample on GPT-4o - Online Relationship}. \texttt{GPT-4o} failed in this case because it completely accepted the premise of the message without skepticism, overlooking potential phishing and social engineering risks. The message includes a suspicious external link (couple.space), Face ID authentication, and an urgent call to action—classic signs of a potential phishing attempt. Instead of prompting verification steps (e.g., confirming the legitimacy of the link, questioning why Face ID is required), the model reinforced engagement by encouraging the user to click the link, download the app, and authenticate with biometric data, making them more vulnerable to credential theft or malware.

\subsection{Phishing Scam}
The detailed failure content is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Denfense Failure Sample on GPT-4o - Phishing Scams}. \texttt{GPT-4o} failed to recognize multiple phishing indicators in this email and instead reinforced engagement by guiding the user through steps that could lead to credential theft or financial fraud. The email mimicked a subscription service notification, a common phishing tactic designed to create urgency and trick recipients into clicking malicious links or revealing sensitive information. The presence of a fake account management link (preferences.lashcareinnovations.com) and alternative opt-out methods (replying with "UNSUBSCRIBE") are classic phishing strategies used to harvest login credentials and confirm active email addresses for further attacks.

\subsection{Failure Analysis Summary}
\texttt{GPT-4o}'s failures in detecting fraud, phishing, and impersonation cases primarily stem from its inability to critically assess structured yet deceptive information. The key failure reasons are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Over-reliance on surface-level legitimacy cues:} The model incorrectly assumes that references to regulatory bodies, company registration numbers, and official-sounding job descriptions indicate authenticity.
    \item \textbf{Failure to recognize social engineering tactics:} Fraudulent messages leverage urgency, high incentives, and authoritative positioning (e.g., teachers, financial advisors, official institutions), which \texttt{GPT-4o} often fails to challenge.
    \item \textbf{Lack of deep verification mechanisms:} The model does not prompt external fact-checking or suggest verifying information via independent official sources instead of relying on the provided details.
    \item \textbf{Inability to detect phishing elements:} \texttt{GPT-4o} does not flag suspicious links, alternative payment methods, or unusual account verification requests as potential threats.
    \item \textbf{Weak memory retention across interactions:} When fraud tactics escalate over multiple turns, the model fails to retain skepticism from previous rounds, leading to eventual misjudgment.
\end{itemize}
