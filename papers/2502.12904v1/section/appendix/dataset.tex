\subsection{Dataset Comparison}
\label{app:Dataset Comparison}
Table~\ref{tab:previous_study_vs_ours} presents a comparative analysis of \ourbench against existing fraud detection benchmarks. The comparison includes key attributes such as task categories, fraud types, language coverage, and whether the benchmark supports multi-round argumentation and evaluation. Existing benchmarks, such as BothBosu Scam Dialogue and FGRC-SCD, primarily focus on classification tasks with single-turn fraud detection, limiting their applicability to real-world fraud scenarios that often unfold dynamically over multiple interactions. In contrast, \ourbench is designed as an OpenQA benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to handle multi-turn fraud scenarios across message, email, and post-based fraud cases in both English and Chinese. Notably, \ourbench uniquely supports multi-round argumentation, allowing for a more realistic assessment of LLMs' defenses against evolving fraud tactics, though it does not yet incorporate a multi-round evaluation component.

\subsection{Fraudulent Keys Extraction}
\label{app:Fraudulent Keys Extraction}
Table~\ref{tab:fiandfs} categorizes various fraudulent strategies and their underlying intentions, highlighting how scammers extract sensitive information or financial assets from victims. The classification includes five main types: Fraudulent Services (such as fake investment schemes, healthcare and insurance scams, e-commerce fraud, and tech support scams), Impersonation (including government, celebrity, and business executive impersonation), Phishing Scams (covering event-related phishing, fake lottery winnings, and cryptocurrency airdrop scams), Fake Job Postings (such as fraudulent recruitment fees, fake remote job offers, and labor exploitation), and Online Relationship Scams (including romance fraud, pig butchering scams, and identity theft for extortion). Each category outlines specific deceptive tactics used by scammers and emphasizes their primary objectives, such as extracting financial assets, stealing personal and banking information, committing identity fraud, or manipulating victims for further exploitation.

\subsection{Data Generation Comparison}
\label{app:Data Generation Comparison}
To validate \texttt{Deepseek-R1}'s suitability for our data generation needs, we conducted a comparative analysis between \texttt{Deepseek-R1} and \texttt{GPT-4o} using identical prompts. Using English raw data as an example, from Figure~\ref{app:Data Generation Comparison}, which reveals that while both models generate fraudulent URLs and service phone numbers, \texttt{Deepseek-R1} produces more comprehensive deceptive content, including fictitious bank addresses and staff names. Additionally, from a practical standpoint, \texttt{Deepseek-R1}'s API calls are significantly more cost-effective than \texttt{GPT-4o} due to resource constraints.
