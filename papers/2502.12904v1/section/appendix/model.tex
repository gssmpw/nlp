\subsection{Model Choice}
\label{app:model_choice}
The following Table~\ref{tab:model_details} illustrates the details of our chosen evaluation models. These models encompass both API-based and open-weight LLMs across a diverse set of architectures and parameter scales. The selection includes major proprietary offerings from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and DeepSeek, alongside open-weight models such as \texttt{Llama-3.1} series and \texttt{Deepseek-V3}. 

We categorize the models based on their availability:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{API-based models}: These include \texttt{GPT-4o}, \texttt{Claude-3.5} series, \texttt{Gemini-1.5} series, and \texttt{GLM} models, which are accessible through their respective cloud-based platforms.
    \item \textbf{Open-weight models}: These include Meta's \texttt{Llama-3.1} series and \texttt{Deepseek-V3}, which offer downloadable weights for independent deployment.
\end{itemize}
