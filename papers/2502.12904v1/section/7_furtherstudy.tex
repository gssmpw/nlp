\section{Future Work}
 While \ourbench advances the evaluation of LLM robustness against fraud, several directions remain for future research.

 \paragraph{Evaluating LLM-Powered Agents.} Our current benchmark focuses exclusively on evaluating standalone LLMs, without assessing their performance in agent-based systems. However, LLMs are increasingly integrated into autonomous agents that interact dynamically with users and other systems in real-world applications. Future work should explore how these agents handle fraud detection in multi-agent environments, where factors like memory, contextual awareness, and adaptive behaviour play a critical role.
