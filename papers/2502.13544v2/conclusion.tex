\section*{Conclusions}
To improve the performance of LLMs in length-controllable text generation, we conduct a bottom-up error analysis of relevant sub-abilities. The results reveal that deficiencies in identifying, counting, and aligning are key limitations. To fill this gap, we propose \textsc{MarkerGen}, which leverages external tools to compensate for fundamental deficiencies. Additionally, it introduces Decaying Interval Marker Insertion Strategy to facilitate explicit length modeling and employs Three-Stage Decoupled Generation mechanism to balance semantic coherence and length control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the strong generalizability and effectiveness of \textsc{MarkerGen} in enhancing length control and preserving semantic integrity.
% 针对当前LLM在length-controllable text generation任务上表现不佳的问题，我们自底向上地对LLM的相关子能力进行了误差分析。结果表明Identifying，Counting，Aligning 能力的欠缺是主要因素。为此，我们提出\textsc{MarkerGen}方法。其通过外部工具引入解决了fundamental能力的不足，introduce Decaying Interval Marker Insertion Strategy 帮助模型进行显式长度建模，通过Three-Stage Decoupled Generation平衡了语义和长度建模。Comprehensive的实验验证了\textsc{MarkerGen}在增强长度控制和语义完整性上的有效性，以及强大的泛化性。
\section*{Limitations} 
% 我们聚焦于LCTG场景进行了自底向上的子能力分析，并提出\textsc{MarkerGen}方法实现了良好的LCTG效果。
% 我们认为我们的主要Limitation在于：\textsc{MarkerGen}目前只能用于开源模型中。对于闭源的模型，目前还无法应用。我们将公开我们的代码，从而方便愿意适配\textsc{MarkerGen}来提升LCTG效果的闭源模型厂商受益于我们提出的方法。
In this work, we conduct a bottom-up sub-capability analysis in the LCTG ability and propose the \textsc{MarkerGen} method, achieving strong LCTG performance.
One major limitation of \textsc{MarkerGen} is that it is currently only applicable to open-source models and cannot yet be used with closed-source models. To address this, we will release our code, allowing closed-source model providers interested in adapting \textsc{MarkerGen} to benefit from our method in enhancing LCTG performance.
