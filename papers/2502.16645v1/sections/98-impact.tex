\section*{Impact Statement}
In this paper, we present \method, an innovative data engine designed to systematically monitor real-world API changes and generate \benchmark, a specialized benchmark for assessing and improving LLMs' adaptability to API updates. This benchmark establishes a standardized evaluation framework for assessing the challenges posed by outdated API knowledge in LLMs. However, one limitation of our work is the efficiency of collecting invocation instances. By enabling LLMs with real-time API adaptation capabilities, our work has the potential to significantly enhance developer productivity and drive advancements in software development, AI-driven coding assistants, and programming education.
