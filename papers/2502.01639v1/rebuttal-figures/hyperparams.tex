    \caption{Concept Sliders Comparison \& Hyperparameter analysis: (Left) Impact of PCA directions: SliderSpace with 10 directions matches the FID of 64 Concept Sliders. More directions, upto 40, leads to improved FID. (Right) Effect of LoRA rank: Given a fixed training budget rank-one sliders are efficient than higher rank versions and outperforms Concept Sliders}
