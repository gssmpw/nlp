    \caption{SliderSpace decomposes the visual variation of diffusion model's knowledge corresponding to a concept. These directions can be perceived as interpretable directions of the model's hierarchical knowledge. We show the decomposed slider direction for a concept using SliderSpace and the corresponding labels generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet.}
