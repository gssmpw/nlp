    \caption{We conduct our ablations on the art-exploration application and show FID scores as a measure of diversity. SliderSpace contrastive objective (Eq.~\ref{eq:contrast} is essential for discovering diverse directions. Ablating CLIP space analysis and performing spectral analysis in diffusion output space (Eq.~\ref{eq:x0}) results in sliders that control color, texture and shapes. We also find that expanding the training data diversity using LLM enhanced prompts and base SDXL models can help with improved distilled model's SliderSpace diversity}
