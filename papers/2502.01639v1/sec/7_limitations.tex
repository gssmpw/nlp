\section{Limitations}
Our method's reliance on semantic embeddings introduces inherent biases present in encoder's training data. While these embeddings enable semantic consistency, they may not capture certain culturally-specific or nuanced artistic concepts. This highlights the need for more careful study on choices of the semantic embeddings and their effects on SliderSpace discovery. The current discovery process requires significant computational time ($\approx$ 2 hrs on A100), which may limit rapid experimentation and iteration. This computational overhead opens avenues for future research into training time optimizations. We also note that our method trains 4 times faster than  Concept Sliders for same number of sliders. For art style discovery, it is possible that the discovered directions are not one-to-one matched with the original artists. Further work can address discovery that nudges the directions to be aligned with real artists. 
% This can be used as an interpretability tool or an attribution tool if the discover directions are aligned with real artists.
