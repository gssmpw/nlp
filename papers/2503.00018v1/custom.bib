    abstract = "A fundamental challenge when training counselors is presenting novices with the opportunity to practice counseling distressed individuals without exacerbating a situation. Rather than replacing human empathy with an automated counselor, we propose simulating an individual in crisis so that human counselors in training can practice crisis counseling in a low-risk environment. Towards this end, we collect a dataset of suicide prevention counselor role-play transcripts and make initial steps towards constructing a CRISISbot for humans to counsel while in training. In this data-constrained setting, we evaluate the potential for message retrieval to construct a coherent chat agent in light of recent advances with text embedding methods. Our results show that embeddings can considerably improve retrieval approaches to make them competitive with generative models. By coherently retrieving messages, we can help counselors practice chatting in a low-risk environment.",

abstract = {The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the mental health of people under risk. Social counselling has gained remarkable significance in this environment. Unlike general goal-oriented dialogues, a conversation between a patient and a therapist is considerably implicit, though the objective of the conversation is quite apparent. In such a case, understanding the intent of the patient is imperative in providing effective counselling in therapy sessions, and the same applies to a dialogue system as well. In this work, we take forward a small but an important step in the development of an automated dialogue system for mental-health counselling. We develop a novel dataset, named HOPE, to provide a platform for the dialogue-act classification in counselling conversations. We identify the requirement of such conversation and propose twelve domain-specific dialogue-act (DAC) labels. We collect ~ 12.9K utterances from publicly-available counselling session videos on YouTube, extract their transcripts, clean, and annotate them with DAC labels. Further, we propose SPARTA, a transformer-based architecture with a novel speaker- and time-aware contextual learning for the dialogue-act classification. Our evaluation shows convincing performance over several baselines, achieving state-of-the-art on HOPE. We also supplement our experiments with extensive empirical and qualitative analyses of SPARTA.},

    abstract = "AI-driven chatbots are seen as an attractive solution to support people undergoing emotional distress. One of the main components of such a chatbot is the ability to empathize with the user. But a significant limitation in achieving this goal is the lack of a large dialogue dataset containing empathetic support for those undergoing distress. In this work, we curate a large-scale dialogue dataset that contains {\ensuremath{\approx}}1.3M peer support dialogues spanning across more than 4K distress-related topics. We analyze the empathetic characteristics of this dataset using statistical and visual means. To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we train four baseline neural dialogue models that can respond empathetically to distress prompts. Two of the baselines adapt existing architecture and the other two incorporate a framework identifying levels of cognitive and emotional empathy in responses. Automatic and human evaluation of these models validate the utility of the dataset in generating empathetic responses for distress support and show that identifying levels of empathy in peer-support responses facilitates generating responses that are lengthier, richer in empathy, and closer to the ground truth."
