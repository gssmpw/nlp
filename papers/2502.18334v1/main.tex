\begin{abstract}
Graph-based learning has achieved remarkable success in domains ranging from recommendation to fraud detection and particle physics by effectively capturing underlying interaction patterns. However, it often struggles to generalize when distribution shifts occur, particularly those involving changes in network connectivity or interaction patterns. Existing approaches designed to mitigate such shifts typically require retraining with full access to source data, rendering them infeasible under strict computational or privacy constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a test-time structural alignment (TSA) algorithm for Graph Test-Time Adaptation (GTTA), a novel method that aligns graph structures during inference without revisiting the source domain. Built upon a theoretically grounded treatment of graph data distribution shifts, TSA integrates three key strategies: an uncertainty-aware neighborhood weighting that accommodates structure shifts, an adaptive balancing of self-node and neighborhood-aggregated representations driven by node representationsâ€™ signal-to-noise ratio, and a decision boundary refinement that corrects remaining label and feature shifts. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TSA can consistently outperform both non-graph TTA methods and state-of-the-art GTTA baselines.

% \subsection{Theorems and such}
% The preferred way is to number definitions, propositions, lemmas, etc. consecutively, within sections, as shown below.
% \begin{definition}
% \label{def:inj}
% A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
% \end{definition}
% Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
% \begin{proposition}
% If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
% the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof} 
% Left as an exercise to the reader. 
% \end{proof}
% \cref{lem:usefullemma} stated next will prove to be useful.
% \begin{lemma}
% \label{lem:usefullemma}
% For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{theorem}
% \label{thm:bigtheorem}
% If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
% \end{theorem}
% An easy corollary of \cref{thm:bigtheorem} is the following:
% \begin{corollary}
% If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
% the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
% \end{corollary}
% \begin{assumption}
% The set $X$ is finite.
% \label{ass:xfinite}
% \end{assumption}
% \begin{remark}
% According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.

% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.  

% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.
