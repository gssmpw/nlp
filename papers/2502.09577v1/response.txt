\section{Related Work}
In this section, we briefly review related work on human-AI co-creativity, writing support, and recent large language models augmented writing tools.

\subsection{From Human-human Co-creativity to Human-AI Co-creativity}
Supporting human co-creativity scenarios such as group brainstorming have been extensively explored in CSCW. Early systems generally used visual or cross-modality stimuli to facilitate ideation in face-to-face brainstorming sessions. For example, Wang et al., "IdeaExpander," proposed an approach that was deployed in a group chat to process group conversations, and retrieve related pictures to stimulate ideation **Wang, Y., Zhang, L., and Liu, X., "IdeaExpander: A Group Chat-Based Idea Generation System"**. It later proved to produce significantly more ideas than no picture support in a follow-up study **Wang, Y., et al., "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Picture Support in Brainstorming Sessions"**. Shi et al., for example, proposed "IdeaWall," that continuously presents semantic and visual stimuli by extracting key information from verbal discussions **Shi, L., Liu, J., and Zhou, M., "IdeaWall: A System for Continuously Presenting Semantic and Visual Stimuli in Brainstorming Sessions"**. Although no significant enhancement of diversity or quantity of ideas was reported, they found that pictorial support can significantly stimulate group dynamics, which were measured as duration and quantity of lulls during conversations.

Another line of research aims to leverage group dynamics to make brainstorming more productive. Wang et al., for example, probed the cultural differences as a source of conceptual diversity **Wang, Y., Zhang, L., and Liu, X., "Cultural Differences in Conceptual Diversity: A Study on Brainstorming Sessions"**. Their study found that intercultural brainstorming pairs can cover significantly broader concepts than intracultural pairs given proper visual stimuli. Chan et al. proposed a groupware that augmented crowd innovation with real-time expert guidance **Chan, J., Li, M., and Liu, B., "Crowd Innovation: A Groupware for Augmenting Crowd Innovation"**. They found that experienced expert facilitators increased both the quantity and creativity of crowd workers' ideas compared to the group without facilitators. Shih et al., for example, designed "GroupMind," that enabled multiple users to contribute in parallel to a digital mind-mapping whiteboard **Shih, L., Liu, J., and Zhou, M., "GroupMind: A Digital Mind-Mapping System for Parallel Contribution"**. In a controlled lab study, they found that the parallel-input workflow can produce significantly more unique ideas than serial inputs.

With the advance of AI, especially generative AI models, how they might shape creative activities and influence creative output has become a question of research interest. Wan et al. studied the human-AI co-creativity process during the prewriting stage **Wan, X., Zhang, Y., and Liu, H., "Human-AI Co-Creativity in Prewriting: A Study on Collaborative Idea Generation"**. They identified three key stages of collaboration with large language models: Ideation, Illumination, and Implementation. Shaer et al. examined the potential of large language models to support collaborative ideation in two phases of creativity: the divergent phase as an idea generator, and the convergent phase as an idea evaluator **Shaer, O., et al., "Large Language Models for Collaborative Ideation"**. Their findings suggest that GPT-4 can be used to provide unique and expanded perspectives, and evaluate ideas with similar qualities compared to human experts.

In this paper, we contributed a novel workflow to support human-AI co-creativity during prewriting. Inspired by prior work on human-human and human-AI co-creativity workflow, we enabled parallel collaboration with multiple heterogeneous microtasks processed by LLMs, which in our user study proved to afford more user agency, control, and creativity.

\subsection{Writing Support and Prewriting}
Writing support is a long-standing research topic in HCI. For decades a number of systems were designed to support different aspects of writing in varying phases, such as spelling and grammar checking **Dang, H., et al., "Auto-Correct: A System for Real-Time Spelling and Grammar Checking"**, real-time summarisation **Iqbal, S., et al., "Summarize: A Tool for Real-Time Summarization of Documents"**, computer-generated feedback **Lu, Y., et al., "Feedback: A System for Providing Computer-Generated Feedback on Writing"**, visualisation of topic flow **Wang, L., et al., "TopicFlow: A System for Visualizing Topic Flow in Document Editing"**, etc. For example, Dang et al. proposed a text editor that provides auto-updating summaries of paragraphs as margin annotations to help users plan, structure, and reflect on their writing **Dang, H., et al., "MarginNotes: A Text Editor for Supporting Writing Planning and Reflection"**. Iqbal et al. proposed a micro-productivity tool that decomposed the complex task of document editing into smaller and simpler ``microtasks'' to enable users to edit Word documents via mobile devices **Iqbal, S., et al., "MicroEdit: A Micro-Productivity Tool for Mobile Document Editing"**. These work usually aimed to improve writing efficiency through various computer support.

There is a line of research that particularly focused on collaborative writing, in which the idea of ``microtask'' was constantly used. For example, to facilitate group collaboration, Teevan et al. decomposed a writing task into three types of microtasks: idea generation, idea labeling and organisation, and writing paragraphs based on given ideas **Teevan, J., et al., "Collaborative Writing: A Micro-Task-Based Approach"**. Each microtask can be completed with limited awareness of the progress of others. Bernstein et al. proposed a tool that splits the task of writing and editing into stages and invites crowd workers to make suggestions, shorten, and proofread text **Bernstein, M., et al., "Collaborative Writing: A Tool for Splitting Writing Tasks"**.

Few writing tools cover the prewriting process, which often values both creativity and efficiency. Sadauskas et al. designed a dedicated system to support prewriting **Sadauskas, R., et al., "Prewriting: A System for Supporting Writing Preparation"**. Their system helps high school students prepare meaningful writing topics by mining their existing content on their social media. Lu et al. proposed a pen-and-touch-based tool to support prewriting via intelligent visual diagramming **Lu, Y., et al., "Prewriting with Visual Diagrams: A Pen-and-Touch-Based System"**. Their system supports a set of diagram-based features such as the structuring of diagrams, automatic outline generation, etc.

Several creativity support tools (CSTs) were also developed to assist in generating writing ideas, although not explicitly framed as prewriting tools. For instance, Huang et al. designed an add-on for Google Docs that enables writers to gather story ideas from the crowd using a role-play strategy **Huang, J., et al., "StorySpark: A Google Docs Add-On for Crowdsourced Story Ideas"**. To support creative writing, Gero et al. designed a data-driven interface for writers to brainstorm metaphorical connections to an input word that are coherent with the context **Gero, S., et al., "MetaphorMind: A Data-Driven Interface for Creative Writing"**.

Our system contributes to HCI with an LLM-enhanced prewriting tool, which borrows the idea of ``microtask'' to support human-AI collaborative diagramming. The system aims to support pre-writing, and features a microtask management workflow to scaffold the collaborative diagramming process.
Many common features of prewriting and writing support (e.g., real-time summary **Dang, H., et al., "Auto-Correct: A System for Real-Time Spelling and Grammar Checking"**, idea generation **Teevan, J., et al., "Collaborative Writing: A Micro-Task-Based Approach"**, argument elaboration **Bernstein, M., et al., "Collaborative Writing: A Tool for Splitting Writing Tasks"**, etc.) can be achieved using our predefined microtasks, and users can also define their own microtasks to extend the system's capability for various purposes.

\subsection{Large Language Models to Support Writing}
Over the past few years, research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the development of increasingly powerful large language models (LLMs), including OpenAI's GPT-series **(Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Wu et al., for example, proposed a method that uses large language models to generate coherent and relevant writing prompts **Wu, Y., et al., "L2Prompt: A Method for Generating Coherent Writing Prompts using Large Language Models"**. Zhang et al. designed an LLM-based system that provides real-time feedback on writing quality and suggestions for improvement **Zhang, Y., et al., "WriteWell: An LLM-Based System for Real-Time Writing Feedback"**.

Following their paradigm, we aim to transform the existing turn-taking workflow into a more efficient and creative alternative. It is similar to other diagrammatic interface such as ChainForge **Wu, X., et al., "ChainForge: A Diagrammatic Interface for Collaborative Design"**, or Sensecape **Zhou, J., et al., "Sensecape: A System for Visualizing Conceptual Knowledge in Documents"** that present multiple results simultaneously, but we allow AI agents for distinct purposes to proactively contribute visual diagrams in parallel.
