\caption{The processing of a proactive microtask. Once results are obtained from the LLM, it will first ``draw a curtain'' over the task header to notify users, displaying key points of the generation. Users can click on the ``expand'' icon on the ``curtain'' for a quick view. If a user does not expand these result, it will be marked as unread notifications. Once users hovers over the task header, a preview panel will pop up, showing a preview of all unread results.}
