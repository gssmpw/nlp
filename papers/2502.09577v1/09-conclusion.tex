\section{conclusion}
This work explored the design and evaluation of \textit{Polymind}, which leverages large language models to support visual diagramming during prewriting. We introduced the notion of ``microtasking'' into human-AI collaborative diagramming, and designed a set of features to support managing these microtasks in parallel, including ``task headers'', ``task cards'', ``notifications and previews'', etc. Our evaluation tentatively reveals the usefulness and the potential of such a system and workflow and opens up opportunities for future research endeavors.
