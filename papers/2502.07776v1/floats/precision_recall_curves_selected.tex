    \caption{Selected precision-recall curves for distinguishing between times from the cache hit and cache miss procedures. Cache hits are the positive class. The curves show that cache hits can be detected with near perfect precision up to moderate recall scores. Figure~\ref{fig:precision-recall-curves-full} in the appendix contains curves for other APIs.}
