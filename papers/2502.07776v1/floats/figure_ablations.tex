        Ablations on the effects of \PromptLength{}, \PrefixFraction{}, and model size on the average precision. In (a)--(c), as the prompt length or prefix match length decreases, the average precision decreases to random chance. In (d), we detect caching across all model sizes, with no clear relationship between model size and average precision.
