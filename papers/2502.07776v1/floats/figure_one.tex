        An example illustrating prompt caching. (1) A victim sends a prompt to the API, which then becomes cached. (2) An attacker sends a new prompt, resulting in a cache miss and slow response time. (3) An attacker sends a prompt that shares a prefix with the victim's prompt, resulting in a cache hit. From the fast response time, the attacker can infer that a cache hit occurred, which potentially reveals information about other users' prompts.
