\section{Ablation Effects on Audit p-values}
\label{app:ablations-p-values}

Figure~\ref{fig:ablations-p-values} shows the effects of the ablations in \S\ref{sec:ablations} on the audit p-values. Each test is run using $\NumSamples = 250$. We observe similar patterns as in \S\ref{sec:ablations}, with decreases in average precision corresponding to increases in p-values. As the prompt length or prefix match length decreases, the p-values grow larger. We detect caching across all model sizes, with no clear relationship between model size and p-values.
