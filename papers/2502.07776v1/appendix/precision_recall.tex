\section{Precision-Recall Curves}

Figure~\ref{fig:precision-recall-curves-full} shows precision-recall curves for distinguishing between cache hit and cache miss times in APIs where we detected caching in our audits (Table~\ref{tab:audit-results}).

    \caption{Precision-recall curves for distinguishing between times produced by the cache hit and cache miss procedures in APIs where we detected caching in our audits (Table~\ref{tab:audit-results}). Cache hits are the positive class, and cache misses are the negative class. The curves show that cache hits can be detected with near perfect precision up to moderate recall scores. Note that our cache hit procedure attempts to produce cache hits but cannot guarantee cache hits (e.g., due to server routing), so some times in the cache hit distribution may actually be cache misses, which would hurt recall scores.}
