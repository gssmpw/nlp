\section{Related Works}
\noindent \textbf{COCO:} COCO problems have been widely studied, since they can handle complex action set ____. Table \ref{tbl:comparison} provides some of the key works for regret and CCV guarantees in the area. ____ proposed an algorithm that solves a constrained convex optimization problem in each round, and achieves $\C{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\C{O}({T}^{3/4})$ CCV. This result is a special case of the result in ____. Recently, ____ proposed a projection-based algorithm that achieves regret and CCV of $\Tilde{\C{O}}(T^{1/2})$. The results have been further extended to strongly convex cost functions, where all these works show a regret of $\Tilde{\C{O}}(1)$ with a CCV of $\Tilde{\C{O}}(T^{1/2})$. However, performing a constrained convex optimization or doing a orthogonal projection is computationally complex ____, and thus we provide a projection-free algorithm in this paper. 


\noindent \textbf{Projection-free Algorithms for OCO:} Frank-Wolfe based approaches have been proposed for OCO, and achieve a regret of $\C{O}(T^{3/4})$ for convex cost function ____ and $\C{O}(T^{2/3})$ for strongly convex cost functions ____. These approaches do not scale well with the dimensional spaces due to the use of linear optimization oracle.  ____ proposed the concept of infeasible projection which was implemented with linear optimization oracle to replace the traditional orthogonal projection oracles, and used that for online linear optimization.  ____ gave an approach to implement infeasible projection via separation oracle, which achieves an optimal regret of $\C{O}(\sqrt{T})$ using online gradient descent based approach with constant step size. Their results for the case where infeasible projection is implemented via linear optimization oracle does not achieve order-optimal regret. This motivates the choice of use of infeasible projection using separation oracle in our work. We also note that ____ studied a variant of the approach to implement infeasible projection via separation oracle in ____, and applied that to online gradient descent with constant step size. The key difference is that the approach of ____ queries only in the constraint set, which is not necessary in ____, which motivates us to use the approach in ____. 




\noindent \textbf{Projection-free Algorithms for  COCO:} 
Projection-free algorithms for online learning were proposed in response to the growing prevalence of high-dimensional data, which led to increased computational challenges for projection operators ____. Recent work in  ____ have studied  projection-free algorithms for  COCO, but do not achieve order-optimal regret and CCV (See Table \ref{tbl:comparison}). In contrast, this paper provides the algorithm that achieves order optimal regret and CCV.
