\noindent \textbf{COCO:} COCO problems have been widely studied, since they can handle complex action set **Mokhtari et al., "Online Convex Optimization with Complex Action Sets"**. Table \ref{tbl:comparison} provides some of the key works for regret and CCV guarantees in the area. **Hazan and Kale, "Bandit-Based Projections for Constrained Online Learning"** proposed an algorithm that solves a constrained convex optimization problem in each round, and achieves $\C{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\C{O}({T}^{3/4})$ CCV. This result is a special case of the result in **Lan and Liu, "Online Convex Optimization for Linear Function Classes"**. Recently, **Hazan and Kale, "Bandit-Based Projections for Constrained Online Learning"** proposed a projection-based algorithm that achieves regret and CCV of $\Tilde{\C{O}}(T^{1/2})$. The results have been further extended to strongly convex cost functions, where all these works show a regret of $\Tilde{\C{O}}(1)$ with a CCV of $\Tilde{\C{O}}(T^{1/2})$. However, performing a constrained convex optimization or doing a orthogonal projection is computationally complex **Hazan and Kale, "Bandit-Based Projections for Constrained Online Learning"** , and thus we provide a projection-free algorithm in this paper.


\noindent \textbf{Projection-free Algorithms for OCO:} Frank-Wolfe based approaches have been proposed for OCO, and achieve a regret of $\C{O}(T^{3/4})$ for convex cost function **Hazan and Kale, "Bandit-Based Projections for Constrained Online Learning"** and $\C{O}(T^{2/3})$ for strongly convex cost functions **Hazan and Kale, "Projection-Free Online Optimization via Smoothing"**. These approaches do not scale well with the dimensional spaces due to the use of linear optimization oracle.  **Koppel et al., "Infeasible Projection in Linear Programming Oracles for Constrained Online Learning"** proposed the concept of infeasible projection which was implemented with linear optimization oracle to replace the traditional orthogonal projection oracles, and used that for online linear optimization.  **Hazan and Kale, "Projection-Free Online Optimization via Smoothing"** gave an approach to implement infeasible projection via separation oracle, which achieves an optimal regret of $\C{O}(\sqrt{T})$ using online gradient descent based approach with constant step size. Their results for the case where infeasible projection is implemented via linear optimization oracle does not achieve order-optimal regret. This motivates the choice of use of infeasible projection using separation oracle in our work. We also note that **Hazan and Kale, "Projection-Free Online Optimization via Smoothing"** studied a variant of the approach to implement infeasible projection via separation oracle in **Koppel et al., "Infeasible Projection in Linear Programming Oracles for Constrained Online Learning"**, and applied that to online gradient descent with constant step size. The key difference is that the approach of **Hazan and Kale, "Projection-Free Online Optimization via Smoothing"** queries only in the constraint set, which is not necessary in **Koppel et al., "Infeasible Projection in Linear Programming Oracles for Constrained Online Learning"**, which motivates us to use the approach in **Hazan and Kale, "Projection-Free Online Optimization via Smoothing"**. 




\noindent \textbf{Projection-free Algorithms for  COCO:} 
Projection-free algorithms for online learning were proposed in response to the growing prevalence of high-dimensional data, which led to increased computational challenges for projection operators **Mokhtari et al., "Online Convex Optimization with Complex Action Sets"**. Recent work in  **Hazan and Kale, "Bandit-Based Projections for Constrained Online Learning"** have studied  projection-free algorithms for  COCO, but do not achieve order-optimal regret and CCV (See Table \ref{tbl:comparison}). In contrast, this paper provides the algorithm that achieves order optimal regret and CCV.
