\textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{Size, n} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{DTU}^{unseen}}$ & 1,103 & A partition of $\mathbf{D_{DTU}}$ that is \textbf{not} used to fine-tune any image generation model. \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{AAU}^{unseen}}$ & 978 & A partition of $\mathbf{D_{AAU}}$ that is \textbf{not} used to fine-tune any image generation model. \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{LFW}}$ & 9,452 & Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition \cite{LFWTech} \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{DTU}^{gen}}$ & 2,500 & Generated by a LDM which has been fine-tuned on the $\mathbf{D_{DTU}^{seen}}$ image set, i.e. $\mathbf{M_T^{DTU}}$ \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{AAU}^{gen}}$ & 2,500 & Generated by a LDM that has been fine-tuned on the $\mathbf{D_{AAU}^{seen}}$ image set, i.e. $\mathbf{M_T^{AAU}}$ \\ \hline
\wmgen & 2,500 & Generated by a LDM which has been fine-tuned on the \wmseen image set, i.e. \wmtar \\ \hline
\hwmgen & 2,500 & Generated by a LDM which has been fine-tuned on the \hwmseen image set, i.e. \hwmtar \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{DTU+LFW}^{gen}}$ & 2,500 & Generated by a LDM that has been fine-tuned on the  $\mathbf{D_{DTU+LFW}}$ image set, i.e. $\mathbf{M_T^{DTU+LFW}}$ \\ \hline
$\mathbf{D_{NFT}^{gen}}$ & $2\times$ 2,500 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Generated by a Non Fine-Tuned (NFT) target model $\mathbf{M_T}$, \\ i.e. Stable Diffusion out-of-the-box. This dataset also comes in two versions, one which was \\ prompted with \texttt{"a dtu headshot"} and one which was prompted with \texttt{"a aau headshot"}\end{tabular} \\ \hline
