\section{Task Code}
\label{appsec:taskcode}

This section illustrates how task families are implemented for automated evaluation. In \Cref{appsubsec:example_family_code}, we show a short code snippet for a simple ``Hello World'' example, and \Cref{appsubsec:eval_free_form} demonstrates how more open-ended tasks can be evaluated automatically. These examples complement the discussion in \Cref{subsec:definition_of_task_families}.

\subsection{Example Task Family Code}
\label{appsubsec:example_family_code}

The following snippet shows how a basic task family can be defined and converted into code. The structure follows a simplified version of the METR Task Standard~\citep{metr}, an open-source task standard found at \url{https://github.com/METR/task-standard}. This code is released under the MIT License.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pythonstyle, caption={Hello World Task Family Code}, label={lst:hello_world_code}]
class TaskFamily:
    @staticmethod
    def get_tasks():
        return {
            "1": {"message": "Hello, world!"},
            "2": {"message": "Greetings, universe!"}
        }

    @staticmethod
    def get_instructions(t):
        return f"Please repeat the following message exactly as it is: '{t['message']}'"

    @staticmethod
    def score(t, submission):
        return 1.0 if submission.strip() == t['message'] else 0.0
\end{lstlisting}

In this example:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item \texttt{get\_tasks()} defines two tasks, each with a different message.
    \item \texttt{get\_instructions(t)} provides instructions to the subject model, specifying the exact message to repeat.
    \item \texttt{score(t, submission)} evaluates the subject model's submission by checking if it matches the required message exactly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluating Free-Form Responses Using an LLM Judge}
\label{appsubsec:eval_free_form}

For tasks that cannot be checked with a simple programmatic approach (e.g.\ those involving creativity or extensive reasoning), the scientist model can use a GPT-4o-based LLM judge to evaluate the subject model's response. Below is an example of such a task family, where the evaluation logic calls \texttt{eval\_with\_llm\_judge} to handle free-form writing tasks.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=pythonstyle, caption={Short Story Writing Task Family Code}, label={lst:story_writing_code}]
class TaskFamily:
    @staticmethod
    def get_tasks():
        return {
            "1": {"prompt": "A child discovers a secret portal in the forest."},
            "2": {"prompt": "An astronaut encounters an alien lifeform on Mars."}
        }

    @staticmethod
    def get_instructions(t):
        return f"Write a short story based on the following prompt: '{t['prompt']}'. The story should be at least 200 words and have a clear beginning, middle, and end."

    @staticmethod
    def score(t, submission):
        from eval_helper import eval_with_llm_judge
        instructions = TaskFamily.get_instructions(t)
        criteria = [
            "The story is at least 200 words.",
            "The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end.",
            "The story is based on the provided prompt."
        ]
        return 1.0 if eval_with_llm_judge(instructions, submission, criteria) else 0.0
\end{lstlisting}

In this example:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item \texttt{get\_tasks()} provides two distinct prompts for short story writing.
    \item \texttt{get\_instructions(t)} instructs the subject model to write a short story based on the given prompt, specifying requirements for length and structure.
    \item \texttt{score(t, submission)} calls the \texttt{eval\_with\_llm\_judge} helper function, which uses a GPT-4o-based judge to decide whether the submission meets the specified criteria (word count, story structure, and adherence to the prompt).
\end{itemize}

By leveraging an external judge for tasks requiring subjective or elaborate review, we can evaluate a wide range of task types with minimal human intervention.

\section{Hyperparameters}
\label{appsec:hyperparameters}

\Cref{tab:hyp} lists all hyperparameters used by \ouralgolong (\ouralgo) in the experiments described in \Cref{sec:eval}. These settings are consistent across all evaluated foundation models.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\caption{LLM Sampling and Algorithm Parameters}
\label{tab:hyp}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Hyperparameter} & \textbf{Value} \\

\multirow{3}{*}{Agent Evaluation} & Evaluation agent type & Chain-of-thought \\
 & Evaluation $n$-shot & 5 \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For visualization and clustering, we use sklearn~\citep{scikit-learn} for t-SNE, and HDBSCAN~\citep{mcinnes2017hdbscan} from \url{https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan} which is released under a BSD 3-Clause License. We used these additional hyperparameters:

\end{table}

\subsection{Cost of Experiments}
\label{appsubsec:cost}
The total cost for our experiments was \$450 USD for the GPT-4o-GPT-4o experiments, so approximately 10 cents per generation.
We saw a small decrease in cost for our GPT-4o-Llama3-8B experiments due to the lower cost of the subject model, while our Sonnet 3.5-GPT-4o experiments were approximately 50\% more expensive.

\section{Additional Experimental Results}
\label{appsec:add_exp}

\subsection{Additional Analysis}
\label{appsubsec:gpt4o_analysis}

First, we show that even after thousands of generations, \ouralgo can find novel tasks by plotting the rolling success rate for the three different scientist-subject combinations we explore in \Cref{sec:eval}.
The very gradual decline in success rate suggests that new tasks continue to emerge even after thousands of generations, illustrating the open-ended nature of our approach.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/discovery_rate_by_generation.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Average Task Discovery Rate by Generation Number.} Even after thousands of generations, \ouralgo continues discovering novel tasks, indicating ongoing exploration of the subject model's capabilities. Each subplot corresponds to a different scientist-subject pairing: \textcolor{JungleGreen}{\textbf{(left)}} GPT-4o-GPT-4o, \textcolor{Orange}{\textbf{(middle)}} GPT-4o-Llama3-8B, and \textcolor{Cerulean}{\textbf{(right)}} Sonnet~3.5-GPT-4o.}
\label{fig:discovery_rate_by_generation}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:gpt4o_3seeds} illustrates how \ouralgo\ discovers tasks when GPT-4o serves as both the scientist and the subject, across three different random seeds.
Each point on the plot represents a discovered task (with each seed shown in a different color), visualized via t-SNE.
Despite variations in random initialization and sampling, the distribution of discovered capabilities remains largely consistent despite stochastic FM sampling.
This consistency suggests that \ouralgo produces a stable ``capability signature'' of tasks given a fixed scientist and subject, even when restarted from different seeds.
Here, each seed was run for a smaller trial of 500 generations for computational cost reasons.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/gpt4o_3seeds.pdf}
\caption{\textbf{Comparison of Discovered Tasks Across Three Seeds for GPT-4o.} We visualize tasks generated by \ouralgo\ under three random seeds (each color denotes a different seed). Despite minor differences in the exact tasks, the overall distribution of discovered capabilities remains roughly consistent, indicating that \ouralgo can generate stable ``capability signatures'' given the same subject. Each run used a lower 500 generations.}
\label{fig:gpt4o_3seeds}
\end{figure}

In \Cref{fig:success_rates_and_task_counts}, we show how the FM-judge and human-estimated success varies by human-estimated difficulty.
Whilst the FM-judge success rate does not vary significantly with the user-estimated difficulty, the human-estimated success rate drops steeply with estimated difficulty.
This complements the class-balanced F1 graphs in \Cref{fig:human_eval}.
Meanwhile, \ouralgo can discover tasks in each difficulty category, suggesting that \ouralgo can suitably adapt task difficulty in response to the subject model's capability.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{figures/gpt_4o_success_rates_and_task_counts.pdf}
\caption{

}
\label{fig:success_rates_and_task_counts}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Additional Visualizations for Llama3-8B as Subject}
\label{appsubsec:llama_vis}

We provide additional visualizations for the GPT-4o-Llama3-8B setting in \Cref{subsec:varying_subject}.
In \Cref{fig:llama_subject_embedding}, we compare embeddings of tasks proposed by GPT-4o as scientist when it evaluates itself \textcolor{Cerulean}{\textbf{blue}} versus when it evaluates Llama3-8B as the subject \textcolor{Orange}{\textbf{orange}}.
While some clusters overlap significantly, Llama3-8B fails more often on tasks requiring multi-step logic or advanced reasoning as shown in \Cref{appsubsec:llama_manual_selection}.
Therefore, \ouralgo is able to adaptively explore areas of potential failure in the subject model.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/gpt4o_vs_llama_subject.pdf}
\caption{
\textbf{Task Distribution for GPT-4o-as-Scientist with Two Different Subjects.}
We show 2D t-SNE embeddings of tasks generated by GPT-4o when evaluating itself
(\textcolor{Cerulean}{\textbf{blue}}) versus Llama3-8B
(\textcolor{Orange}{\textbf{orange}}).
Although these clusters share some overlap, Llama3-8B exhibits significantly higher failure rates on tasks requiring multi-step logic and more advanced reasoning.
Consequently, \ouralgo is able to adaptively probe the failure modes of weaker models.
}
\label{fig:llama_subject_embedding}
\end{figure}

\section{Examples of Discovered Tasks}
\label{appsec:task_examples}

This section contains an overview and selected tasks discovered by \ouralgo across various models. 
We found that the discovered tasks span a broad range of complexity, from basic text transformations to advanced domain-specific challenges such as cryptography, linguistics, and complex puzzle-solving. 
By carefully analyzing these tasks, we gain insight into under-recognized capabilities of LLMs and their potential blind spots.

As a reminder, all agents are evaluated using chain-of-thought as described in \Cref{appsubsec:evaluation_prompts}.
\emph{Note: Foundation model sampling is stochastic and reproductions will vary. Furthermore, the complete archive of discovered tasks for all our evaluation settings are available on our GitHub repository at \url{https://github.com/conglu1997/ACD/tree/main/results}, although only a representative subset is highlighted here.}

\subsection{Listing of Discovered Clusters}
\label{appsubsec:cluster_listings}

We present in Tables~\ref{tab:gpt4o_gpt4o_clusters}, \ref{tab:gpt4o_llama_clusters}, and \ref{tab:sonnet_gpt4o_clusters} the primary clusters discovered by \ouralgo\ for three different scientist–subject configurations:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2em]
    \item GPT-4o Scientist on GPT-4o Subject
    \item GPT-4o Scientist on Llama3-8B Subject
    \item Sonnet 3.5 Scientist on GPT-4o Subject
\end{enumerate}
Each table is sorted in descending order of the total number of tasks in that cluster, and we additionally report the cluster-wide automated FM-judge success rate of the subject model.

\subsection{Manual Selection of Surprising Tasks}
\label{appsubsec:manual_selection}

Although our system is capable of automatically generating and evaluating a vast number of tasks, identifying which of these tasks are genuinely ``surprising'' remains somewhat subjective. 
We initially experimented with two main more scalable approaches to filter for surprising tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Crowd-based filtration:} We asked crowd-sourced human participants from CloudResearch to mark which tasks they found surprising. However, we observed that around 37\% of tasks were marked as surprising, suggesting that even those who have used LLMs did not share a clear notion of what ``should'' be within an LLM's abilities. This broad labeling provided insufficient filtering for our goal of highlighting truly unexpected successes or failures.
\item \textbf{Model-based filtration:} We also attempted to ask the model itself to predict which tasks humans would consider surprising. These predictions did not consistently align with our perspectives. Sometimes the model flagged trivial successes as surprising, or conversely missed failure modes we found surprising.
\end{enumerate}

Given these challenges, we ultimately opted for a \emph{manual} curation step led by the authors.
While this approach is more labor-intensive and subjective, it allowed us to present a set of especially illustrative or counterintuitive results, which we believed would be of broad interest to the machine learning community.
In future work, we anticipate further improvements in automated or semi-automated approaches to better capture and quantify ``surprisingness.''
For each presented example, we did a web search to ensure that they were not trivially memorized from some popular training data.

\subsection{GPT-4o As Both Scientist and Subject}
\label{appsubsec:gpt4o_manual_selection}

In this configuration, GPT-4o both generates tasks (acting as the ``scientist'') and then attempts them (acting as the ``subject''), as reported in the main paper \Cref{subsec:gpt4_eval}. Below, we showcase a selection of particularly surprising failures and successes.

\subsubsection{Selected Failures}

\textbf{Instructions}:

You are tasked with creating a riddle based on a given scientific concept. The concept you need to create a riddle for is: gravity.

Provide your response in the following format:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Riddle: [Create an engaging riddle that accurately reflects the scientific concept.]

    \item Solution: Gravity

\textbf{Instructions}: 

Solve the following financial calculation problem based on the given scenario:\\

Calculate the monthly payment for a car loan. The loan amount is \$20,000, the annual interest rate is 5\%, and the loan term is 5 years. Use the formula: M = P[r(1+r)\^n]/[(1+r)\^n-1], where M is the monthly payment, P is the loan amount, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments. Note: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12. Example: For an annual rate of 5\%, the monthly rate is 0.05/12.\\

Submit your solution as a plain text string in the following format:\\

Solution: [Your solution]\\

\textbf{Llama3-8B's Response}:

To solve this problem, I will first convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate by dividing by 12. Then, I will use the formula to calculate the monthly payment.\\

The annual interest rate is 5\%, so the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.004167.\\

The loan term is 5 years, so the number of payments is 5 years x 12 months/year = 60 months.\\

Now, I can plug in the values into the formula:\\

M = P[r(1+r)\textasciicircum n]/[(1+r)\textasciicircum n-1]\\
M = 20000[0.004167(1+0.004167)\textasciicircum 60]/[(1+0.004167)\textasciicircum 60-1]\\
M = 20000[0.004167(1.004167)\textasciicircum 60]/[(1.004167)\textasciicircum 60-1]\\
M = 20000[0.004167(1.27631)]/[1.27631-1]\\
M = 20000[0.005293]/0.27631\\
M = 20000 * 0.0191\\
M = 382.00\\

Therefore, the monthly payment for the car loan is \$382.00.\\

Solution: \$382.00

\textbf{Llama3-8B's Response}:

Word Problem:\\
Tommy is a grocery store clerk. A customer, Mrs. Johnson, wants to buy some items for her party. She buys 12 boxes of cookies, each containing 8 cookies. She also buys 5 jars of sauce, and 15 boxes of crackers. However, during checkout, Tommy realizes that 3 jars of sauce are damaged and need to be returned. Additionally, Tommy finds that the store has a discount of \$2 on every 2 boxes of crackers. If a box of cookies costs \$3, a jar of sauce costs \$1.5, and a box of crackers costs \$4, how much will Mrs. Johnson pay in total after all the calculations?\\

Solution:\\
1. First, let's find the total cost of the cookies. There are 12 boxes of cookies, each containing 8 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 12 * 8 = 96.\\
2. The cost of each cookie is \$3, so the total cost of the cookies is 96 * \$3 = \$288.\\
3. Next, let's calculate the cost of the jars of sauce. Mrs. Johnson buys 5 jars, but 3 are damaged, so she has to return them. She is left with 5 - 3 = 2 jars.\\
4. The cost of each jar of sauce is \$1.5, so the total cost of the 2 jars of sauce is 2 * \$1.5 = \$3.\\
5. Now, let's find the total cost of the boxes of crackers. Mrs. Johnson buys 15 boxes, but there is a discount of \$2 on every 2 boxes. To find the number of pairs of crackers, we divide 15 by 2, which gives us 7.5 pairs. Since we can't have half a pair, we round down to 7 pairs of crackers with 1 box left over.\\
6. The cost of each pair of crackers is \$2 (half the cost of a box), so the total discount is 7 * \$2 = \$14.\\
7. The total cost of the boxes of crackers is 15 * \$4 = \$60, and after the discount, it is \$60 - \$14 = \$46.\\
8. Now, let's find the total cost of the items. The cost of the cookies is \$288, the cost of the 2 jars of sauce is \$3, and the cost of the boxes of crackers is \$46. The total cost is \$288 + \$3 + \$46 = \$337.\\
9. Finally, let's find the total amount Mrs. Johnson will pay. The total cost is \$337, and since there are no other discounts or taxes, the total amount she will pay is \$337.

Answer: [Your answer]\\

\textbf{Llama3-8B's Response}:

To solve this puzzle, I will use a step-by-step approach to gather information and eliminate possibilities.\\

From clue 9, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house. Since the Norwegian lives next to the blue house (clue 14), the blue house must be either the second or the fifth house. But from clue 8, we know the center house drinks milk, so the Norwegian lives in the first house, and the blue house must be the fifth house.\\

From clue 4, the green house is to the left of the white house, so the green house is the second house, and the white house is the third house.\\

From clue 7, the owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill. Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, the yellow house must be the fourth house.\\

From clue 10, the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats. Since the green house is the second house, the man who smokes blends must live in the third house, and the man who keeps cats must live in the fourth house.\\

From clue 11, the man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. Since the yellow house is the fourth house, the man who keeps horses must live in the fifth house.\\

From clue 1, the Brit lives in the red house. Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, the red house must be the fifth house, and the Brit lives in the fifth house.\\

From clue 2, the Swede keeps dogs as pets. Since the green house is the second house, the Swede lives in the second house.\\

From clue 3, the Dane drinks tea. Since the center house drinks milk (clue 8), the Dane must live in the third house.\\

From clue 6, the person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds. Since the Norwegian lives in the first house, the person who smokes Pall Mall must live in the second house, but the Swede lives in the second house, so the person who smokes Pall Mall must live in the first house, but the Norwegian lives in the first house, so the person who smokes Pall Mall must live in the second house, but the Swede lives in the second house, so the person who smokes Pall Mall must live in the first house, but the Norwegian lives in the first house, \emph{\textbf{[repeats...]}}, so the person who smokes Pall Mall...

Puzzle: SEND + MORE = MONEY\\

Submit your solution in the following format:\\

A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 5, F = 6\\

\textbf{Llama3-8B's Response}:

To solve this cryptarithm puzzle, we'll break it down step by step.\\

1.  We know that the rightmost column of the addition should have a carry if the sum of the last two digits exceeds 9. In this case, 'Y' + 'E' + 'C' + any carry should end in 'Y', which means 'Y' must be 0 or the only possibility is 9 + 8 + 5 = 22 and 'Y' being in the 'ones' place would require the carry from the next column to be 1. ...

Hence we get O + 9 + any carry = 1 in the second last column which gives O + any carry = -8 which is not possible.\\

Now we know that D + 9 + any carry = 8 in the first column, and we also know that carry in the first column is discarded for the same reason as before, so any carry in the second column must be 9 (because D + 9 + 9 = 18 and 8 = 18 - 10).\\

Hence we get D + 9 = -1 which is not possible.\\

Hence we get D + 9 = -1 which is not possible. \emph{\textbf{[repeats...]}}\\

E1 = (0, 0, 0, 0) - Trivial equilibrium, likely unstable.\\
E2 = (x1\*, 0, 0, 0) - No algae, fish, or predators.\\
E3 = (x1\*, x2\*, 0, 0) - No fish or predators.\\
E4 = (x1\*, x2\*, x3\*, 0) - No predators.\\
E5 = (x1\*, x2\*, x3\*, x4\*) - Non-trivial equilibrium with all species present.\\
Stability of E5 can be analyzed using the Jacobian matrix; if all eigenvalues of the Jacobian at E5 have negative real parts, the equilibrium is stable.\\

Predicted Response to Change:\\
Introducing a new predator species (e.g., x5) adds terms to equations for x4 and introduces dx5/dt. This could destabilize the current equilibrium or shift it to a new state. Climate change reducing crystal light output decreases r2, reducing algae population (x2), subsequently impacting fish (x3) and predator (x4) populations, potentially leading to ecosystem collapse if severe.

\textbf{GPT-4o's Response}:

1. Language Structure\\

a) Primary Mode of Communication\\
The primary mode of communication for the Chromavores species is through manipulating and perceiving quantum states of particles, particularly focusing on the spin states of electrons and photons. These quantum states can be altered and detected with high precision, allowing for complex information to be exchanged rapidly.\\

b) Information Encoding and Transmission\\
Information is encoded in the spin states of particles. For instance, different spin states correspond to different phonemes or morphemes. Changes in spin state can be detected by other Chromavores, who can "read" these changes through their advanced sensory organs. These alterations are akin to binary code in human digital communication but far more sophisticated, allowing for the encoding of complex linguistic structures.\\

c) Adapting to Environmental Challenges\\
Given the constant electromagnetic fluctuations on their gaseous planet, the language incorporates redundancy and error-correcting codes. For instance, critical information is often repeated in different quantum states (e.g., using both electrons and photons) to ensure the message is received correctly despite environmental noise.\\

2. Specific Aspects\\

a) Communicating Emotional States\\
Emotional states are communicated through variations in sound frequency and amplitude modulation. Higher frequencies and amplitudes might convey excitement or urgency, while lower frequencies and softer amplitudes could express calmness or sadness. Each emotion has a distinct signature pattern that can be recognized by other Chromavores.\\

b) Expressing Abstract Concepts\\
Abstract concepts are expressed using quantum-related metaphors. For example:\\
- Beauty might be described as a "harmonic resonance" where different particles align in a visually pleasing pattern.\\
- Justice could be referred to as "quantum equilibrium" where all particles exist in a balanced and fair state.\\

3. Examples of Expressing Concepts\\

a) Time\\
Time is expressed as a sequence of quantum state transitions. For example, a series of spin state changes might represent past, present, and future. A simple representation might be:\\
- Past: Spin state 1\\
- Present: Spin state 2\\
- Future: Spin state 3\\

b) Quantity\\
Quantity is encoded through the number of simultaneous quantum state alterations. For instance:\\
- One: Single spin state shift\\
- Two: Dual spin state shift\\
- Many: Multiple (3+) spin state shifts\\

c) Relationship\\
Relationships are depicted through spatial and contextual arrangements of quantum states. For example:\\
- Familial: Spin states that are entangled, representing a close, inseparable bond.\\
- Social: Spin states that are in proximity but not entangled, indicating social interactions.\\
- Spatial: Relative positions of particles, with closer particles indicating closer physical or conceptual relationships.\\

4. Sample Communication Unit\\

A sample 'sentence' in this language might be:\\
"Spin1-Spin2-PhotonShift-FrequencyModulation"\\

Explanation:\\
- "Spin1-Spin2" represents a temporal transition, indicating movement from past to present.\\
- "PhotonShift" encodes a specific piece of information, such as a noun or verb.\\
- "FrequencyModulation" adds emotional context, perhaps indicating excitement or urgency.\\

Meaning: "We are moving towards an exciting event."\\

5. Challenges for Humans\\

- Sensory Limitations: Humans lack the ability to perceive and manipulate quantum states directly, making it extremely challenging to both produce and understand the language.\\
- Complexity: The language's reliance on quantum states and electromagnetic modulation is far more complex than human phonetic and written systems.\\
- Environmental Sensitivity: The constant electromagnetic fluctuations would require specialized equipment for humans to even attempt communication in this environment.\\
- Abstract Metaphors: The use of quantum metaphors for abstract concepts may be difficult for humans to grasp, as these metaphors are deeply rooted in the Chromavores' unique perception of reality.\\

Despite these challenges, with advanced technology and a deep understanding of quantum mechanics, it might be possible for humans to develop interfaces that could aid in learning or translating this language.

\section{Example Failures of the Automated Judge}
\label{sec:judge_failures}

As discussed in \Cref{subsec:gpt4_eval}, the automated judge has some failure rate.
We show two examples of incorrectly judged tasks here.
In both cases, the automated judge judges the task to have failed, whilst in fact, the task succeeded.
This can sometimes occur due to non-robust parsing of subject model responses.

\section{Human Surveying Details}
\label{appsec:human_survey}

We present the script we use to perform a human evaluation of automated LLM judgments used in \ouralgo (\Cref{subsec:gpt4_eval}).
We use the CloudResearch~\citep{cloudresearch} platform and specifically target participants who have experience with using large language models such as ChatGPT.
The survey takes the form of a simple, anonymous data labeling task.
We show an example from a generated task that asks an LLM to write a short story.
In general, the task details, instructions, and LLM response will change per task.
Participants were given up to two minutes per task and paid \$0.25 USD for each task.
The average pay was \$15.79 USD per hour, with the final survey completion times.
The total cost of surveying including service fees was \$329.25.
