A gentle introduction is provided on common statistical and machine learning methods for imputation. We discuss the main strengths and weaknesses of each method, and compare their performance in a literature review. We motivate why the imputation of RWD may require additional efforts to avoid bias, and highlight recent advances that account for informative missingness and repeated observations. Finally, we introduce alternative methods to address incomplete data without the need for imputation.},

            Process event data is a fundamental building block for process mining as event logs portray the execution trails of business processes from which knowledge and insights can be extracted. In this Chapter, we discuss the core structure of event logs, in particular the three main requirements in the form of the presence of case IDs, activity labels, and timestamps. Moreover, we introduce fundamental concepts of event log processing and preparation, including data sources, extraction, correlation and abstraction techniques. The chapter is concluded with an imperative section on data quality, arguably the most important determinant of process mining project success.},

	abstract = {Process Mining allows organizations to obtain actual business process models from event logs (discovery), to compare the event log or the resulting process model in the discovery task with the existing reference model of the same process (conformance), and to detect issues in the executed process to improve (enhancement). An essential element in the three tasks of process mining (discovery, conformance, and enhancement) is data cleaning, used to reduce the complexity inherent to real-world event data, to be easily interpreted, manipulated, and processed in process mining tasks. Thus, new techniques and algorithms for event data preprocessing have been of interest in the research community in business process. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review and provide, for the ﬁrst time, a survey of relevant approaches of event data preprocessing for business process mining tasks. The aim of this work is to construct a categorization of techniques or methods related to event data preprocessing and to identify relevant challenges around these techniques. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the most popular techniques for event log preprocessing. We also study and present ﬁndings about how a preprocessing technique can improve a process mining task. We also discuss the emerging future challenges in the domain of data preprocessing, in the context of process mining. The results of this study reveal that the preprocessing techniques in process mining have demonstrated a high impact on the performance of the process mining tasks. The data cleaning requirements are dependent on the characteristics of the event logs (voluminous, a high variability in the set of traces size, changes in the duration of the activities. In this scenario, most of the surveyed works use more than a single preprocessing technique to improve the quality of the event log. Trace-clustering and trace/event level ﬁltering resulted in being the most commonly used preprocessing techniques due to easy of implementation, and they adequately manage noise and incompleteness in the event logs.},

In response to this demand, automated machine learning (autoML) researchers have begun building systems that automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this paper we present TPOT, an open source genetic programming-based autoML system that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification task. We benchmark TPOT on a series of 150 supervised classification tasks and find that it significantly outperforms a basic machine learning analysis in 22 of them, while experiencing minimal degradation in accuracy on 5 of the benchmarks—all without any domain knowledge nor human input. As such, GP-based autoML systems show considerable promise in the autoML domain.}
