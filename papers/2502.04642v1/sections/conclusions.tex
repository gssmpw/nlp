\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented a control framework for incentive hierarchical MPCs with multiple LoMPCs.
We defined team-optimal solutions and incentive controllability for the incentive hierarchical MPC.
We defined the dual of the incentive LoMPC cost function and, using tools from convex analysis, established a connection between the minima of the dual function and the set of optimal incentives.
We showed that, under some assumptions, the hierarchical MPC problem with a linear-convex incentive structure is incentive controllable, and the optimal incentives can be computed iteratively.
We also proved that, for the case of multiple LoMPCs, the team-optimal solution can be attained up to an error bound and provided an algorithm for computing optimal incentives.
Notably, the proposed algorithm scales well with the number of LoMPCs and does not require knowing the LoMPC cost function.
Finally, we considered dynamic electricity price control for large-scale EV charging.
We used our algorithm to show that an ISO can set the electricity prices to approximately minimize a social cost while also guaranteeing constraint satisfaction.
Our BiMPC formulation resulted in an electricity consumption pattern that fills the overnight demand valley.
