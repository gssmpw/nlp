\section*{Limitations}

We observe the following limitations of this work:

\paragraph{Domain scalability}
Although {\langname} can generate a variety of domain-specific datasets, the experiments in this paper are confined to evaluating its effectiveness in improving math reasoning capabilities. Further extensions to other domains are subject to future work.

\paragraph{Aligned model restriction}
{\langname} is designed for aligned chat models. In this paper, we did not investigate whether the same approach can be used to generate high-quality, domain-specific data for base models without instruction tuning.

% \paragraph{Experiment setups}
% Due to computational resource constraints, the model parameters used in this paper are limited to 8B. Whether {\langname} is equally applicable to models with larger parameters remains to be verified in future work.


% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Although {\langname} can generate a variety of domain-specific datasets, the experiments in this paper are limited to evaluating its effectiveness in improving math reasoning capabilities. Further exploration is needed to assess its applicability to other domains.;
%     \item {\langname} is designed for alignment models, meaning it can only be applied in the post-training phase. In this paper, we did not investigate whether the same approach can be used to generate high-quality, domain-specific data for base models before alignment;
%     \item Our experiments do not explore the iterative use of {\langname}, where a trained model could generate additional data for further training. Future work could investigate the potential benefits of such an iterative process for continual self-improvement.
