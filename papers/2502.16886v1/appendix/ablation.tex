\section{Ablation}
\label{app:ablation}
In this section, we present additional ablation study results. By setting various values for $k$, we expand upon the results shown in Table~\ref{ablation}. The expanded results are displayed in Table~\ref{extend_ablation}. These experiments facilitate a deeper understanding of how different parameter settings impact model performance and provide a basis for optimizing parameter selection.

As shown in Table~\ref{extend_ablation}, setting $k=1$ not only conserves pruning time but also achieves better model performance with a reduced budget.
