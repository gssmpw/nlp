abstract = {We examine the use of modern recommender system technology to aid command awareness in complex software applications. We first describe our adaptation of traditional recommender system algorithms to meet the unique requirements presented by the domain of software commands. A user study showed that our item-based collaborative filtering algorithm generates 2.1 times as many good suggestions as existing techniques. Motivated by these positive results, we propose a design space framework and its associated algorithms to support both global and contextual recommendations. To evaluate the algorithms, we developed the CommunityCommands plug-in for AutoCAD. This plug-in enabled us to perform a 6-week user study of real-time, within-application command recommendations in actual working environments. We report and visualize command usage behaviors during the study, and discuss how the recommendations affected users behaviors. In particular, we found that the plug-in successfully exposed users to new commands, as unique commands issued significantly increased.},

abstract = {Modeling users' dynamic preferences from their historical behaviors is challenging and crucial for recommendation systems. Previous methods employ sequential neural networks to encode users' historical interactions from left to right into hidden representations for making recommendations. Despite their effectiveness, we argue that such left-to-right unidirectional models are sub-optimal due to the limitations including: begin enumerate* [label=seriesitshapealph*upshape)] item unidirectional architectures restrict the power of hidden representation in users' behavior sequences; item they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not always practical. end enumerate* To address these limitations, we proposed a sequential recommendation model called BERT4Rec, which employs the deep bidirectional self-attention to model user behavior sequences. To avoid the information leakage and efficiently train the bidirectional model, we adopt the Cloze objective to sequential recommendation, predicting the random masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and right context. In this way, we learn a bidirectional representation model to make recommendations by allowing each item in user historical behaviors to fuse information from both left and right sides. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.},

abstract = {In sparse recommender settings, users’ context and item attributes play a crucial role in deciding which items to recommend next. Despite that, recent works in sequential and time-aware recommendations usually either ignore both aspects or only consider one of them, limiting their predictive performance. In this paper, we address these limitations by proposing a context and attribute-aware recommender model (CARCA) that can capture the dynamic nature of the user profiles in terms of contextual features and item attributes via dedicated multi-head self-attention blocks that extract profile-level features and predict item scores. Also, unlike many of the current state-of-the-art sequential item recommendation approaches that use a simple dot-product between the most recent item’s latent features and the target items embeddings for scoring, CARCA uses cross-attention between all profile items and the target items to predict their final scores. This cross-attention allows CARCA to harness the correlation between old and recent items in the user profile and their influence on deciding which item to recommend next. Experiments on four real-world recommender system datasets show that the proposed model significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art models in the task of item recommendation and achieving improvements of up to 53\% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Hit-Ratio. Results also show that CARCA outperformed several state-of-the-art dedicated image-based recommender systems by merely utilizing image attributes extracted from a pre-trained ResNet50 in a black-box fashion.},

As the by-product, 3D modeling event logs could provide quantitative and traceable data for early design stages that can produce butterfly-effect on the later construction stages. In this study, new data structure of command-object graph retrieved from 3D modeling event logs was proposed. It reflects the cause-and-effect relationship between commands and objects to accommodate 3D modeling process. A case study was conducted on 110 students' event logs generated from solving a well-defined façade model. As result: an average trial-and-error ratio was calculated at 0.3357 based on original and simplified graphs. Four main types of ‘modeling bubble’ were summarized base on unit-tag graphs. Key commands were found by graph centrality. Auto-prediction of same-group objects was developed with mis-group rate less than 0.9%.}

On this issue, methods for data preprocessing, predictive model training and model evaluation are three primary questions to answer. In this study, a data augmentation method is developed to prepare high quality data input for 3D modeling event logs. A standard Transformer model is trained with the augmented data as input. Six predictive models on three different input data are compared for evaluating the method. In this case, the most accurate of the six models is Transformer with 94% accuracy on top one command prediction. As results, the data augmentation method proposed in this study improves the accuracy of the predictive models up to 1.75 times. Intelligent CAD tool for command prediction with high accuracy during 3D modeling design can be further developed.}

First, through a critical review of previous studies, 19 different ways of using BIM logs were identified, including authoring and collaborative pattern discovery, authoring process modeling, collaboration pattern analysis, command predictions, and team optimization; however, most of the uses concerned process discovery. The analysis also revealed that BIM log mining has mainly been used for the design phase, with a few examples of being used for the construction phase. For BIM log mining, various techniques ranging from simple frequency analyses via social network analyses to advanced pattern discovery were deployed. In terms of BIM log sources, native BIM logs from Revit were dominantly used almost in all studies, aside from a few studies that used custom-developed BIM logs. The content analysis of BIM logs showed that the contents of native BIM logs provided by major BIM authoring tools varied, but commonly lacked model-element-specific information; this limitation prevents in-depth analyses of BIM processes. Overall, the current disproportionate focus on process discovery in the design phase of BIM log mining suggests that the application of BIM log mining is still in its early stages and holds significant potential for other project phases if adding model-element-specific information is incorporated.}

abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Real-time collection and log mining are integrated to collect raw data related to design behaviors. Feature engineering and various machine learning models are then utilized for quantitative modeling and interpretation. Results confirm a clear quantifiable relationship between behaviors and quality which can be learned by various models. The best model using Extremely Random Trees achieved an R2 value of 0.88 on the test set. Behavioral features related to designer's skill level and changes of design intentions are identified as having significant impacts on design quality.

abstract = {A clustering-based building information modeling (BIM) log mining method is developed in this research to provide a data-driven knowledge discovery about the design productivity characteristics from a huge amount of BIM design log data. Since design behaviors are non-deterministic and subjective, a novel clustering algorithm named efficient fuzzy Kohonen clustering network (EFKCN) is utilized to produce informative clusters of different features. First, datasets are pulled out from the raw design logs and transformed into understandable forms for computers. Then, EFKCN clustering algorithm is performed in datasets at both individual and team level. Finally, analysis and prediction methods, like time analysis, regression and others, will further investigate the extracted clusters, which help managers to figure out the design preference and productivity of different designers. A case study is conducted in the real BIM design logs from an international architecture design firm with 853,520 records to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. From a view of individuals, the personal design behaviors hidden in different clusters are served to arrange proper design work rationally during particular time periods. From a team perspective, the design productivity of different designers can be approximately evaluated as high, medium, and low levels in an objective and efficient manner. In the comparison of EFKCN with other popular clustering methods, EFKCN takes less time and iterations to complete the clustering process, and its clustering results achieve great compactness and separation according to the value of cluster validity indices (CVIs). Hence, this research contributes to performing the novel clustering-based BIM log mining, which acts as a powerful decision-making tool in evaluating design productivity and drawing up personalized work arrangements for a more efficient modeling process.}

During the BIM implementation, a large number of event logs are automatically generated and accumulated to record details of the model evolution. For knowledge discovery from huge logs, a novel BIM event log mining approach based on the dynamic social network analysis is presented to examine designers’ performance objectively, which has been verified in BIM event logs about an ongoing year-long design project. Relying on meaningful information extracted from time-stamped logs, networks on the monthly interval are built to graphically represent information and knowledge sharing among designers. Special emphasis is put on measuring designers’ influence by a defined new metric called “impact score”, which combines the k-shell method and 1-step neighbors to achieve comparatively low computational cost and high accurate ranking. Besides, an emerging machine learning algorithm named CatBoost is utilized to predict designers’ influence intelligently by learning features from both network structure and human behavior. It has been found that twelve networks can be easily distinguished into two collaborative patterns, whose characteristics in both network structures and designers’ behaviors are significantly different. The most influential designers are similar within the same group but varied from different groups. Extensive analytical results confirm that the method can potentially serve as month-by-month feedback to monitor the complex modeling process, which further supports managers to realize data-driven decision making for better leadership and work plan towards an optimized collaborative design.}

abstract = {Building information modeling is instrumental in documenting design, enhancing customer experience, and improving product functionality in capital projects. However, good building models do not happen by accident, but rather as a result of a managed process that involves several participants from different disciplines and backgrounds. Effective management of this process requires an ability to closely monitor the modeling process and correctly measure modelers' performance. Nevertheless, existing methods of performance monitoring in building design practices lack an objective measurement system to quantify modeling progress. The widespread utilization of Building Information Modeling (BIM) tools presents a unique opportunity to retrieve granular design process data and conduct accurate performance measurements. As a building's 3D model is gradually developed, model generation software packages, such as Autodesk Revit, automatically create log files that record design activities. This paper investigates what information these log files contain and how one can extract and further analyze the information to provide insight into the design modeling process. The specific objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the presence of implicit patterns in 3-D design log files; and (2) to empirically characterize the performance of modelers based on the time it takes them to execute similar modeling tasks. To fulfill these objectives, design log files provided by an international architecture and design firm were analyzed. Using a tailored text file parser, user-model interaction data including modeler characteristics, command type, and command time were extracted from the journal files. To identify implicit command execution patterns, a sequence mining algorithm based on Generalized Suffix Trees (GST) was implemented. It was shown that there is a statistically significant difference between the average time it takes modelers to execute each command sequence. This study extends the existing knowledge by proposing a novel methodology to extract meaningful patterns from time-stamped unstructured design log data. This research contributes to the state of practice by providing a better understanding of information embedded in design log files.}

Firstly, a data extraction procedure consisting of data harvesting, parsing, and cleaning is proposed to obtain BIM design logs in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format from several designers over the course of working on multiple projects. Secondly, a metric of working together on joint cases is proposed to build up a weighted sociogram that is consisting of performers P, relations R, and weights W. Lastly, a number of indicators are defined to measure and analyze structural characteristics of the discovered BIM-based collaborative network at macro-, meso-, and micro- levels. A dataset of design logs that involves 51 designers working on 82 projects with 620,492 lines of commands, provided by a major international design firm, is used as a case study to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed approach in this research. Results indicate that: (i) Strong positive correlations exist across all centrality measures calculated based on the discovered social network of BIM-based collaborative design where designers located in the center of the interaction map (with the greatest degree centralities), such as designers “#2” and “#24”, are generally those who provide the shortest communication channels (with highest betweenness centralities) and are most reachable for others (with highest closeness centralities); and (ii) All the node centrality measures are significantly and positively related to the production performance of designers in the BIM-based collaborative network. Particularly, the measured node degree centrality by weight is capable of explaining the greatest percentage of variations (71.13%) in the production performance of designers. This research contributes to: (a) The state of knowledge by proposing a novel methodology that is capable of capturing and modeling collaborations among designers from tremendous event logs to discover social networks; and (b) The state of practice by providing insight into a better understanding of relationships between sociological network characteristics and production performance of designers within a design firm.}

abstract = {This paper develops a framework to learn and predict design commands based upon building information modeling (BIM) event log data stored in Autodesk Revit journal files, which has the potential to improve the modeling efficiency. BIM design logs, which automatically keep detailed records on the modeling process, are the basis of data acquisition and data mining. Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM NN), as a probabilistic deep learning model for learning sequential data with varying lengths from logs, is established to provide designers with predictions about the possible design command class in the next step. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, a case study runs at large design logs over 4 GB from an international design firm for command class prediction. To begin with, useful data retrieved from logs is cleaned and saved in a 320 MB Comma Separated Values (CSV) file with totally 352,056 lines of commands over 289 projects. Subsequently, various design commands are categorized into 14 classes according to their effects and given numerical labels, which are then fed into LSTM NN for training and testing. As a result, the overall accuracy of this particular case study can reach 70.5% in the test set, which outperforms some classical machine learning methods, like k nearest neighbor, random forest and support vector machine. This research contributes to applying a probabilistic LSTM NN with optimal parameters to learn features from designers' subjective behaviors effectively and predict the next possible design command class intelligently towards automation of the design process. Moreover, the three most possible command classes will be offered as the recommendations under the assumption that the correct class tends to appear owning the top three highest probabilities, which can possibly enhance the reliability of predictions.}

abstract = {Much of the recent progress in sequential and session-based recommendation has been driven by improvements in model architecture and pretraining techniques originating in the field of Natural Language Processing. Transformer architectures in particular have facilitated building higher-capacity models and provided data augmentation and training techniques which demonstrably improve the effectiveness of sequential recommendation. But with a thousandfold more research going on in NLP, the application of transformers for recommendation understandably lags behind. To remedy this we introduce Transformers4Rec, an open-source library built upon HuggingFace’s Transformers library with a similar goal of opening up the advances of NLP based Transformers to the recommender system community and making these advancements immediately accessible for the tasks of sequential and session-based recommendation. Like its core dependency, Transformers4Rec is designed to be extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in industrial deployments. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the library and the applicability of Transformer architectures in next-click prediction for user sessions, where sequence lengths are much shorter than those commonly found in NLP, we have leveraged Transformers4Rec to win two recent session-based recommendation competitions. In addition, we present in this paper the first comprehensive empirical analysis comparing many Transformer architectures and training approaches for the task of session-based recommendation. We demonstrate that the best Transformer architectures have superior performance across two e-commerce datasets while performing similarly to the baselines on two news datasets. We further evaluate in isolation the effectiveness of the different training techniques used in causal language modeling, masked language modeling, permutation language modeling and replacement token detection for a single Transformer architecture, XLNet. We establish that training XLNet with replacement token detection performs well across all datasets. Finally, we explore techniques to include side information such as item and user context features in order to establish best practices and show that the inclusion of side information uniformly improves recommendation performance.

abstract = {With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment setting, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},
