\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce a novel modularized skill learning framework, \name, which decouples complex full-body skills into compositional, modular skills for independent body parts. The framework incorporates a Skill Modularization Attention layer that transforms policy observations into modular skill embeddings, guiding independent low-level controllers for each body part. Additionally, our Active Skill Learning approach with Generative Adaptive Sampling utilizes large motion generation models to adaptively enhance policy learning in challenging tracking scenarios. Our results demonstrate that this modularized framework, enhanced by generative sampling, outperforms existing methods in achieving precise full-body motion tracking and enables reusable skill embeddings for diverse, goal-driven tasks.\\

\noindent \textbf{Limitations.} While modularized skill learning offers advantages in creating compact, compositional skill spaces, it introduces an inherent tradeoff in search complexity due to the formulation of multiple modular components. Future work could explore methods for improving the efficiency of modular skill composition. Additionally, incorporating environment-aware interaction priors would be a promising direction for extending the framework to interaction tasks.
