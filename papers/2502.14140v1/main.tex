% It is strongly recommended to use hyperref, especially for the review version.
% hyperref with option pagebackref eases the reviewers' job.
% Please disable hyperref *only* if you encounter grave issues, 
% e.g. with the file validation for the camera-ready version.
%
% If you comment hyperref and then uncomment it, you should delete *.aux before re-running LaTeX.
% (Or just hit 'q' on the first LaTeX run, let it finish, and you should be clear).

    \captionof{figure}{We propose a modularized skill learning framework, \name, that decouples full-body motion into skill embeddings for controlling individual body parts. Learned from large-scale motion datasets, these modular skills can be combined to control a simulated character to perform diverse motions, such as the Usain Bolt pose, and seamlessly reused for various downstream tasks.}
