\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has proposed a physics-based hardware model and several signal models for the emerging PASS technology, serving as a valuable reference for future research. Two efficient optimization algorithms were proposed to tackle the joint transmit and pinching beamforming optimization problem in downlink multi-user PASS. Numerical results demonstrated the significant advantages of PASS in reducing transmit power compared to conventional wireless systems.

However, several key challenges remain unresolved. For instance, the proposed physics model has been applied only to the downlink scenario, whereas modeling for uplink scenarios may be more complex and requires further investigation. Additionally, this study considered the simplest transmit beamforming architecture, where each waveguide is connected to a single RF chain. Exploring hybrid analog-digital beamforming architectures with pinching beamforming, which support fully connected configurations and a flexible number of RF chains, is another promising direction for future research.
