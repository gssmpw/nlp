In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare RAG and GraphRAG on general text-based tasks. Our analysis reveals the distinct strengths of RAG and GraphRAG in QA and query-based summarization, as well as evaluation challenges in summarization tasks, providing valuable insights for future research. Building on these findings, we propose two strategies to enhance QA performance. Future work can explore improving GraphRAG through better graph construction or developing novel approaches to combine RAG and GraphRAG methods for both effectiveness and efficiency.
