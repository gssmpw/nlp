In this paper, we evaluate and compare RAG and GraphRAG on Question Answering and Query-based Summarization tasks. Future work can extend this study to additional tasks to further assess the strengths and  applicability of GraphRAG. Additionally, the graph construction in all GraphRAG methods explored in this work relies on LLM-based construction, where LLMs extract entities and relations. However, other graph construction models designed for text processing exist and can be investigated in future studies. Finally, we primarily evaluate generation performance using Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct and Llama 3.1-70B-Instruct. Future research can explore other generation models for a more comprehensive comparison.
