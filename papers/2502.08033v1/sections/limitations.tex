\section{Limitations}

Although our proposed method significantly improves the efficiency of generating human-like trajectories through consistency models and joint prediction and planning, it may not yet meet the demands of real-time operation, especially in highly dynamic environments that require high-frequency planning.
Future work could leverage model pruning or distillation techniques to further improve the inference efficiency.
Besides, while in the current paper, we test open-loop trajectory generation to focus on evaluating the model performance of a single inference step, in the future we will extend our method to the closed-loop case with a receding horizon fashion,  which is expected to further enhance the interactive planning.
