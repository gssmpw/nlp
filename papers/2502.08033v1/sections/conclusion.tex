\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach that unifies trajectory prediction and planning using consistency models. 
By modeling the joint distribution of ego and surrounding agents' trajectories, our method enables efficient and interactive planning, such as proactive nudging and yielding, without the need for iterative alternation between prediction and planning modules. 
Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the proposed consistency model generates human-like trajectories while its guided sampling capability naturally incorporates additional planning constraints during online trajectory generations.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior trajectory quality and interactive behavior compared to existing methods while requiring fewer sampling steps.
This framework also has the potential to be extended to broader robot decision-making tasks in interactive scenarios.

Looking forward, we aim to optimize this method for real-time operation and extend it to closed-loop operation with receding horizon planning.
Additionally, we plan to incorporate LLMs as high-level planners to interpret diverse contextual information and enhance decision-making in challenging scenarios.
