% \usepackage{cvpr}              % To produce the CAMERA-READY version
% \usepackage[review]{cvpr}      % To produce the REVIEW version
\usepackage[pagenumbers]{cvpr} % To force page numbers, e.g. for an arXiv version

% Import additional packages in the preamble file, before hyperref


% It is strongly recommended to use hyperref, especially for the review version.
% hyperref with option pagebackref eases the reviewers' job.
% Please disable hyperref *only* if you encounter grave issues, 
% e.g. with the file validation for the camera-ready version.
%
% If you comment hyperref and then uncomment it, you should delete *.aux before re-running LaTeX.
% (Or just hit 'q' on the first LaTeX run, let it finish, and you should be clear).

    % \textbf{4Deform} trains on a collection of shapes and learns realistic deformations. Starting from just a pair of frames and noisy correspondence estimation, we obtain realistic long interpolation where shapes change their topology (\eg, the human-object interaction from \textbf{BEHAVE}~\cite{bhatnagar22behave}, top two rows), even in the presence of partiality (\eg, the horse), or non-isometric deformation (\eg cougar to hippo), or with correspondence do not spatially align with the input data (\eg, the clothed human from \textbf{4DDRESS}~\cite{wang20244ddress}, lower right row).
    \textbf{4Deform} takes a sparse temporal sequence of point clouds as input
    % \fb{temporal sequence of 3D shapes? [we need to consistently use this throughout the paper]; just spoke to dongliang; it seems the main task is to produce realistic intermediate shapes between a soruce and target shape? if that is the case, this should be the focus of the teaser} 
    and generates realistic intermediate shapes. Starting from just pairs of point clouds and estimated sparse, noisy correspondences (indicated using colors in the point clouds),
    % \fb{where? add a label `noisy correspondence estimation' to the figure?})
    our method obtains realistic long-range interpolations, even for shapes with changing topology (\eg, the human-object interaction in the top row), and can generalize the interpolation results to real-world data (Kinect point clouds in the second row). Meanwhile, our method can handle non-isometrically deformed shapes (bottom left)  as well as partial shapes (bottom right).

    % \fb{fontsizes should be the same within the figure}
    % \fb{visually the teaser looks very nice. However, it is hard to understand what one should look at; there are 5 different shape types. maybe it'd be better to reduce this and introduce a clearer layour (eg using (a), (b), (c) to label subparts, and then in the caption refer to these)}
