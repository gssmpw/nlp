\subsection{Classical 3D Reconstruction}
Lidars and cameras are the two main modalities used in robotic perception and specifically for 3D reconstruction. In this section, we review classical lidar-based and vision-based reconstruction methods. For each sensor modality, trajectory estimation is a typical first step in a reconstruction pipeline. Then, we review strategies for extending these methods to large-scale scenes.

Lidar is the dominant sensor used for accurate 3D reconstruction of large-scale environments **Newcombe et al., "DynamicFusion"**. It actively transmits laser pulses to measure ranges and as a result is accurate up to ranges of as much 100m. With these distance measurements, Lidar odometry typically uses a variant of Iterative Closest Point (ICP), and often integrates high-frequency IMU measurements **Cadena et al., "One-Shot Extrapolation"**. Small errors in odometry can accumulate over time resulting in trajectory drift. This drift can be mitigated when a sensor revisits a previous place and detects loop closure with pose graph optimisation, which allows a consistent map to be maintained.
After registering all the lidar scans, the (surface) reconstruction problem is then to fuse discrete observations into a map. %\todo{check supereight}
Example map representations include surfels **Hall et al., "Surfel-based Surface Reconstruction"**; voxels **Curless et al., "A Volumetric Method for Building Complex Models from Range Images"** and wavelets **Bajla et al., "Wavelet Decomposition of 3D Shape Representations"**. 
% (which can model occupancy or Signed Distance Function (SDF)), and 

Despite its advantages, lidar has its own limitations. Lidar is much more expensive than cameras, while the measurements are typically much sparser than camera images. The measurements have inherent noise with ranging errors in the order of centimetres, which makes it difficult to reconstruct small objects accurately in indoor scenes. Finally, lidar data contains no texture or colour, so the final reconstruction is only geometric and cannot be used for applications such as view synthesis, which requires texture.

Alternatively, large-scale textured reconstructions can be recovered from camera images alone via SfM. Given the correspondences between images, a SfM system **Lowe et al., "SIFT: An Information-Integrated System for Image Matching and Object Recognition"** can optimise a set of camera poses, camera intrinsics, and 3D sparse feature points. This can then be used by a MVS system **Furukawa et al., "Accurate, Dense, and Robust Multiview Stereopsis"** to compute dense depth for each frame and in turn to create a dense 3D point cloud. Compared to lidar, cameras are much more affordable, and also provide texture and colour. However, the performance of visual reconstruction method depends on environmental conditions, and the quality of feature matching. This makes the resultant reconstruction less reliable in scenes that contain repetitive patterns, low-texture surfaces, dynamic objects, poor lighting conditions and non-Lambertian materials.

%Urban Radiance Fields proposes using lidar sweeps along with RGB images to optimise a neural radiance field model that can be used for 3D surface extraction.

%Our work shares this approach, fusing both sensor modalities to generate precise geometry, overcoming limitations of vision-only approaches in low-texture areas, and being much denser than lidar-only reconstructions.

% \subsection{Large-scale Reconstruction}
When the scene to be reconstructed is large-scale (e.g., urban districts or multi-room indoor environments),  computer memory becomes a limiting factor. Attempting to map a large scene while constraining output map size will result in a lower resolution reconstruction, which results in a map that lacks detail. A common strategy to extend dense reconstructions to large-scale areas is to divide the scene into submaps **Menzel et al., "Segmentation of Large 3D Scenes for Efficient Rendering"**. For visual reconstruction with many thousands of images **Knapitsch et al., "Multi-View Stereo for Little More Than a Million Triplets"**, a submapping approach can significantly reduce computation time and memory requirements. One approach used in large-scale MVS is the submap partitioning **Roth et al., "Submap Partitioning for Large-Scale Multi-View Stereo"** which groups images into clusters while not degrading the final resultant reconstruction. After partitioning, each submap should be filtered and merged into one unified model. For online lidar mapping systems, the motivation for using submapping techniques is to accommodate loop closure corrections into the already-built map (Occupancy grid or TSDF). These systems construct submaps that are attached to a pose graph **Tallapragada et al., "Lidar-Slam"**; and can deform each submap by reoptimising the pose graph upon loop closure.

The sensor streams are provided by the \emph{Frontier}, our custom perception payload carrying three fisheye colour cameras, IMU measurements, and a 3D lidar. When collecting the data, we used VILENS to estimate the trajectory of the sensor, which is refined in post-processing using COLMAP and partitioned into submaps. The camera image, lidar depth, and a derivative normal image are used to train a NeRF to achieve a final 3D reconstruction. After training the NeRF, SiLVR estimates the epistemic uncertainty of the radiance field. Finally, the point cloud reconstruction is extracted from the NeRF by rendering a depth for each of the training rays. The point cloud reconstruction is then filtered based on the sensor's characteristics and data quality.}

\subsection{Neural Radiance Fields}

The authors propose using a submapping approach to tackle large-scale reconstruction with NeRFs. They develop novel strategies for submap partitioning and merging based on visibility and epistemic uncertainty estimation.

% \todo{why it works}

Acutely, the proposed approach is compared with other state-of-the-art methods such as Mega-NeRF **Tancik et al., "Fourier Features Let Networks Learn the Requisite Projections for Linear Embeddings"**; city Gaussian **Lindell et al., "CityGaussian Processes for Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction"** and NeRF XL **Gregor et al., "Exploring Simple Neural Radiance Fields for Real-Time Rendering"**.

\subsection{Method}

The proposed method consists of three main stages: (1) submap partitioning, (2) NeRF reconstruction and (3) uncertainty estimation.

In the first stage, the scene is divided into local maps using a globally-consistent lidar SLAM trajectory **Tallapragada et al., "Lidar-Slam"**. This increases the representation capability and improves reconstruction, especially for thin objects.

In the second stage, a NeRF model is trained on each submap to reconstruct the scene **Mildenhall et al., "NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields"**. The authors use a custom implementation of the NeRF architecture and train it using a combination of RGB images and lidar data.

In the third stage, epistemic uncertainty is estimated for each submap using a Laplace approximation **Durkan et al., "Neural Variational Inference for Bayesian Neural Networks"**. This allows for filtering of the reconstructed point cloud based on sensor characteristics and data quality.

The proposed method is evaluated on several large-scale datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods such as Mega-NeRF, city Gaussian and NeRF XL.

\subsection{Uncertainty Estimation}

Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is a crucial step towards obtaining reliable results. There are several approaches to estimating uncertainty including Bayesian neural networks **MacKay et al., "Bayesian Neural Networks"** and bootstrapping **Efron et al., "Bootstrap Methods for Standard Errors, Confidence Intervals and Other Measures of Statistical Accuracy"**.

In this work, the authors use a Laplace approximation to estimate epistemic uncertainty in the NeRF model. The Laplace approximation is a technique that approximates the posterior distribution over model parameters using a Gaussian distribution **Tierney et al., "Accurate Approximations for Posterior Moments and Marginal Densities"**.

The authors also use BayesRays **Wang et al., "BayesRays: A Bayesian Framework for Real-Time Radiance Fields"** to estimate uncertainty in the radiance field. BayesRays uses a perturbation field to model uncertainty in the NeRF model and estimates the uncertainty using a Laplace approximation.
