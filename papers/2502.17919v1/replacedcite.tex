Recent advancements in neural network architectures have significantly improved the integration of air quality variables with weather variables in forecasting models. 
For instance, the Aurora model ____ primarily trains on weather data and then forecasts air pollution levels as a downstream task.
Similarly, ClimaX ____ is an open-source weather model that leverages the vision transformer architecture ____. 
Trained on large-scale datasets, it serves as a foundational model by employing a pretext task focused on predicting future time steps randomly sampled within a specified range. 
In its downstream applications, ClimaX handles a variety of tasks across different spatial and temporal scales, including regional weather forecasting. Due to its adaptable and efficient design, we have selected ClimaX to demonstrate our proposed approach. 
A recent study ____, has explored enhancing ClimaX for MENA weather forecasting using parameter-efficient fine-tuning like LoRA. This underscores the potential of adapting foundational models to meet the challenges of specific regions.
However, it's important to note that ClimaX currently operates at a lower spatial resolution compared to models like Aurora ____ and CAMS ____. In contrast to large-scale foundational models, existing work on PM forecasting typically employs fewer variables, limiting itself to smaller capacity models or statistical approaches ____. A notable exception is the work of ____, which uses a transformer-based model to forecast PM10 concentrations using several weather variables, demonstrating their importance in the process. However, most studies in this field, while valuable, often focus on predicting a single PM concentration variable and utilize only a subset of available predictors. Our work aims to address these limitations by adopting a more comprehensive, multi-variable approach.

% In AirCast, we integrate air quality variables directly with weather variables. This integration allows us to overcome the limitations of traditional physics-based models, which may not fully capture complex interactions and data-driven methods that consider only one type of data. 
% By combining both air quality and weather data, our approach is better equipped to model the complex environmental dynamics. This is particularly significant for regions like the MENA, where complex environmental factors demand models capable of effectively handling a diverse set of variables.
