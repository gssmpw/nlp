% Search plays a fundamental role in problem-solving across various domains, with most real-world decision-making problems being solvable through systematic search. While traditional approaches suffer from efficiency issues, recent methods that rely solely on Large Language Models' (LLMs) intrinsic knowledge for search simulation prove unstable. Inspired by recent discussion in search and learning, we investigate the integration of LLMs into real search processes. First, we explore how LLMs can enhance search efficiency and propose a framework, \textbf{\underline{Se}arch vi\underline{a} \underline{L}earning (\method)}, for accurate and efficient search. Second, we study how to leverage LLMs to conduct complete and sound searches with 100\% accuracy efficiently. Finally, we explore whether LLMs can inherently develop search capabilities themselves. Our experimental results across three real-world planning tasks demonstrate that our framework can solve problems via complete but efficient search with 100\% accuracy using minimal model calls. Furthermore, we show that with proper guidance, LLMs can inherently conduct systematic searches, significantly improving their task-solving performance. These findings suggest promising directions for better empowering LLMs with search capabilities.

Search plays a fundamental role in problem-solving across various domains, with most real-world decision-making problems being solvable through systematic search. 
Drawing inspiration from recent discussions on search and learning, we systematically explore the complementary relationship between search and Large Language Models (LLMs) from three perspectives. 
First, we analyze how learning can enhance search efficiency and propose \textbf{\underline{Se}arch vi\underline{a} \underline{L}earning (\method)}, a framework that leverages LLMs for effective and efficient search. Second, we further extend \method to \cmethod to ensure rigorous completeness during search.
Our evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that \method achieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1\% compared to traditional approaches. 
Finally, we explore how far LLMs are from real search by investigating whether they can develop search capabilities independently. Our analysis reveals that while current LLMs struggle with efficient search in complex problems, incorporating systematic search strategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities. These findings not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also highlight the need for improving LLMs' search abilities for real-world applications.

Drawing inspiration from recent discussions on search and learning, we systematically explore the complementary relationship between search and Large Language Models (LLMs) from three perspectives. First, we analyze how learning can enhance search efficiency and propose Search via Learning (SeaL), a framework that leverages LLMs for effective and efficient search. Second, we further extend SeaL to SeaL-C to ensure rigorous completeness during search. Our evaluation across three real-world planning tasks demonstrates that SeaL achieves near-perfect accuracy while reducing search spaces by up to 99.1\% compared to traditional approaches. Finally, we explore how far LLMs are from real search by investigating whether they can develop search capabilities independently. Our analysis reveals that while current LLMs struggle with efficient search in complex problems, incorporating systematic search strategies significantly enhances their problem-solving capabilities. These findings not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also highlight the importance of improving LLMs' inherent search abilities for real-world applications.
