\section{\SYS{} Design}
\label{section:design}

This section first introduces the innovative design of OCS transceivers (OCSTrx) based on Silicon Photonics (SiPh) chips (\secref{sec:design:docs}), a key enabler for \sys{}, providing both cost efficiency and reconfigurability. Next, we present the DC-scale \sys{} topology design (\secref{section:design:topology}) based on OCSTrx. Finally, we outline the HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm (\secref{sec:design:orch}), designed to optimize communication efficiency for training jobs.

\subsection{SiPh-based OCS transceiver (OCSTrx)}
\label{sec:design:docs}

The \ocstrx \xspace is designed for reconfigurable point-to-multipoint connectivity. It incorporates a compact OCS-based switch with three Rx/Tx paths, utilizing the MZI switch ~\cite{mzi} micro-structure with thermo-optic (TO) effect~\cite{thermo-optic_2006} phase arms. This OCS-based switch is seamlessly integrated into the Photonic Integrated Chip (PIC) of the transceiver, serving as the MZI switch matrix within the Tx light path, and providing photodetector (PD) modules for each Rx paths.

\para{SiPh-Based OCS.} 
Currently, there are two predominant technological approaches for OCS.
Micro Electromechanical systems (MEMS)~\cite{urata2022missionapollo, mem-optical-switches} are attractive for commercial adoption due to supporting large port radix, up to a $320\times 320$ matrix~\cite{mems-320}.
Another option is SiPh-based OCS. 
Its structure is simpler and cheaper to manufacture, the limitation is its radix due to optical losses in multistage light path selector. 
Given that the locality of traffic and external paths number of \ocstrx{} is only two, SiPh-based OCS offers greater advantages. 

So we choose the design of MZI micro-structure~\cite{mzi} based SiPh-Based OCS.
The basic mechanism of MZI switch elements is controlling the phase difference between light paths in two phase arms, then directs the output light to specific ports through interference at the output combiner. TO effect is utilized for phase arm control, for better switching latency compared to MEMS.


\para{OCS Micro-Structure Design.} As shown in Figure~\ref{figure:design:transceiver:component}, the initial routing decision is made by two MZI switch elements, determining whether to direct the signal through external output 1\&2, or the internal loopback path.
Subsequently, an internal $N\times N$ MZI switch matrix is incorporated to facilitate the cross-lane loopback mechanism, exemplified by the blue and red paths.  Notably, this design can reduces stages count and light attenuation of output 1\&2, while ensures consistent light attenuation for them. The design is implemented on the Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) chip.

\para{Transceiver Design.} In \ocstrx, Tx electrical signal is amplified by linear driver and converted to optical signal by modulators as in \figref{figure:design:transceiver}. One laser is coupled into the PIC as optical source.
On the receiving end, multiple photodetectors capture the Rx optical signal from all available paths separately. The output from the activated photodetector is then amplified by a linear transimpedance amplifier (TIA).
\ocstrx{} offers significant benefits, including high compactness, low power consumption, and cost-effective mass production.
