\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \sys{}, a novel HBD design that supports datacenter scale, dynamic TP group size and near-ideal fault explosion radius.
\sys is built upon a novel design of optical transceivers interaged with SiPh-based \ocstrx, a reconfigurable K-Hop Ring topology and a HBD-DCN orchestration algorithm to leverage the capabilities of the new hardware. 
Using real fault trace of 3K GPU cluster and the in-house simulator, we demonstrate that \sys{} achieves GPU utilization close to the ideal model during faults, delivers superior cost and energy efficiency compared to existing designs, and provides effective control over cross-ToR DCN traffic.
We believe \sys provides an efficient scaling solution for HBD, which offers new insights for the infrastructure of the next generation Trillion-Parameters LLM training.
