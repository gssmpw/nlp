\section{Results}
We identified key contexts of parental involvement, perceptions of AI-generated content, preferences for AI-assisted content creation, and collaborative patterns in shared interactions with a robot. We present the findings based on our research questions as follows.

%We identified four key areas that inform the design of an AI-assisted educational robot to support parental involvement in young children's learning activities. We present our results based on the study phases as follows: (1) \textit{Phase 1: Parent Contextual Needs and Scenarios}: understanding the real-life contexts and challenges parents face; (2) \textit{Phase 2.1: Parent Perspectives on AI-Generated Learning Content}: capturing parents' attitudes and concerns regarding the use of AI in generating educational content; (3) \textit{Phase 2.2: Parent Use of the LLM-Assisted Content Supervision Mechanism}: examining how parents review, edit, and supervise AI-generated content; and (4) \textit{Parent Use of the Robot Involvement Adjustment Mechanism}: exploring how parents delegate roles between themselves and the robot during learning activities.
