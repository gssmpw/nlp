\section{Conclusion}\label{Sec:Conclusion}
%In this work, we present DeepCell, a multiview representation learning framework for post-mapping (PM) netlists. DeepCell involves a PM encoder to process PM netlists and converts them into And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) for encoding using pre-trained AIG models. To integrate information from the AIG view, DeepCell employs Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM), a novel training mechanism that randomly masks regions in the PM netlist and reconstructs them using surrounding nodes and AIG embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that the multiview learning framework, combined with the MCM training mechanism, effectively learns rich and general representations of PM netlists. Furthermore, we evaluate DeepCell on the functional ECO task by integrating it into an ECO tool, showing that it significantly reduces both runtime and ECO costs.
We introduced DeepCell, a multiview representation learning framework for PM netlists. By integrating a GNN-based PM encoder with a pretrained AIG encoder, and leveraging the novel Mask Circuit Modeling mechanism, DeepCell captures rich and generalizable embeddings of PM netlists. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepCell in functional ECO, achieving significant reductions in patch generation costs, gate count, and runtime. Future work will explore its adaptability to other critical EDA tasks and extend its scalability to industrial-scale designs.
