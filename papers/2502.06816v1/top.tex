\begin{abstract}
%Circuit representation learning becomes an attractive direction in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) inspired by the advancements of pretraining-then-finetuning paradigm. Existing circuit representation learning models focus on And-Inverter Graphs (AIG), leaving a gap in handling post-mapping netlists, which are more complex due to standard cell diversity. To address this, we introduce DeepCell, a multi-view representation learning framework for post-mapping netlists. We propose Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) mechanism to train DeepCell, which masks and reconstructs cell embeddings with the pre-trained AIG encoder. We evaluate the effectiveness of DeepCell on the functional engineering change orders (ECO) task. 
%Circuit representation learning has gained traction in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), inspired by the success of pretraining-then-finetuning paradigms in other fields. However, existing efforts predominantly target And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), overlooking post-mapping (PM) netlists that encapsulate more practical, complex designs due to diverse standard cells. To address this gap, we introduce DeepCell, a multiview representation learning framework tailored for PM netlists. By leveraging a pretrained AIG encoder and a novel Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) mechanism, DeepCell effectively integrates structural and functional insights from both PM netlists and AIGs. This self-supervised framework captures rich cell-level representations, enabling accurate and scalable downstream task performance. We demonstrate the utility of DeepCell on functional Engineering Change Orders (ECO), a critical EDA task. Integrated as a plug-in to existing ECO tools, DeepCell reduces patch generation costs and runtime by up to 15\%, while also minimizing patch complexity. 
Representation learning for post-mapping (PM) netlists is a critical challenge in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), driven by the diverse and complex nature of modern circuit designs. Existing approaches focus on intermediate representations like And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), limiting their applicability to post-synthesis stages. We introduce \emph{DeepCell}, a multiview representation learning framework that integrates structural and functional insights from both PM netlists and AIGs to learn rich, generalizable embeddings. At its core, DeepCell employs the novel Mask Circuit Modeling (MCM) mechanism, which refines PM netlist representations in a self-supervised manner using pretrained AIG encoders. DeepCell sets a new benchmark in PM netlist representation, outperforming existing methods in predictive accuracy and reconstruction fidelity. To validate its efficacy, we apply DeepCell to functional Engineering Change Orders (ECO), achieving significant reductions in patch generation costs and runtime while improving patch quality.
