\section{Conclusion}

We introduced a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling in green security, overcoming the limitations of traditional Gaussian process and linear models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in this domain.  To integrate diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, we proposed a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and leverage a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for efficient sampling from unnormalized distributions. We established theoretical convergence to an \(\epsilon\)-equilibrium with high probability using finite samples and finite iterations and demonstrated empirical effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets.  
 Future work could explore extensions to sequential-decision-making.
