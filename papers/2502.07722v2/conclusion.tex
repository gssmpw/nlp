\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have constructed and analyzed the Balancing Domain Decomposition by Constraint preconditioner for composite DG-type discretizations of cardiac cell-by-cell models in three spatial dimensions. We have derived theoretical convergence results and used an experimental evaluation to confirm these bounds for a synthetic test case with a repetitive geometry. We also demonstrated the scalability and quasi-optimality of the preconditioner and the convergence being independent of conductivity coefficients. Future research will include the integration of the method into large-scale cardiac simulations, moving further away from the regularly shaped geometries considered by the theory and towards more organically, irregularly shaped myocytes as they would appear in the human heart.
