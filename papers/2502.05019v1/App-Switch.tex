\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main2}}
 \begin{proof}
 Since $\text{CCV}(t)$ is a monotone non-decreasing function, let $t_{\min}$ be the largest time until which Algorithm \ref{coco_alg_1} is followed by $\mathrm{Switch}$.
 The regret guarantee is easy to prove.  From Theorem \ref{thm:main1},
 regret until time $t_{\min}$ is at most $O(\sqrt{t_{\min}})$. Moreover, starting from time $t_{\min}$ till $T$, from Theorem \ref{thm:sinha2024}, the regret of Algorithm \ref{coco_sinha} is at most $O(\sqrt{T-t_{\min}})$. Thus, the overall regret for $\mathrm{Switch}$ is at most $O(\sqrt{T})$.
 
 For the CCV, with $\mathrm{Switch}$, until time $t_{\min}$, $\text{CCV}(t_{\min})\le \sqrt{T}\log T$. At 
 time $t_{\min}$, $\mathrm{Switch}$ starts to use Algorithm \ref{coco_sinha} which has the following appealing property from (8) \cite{Sinha2024} that for any $t\ge t_{\min}$ where at time $t_{\min}$  Algorithm \ref{coco_sinha} was started to be used with resetting $\text{CCV}(t_{\min})=0$. 
 For any $t\ge t_{\min}$
 \begin{eqnarray} \label{gen-fn-ineq}
		\Phi(\text{CCV}(t)) +\textrm{Regret}_t(x^\star) \leq \sqrt{\sum_{\tau=t_{\min}}^t \big(\Phi'(\text{CCV}(\tau))\big)^2} + \sqrt{t-t_{\min}}.
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta = (2GD)^{-1}, V=1, \lambda = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{T}}, \Phi(x)= \exp(\lambda x)-1, $ and $\lambda=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{T}}$.
We trivially have $\textrm{Regret}_t(x^\star)\geq -\frac{Dt}{2D} \geq -\frac{t}{2}.$ Hence, from \eqref{gen-fn-ineq}, we have that for any $\lambda = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{T}}$ and any $t \ge t_{\min}$
$$\text{CCV}_{[t_{\min},T]} \leq 4GD\ln(2\big(1+2T)\big)\sqrt{T}.$$
Since as argued before, with $\mathrm{Switch}$,  $\text{CCV}(t_{\min})\le \sqrt{T}\log T$, we get that  $\text{CCV}_{[1:T]}\le O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$.
 \end{proof}
