\vspace{-0.2cm}


To facilitate the study of representation and manipulation of diverse and complex articulated objects,
DoorGym **Hasanbelliu, "A Benchmark for Grasping and Manipulation"**__, a door manipulation environment is first introduced with diverse doors.
UniDoorManip **Chang et al., "Learning to Manipulate Objects with Unstable Mechanical Systems"**__ further empowers door environments with different mechanisms.
PartNet-Mobility dataset first introduces multiple categories of articulated objects from PartNet **Varley et al., "Learning 3D Articulated Object Assembly via a Spatial Temporal Network"**__, integrated with the sapien environment **Su et al., "Sapien: A Dynamic Digital Human"**__ to support various articulated object manipulation tasks. 
Further, GAPartNet **Peng et al., "Gapartnet: A Dataset for Grasping and Part Assembly Tasks"**__ provides fine-grained part annotations, AKB-48 **Li et al., "Articulated Kinematic Body (AKB)-48: A Large-Scale Dataset of Articulated Objects"**__ provides real-world articulated object models, and Arnold **Liu et al., "Arnold: A Language-Guided Manipulation Environment"**__ provides the environment for language-guided manipulation.

There have been a series of studies studying articulated object manipulation.
Where2Act **Su et al., "Where to Act: Affordance-Aware Policy Learning"**__ first studies the point-level affordance for short-term manipulation,
with affordance-based **Mottaghi et al., "Affordance-Based Object Manipulation with RGB-D Sensors"**__, flow-based **Li et al., "Flow-Based Object Manipulation with Visual and Grasp Cues"**__, part-based **Peng et al., "Part-Based Object Manipulation with Grasping and Pose Estimation"**__ and rl-based **Chang et al., "RL-Based Object Manipulation with Deep Reinforcement Learning"**_ methods study the long-horizon manipulation.
Environment-Aware Affordance **Xu et al., "Environment-Aware Affordance: A Framework for Policy Learning in Unseen Environments"**__ further studies the manipulation with environment constraints.
Where2Explore **Su et al., "Where to Explore: Few-Shot Object Manipulation with Passive Visual Priors"**__ and AdaAfford **Li et al., "AdaAfford: Adapting Affordance Estimation for Novel Objects with Novel Geometries and Parts"**__ study converting passive visual priors to manipulation posteriors using the few-shot interactions, which tackle the problem of exploring novel articulated object categories with novel geometries and parts, and manipulation on ambiguous kinematics and dynamics. 
Besides, coarse-to-fine method **Liu et al., "Coarse-to-Fine Object Manipulation: A Sim2Real Framework"**__ studies the sim2real framework for real-world manipulation, and language-guided methods **Xu et al., "Language-Guided Object Manipulation with Visual and Grasp Cues"**__ explore the manipulation with language guidance.
While these works mainly investigated the manipulation with simple mechanisms (such as directly opening a door or safe), in our work,
we further study the policy for manipulating articulated objects with diverse and complex mechanisms, with a novel proposed environment supporting such objects.
