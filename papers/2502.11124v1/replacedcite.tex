\subsection{Articulated Object Environments and Datasets}
\vspace{-0.2cm}


To facilitate the study of representation and manipulation of diverse and complex articulated objects,
DoorGym____, a door manipulation environment is first introduced with diverse doors.
UniDoorManip____ further empowers door environments with different mechanisms.
PartNet-Mobility dataset first introduces multiple categories of articulated objects from PartNet____, integrated with the sapien environment____ to support various articulated object manipulation tasks. 
Further, GAPartNet____ provides fine-grained part annotations, AKB-48____ provides real-world articulated object models, and Arnold____ provides the environment for language-guided manipulation.

\subsection{Articulated Object Manipulation}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

There have been a series of studies studying articulated object manipulation.
Where2Act____ first studies the point-level affordance for short-term manipulation,
with affordance-based____, flow-based____, part-based____ and rl-based____ methods study the long-horizon manipulation.
Environment-Aware Affordance____ further studies the manipulation with environment constraints.
Where2Explore____ and AdaAfford____ study converting passive visual priors to manipulation posteriors using the few-shot interactions, which tackle the problem of exploring novel articulated object categories with novel geometries and parts, and manipulation on ambiguous kinematics and dynamics. 
Besides, coarse-to-fine method ____ studies the sim2real framework for real-world manipulation, and language-guided methods____ explore the manipulation with language guidance.
While these works mainly investigated the manipulation with simple mechanisms (such as directly opening a door or safe), in our work,
we further study the policy for manipulating articulated objects with diverse and complex mechanisms, with a novel proposed environment supporting such objects.
