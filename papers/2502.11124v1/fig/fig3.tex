\textbf{Adaptive demonstration collection}: Given the uncertain lock state of a microwave, we instruct the robot to first pull the door to check if it is locked, and then follow two different trajectories based on the result. \textbf{Diffusion-based 3D adaptive manipulation policy}: Conditioning on the history of 3D visual features, proprioceptions, and actions, the policy denoises Gaussian noise into the trajectory distribution. Initially, the policy captures the bimodal distribution in the demonstration based on the initial observation. As the observed lock state is determined, the policy distribution adaptively shifts to an unimodal distribution.
