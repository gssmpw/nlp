  \caption{Visualization of adaptive policy of Open Microwave in the real world. The trajectories vary depending on the state of the microwave.  The red trajectory represents the executed trajectory when the microwave is locked. In subfigure 2, the blue trajectory illustrates the robot's action when the microwave is unlocked, prompting it to continue opening the door. The red trajectory shows that the robot failed to pull the locked door and turned to push the button.
