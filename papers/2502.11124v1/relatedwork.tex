\subsection{Articulated Object Environments and Datasets}
\vspace{-0.2cm}


To facilitate the study of representation and manipulation of diverse and complex articulated objects,
DoorGym~\citep{urakami2019doorgym}, a door manipulation environment is first introduced with diverse doors.
UniDoorManip~\citep{li2024unidoormanip} further empowers door environments with different mechanisms.
PartNet-Mobility dataset first introduces multiple categories of articulated objects from PartNet~\citep{Mo_2019_CVPR, Chang2015ShapeNetAI}, integrated with the sapien environment~\citep{xiang2020sapien, mu2021maniskill, gu2023maniskill2} to support various articulated object manipulation tasks. 
Further, GAPartNet~\citep{geng2023gapartnet} provides fine-grained part annotations, AKB-48~\citep{liu2022akb} provides real-world articulated object models, and Arnold~\citep{gong2023arnold} provides the environment for language-guided manipulation.

\subsection{Articulated Object Manipulation}
\vspace{-0.2cm}

There have been a series of studies studying articulated object manipulation.
Where2Act~\citep{Mo_2021_ICCV} first studies the point-level affordance for short-term manipulation,
with affordance-based~\citep{wu2022vatmart}, flow-based~\citep{eisner2022flowbot3d, zhang2023flowbot++}, part-based~\citep{geng2023partmanip} and rl-based~\citep{geng2022end} methods study the long-horizon manipulation.
Environment-Aware Affordance~\citep{wu2023learningenv, li2024mobileafford} further studies the manipulation with environment constraints.
Where2Explore~\citep{ning2023where2explore} and AdaAfford~\citep{wang2021adaafford} study converting passive visual priors to manipulation posteriors using the few-shot interactions, which tackle the problem of exploring novel articulated object categories with novel geometries and parts, and manipulation on ambiguous kinematics and dynamics. 
Besides, coarse-to-fine method ~\citep{ling2024articulated} studies the sim2real framework for real-world manipulation, and language-guided methods~\citep{xu2024naturalvlm, gong2023arnold} explore the manipulation with language guidance.
While these works mainly investigated the manipulation with simple mechanisms (such as directly opening a door or safe), in our work,
we further study the policy for manipulating articulated objects with diverse and complex mechanisms, with a novel proposed environment supporting such objects.
