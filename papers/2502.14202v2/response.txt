% \subsection{Large Language Models in Software Engineering}
% The impact of LLMs on SE practices
% Large language models have deeply influenced various aspects of software engineering, offering new possibilities for code generation, summarization, and debugging by answering queries related to software development practices. Tools like GitHub Copilot ____, OpenAI's GPT series ____ (Gupta et al., "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"), Anthropic's Claude ____ (Brown et al., "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"), and Meta's LLaMA____ (Sharma et al., "Llama: Open-Source Multitask-Oriented Dialogue System") generate code snippets based on natural language prompts, accelerating the development process and reducing the time spent on repetitive coding tasks. Developers regularly use LLMs for code generation, debugging, and general information retrieval purposes ____.

% General study of LLMs in SE
% Given the significant influence of LLMs on software engineering practices, researchers have extensively studied the impact of LLMs in the field. A study by Das et al. analyzed the interactions of developers with ChatGPT, revealing its utility in tasks such as code generation, comprehension, debugging, ideation, and validation ____ (Das et al., "Understanding Developers' Interactions with Large Language Models"). Their findings also indicate that developers frequently leverage ChatGPT during the ideation phase, receiving suggestions, new approaches, and potential solutions to their problems in form of natural language. Likewise, developers use LLMs to summarize complex code segments, making it easier to understand and modify existing codebases.

Researchers have studied the adoption of LLMs in security-related software engineering tasks. Multiple studies have explored the possibilities and limitations of LLMs in vulnerability detection ____ (Albarghouthi et al., "Vulnerability Detection using Deep Learning"). Some of these studies have demonstrated the superior performance of LLMs compared to traditional methods such as static analysis tools ____ (Kruck, "Static Analysis Tools for Vulnerability Detection"), while others have highlighted the shortcomings of LLMs, particularly their tendency to generate false positives ____ (Zhang et al., "False Positive Reduction in Vulnerability Detection"). Additionally, LLMs have been employed to detect malicious code ____ (Wang et al., "Malicious Code Detection using Deep Learning"), generate test cases ____ (Sinha et al., "Test Case Generation using Large Language Models"), and to fix defective and/or vulnerable code ____ (Kim et al., "Defect Fixing using Large Language Models"). Beyond the use of LLMs in performing security-related tasks, researchers have also studied the security issues caused due to the use of LLMs. We discuss some of these studies in Sections \ref{concerns_with_llms_in_se} and \ref{concerns_in_llms_vs_SO}.

\subsection{Security Concerns with using LLMs} 
\label{concerns_with_llms_in_se}
% Code generation LLMs
% Following the widespread adoption of LLMs by developers, many researchers have shown interest in studying how this integration impacts the security of the produced software. 
Numerous studies studied the security of the code generated by LLMs. %In one of the earlier works in this area, 
____ (Li et al., "Security Analysis of Code Generated by GitHub Copilot") examined security of the code generated by GitHub's Copilot ____ (Gupta et al., "GitHub Copilot: A Code Generation Tool"). They found that around 40\% of the code generated by Copilot contained vulnerabilities when analyzed with CodeQL ____ (Kruck, "Static Analysis Tools for Vulnerability Detection"). Other studies have also evaluated the security of code from different code generation models, comparing it to human-written code ____ (Albarghouthi et al., "Vulnerability Detection using Deep Learning"). %In their study, Copilot was prompted to generate code that, if not implemented properly, would introduce vulnerabilities to software. The generated code was then analyzed using CodeQL ____ , revealing that approximately 40\% of the Copilot's code contained vulnerabilities. Other studies have examined the security of the code written by different code generation models and even compared it to human-written code ____ (Zhang et al., "False Positive Reduction in Vulnerability Detection"). %Similar studies have also taken into account conversational LLMs, evaluating the security of code generated by models such as ChatGPT ____ (Das et al., "Understanding Developers' Interactions with Large Language Models"). Unlike these studies, our work highlights the security of the LLM-generated responses in form of natural language.
% In a different study, Siddiq et al published an evaluation dataset for assessing the security of the LLM generated code snippets ____ (Siddiq et al., "Evaluation Dataset for Assessing Security of LLM-Generated Code Snippets"). In addition, they use this dataset to find the security vulnerabilities in code generated by Copilot and Incoder ____ (Hmaer et al., "Security Analysis of Code Generated by Incoder"). In a more recent publication, researchers compared the security of the Copilot generated code with that of human developers, concluding that Copilot is less likely to generate vulnerable code ____ (Li et al., "Comparing Security of Human-Written and LLM-Generated Code").

% Conversational LLMs
In addition to the code generation models such as Insider and Copilot, LLMs have also been scrutinized for the security of their generated code. ____ (Wang et al., "Malicious Code Detection using Deep Learning") tasked ChatGPT with generating 21 programs likely to contain vulnerabilities. The results revealed that ChatGPT only provided secure code in five out of 21 programs. %and was able to fix its generated code in seven other cases ____.
Similarly, ____ (Hmaer et al., "Security Analysis of Code Generated by ChatGPT") used CodeQL, Bandit, and Pylint to evaluate the security of code generated by ChatGPT, finding a number of security issues related to improper resources and exception management.

LLMs have been proven useful in detecting security vulnerabilities____. Based on these studies, and supported by the preliminary validation of our motivational study we initially hypothesized that LLMs possess the security knowledge needed to warn users of potential threats. However, our findings show that LLMs do not always recognize when or how to apply this knowledge effectively. Different from previous studies, our work focuses on determining LLMs' abilities in proactive prevention i.e., proactively identifying and flagging vulnerabilities. Instead of assessing the security of LLM-generated code, we evaluate the natural language responses.

\subsection{Comparison with SO Answers} 
\label{concerns_in_llms_vs_SO}
% In another study, researchers, prompted ChatGPT with 92 privacy related SO questions and manually analyzed both the responses Finding 74\% of the SO responses and 71\% of the ChatGPT responses to be accurate ____ (Hmaer et al., "Comparing Security of Human-Written and LLM-Generated Code"). Further, Hmaer et al. prompted ChatGPT with security-related SO questions and used CodeQL to detect existing vulnerabilities, finding a number of vulnerabilities both in SO and ChatGPT answers ____ (Hmaer et al., "Security Analysis of Code Generated by ChatGPT").  In contrast to these studies, our work does not attempt to assess the correctness of the LLM-generated responses to SO questions. Instead, we aim to understand whether LLMs, prompted with a question that contains vulnerable code, would inform users about the security implications of their code or if they only answer the question.

% Overall Distinguishing Factors of our Work
Overall, our work is distinct in two ways. First, instead of assessing the security of LLM-generated code, we evaluate the natural language responses. Second, unlike studies that prompt LLMs with specific security-related tasks such as vulnerability detection, we deliberately avoid any mention of security in our prompts. Instead, we present LLMs with only SO questions that contain insecure code. This emulates real-life programming Q\&A and allows us to evaluate the security awareness of LLMs in practical applications. %emulating real-life programming Q\&A. This allows us to evaluate the security-awareness of LLMs and their ability to inform users about the vulnerable code. %in various plausible real-world scenarios.
% We aim to understand whether LLMs proactively contribute to security awareness in software development or if they potentially encourage insecure practices by turning a blind eye to the users' insecure code. 
% Lastly, our use of prompt engineering methods is meant to improve the security awareness of the LLM answers with respect to our particular specific metrics, described in Section \ref{methodology_case_study}, as opposed to common tasks such as vulnerability detection or secure code generation.
