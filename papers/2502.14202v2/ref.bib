	abstract     = {Monthly, 50 million users visit Stack Overflow, a popular Q\&A forum used by software developers, to share and gather knowledge and help with coding problems. Although Q\&A forums serve as a good resource for seeking help from developers beyond the local team, the abundance of information can cause developers, especially novice software engineers, to spend considerable time in identifying relevant answers and suitable suggested fixes. This exploratory study aims to understand how novice software engineers direct their efforts and what kinds of information they focus on within a post selected from the results returned in response to a search query on Stack Overflow. The results can be leveraged to improve the Q\&A forum interface, guide tools for mining forums, and potentially improve granularity of traceability mappings involving forum posts. We qualitatively analyze the novice software engineers'�� perceptions from a survey as well as their annotations of a set of Stack Overflow posts. Our results indicate that novice software engineers pay attention to only 27\% of code and 15-21\% of text in a Stack Overflow post to understand and determine how to apply the relevant information to their context. Our results also discern the kinds of information prominent in that focus.}

    abstract = "{In this work, artificial neural networks (ANNs) is used to predict nucleate boiling heat flux by learning from a dataset of twelve experimental parameters across 231 independent samples. An approach to reduce the number of parameters involved and to increase model accuracy is proposed and implemented. The proposed approach consists of two steps. In the first step, a feature importance study is performed to determine the most significant parameters. Only important features are used in the second step. In the second step, dimensional analysis is performed on these important parameters. Neural network analysis is then conducted based on dimensionless parameters. The results indicate that the proposed feature importance study and dimensional analysis can significantly improve the ANNs performance. It also show that model errors based on the reduced dataset are considerably lower than those based on the initial dataset. The study based on other machine learning models also shows that the reduced dataset generate better results. The results conclude that ANNs outperform other machine learning algorithms and outperform a well-known boiling correlation equation. Additionally, the feature importance study concludes that wall superheat, gravity and liquid subcooling are the three most significant parameters in the prediction of heat flux for nucleate boiling. Novel results quantifying parameter significance in surface tension dominated (SDB) and buoyancy dominated (BDB) boiling regimes have been reported. The results show that surface tension and liquid subcooling are the most significant parameters in SDB regime with a combined contribution percentage of 60\\%, while wall superheat and gravity are the most significant parameters in BDB regime with a combined contribution percentage of 70\\%.}",

abstract = {Understanding code is challenging, especially when working in new and complex development environments. Code comments and documentation can help, but are typically scarce or hard to navigate. Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the process of writing code. Can they do the same for helping understand it? In this study, we provide a first investigation of an LLM-based conversational UI built directly in the IDE that is geared towards code understanding. Our IDE plugin queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model with four high-level requests without the user having to write explicit prompts: to explain a highlighted section of code, provide details of API calls used in the code, explain key domain-specific terms, and provide usage examples for an API. The plugin also allows for open-ended prompts, which are automatically contextualized to the LLM with the program being edited. We evaluate this system in a user study with 32 participants, which confirms that using our plugin can aid task completion more than web search. We additionally provide a thorough analysis of the ways developers use, and perceive the usefulness of, our system, among others finding that the usage and benefits differ between students and professionals. We conclude that in-IDE prompt-less interaction with LLMs is a promising future direction for tool builders.},
