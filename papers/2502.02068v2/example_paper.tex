\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces \sys{}, the first-of-its-kind ML/Crypto codesign watermarking framework that regulates LLM-generated code to avoid intellectual property rights violations and inappropriate misuse in software development. 
High-quality watermarks adhering to the detectability-fidelity-robustness tri-objective are limited due to codes' low-entropy nature. Watermark verification, however, often needs to reveal the signature and requires re-encoding new ones for code reuse, which potentially compromising the system's usability.
To overcome these challenges, \sys{} obtains high-quality watermarks by training the watermark insertion and extraction modules end-to-end to ensure (i) unaltered watermarked code functionality and (ii) enhanced detectability and robustness leveraging pre-trained CodeT5 as the insertion backbone to extract better code features. In the deployment, \sys{} uses zero-knowledge proofs for secure verification without revealing the underlying signatures. 
Extensive evaluations demonstrated \sys{} achieves high detection accuracy while preserving the code functionality. \sys{} is also robust against attacks and provides efficient secure watermark verification.


%Existing works struggle to balance the detectability-fidelity-robustness tri-objective for practical code watermarking. Moreover,
%disclosing watermarks for verification often requires re-encoding new signatures to reuse the code, potentially compromising its functionality.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present \sys{}, the first-of-its-kind ML/Crypto codesign secure watermarking framework with enhanced and balanced detectability-fidelity-robustness. We train the watermark insertion and extraction modules end-to-end, aiming to ensure the watermarked codes' functionality-invariant, while maintaining the detectability of the watermark in the adversarial environment. We also design a zero-knowledge proof-based watermark verification in the system deployment to ensure correct ownership proofs without disclosing the signature details. Extensive evaluations of various coding benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 


% We recommend future work in exploring \sys's generalizability to watermarking other coding languages. We also recommend exploring adaptive watermarking verification approaches to verify watermarked code in large engineering projects. 

\section*{Impact Statement}

Our code watermarking framework has potential societal implications.  
By building secure and public-verifiable code watermarking framework, our approach can enhance the usability of existing watermarking systems, especially for low-entropy code data. As such, it helps to detect code plagiarism for academic dishonesty, protect the intelligent property of the LLM owners, and monitor the distribution of the watermarked content. However, there might be cases where human-written code can be erroneously detected as LLM-generated, leading to false accusations.
