EWN, being a game with only 20 years of history, has limited human knowledge available. Consequently, designing an evaluation function for EWN is challenging and complex. Most researchers have focused on using Monte Carlo tree search techniques to develop EWN programs \cite{EWN_perfect_information} \cite{TAAI_MCTS} \cite{china_MCTS} \cite{monte_alpha}.

    Several attempts have also been made to craft evaluation functions for EWN, often focusing on balancing attacking and defending power through parameter tuning \cite{EWNNY} \cite{ODEMA}.

    There was another evaluation function similar to Zweistein, called Schwarz table. \cite{Schwarz} In the experiments section, we will compare the performance of Zweistein with these existing functions.
