\section{Conclusion}

We present \workname to support tuning-free multi-concept video personalization. 
We alleviate the identity blending issue by explicitly associating the concept descriptions with reference images. 
With the pursuit of architectural simplicity and flexibility, we propose anchored prompts to inject unique tokens within text prompts and concept embeddings to encode the order of reference images.
Our results show that \workname can generate high quality personalized videos with diverse reference types, including face, body and animal images.
