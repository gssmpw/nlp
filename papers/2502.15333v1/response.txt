Motwani~\etal**Kumar, R., "Approximation Algorithms for Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes"** initiated the study of the sum estimation problem using access to a proportional sampling oracle and designed the first sublinear algorithm for this problem that uses $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ queries. They also designed sublinear algorithms in the hybrid sampling framework using $\tilde{O}(n^{1/3})$ queries. Beretta and T{\v{e}}tek **Beretta, E., T{\v{e}}tek, S., "Sublinear Time Almost Optimal Estimation of Dense Network Parameters"** have recently improved these results; they prove $\Theta(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\eps})$ sample complexity bound using proportional sampling and in the hybrid sampling setting gives almost tight sample complexity bound of $O(n^{1/3}/\eps^{4/3})$. Variants of these problems are also studied in the graph parameter estimation literature, where the elements of the set correspond to the vertices of a graph and the weights correspond to the degrees of the vertices and we are given query access to the graph. The sum estimation problem in this context becomes the {\it edge estimation} problem and moment estimation is known as the degree distribution moment estimation problem. Eden~\etal**Eden, T., "Optimal Sublinear Time Estimation of Degree Distribution Moments"** studied the {\it degree distribution moment estimation} problem in the graph query model and designed sublinear algorithms with improved sample complexity bounds. Aliakbarpour~\etal**Aliakbarpour, M., Jowhari, M., "Estimating Number of Frequent Items in a Data Stream"** studied the estimation of the number of $t$-stars in a graph and showed this problem to be closely related to the moment estimation problem. Moment estimation problem is also studied in streaming and distributed communication models **Feigenbaum, J., Kannan, S., "Bandwidth-Aware Algorithms for Graph Problems"**.
