\section{Conclusion} In this paper we improve the results for moment estimation using proportional sampling and proved optimal sample complexity bounds for moment estimation using proportional sampling for $t\geq 2$. Since hybrid sampling does not provide better guarantees for the moment estimation problem, one possible approach to obtain better bounds might be to explore whether conditional sampling-based approaches give better results. Conditional sampling has been used to design algorithms for the sum estimation problem \cite{ACK2015} but to the best of our knowledge no such algorithm is known for the moment estimation problem.
