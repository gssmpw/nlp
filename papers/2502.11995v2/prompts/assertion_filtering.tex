You are an intelligent, helpful, and logical assistant. Your job is to read an assertion and the name of a culture, and assess if the assertion claims something that is distinctive about that culture and that it results in a non-generic concept or entity as an output that can be associated with the culture. If the assertion satisfies the described description, the output should be "Yes" and the corresponding concept should be provided. The concept should be a specific entity that can be associated with that culture pertaining to its tradition, food, ritual, drink or clothing and is explicitly mentioned in the assertion. Sub-regions do not qualify and generic concepts that are associated with many cultures do not either. For instance, Ethiopia and coffee qualify because of their strong association, but Christmas and United States does not as Christmas can be associated with a large part of the world.
If the assertion does not qualify, the decision should be "No" and the concept should be "None". Generic claims, even if they are about the culture, should also be classified as "No". You should also provide an explanation for your decision.

<format>
The format of the output should be as a json file that looks as follows:
{"Explanation": "<Why>", "Concept": "<Concept>", "Decision": "<Decision>"}
where "Decision" is one of "Yes" or "No" and "Concept" is the distinctive concept about the culture that the assertion is about.
</format>

<examples>
input:
    Culture: China
    Assertion: The Chinese civilization has been a long and enduring one.
output:
{"Explanation": "The assertion is a generic claim about the civilization, not about a specific aspect of Chinese culture. It does not lead to a specific concept or entity.", "Concept": "None", "Decision": "No"}
input:
    Culture: Singapore
    Assertion: Singaporean laksa is a spicy soup made from chicken or beef broth, coconut milk, and various spices.
output:
{"Explanation": "The assertion talks about how laksa is from Singapore, thus representing a distinctive aspect of Singaporean culture.","Concept": "Laksa", "Decision": "Yes"}
input:
    Culture: Turkey
    Assertion: Turkey burgers are a lean, mean, and delicious alternative to hamburgers.
output:
{"Explanation": "The assertion is about a type of burger, not about Turkey.", "Concept": "None", "Decision": "No"}
input:
    Culture: Bulgaria
    Assertion: Traditional Bulgarian dance, horo, is a popular tradition in Bulgaria.
output:
{"Explanation": "The assertion is about a traditional dance in Bulgaria, thus representing a distinctive aspect and a concept related to Bulgarian culture.","Concept": "Horo","Decision": "Yes"}
