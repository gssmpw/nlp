With this work, we presented an improved version of the original dataset proposed by Angelopoulos in~\cite{angelopoulos2020event}, together with the pipeline used to generate improved annotations at 200Hz, providing what we believe could be a valuable resource for the scientific community.

The semi-automatic pipeline presented provides a method that reduces both the time required to annotate an event-camera dataset and the potential human error that might arise from a completely manual annotation process. This method can also be applied to future datasets, giving more precise annotations that can help develop and test new algorithms for event-based eye-tracking.

Simultaneously, with the increasing interest in event-based technologies, particularly in low-power applications, we aim to expedite research in real-time eye-tracking using purely event-driven approaches.
