\section{\al{} Generally Gives the Best Performance}
\label{sec:opt_comparison_additional}
\cref{fig:opt_comparison} shows that \al{} typically yields the best performance on both loss and L2RE across network widths.

    \caption{Performance of Adam, \lbfgs, and \al{} after tuning. 
    We find the learning rate $\eta^\star$ for each network width and optimization strategy that attains the lowest loss (L2RE) across all random seeds.
    The min, median, and max loss (L2RE) are calculated by taking the min, median, and max of the losses (L2REs) for learning rate $\eta^*$ across all random seeds.
    Each bar on the plot corresponds to the median, while the top and bottom error bars correspond to the max and min, respectively.
    The smallest min loss and L2RE are always attained by one of the \al{} strategies; the smallest median loss and L2RE are nearly always attained by one of the \al{} strategies.}
