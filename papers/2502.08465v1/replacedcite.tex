 Morpheus uses a PBFT ____ style approach to view changes, while consistency between finalised transaction blocks within the same view uses an approach similar to Tendermint ____ and Hotstuff ____. As noted in Section \ref{metrics}, Hotstuff's approach of relaying all messages via the leader could be used by Morpheus during low throughput to decrease communication complexity, but this is unlikely to lead to a decrease in `real' latency (i.e.\ actual finalisation times). As also noted in Section \ref{metrics}, the optimistic `fast commit' of Zyzzyva ____ can also be applied as a further optimisation. 

 \vspace{0.2cm} 
 Morpheus transitions between being a leaderless `linear' blockchain during low throughput to a leader-based DAG-protocol during high throughput. DAG protocols have been studied for a number of years, Hashgraph ____ being an early example. Hashgraph builds an unstructured DAG and suffers from latency exponential in the number of processes. Spectre was another early DAG protocol, designed for the `permissionless'' setting ____, with proof-of-work as the mechanism for sybil resistance. The protocol implements a `payment system', but does not totally order transactions.  Aleph ____ is more similar to most recent DAG protocols in that it builds a structured DAG in which each process proceeds to the next `round' after receiving blocks from $2f+1$ processes corresponding to the previous round, but still has greater  latency than modern DAG protocols.  

 \vspace{0.2cm}
 More recent DAG protocols use a variety of approaches to consensus. Narwhal ____ builds a DAG for the purpose of ensuring data availability, from which (one option is that) a protocol like Hotstuff or PBFT can then be used to efficiently establish a total ordering on transactions. DAG-Rider ____, on the other hand, builds the DAG in such a way that a total ordering can be extracted from the structure of the DAG, with zero further communication cost. The protocol proceeds in `waves', where each wave consists of four rounds, each round building one `layer' of the DAG. In each round, each process uses an instance of Reliable Broadcast (RBC) to disseminate their block for the round. Each wave has a leader and an 
 expected six rounds (6 sequential RBCs) are required to finalise
the leader's block for the first round of the wave. This finalises all blocks observed by that leader block, but other blocks (such as those in the same round as the leader block) may have signicantly greater latency. Tusk ____ is an implementation based on DAG-Rider. 

 \vspace{0.2cm} 
 Given the ability of DAG-Rider to handle significantly higher throughput in many settings, when compared to protocols like PBFT that build a linear blockchain, much subsequent work has taken a similar approach, while looking to improve on latency. While DAG-Rider functions in asynchrony, Bullshark ____ is designed to achieve lower latency in the partially synchronous setting. 
 GradedDAG ____ and LightDAG ____ function in asynchrony, but look to improve latency by replacing RBC ____ with weaker primitives, such as consistent broadcast ____. This means that those protocols solve Extractable SMR (as defined in Section \ref{esmr}), rather than SMR, and that further communication may be required to ensure full block dissemination in executions with faulty processes. Cordial Miners ____ has versions for both partial synchrony and asynchrony and further decreases latency 
by using the DAG structure (rather than any primitive such as Consistent or Reliable Broadcast) for equivocation exlcusion. Mysticeti ____ builds on Cordial Miners and establishes a mechanism to  accommodate multiple leaders within a single round. Shaol ____ and Shoal++ ____ extend Bullshark by establishing a `pipelining approach' that implements simultaneous instances of Bullshark with a leader in each round. This reduces latency in the good case because one is required to wait less time before reaching a round in which a leader block is finalised. Both of these papers, however, use a `reputation' system to select leaders, which comes its own trade-offs. Sailfish ____ similarly describes a mechanism where each round has a leader, but does not make use of a reputation system. As noted previously, the protocol most similar to Morpheus during high throughput is Autobahn ____. One of the major distinctions between Autobahn and those previously discussed, is that most blocks are only required to point to a single parent. This significantly decreases communication complexity when the number of processes is large and allows one to achieve linear ammortised communction complexity without the use of erasure coding ____ or batching ____.
