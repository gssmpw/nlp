\section{Appendix B: Scams} \label{scams}
Scams were, unfortunately, shared experiences that resonated with workers of all platforms. Although ``true'' scams occur rarely on Rover, Petsitter-4 described how they usually take the form of a ``classic check scheme'' where the scammer claims ``they're going to send you a check for \$500 and tell you to buy something and send back whatever is extra''. Manipulations of hours or number of pets involved are more commonplace, where clients would change hours to ``get charged less for a boarding or a house set, and they can manipulate the number of animals \dots the cost comes out to us [as sitters]'' (Petsitter-4). On Uber, Driver-7 described getting phone calls from fake numbers claiming to be Uber support who tries to assign him `` `a ride to a very important person. So we need to confirm your identity' ''. The scammer would then proceed to ask for their phone number to which send a 4-digit code, which they'll then use to access the drivers' account. Meanwhile, Freelancer-1 related how she enjoyed reading about others' \textit{Stories} of ``scams \dots cause there's quite a few of them on Upwork''.
