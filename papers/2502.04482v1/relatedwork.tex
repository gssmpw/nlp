\section{Related Work}
\label{Related_Work}
{Recent efforts} surrounding the investigation and improvement of gig work conditions coalesced around 1) the potential of worker data for making evident the conditions imparted by algorithmic platform practices and 2) the importance of concrete policy and regulation that ensure strong worker protections. 
Below, we describe related works that center our vision {and design} of a worker-centered data-sharing platform that meets {the needs of workers (across platforms)} for self-tracking, mutual aid, and policy advancements that improve current work conditions.

\subsection{{Work Tracking: Individual Logging $\rightarrow$ Collective Support \& Decision-making}}
In the absence of peer support and higher power actors who assume or share the structural risks and challenges inherent to gigs, workers are left to their own devices to manage {various} accountabilities {and obligations} \cite{consent, indie, accountable}. 
Studies documented two main ways that workers understand and manage work: on their own through self-tracking, or with peers via online groups/forums. 
Recent work at the intersection of HCI and Personal Informatics revealed how gig workers currently (or might in the future) self-track to (1) protect themselves from the platform \cite{privacy} or customers \cite{visibility, sousveillance} (2) comply with tax obligations \cite{tax_lives, taxing} (3) understand how algorithms operate \cite{sousveillance, zhang2023stakeholder} and (4) comprehend and improve their own earning patterns \cite{zhang2023stakeholder, accountable, supporting} using tools such as data probes {in addition to apps designed for tracking fuel, time, tax, mileage \footnote{Tracking apps include Fuelio and GasBuddy (for Fuel), Traqq (for time), Stride (for tax), as well as MileIQ, Everlance and Triplog (for Mileage)} and generalized gig work assistance \cite{accountable}. For instance, Mystro a commercial tool affording rideshare drivers the agency to auto-decline work across platforms that do not match their expressed preferences (e.g., earning rates, duration of gigs, work locations). 
% Para offer similar functionality for DoorDash that automatically declined low-wage work, but was rendered unfunctional after a DoorDash app update. 
% Third party apps cater to workers seeking targeted strategies to pursue their work preferences---for example, 
Gridwise and Farepilot provide workers data-driven insights about in-demand locations, while Stride assists with tax filing. } 

While such tools act as resource providers and \del{(sometimes automated) }assistants, they {fall short in} provid{ing} workers with social support or strategies in times of need. T\del{hus, t}o overcome \replace{social isolation 
}{the atomized nature gigs \cite{peersupport, atom}} and find a sense of   ``community'',  workers also {}leverage online forums (both {pages and groups on general-purpose sites like Reddit/Facebook} and platform-specific sites like uberpeople.net) to share strategies \cite{nomad} and information \cite{machines, peersupport} {so they can hypothesize and collective make sense of underlying platforms' algorithmic mechanisms}, solicit advice and social connections \cite{belonging, organizing}, as well as rant and commiserate \cite{privacy, atom}.  
Online video tutorials (e.g., vlogging) are also emerging as more effortless ways for workers to learn about existing strategies and work conditions \cite{chan2019becoming, pires2024delivery, woodside2021bottom}.
However, the loosely-organized structure of general purpose forums (and video sharing platforms) {makes them in}effective for sensemaking \cite{peersupport}, while platform-specific sites limit {worker's abilities to discern unifying challenges shared across domains from characteristics that uniquely afflict workers of a single work context/platform}.
{Furthermore, ``Online forums are built to aid workers with a sense of immediacy, not to quantifiably or qualitatively monitor
request patterns or worker grievances over time'' \cite{organizing}, making them ill-suited for purposes of collective bargaining or identify-building.}
