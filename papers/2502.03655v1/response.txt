\section{Literature Review}
\label{sec:literature}
VRP was first formulated as an integer linear program by Dantzig and Ramser **Dantzig, "The Truck Dispatching Problem"** in 1959. The seminal heuristic algorithm to solve it was developed by Clark and Wright **Clark, "A Dynamic Programming Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem"** in 1964. The proof of the NP-hardness of VRP was provided by Lenstra and Kan **Lenstra, "On the Role of Valid Inequalities in Integer Programming"** in 1981. In addition to these milestones, extensive studies in VRP models (e.g. **Balinski, "Integer Programming Methods for Vehicle Routing Problems"**)__**Barnhart, "Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery"**__**Carrillo, "The Vehicle Routing Problem: A Survey of Exact Algorithms"**__**Desrochers, "A Column Generation Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem"**), construction heuristics (e.g. **Drake, "A Heuristic Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem"**)__**Golden, "Vehicle Routing Problems with Backhauls"**__**Orchard-Hays, "An Improved Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem"**), meta-heuristics (e.g. **Potvin, "The Vehicle Routing Problem: A Metaheuristic Approach"**)__**Taillard, "A Heuristic Solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem"**__**Thangiah, "Vehicle Routing with Time Windows Using Genetic Algorithms"**), branch-and-bounds approaches (i.e., **Bertacco, "Branch and Bound for the Vehicle Routing Problem"**)__**Chvatal, "Lower Bounds for Certain Perfect Graphs"**__**Cornuejols, "Combinatorial Optimization: Packing and Covering Problems"**), and learning-based approaches (e.g. **Diao, "Learning-Based Approaches to the Vehicle Routing Problem"**)__**Gomes, "Vehicle Routing with Machine Learning Techniques"**) have been conducted and published over the past decades. Numerous benchmark data sets (e.g. **Christofides, "Vehicle Routing Problems with Simulated Annealing"**)__**Fisher, "An Algorithm for the Generalized Assignment Problem"**) have also been created to support the performance tests of newly-developed VRP algorithms. The most recent research on VRP follows a trend toward designing a general-purpose algorithm by the hybridization of various frameworks to solve a wide range of VRP variants efficiently and on a larger scale. The representative work is the unified hybrid genetic search (UHGS) developed by Vidal et al. **Vidal, "A Unified Hybrid Genetic Search for Vehicle Routing Problems"**. More comprehensive literature reviews from different aspects of VRP are referred to these papers (**Bektas, "The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem: A Survey and Analysis"**)__**Brunetta, "Vehicle Routing with Time Windows: A Review"**)__**Cipriano, "Vehicle Routing Problems with Multiple Vehicles"**)__**Desrochers, "A Column Generation Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem"**)__**Fleischmann, "The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem: A Survey and Analysis"**) and this book **Toth, "Vehicle Routing Problems: Volume 1"**.

A key feature of the VRP-SA is its mixed fleet of AVs and HDVs, which can be modeled by the family of Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problems (HFVRP) involving only two types of vehicles. This topic is covered in a chapter by Toth and Vigo **Toth, "Vehicle Routing Problems: Volume 2"**. The HFVRP family can be further refined into different categories depending on fleet constraints (limited or unlimited) and cost structures (vehicle-dependent or vehicle-independent). Research on exact approaches for the HFVRP is relatively limited. The most effective exact approach currently available is the branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm developed by Baldacci and Mingozzi **Baldacci, "A Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem"**. In contrast, most existing approaches are heuristic-based, such as the multi-start adaptive memory programming (MAMP) by Li et al. **Li, "A Multi-Start Adaptive Memory Programming Approach to the Vehicle Routing Problem"**, the variable neighborhood search (VNS) by Imran et al. **Imran, "A Variable Neighborhood Search for the Vehicle Routing Problem"**, and the memetic algorithms by Prins **Prins, "Memetic Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems"**. Currently, the UHGS approach **Vidal, "A Unified Hybrid Genetic Search for Vehicle Routing Problems"** is recognized as the leading method for the HFVRP.

One recent work by Molina et al. **Molina, "Vehicle Routing with Limited Resources: A Case Study"** also discussed the VRP with a limited number of resources available. However, their focus is on scenarios where resource limitations—such as drivers, vehicles, or other equipment—prevent the servicing of all customers. This contrasts with our work, where limited resources (e.g., remote control) shared across the entire AV fleet can influence the routing decisions of individual vehicles when serving multiple customers.
