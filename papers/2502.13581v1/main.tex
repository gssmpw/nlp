% TL;DR We propose ActionPiece, the first context-aware action sequence tokenizer for generative recommendation. Unlike traditional action tokenizers, ActionPiece can tokenize the same action into different tokens based on the surrounding context in different sequences.

\begin{abstract}
Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions
% , represented by interacted items, 
are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions.
% However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, without considering the contextual relationships between other actions in a sequence. 
However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships.
This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context.
To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a \emph{set} of item features, which serve as the initial tokens.
% Our tokenizer then iteratively merges frequently co-occurred tokens, either within a single feature set or between adjacent sets in the action sequence corpora, into new tokens.
% The tokenizer is then trained on the action sequence corpora to memorize feature patterns as new tokens, based on their frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets.
Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets.
% These new tokens act as shortcuts, helping the GR models memorize important feature patterns.
% By controlling the vocabulary size, ActionPiece allows for a balance between generalization and memorization.
Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics.
% during both training and inference
% to enhance the utilization of ActionPiece tokens. 
Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ActionPiece consistently outperforms existing action tokenization methods, improving NDCG@$10$ by $6.00\%$ to $12.82\%$.
% By adjusting the vocabulary size, ActionPiece is also shown to be able to balance memory efficiency and recommendation performance~(\Cref{fig:intro}).

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce ActionPiece, the first context-aware action sequence tokenizer for generative recommendation. By considering the surrounding context, the same action can be tokenized into different tokens in different sequences. We formulate generative recommendation as a task on sequences of feature sets and merge important feature patterns into tokens. During vocabulary construction, we propose assigning weights to token pairs based on their structures, such as those within a single set or across adjacent sets. To enable efficient vocabulary construction, we use double-ended linked lists to maintain the corpus and introduce intermediate nodes to store tokens that combine features across adjacent sets. Additionally, we propose set permutation regularization, which segments a single action sequence into multiple token sequences with the same semantics. These segments serve as natural augmentations for training and as ensemble instances for inference.

In the future, we plan to align user actions with other modalities by constructing instructions that combine ActionPiece tokens and other types of tokens.
We also aim to extend the proposed tokenizer to other tasks that can be framed as set sequence modeling problems, including audio modeling, sequential decision-making, and time series forecasting.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% This paper introduces ActionPiece, a context-aware action sequence tokenizer to enhance generative recommendation. This work aims to advance personalized recommender systems, enabling more accurate understanding of user preferences. We argue that this work is not directly correlated to certain society or ethical concerns. The impact of this work is primarily tied to the broader implications of recommender systems in various domains, such as e-commerce, entertainment, and social platforms.

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
