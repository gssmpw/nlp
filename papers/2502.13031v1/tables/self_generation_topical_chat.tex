\multirow{1}{*}{Metrics Generation} & 
\#\# Instruction \newline
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the response for the next turn in the conversation displayed below on its \textcolor{blue}{[Aspect]}. Please propose at most three concise questions about whether a potential response is a good response for the next turn in the given conversation on its \textcolor{blue}{[Aspect]}. Another assistant will evaluate the aspect of the output by answering all the questions. \newline

Here are some rules of the evaluation: \newline
(1) Your evaluation should consider the \textcolor{blue}{[Aspect]} of the response. \textcolor{blue}{[Criteria]} \newline
(2) Outputs should NOT contain more/less than what the instruction asks for, as such outputs do NOT precisely execute the instruction. \newline

\#\# Conversation History: \newline
\textcolor{blue}{[Conversation History]} \newline

\#\# Requirements for Your Output: \newline
(1) The questions should **specifically** target the given conversation instead of some general standards, so the questions may revolve around key points of the conversation. \newline
(2) You should directly give the questions without any other words. \newline
(3) Questions are presented from most important to least important. \\
