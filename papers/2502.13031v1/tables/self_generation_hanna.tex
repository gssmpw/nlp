\#\# Instruction \newline
Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the story generated according to a prompt displayed below on its \textcolor{blue}{[Aspect]}. Please propose at most three concise questions about whether a potential story is a good story according to a given prompt on its \textcolor{blue}{[Aspect]}.
