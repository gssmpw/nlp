In this work, we integrate 8 key factors for the prompt of LLM evaluators and propose HPSS, a heuristic search method to automatically optimize the prompting strategy for adjusting these factors. 
HPSS leverages the expected performance advantages of each value as the heuristic function to guide the search process. 
Extensive experiments on four NLG evaluation tasks demonstrate the superiority of HPSS, yielding consistent performance gains over both human-designed evaluation prompts and automatic prompt optimization methods. 
Additionally, we analyze the characteristics of these factors and provide new insights into future prompt design for LLM evaluators.
