We also present a similar classification of malware using their binary files. We use our own dataset for traffic identification and Microsoft Kaggle dataset for malware classification tasks. The current techniques used in network traffic analysis and malware detection is time consuming and beatable as the precise signatures are known. Deep learned features in both cases are not hand crafted and are learned form data signatures. It cannot be understood by the attacker or the malware in order to fake or hide it and hence cannot be bypassed easily.",
