We also present a similar classification of malware using their binary files. We use our own dataset for traffic identification and Microsoft Kaggle dataset for malware classification tasks. The current techniques used in network traffic analysis and malware detection is time consuming and beatable as the precise signatures are known. Deep learned features in both cases are not hand crafted and are learned form data signatures. It cannot be understood by the attacker or the malware in order to fake or hide it and hence cannot be bypassed easily.",

abstract = "As a basic method for monitoring the activities of Internet applications, traffic identification is very important for Internet management and security. Internet traffic data naturally exhibits imbalanced distributions, but this problem is rarely considered by the research community. Data gravitation-based classification (DGC) is a new classification model for handling imbalance data sets and we proposed an imbalanced DGC (IDGC) model in our previous study. In the present study, we developed an IDGC-based model to resolve imbalanced Internet traffic identification problems. First, we constructed six imbalanced traffic data sets from three original traffic data sets and we then extracted their early stage features according to the packet sizes. In identification experiments, we compared the performance of six standard algorithms, including DGC and four imbalanced algorithms with IDGC. The experimental results demonstrated that the standard classification models could achieve high accuracy with imbalanced traffic data, but their imbalanced performance was not as good, and their generalizability was also a problem. By contrast, IDGC performed very well and in a stable manner in terms of imbalanced performance measures, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness for imbalanced traffic identification."

abstract="Class imbalance has become a big problem that leads to inaccurate traffic classification. Accurate traffic classification of traffic flows helps us in security monitoring, IP management, intrusion detection, etc. To address the traffic classification problem, in literature, machine learning (ML) approaches are widely used. Therefore, in this paper, we also proposed an ML-based hybrid feature selection algorithm named WMI{\_}AUC that make use of two metrics: weighted mutual information (WMI) metric and area under ROC curve (AUC). These metrics select effective features from a traffic flow. However, in order to select robust features from the selected features, we proposed robust features selection algorithm. The proposed approach increases the accuracy of ML classifiers and helps in detecting malicious traffic. We evaluate our work using 11 well-known ML classifiers on the different network environment traces datasets. Experimental results showed that our algorithms achieve more than 95{\%} flow accuracy results.",
