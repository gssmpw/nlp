\section*{Limitations}
Our study focuses on entity unlearning, leaving hazardous knowledge and copyrighted content unlearning unexplored. These cases may require different evaluation strategies.

Additionally, our experiments use mid-sized models (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct). Larger models, with their computational demands and structural differences, may respond differently. Future research should assess their applicability to such models.
