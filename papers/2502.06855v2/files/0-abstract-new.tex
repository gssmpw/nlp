\begin{abstract}
Well-designed prompts are crucial for enhancing Large language models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities while aligning their outputs with task requirements across diverse domains. However, manually designed prompts require expertise and iterative experimentation. 
While existing prompt optimization methods aim to automate this process, they rely heavily on external references such as ground truth or by humans, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable or costly to obtain. 
To address this, we propose \textbf{S}elf-Supervised \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{O}ptimization (\ours), a cost-efficient framework that discovers effective prompts for both closed and open-ended tasks without requiring external reference.
Motivated by the observations that prompt quality manifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to task requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from output comparisons.
Specifically, \ours selects superior prompts through pairwise output comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer that aligns outputs with task requirements.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ours outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving comparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., \textbf{1.1\% to 5.6\%} of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples).
