\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces Control-CLIP, a novel framework that enhances its ability to accurately understand concepts in specific domains by decoupling style from category features. We establish independent style and category control modules and apply different loss functions to fine-tune the CLIP model. Compared to other fine-tuning methods, Control-CLIP demonstrates better performance on both style and category recognition in specific domains. In addition, we propose an innovative cross-attention mechanism that utilizes the decoupled outputs of the style and category encoders to guide diffusion models. 
% Compared to directly fine-tuning diffusion models, our approach maintains the general ability of pre-trained diffusion models and at the same time improves generation diversity and fidelity to texts. The plug-and-play design makes Control-CLIP to be easily deployed to a wide range of text-to-image generation models with a low cost.
Compared to fine-tuning diffusion models, our approach preserves the general capabilities of pre-trained models while enhancing generation diversity and text fidelity. The plug-and-play design allows Control-CLIP to be easily and cost-effectively integrated into various text-to-image generation models.
