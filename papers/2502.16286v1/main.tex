\begin{abstract}
  In the rapidly evolving landscape of neural network security, the resilience of neural networks against bit-flip attacks (i.e., an attacker maliciously flips an extremely small amount of bits within its parameter storage memory system to induce harmful behavior), has emerged as a relevant area of research. Existing studies suggest that quantization may serve as a viable defense against such attacks. Recognizing the documented susceptibility of real-valued neural networks to such attacks and the comparative robustness of quantized neural networks (QNNs), in this work, we introduce \tool, the first verification framework designed to formally verify the absence of bit-flip attacks or to identify all vulnerable parameters in a sound and rigorous manner.
\tool comprises two integral components: an abstraction-based method and an MILP-based method.
Specifically, we first conduct a reachability analysis with respect to symbolic parameters that represent the potential bit-flip attacks, based on a novel abstract domain with a sound guarantee. If the reachability analysis fails to prove the resilience of such attacks, then we encode this verification problem into an equivalent MILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. 
Therefore, \tool is sound, complete, and reasonably efficient. We conduct extensive experiments, which demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency across various network architectures, quantization bit-widths, and adversary capabilities.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:con}
We proposed a novel bit-flip attack verification method, \tool, for QNNs, which is sound, complete, and arguably efficient. To achieve this, we introduced \symPoly, the first abstract domain tailored for networks with symbolic parameters. We implemented \tool as an end-to-end tool and conducted thorough experiments on various benchmarks with networks of different model sizes and quantization bit-widths, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. 

While \symPoly may not represent the theoretically optimal abstract transformer for convex relaxations of weighted activation functions, it achieves optimal when restricting static abstractions to using only two linear constraints per neuron. 
Moreover, in terms of convex relaxation, the optimal abstraction transformer may not significantly enhance \symPoly, supported by the observation in~\cite{salman2019convex} that there is an inherent \emph{barrier} to tight relaxation-based verification methods. 
However, \tool could be integrated with complementary verification techniques, such as Branch-and-Bound for ReLU splitting~\cite{bunel2018unifiedviewpiecewiselinear} and optimizable lower bounds~\cite{xu2021fastcompleteenablingcomplete}, to improve the verification precision and scalability. We consider these promising extensions for future work.

\minor{Our verification approach targets bit-flip attacks on a single parameter. Extending such threat models to attack multiple parameters simultaneously, e.g., two out of $n$ parameters (i.e., $\mm=2$), would involve a straightforward modification of Algorithm~\ref{alg:overall} by traversing all $\binom{n}{2}=\frac{n\cdot(n-1)}{2}$ two-parameter combinations in the for-loop at line 3, leading to exponential computation growth. Hence, although the abstract domain \symPoly can handle multiple symbolic parameters simultaneously, how to efficiently and effectively partition all $\binom{\nn}{2}$ combinations into groups for abstraction-refinement poses a significant and non-trivial challenge, which is also a key focus in future work.}
  
% For further work, it would be interesting to investigate techniques for other network architectures, activation functions, and bit-flip attack settings, as well as to develop a more efficient verification method that does not require parameter traversal. This work represents a significant step towards these goals.
