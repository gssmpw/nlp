abstract = {This paper presents a community-centered study of cultural limitations of text-to-image (T2I) models in the South Asian context. We theorize these failures using scholarship on dominant media regimes of representations and locate them within participants’ reporting of their existing social marginalizations. We thus show how generative AI can reproduce an outsiders gaze for viewing South Asian cultures, shaped by global and regional power inequities. By centering communities as experts and soliciting their perspectives on T2I limitations, our study adds rich nuance into existing evaluative frameworks and deepens our understanding of the culturally-specific ways AI technologies can fail in non-Western and Global South settings. We distill lessons for responsible development of T2I models, recommending concrete pathways forward that can allow for recognition of structural inequalities.},

Existing approaches, such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and constitutional {AI}, however, exhibit power asymmetries and lack transparency. These “authoritarian” approaches fail to adequately accommodate a broad array of human opinions, raising concerns about whose values are being prioritized. In response, we introduce the Dynamic Value Alignment approach, theoretically grounded in the principles of parallel constraint satisfaction, which models moral reasoning as a dynamic process that balances multiple value principles. Our approach also enhances users’ moral and epistemic agency by granting users greater control over the values that influence {AI} behavior. As a more user-centric, transparent, and participatory framework for {AI} ethics, our approach not only addresses the democratic deficits inherent in current practices but also ensures that {AI} systems are flexibly aligned with a diverse array of human values.},

  abstract  = {As artificial intelligence (AI) gains prominence in pathology and medicine, the ethical implications and potential biases within such integrated AI models will require careful scrutiny. Ethics and bias are important considerations in our practice settings, especially as increased number of machine learning (ML) systems are being integrated within our various medical domains. Such machine learning based systems, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in specified tasks such as but not limited to image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. However, the potential bias that may exist within such AI-ML models can also inadvertently lead to unfair and potentially detrimental outcomes. The source of bias within such machine learning models can be due to numerous factors but can be typically put in three main buckets (data bias, development bias and interaction bias). These could be due to the training data, algorithmic bias, feature engineering and selection issues, clinical and institutional bias (i.e. practice variability), reporting bias, and temporal bias (i.e. changes in technology, clinical practice or disease patterns). Therefore despite the potential of these AI-ML applications, their deployment in our day to day practice also raises noteworthy ethical concerns. To address ethics and bias in medicine, a comprehensive evaluation process is required which will encompass all aspects such systems, from model development through clinical deployment. Addressing these biases is crucial to ensure that AI-ML systems remain fair, transparent, and beneficial to all. This review will discuss the relevant ethical and bias considerations in AI-ML specifically within the pathology and medical domain.}

year = {2024},
publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, such as helping to commit crimes or producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans' expressed preferences over multiple outputs. Another approach is constitutional AI, in which the input from humans is a list of high-level principles. But how do we deal with potentially diverging input from humans? How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about "collective" preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior? In this paper, we argue that the field of social choice is well positioned to address these questions, and we discuss ways forward for this agenda, drawing on discussions in a recent workshop on Social Choice for AI Ethics and Safety held in Berkeley, CA, USA in December 2023.},
