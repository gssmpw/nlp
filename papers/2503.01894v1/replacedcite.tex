\subsection{Alignment of Generative Models} Multiple datasets have supported alignment efforts in text-to-image (T2I) generation. For instance, Simulacra Aesthetic Captions ____ offers 238{,}000 synthetic images rated for aesthetics, and Pic-a-Pic ____ comprises over 500{,}000 preference data points. ImageReward ____ extends these efforts by capturing ratings on alignment, fidelity, and harmlessness, while HPS ____ and HPS v2 ____ propose large-scale binary preference pairs to train reward models reflecting human judgments. Related work in language models has explored moral decision-making in multilingual contexts ____ and contextual preferences across diverse demographics ____, highlighting the importance of subjective, multicultural perspectives in alignment processes.

Studies on T2I alignment often focus on aesthetic preferences ____ or content policy compliance. However, they typically assume a single, global notion of “goodness” or “suitability.” Pluralistic alignment, in contrast, recognizes that social values are heterogeneous and context-dependent ____. Our work extends beyond purely global alignment by collecting specialized, multi-criteria annotations grounded in local, intersectional community knowledge for urban public space design.

Fewer efforts target image-based generative models compared to alignment in large language models ____. Prior research has primarily utilized reward modeling and reinforcement learning from human feedback ____, with a focus on single-objective tasks such as helpfulness or factual correctness ____. In contrast, our approach applies multi-criteria preference learning ____ to T2I outputs within an urban planning context, capturing nuanced trade-offs among accessibility, safety, comfort, invitingness, inclusivity, and diversity.

\subsection{Intersectionality and Local Knowledge} Intersectionality recognizes that individuals may experience multiple, overlapping forms of marginalization, affecting how they engage with public spaces and technology ____. In generative modeling, this perspective is often overlooked, with systems calibrated to an “average” user profile that can obscure the distinct needs of marginalized groups ____. For urban planning tasks, ignoring intersectionality risks overlooking critical insights related to accessibility, safety, or cultural expression. Integrating local knowledge adds further granularity, accounting for the historical, spatial, and communal context that global datasets typically lack ____. While some studies acknowledge the importance of localized, context-specific input ____, few systematically address intersectionality in T2I alignment. By weaving intersectional considerations into local community-driven annotations, our approach endeavors to reflect a broader range of perspectives and needs, moving beyond singular, one-size-fits-all criteria in generative modeling. 

\subsection{Visual Generative Modeling for Urban Spaces} Urban planning and design have long leveraged visualizations to communicate design objectives and gather feedback from stakeholders ____. T2I models offer the promise of more rapid prototyping and inclusive deliberation, especially when non-experts can directly prompt a model to generate conceptual designs of a plaza, park, or street ____. Yet, generative models frequently default to learned global priors, potentially reproducing biases or neglecting local cultural markers ____. Our LIVS dataset is explicitly curated to capture local, intersectional preferences in a domain where the geometry, aesthetics, and sociocultural elements of a public space are all crucial ____. This approach aids in systematically evaluating how T2I alignment can be guided by multiple, sometimes conflicting, user-defined criteria.

\subsection{Multi-Criteria Preference Learning} Beyond single-objective alignment, multi-criteria preference learning integrates multiple attributes into a unified training signal ____. This approach has been explored in text-based RLHF, where models are optimized for multiple constraints, such as helpfulness and safety ____. Recent advancements extend this paradigm to T2I generation by incorporating diverse human preferences.

Prior work has demonstrated the efficacy of multi-dimensional preference learning in T2I. Zhang et al.\ ____ introduced the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS), a model trained on over 918{,}000 human preference choices across more than 607{,}000 images, capturing multiple evaluation criteria such as aesthetics, semantic alignment, detail quality, and overall assessment. Similarly, Xu et al.\ ____ proposed \emph{ImageReward}, a reward model trained on 137{,}000 expert comparisons to encode human preferences and optimize diffusion models for improved alignment with human expectations. Furthermore, Kuhlmann-Joergensen et al.\ ____ emphasized the limitations of simplistic preference annotations, advocating for richer human feedback mechanisms to refine T2I model performance and safety.

Building on these developments, we extend multi-criteria preference learning to intersectional urban design goals. We employ the DPO method ____ to fine-tune a T2I model using pairwise preference data that account for accessibility, safety, comfort, invitingness, inclusivity, and diversity. By integrating structured human feedback across multiple criteria, we aim to align generative models with complex societal values in urban planning.
