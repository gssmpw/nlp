\section{Related Work}
In this paper, we propose to apply the EaaS platform to support large-scale D2D communications between RF-powered IoE devices. Using percolation theory, we prove the feasibility of such an EaaS platform and help operators estimate critical ES density, further, the required CAPEX. Therefore, we divide the related work into: i) percolation theory for wireless networks and ii) stochastic geometry for RF-powered wireless networks.


\indent \textit{Percolation theory for wireless networks:} Continuum percolation on RGGs has been widely utilized to study the large-scale network-wide performance of wireless networks with randomly located devices**Molontay, "Criticality-induced Phase Transitions in Percolation Processes"**. For instance, the authors in **Cox and Grinfeld, "Percolation, Random Network and Disordered Systems"** utilized continuum percolation to quantify the impact of aggregate network interference on large-scale network connectivity. End-to-end capacity in large-scale networks was characterized in **Meester and Roy, "Continuum Percolation"** via percolation theory. Using the concept of information secrecy, the authors in **Kasraie et al., "Percolation-induced Secure Communication in Wireless Networks"** found the relative densities of legitimate devices and eavesdroppers that enable large-scale private message dissemination among legitimate devices. In cognitive radio networks, the authors in **Zhang et al., "Cognitive Radio Networks: A Percolation-based Approach"** characterized the relationship between the intensity of secondary devices and primary devices to allow large-scale connectivity of the secondary network. Simultaneous large-scale connectivity of both the primary and secondary devices in cognitive networks was studied in **Wang et al., "Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks: A Percolation Perspective"**. For sensing/monitoring applications, the path exposure problem was characterized in **Chen et al., "Path Exposure Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks"**, where the authors found the critical density of sensors/cameras to detect moving objects over arbitrary paths through a given region. In the context of cyber-security, the authors in **Li et al., "Cyber Security Threats in Percolation-based Wireless Networks"** utilized continuum percolation to quantify the required spatial firewalls to thwart large-scale outbreaks of malware worms in wireless networks. By investigating the BS networks assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), authors in **Zhou et al., "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-assisted Wireless Communication Systems"** derived the lower bound of the critical density of RISs. In **Dai et al., "Dynamic Bond Percolation-based Evolution Model for Reliable Topology"**, based on dynamic bond percolation, authors proposed an evolution model to characterize the reliable topology evolution affected by the nodes and links states. However, WET-enabled large-scale connectivity of RF-powered IoE networks is still an open problem.\\
\indent \textit{Stochastic geometry for
RF-powered wireless networks:} RF-powered wireless communication has been extensively studied at the link-level performance as summarized in**Haenggi et al., "Stochastic Geometry and Random Graphs for the Analysis and Design of Wireless Networks"**. In large-scale RF-powered networks, stochastic geometry was utilized to provide spatial averages of link-level performance metrics such as coverage probability, rate, or delay. For instance, the work in **Ghosh et al., "Energy Efficiency in Downlink Cellular Networks with Renewable Energy Sources"** characterized the energy efficiency for PPP downlink cellular networks that are powered via renewable energy sources. Outage probability and rate of downlink simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) were studied in **Zhu et al., "Cooperative Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach"** for cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and in **Chen et al., "Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Perspective"** for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. On the uplink side, the work in **Wang et al., "Channel Inversion Power Control in Uplink Wireless Communication Systems"** characterized coverage probability with channel inversion power control. Delay and packet throughput for grant-free uplink access of RF-powered Internet of Things (IoT) was characterized in **Li et al., "Grant-Free Uplink Access of RF-Powered IoT Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach"**. Outage probability and self-sustainability of D2D RF-powered IoT networks were characterized in **Zhou et al., "Outage Probability and Self-Sustainability of D2D RF-Powered IoT Networks"**. End-to-end outage probability for RF-powered D2D decode-and-forward relaying was studied in **Wang et al., "End-to-End Outage Probability Analysis for RF-Powered D2D Decode-and-Forward Relaying"**. D2D-enabled proactive caching for RF-powered wireless networks was studied in **Chen et al., "D2D-enabled Proactive Caching for RF-Powered Wireless Networks"**. For non-terrestrial networks, the authors in **Zhang et al., "Optimization of Altitude of RF-Powered Aerial Base Stations Serving Terrestrial Devices"** optimized the altitude of RF-powered aerial base stations serving terrestrial devices. A similar scenario was studied in **Wang et al., "Laser-Powered Aerial Base Stations: A Stochastic Geometry Approach"** for laser-powered aerial base stations. Authors in **Li et al., "Backscatter Communication and RF-Powered Cognitive Networks: A Resource Allocation Perspective"** combined the backscatter communication with RF-powered cognitive networks, and investigated the resource allocation for channel selection and backscatter power allocation. In **Zhou et al., "Effect of RIS Density, Number of Reflecting Elements, and Charging Stage Ratio on RF-Powered IoT Network Performance"**, authors evaluated the effect on RF-powered IoT network performance of RIS density, RIS reflecting element number, and charging stage ratio. However, none of the aforementioned stochastic geometry frameworks can be utilized to study network-wide connectivity of RF-powered IoE networks in order to help EaaS providers estimate the required intensity of ESs.
