% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
%\section*{Acknowledgements}

%\textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
%the paper submitted for blind review.

%If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
%usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
%should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
%that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
%include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
%who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
%sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}
 The defense framework proposed can be useful for safety in practical, high-risk applications of supervised machine learning such as autonomous vehicles \citep{tencent2019experimental, 272270, 291108}, content moderation \citep{ye2023noisyhate,schaffner2024community}, and face authentication \citep{komkov2021advhat, wei2022adversarial} and provides first steps towards training and updating models in order to maintain robustness over time.  However, there are cases in which adversarial examples are used for good (\textit{e.g.} defending against website fingerprinting \citep{rahman2020mockingbird,shan2021patch}) which may be adversely affected by models robust to adversarial examples, including our proposed approach.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
