\textbf{SAT dataset.}
SAT problems can be classified into different categories, mainly as random, crafted, and industrial ____, while most come from either synthetic generators or existing datasets. Most generators such as CNFgen ____, focus on random problems like random \textit{k}-SAT or combinatorial problems. The largest established datasets are SATLIB ____ and SAT Competitions (SATCOMP) ____, while only SATCOMP contains industrial problems and is limited in size. To overcome this constraint, new generators have been proposed to generate pseudo-industrial instances, including hand-crafted generators Community Attachment ____ and Popularity-Similarity  ____, or graph-generative models generators ____. For GNN based SAT solving, ____ proposed random generator SR(\textit{n}) and ____ generated uniform-random 3-SAT instances as datasets. G4SATBench ____ produced a dataset including 7 types of synthetic generators with varying variable sizes.


\textbf{SAT structural properties.}
As traditional SAT solvers perform differently over random, crafted, and industrial instances, it is believed that different SAT domains have distinct underlying properties ____, including problem-based properties and solver-based properties. Results in this filed have been wildy used in improving traditional solvers ____ and portfolio based solvers ____. 
Problem-based properties are further divided to CNF-based, including phase-transition ____, backdoor ____ and  backbones ____, and graph-based, including scale-free ____, self-similar ____, centrality ____, small-worlds ____ and community structure ____. Solver-based properties are related to SAT solvers such as: mergeability and resolvability ____. These measures are either proved mathematically, or analyzed through solver-related parameters such as solving time. However, all the works are experimented with traditional SAT solvers, and most work only focus on single property measure ____. In this work, we select several related properties, and calculate their values on each of our selected domains. We also split our dataset to different values based on each structure, %while analyzing them against cross-domain generalisation result on GNN, 
and analyze the important or hard features for GNN to capture. %and traditional solver time.


\textbf{GNN for SAT solving.} GNN has been applied to SAT solving mainly as problem solvers, including standalone solvers, which are networks trained to classify problem satisfiability themselves and mainly encodes the formula as LCG graphs ____, and hybrid solvers, which treat GNN as a guidance to traditional solvers by replacing their heuristics with network predictions. These solvers focuses on specific tasks and corresponding problems such as UNSAT core ____, glue clauses ____ or backbone variables ____ for CDCL solvers and initial assignment ____ for SLS solvers. Although hybrid solvers generally achieve better results than standalone solvers, they acts as modifications of traditional solvers instead of discussing solvability of GNNs,  which is out of scope of our work.
