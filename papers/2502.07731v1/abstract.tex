Our work introduces the effect of supply/demand imbalances into the literature on online matching with stochastic rewards in bipartite graphs. We provide a parameterized definition that characterizes instances as over- or undersupplied (or balanced), and show that higher competitive ratios against an offline clairvoyant algorithm are achievable, for both adversarial and stochastic arrivals, when instances are more imbalanced. The competitive ratio guarantees we obtain are the best-possible for the class of \emph{delayed} algorithms we focus on (such algorithms may adapt to the history of arrivals and the algorithm's own decisions, but not to the stochastic realization of each potential match). 

We then explore the real-world implications of our improved competitive ratios. First, we demonstrate analytically that the improved competitive ratios under imbalanced instances is not a one-way street by showing that a platform that conducts effective supply- and demand management should incorporate the effect of imbalance on its matching performance on its supply planning in order to create imbalanced instances. Second, we empirically study the relationship between achieved competitive ratios and imbalance using the data of a volunteer matching platform.
