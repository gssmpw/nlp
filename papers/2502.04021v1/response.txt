\paragraph*{Structured and Continuous Bandits}
Best arm identification for general bandit problems with a finite set of arms has been explored in both worst-case scenarios **Bubeck, "X-Armed Bandits"** and instance-specific settings **Dani et al., "The Price of Bandit Feedback Revisited: Regularized MDPs"**. Subsequent research has extended this work to provide instance-specific bounds and algorithms for bandits incorporating contextual information, such as those with Linear or Lipschitz-continuous reward functions **Kveton et al., "Stochastic Constrained Bandits"**, as well as bandits subject to constraints **Gai et al., "Instance-Specific Regret Bounds for Combinatorial Pure Exploration"**. Continuous bandits have primarily been studied in the context of regret minimization **Abbasi-Yadkori et al., "Regret Minimization for Non-Stationary Dynamic Multi-Armed Bandits with Risk-Averse Cost Functions"**, with further refinement in Adaptive-treed bandits **Kaufmann et al., "Adaptive-Treed Bandits for Efficient Exploration and Exploitation"**, which, while focusing on cumulative regret, also offers PAC bounds. In the context of Quantum computing, regret minimization has been studied outside of VQA, where the task is to select an optimal observable from a finite or continuous set **Harrow et al., "Quantum Computation of Measurements in the Presence of Noise"**, with regret defined as the expected measurement outcome, though the bounds in this setting are not instance-specific. Methods for pure exploration in continuous bandit settings, such as MFDOO **Kazerouni et al., "Multi-Point Exploration for Efficient Pure Exploration in Continuous Bandits"**, have been developed; however, they do not incorporate structural properties of the problem, such as the Lipschitz continuity of the reward function $\mu$, which implies that nearby arms tend to yield similar rewards. Additionally, these methods rely on worst-case analysis and lack instance-dependent performance guarantees, with no known bounds for continuous bandits with Lipschitz reward functions. Our work is the first to address this gap.

\paragraph*{Mitigating BP in VQAs}
Recent research indicates a trade-off between the expressivity and trainability **Hastings et al., "Scalable Hamiltonian Simulation"** of specific quantum circuit architectures, often referred to as \emph{ansatz}. If an ansatz lacks sufficient expressivity, it may be incapable of representing the target function. Conversely, provably expressive ansatzes are typically susceptible to the BP phenomenon, which complicates the task of identifying the desired model within the represented model class. 
**Cerezo et al., "A Quantum Approximation Method for Combinatorial Problems"** provides a summary of current techniques for mitigating BPs, a subset of which we briefly outline. One way to mitigate this issue is to find the best trade-off via adaptive structure search **Grant et al., "Efficient Bayesian Optimization for Noisy Experiments"** and \emph{ADAPT-VQE} **Bharti et al., "Provably Efficient Algorithms for Sampling Continuous Quantum Systems"}. Furthermore, most proofs of presence of BPs only apply to random parameter initialization. Therefore, employing alternative initialization strategies **Chang et al., "Quantum Circuit Learning with Conjugate Computation"** can serve as an effective approach to mitigating this issue. Finally, certain architectures, such as noise-induced shallow circuits **Low et al., "Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) Algorithms"**, are proven not to have BPs. However, recent work suggests that the absence of BPs implies classical simulability **Dunjko et al., "Quantum-Classical Simulatability and Universal Correctness"**. Even in the absence of BPs, the challenge of avoiding local minima remains. Alternative training methods for VQAs, such as those proposed in **Kottmann et al., "Variational Quantum Computation with a Superconducting Qubit"** and **Niu et al., "Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm with Improved Performance"**, generally lack formal theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce the application of bandit methods to this domain for the first time.
