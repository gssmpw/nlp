abstract="We consider the framework of stochastic multi-armed bandit problems and study the possibilities and limitations of strategies that perform an online exploration of the arms. The strategies are assessed in terms of their simple regret, a regret notion that captures the fact that exploration is only constrained by the number of available rounds (not necessarily known in advance), in contrast to the case when the cumulative regret is considered and when exploitation needs to be performed at the same time. We believe that this performance criterion is suited to situations when the cost of pulling an arm is expressed in terms of resources rather than rewards. We discuss the links between the simple and the cumulative regret. The main result is that the required exploration--exploitation trade-offs are qualitatively different, in view of a general lower bound on the simple regret in terms of the cumulative regret.",

abstract={Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are expected to be a path to quantum advantages on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. However, both empirical and theoretical results exhibit that the deployed ansatz heavily affects the performance of VQAs such that an ansatz with a larger number of quantum gates enables a stronger expressivity, while the accumulated noise may render a poor trainability. To maximally improve the robustness and trainability of VQAs, here we devise a resource and runtime efficient scheme termed quantum architecture search (QAS). In particular, given a learning task, QAS automatically seeks a near-optimal ansatz (i.e., circuit architecture) to balance benefits and side-effects brought by adding more noisy quantum gates to achieve a good performance. We implement QAS on both the numerical simulator and real quantum hardware, via the IBM cloud, to accomplish data classification and quantum chemistry tasks. In the problems studied, numerical and experimental results show that QAS cannot only alleviate the influence of quantum noise and barren plateaus but also outperforms VQAs with pre-selected ansatze.},

abstract={Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) represent a powerful class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for computing molecular energies. Various numerical issues exist for these methods, however, including barren plateaus and large numbers of local minima. In this work, we consider the Adaptive, Problem-Tailored Variational Quantum Eiegensolver (ADAPT-VQE) ans{\textsurd}{\textsection}tze, and examine how they are impacted by these local minima. We find that while ADAPT-VQE does not remove local minima, the gradient-informed, one-operator-at-a-time circuit construction accomplishes two things: First, it provides an initialization strategy that can yield solutions with over an order of magnitude smaller error compared to random initialization, and which is applicable in situations where chemical intuition cannot help with initialization, i.e., when Hartree-Fock is a poor approximation to the ground state. Second, even if an ADAPT-VQE iteration converges to a local trap at one step, it can still ‚{\"A}{\'u}burrow‚{\"A}{\`u} toward the exact solution by adding more operators, which preferentially deepens the occupied trap. This same mechanism helps highlight a surprising feature of ADAPT-VQE: It should not suffer optimization problems due to barren plateaus and random initialization. Even if such barren plateaus appear in the parameter landscape, our analysis suggests that ADAPT-VQE avoids such regions by design.},

    abstract = { Abstract.We consider the problem of multifidelity zeroth-order optimization, where one can evaluate a function \(f\) at various approximation levels (of varying costs), and the goal is to optimize \(f\) with the cheapest evaluations possible. In this paper, we study certified algorithms, which are additionally required to output a data-driven upper bound on the optimization error. We first formalize the problem in terms of a min-max game between an algorithm and an evaluation environment. We then propose a certified variant of the MFDOO algorithm and derive a bound on its cost complexity for any Lipschitz function \(f\). We also prove an \(f\)-dependent lower bound showing that this algorithm has a near-optimal cost complexity. As a direct example, we close the paper by addressing the special case of noisy (stochastic) evaluations, which corresponds to \(\varepsilon\)-best arm identification in Lipschitz bandits with continuously many arms. }

Unlike the standard best-arm identification problem which is well studied, the optimal policy in this case may not be deterministic and could mix between several arms. This changes the geometry of the problem which we characterize via an information-theoretic lower bound. We introduce two asymptotically optimal algorithms for this setting, one based on the Track-and-Stop method and the other based on a game-theoretic approach. Both these algorithms try to track an optimal allocation based on the lower bound and computed by a weighted projection onto the boundary of a normal cone. Finally, we provide empirical results that validate our bounds and visualize how constraints change the hardness of the problem.}
