\label{sec:conclusion}

We design a data marketplace where a broker facilitates transactions between buyers, who seek to estimate the mean of an unknown normal distribution, and strategic data contributors, who collect data from these distributions at a cost. Our mechanism admits a Nash equilibrium (NE) in which the two lowest-cost contributors collect all the data and report it truthfully. In this equilibrium, we maximize profit while satisfying key market constraints.  
Furthermore, we show that our mechanism is essentially unimprovable, as it achieves a profit arbitrarily close to the maximum possible in any NE of any mechanism. An interesting and challenging direction for future work is to extend our framework to learning tasks beyond mean estimation.
