\section{Related Work}
% We first introduce some existing works about modelling an agent's decision-making process using ToM. We then review two groups of methods that focus on modelling interactive and dynamic humans, respectively. Lastly, we review common types of human trajectory prediction methods used in robot planning.

\subsection{ToM in Agent Modelling}
\label{sec:ToM}
% ToM has been a well-established theory in cognitive psychology **Wellman, "The Child's Theory of Mind"**.
Prior works have formulated a ToM agent's decision-making processes for basic games such as rock-paper-scissors **Gintis et al., "Strong Reciprocity and Human Sociality"**, Tacit Communication Game **Bicchieri et al., "Cooperation, conscience and the transformation of values"**, and Common Pool Resource Game **Ostrom, "Design Principles of Elinable Institutions for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods"**.
These extensive-form games have relatively small action sets, making recursive reasoning straightforward by listing down all possible game states. Some methods apply ToM to predict agent's movement **Tessema et al., "Modeling Theory of Mind in Agent-Based Modeling"**, but they are constrained to a grid space with limited action sets. For a more general discussion on ToM in machine intelligence, we direct the reader to **Gratch et al., "Reasoning about the other mind: A computational model of joint attention and theory of mind"**.

\subsection{Interactive Human Models}
Many human motion predictors have studied interactions in human crowds **Helbing et al., "Simulating dynamical features in open access: Redesigning social force"**. A heuristic approach for human-robot interaction is to directly model the robot as a human neighbour.
**Loianno et al., "Learning to Predict Human Trajectories with Candidate Robot Plans for Autonomous Navigation"** uses a neural network to predict human trajectories with different candidate robot plans. By observing how much the human tries to avoid each planned trajectory, it chooses the least invasive robot plan for maximised human comfort.
This method relies on a strong assumption that humans treat robots the same as other humans.
Another line of work models how humans react to robots. **Kim et al., "Stackelberg Game Theoretic Human-Robot Interaction"** predicts whether the human behaves like a leader or follower in a Stackelberg game. When the human is a follower, the cost is minimised based on observed robot actions.
Similarly in **Liu et al., "Motion Prediction for Autonomous Robot Planning with Social Learning"**, the robot action is used in human cost functions to predict the human response.
The key difference between these methods and our proposed method is that we enable the human to ``predict" future motions of other agents, instead of only ``observe and respond".

\subsection{Dynamic Human Models}
Instead of using a unified and static human model for all interactions, some methods model a dynamic human.
**Khatib et al., "Human Teleoperation with Dynamic Estimation of Robot Dynamics"** models a human teleoperator whose internal estimation of the robot dynamics is potentially inaccurate. The robot then corrects this estimation by modifying its response to teleoperation.
It assumes that there exists a true value that the human model needs to approach. However, there is no true human model in reality.
**Piasco et al., "Human Preference Modeling for Robot Planning and Control"** models diverse human actions and preferences using either explicit categories or latent distributions.

\subsection{Human Trajectory Prediction for Robot Planning}
\label{seq:traj_prediction}
% To navigate safely in a shared space with humans, robots rely on human trajectory predictions to perform predictive planning.
Early works on robot planning do not consider human motion models **Khatib et al., "Dynamic Motion Planning for Human-Robot Interaction"**.
In recent social predictive planning, the most commonly adopted heuristic is the constant velocity model.
Another classic model is the Social Force model **Helbing et al., "Simulating dynamical features in open access: Redesigning social force"** which considers multiple factors that can influence human motions.
Recent learning-based methods have achieved outstanding prediction accuracy on large-scale pedestrian datasets **Liu et al., "Predicting Pedestrian Trajectories with Recurrent Neural Networks"**.
Existing robot planners have integrated these human predictors into the system **Khatib et al., "Human-Robot Interaction through Dynamic Motion Planning and Control"**.
However, few methods have compared the effect of different prediction methods over downstream planning.
Through our experiment, we show that our model not only produces more accurate predictions, but also ensures safety and efficiency in robot planning.
