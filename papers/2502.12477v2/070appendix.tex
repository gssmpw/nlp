\subsection{Details of Conducting the Expert Study}
\label{subsec:appendix_human_eval_conduct}

To conduct the human evaluation, participants were first required to review and sign a consent form that outlined the study's purpose, data privacy, and the voluntary nature of their participation (\autoref{fig:savaal-consent}). After signing the consent form, participants completed a blind evaluation form consisting of 20 randomly selected questions from \name and \Baseline. They assessed each question based on clarity, depth of understanding, quality of choices, and overall usability (\autoref{fig:savaal-form}). All responses were anonymized, and participants had the option to withdraw from the study at any time.
