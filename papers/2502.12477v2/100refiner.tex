\subsection{Attempts to Refine Quality of Choices}
\label{appendix:choice-refine}
As shown in human evaluation~\autoref{fig:human-eval-disagree-paper}, the difference between the quality of choice of \Baseline and \TheSystem in short documents is not much. In both systems, the choices are generated alongside the question statement.

To further improve the quality of answer choices, we attempted to use the LLM to refine the incorrect options in the generated questions while keeping the correct answer unchanged, following the prompt in \autoref{fig:refine_prompt}. We evaluated this approach on 100 questions by incorporating the option refiner into \name and conducting a survey with human experts. However, the experts did not favor the refined questions, as the refiner often introduced ambiguity in the incorrect choices or unintentionally made multiple options correct.

\textbf{Instructions}: \\
{You are given the following information about a multiple-choice question: \\

\textbf{Main Idea}: $\{\text{main\_idea}\}$ \\

\textbf{Relevant Passages}: $\{\text{passages}\}$ \\
\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{Question}: $\{\text{question}\}$ \\

\textbf{Current Options}: $\{\text{options}\}$ \\

\textbf{Correct Answer}: $\{\text{correct\_answer}\}$ \\
\vspace{3mm}
Your task is to refine the three INCORRECT options in a way that:
\begin{itemize}[label=-,nosep]
    \item They remain closely related to the topic of the CORRECT option.
    \item They are incorrect but not obviously off-topic.
    \item They are PLAUSIBLE enough to confuse the reader.
    \item The correct option (and its label) must REMAIN UNCHANGED.
    \item The three incorrect options should ALIGN with the context of the correct answer; 
          for example, if the question asks about advantages, a distractor that lists disadvantages would be considered bad.
\end{itemize}

Return the final question, the NEW options, and the correct answer. \\
\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{REMEMBER}: \\
The correct answer is: $\{\text{correct\_answer}\}$.
