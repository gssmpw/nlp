\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we provide detailed studies of the benefits of including multiple-space information to solve NAD tasks from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Based on the results, we design SpaceGNN, an ensemble of diverse GNNs within Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces, that can effectively handle difficulties in real NAD tasks, such as the appearance of complicated architectures, the need for powerful models, and limited labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceGNN consistently outperforms other SOTA competitors by a significant margin, demonstrating our proposed SpaceGNN is an effective identifier for NAD tasks.
