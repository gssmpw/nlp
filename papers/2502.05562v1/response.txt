Recently, the integration of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks has been widely studied. In this response, we will explore some applications of LLMs.

One such application is database management systems (DBMS). Modern DBMS expose hundreds of configurable knobs to control system behaviors. Determining the appropriate values for these knobs to improve DBMS performance can be challenging. Recent advancements in database tuning systems have explored the integration of large language models to enhance performance optimization. $\lambda$-Tune presents an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to optimize database systems adaptively based on varying workloads. $\lambda$-Tune exploits information from an input set of queries, in order to tune an input database system in a workload-adaptive manner.

Another application is data cleaning. Table-GPT introduces a "table-tuning" paradigm to enhance the performance of language models like GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT on table-related tasks. By synthesizing diverse training data from real tables, the model is fine-tuned to improve its understanding and manipulation of tabular data, achieving notable advancements in tasks such as data transformation, question answering, and error detection.

In addition, LLMs can also be used for text-to-SQL, query planning, and query rewriting. Text-to-SQL aims at automatically translating natural language questions into SQL queries. BIRD is proposed to narrow the gap between Text-to-SQL research and its real-world deployment. GPT-DB presents a system that utilizes GPT-4 to automatically generate code for SQL processing in general-purpose programming languages like Python, based on user-provided natural language instructions.

Furthermore, LLMs have been applied in various other tasks such as predicting data correlations____, text-to-SQL____, and code generation____. These studies underscore the potential of LLMs in enhancing database tuning processes and improving performance efficiency.

In summary, this response highlights some applications of large language models in various fields.
