\subsection{LLMs for Time Series Analysis}
The application of LLMs to time series tasks has garnered increasing attention from researchers. For instance, TIME-LLM repurposed an existing LLM for time series forecasting while maintaining the original architecture of the language model____. 
% This approach reformatted time series data into textual prototypes, allowing for alignment between textual and time series representations.
Similarly, LLMTIME____ leveraged pretrained LLMs for continuous time series prediction by encoding numerical values as text and generating forecasts through text-based completions. However, this method primarily focuses on the temporal dimension, overlooking spatial dependencies in the data.
To address spatial considerations, GATGPT integrated a graph attention network with GPT to perform spatio-temporal imputation____. 
Furthermore, researchers have explored the use of LLMs for interpreting sensor data to facilitate real-world sensing____.

% \subsection{LLMs for Time Series}

% Several researchers have investigated the potential of using LLMs for time series applications. 
% For example, TIME-LLM adapted an existing LLM for time series forecasting while preserving the original language model structure____. The model reprogrammed the input time series as text prototypes, facilitating alignment between text and time series modalities.
% LLMTIME____ harnessed pretrained LLMs for continuous time series forecasting by representing numerical values in textual format and generating extrapolations through text completions. This model, however, only addresses the temporal dimension of the data, neglecting spatial aspects.
% GATGPT combined the graph attention network with GPT for spatial-temporal imputation____, enhancing the LLM's ability to understand spatial dependencies, though it somewhat neglects the temporal aspects. Besides, some researchers propose to use LLMs to understand sensor data to sense the physical world____. 
% However, these methods, designed specifically for time series forecasting and understanding, are not suitable for transportation sensor data compression and reconstruction. Therefore, we propose \SystemNameâ€”a system that can effectively reconstruct compressed sensor data by leveraging the extensive knowledge base of LLMs.



% LoRa is an emerging wireless communication technology designed specifically for long-range and low-power communications. The low data rate and long airtime feature of LoRa bring new research challenges. To address these challenges, several key generation systems for LoRa networks have been proposed in recent years. For example, LoRa-Key____ is the first RSSI-based key generation method for LoRa. In their follow-up research____, a variant RSSI feature, register RSSI, is exploited, which can provide finer granularity of channel sampling for key generation. 
% Recently, Yang \textit{et al.}____ utilized the mean value of adjacent rRSSI (arRSSI) of LoRa signals for key establishment on Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios. 
% However, the performance of these systems is limited because of the use of coarse-grained channel characteristics and inefficient quantization mechanism. Our work differs from existing studies in two aspects. First, we propose a novel LoRa-specific channel characteristics that can provide fine-grained channel state information. Second, we propose a novel PCS-based key delivery method instead of using quantization-based key generation methods.  

% \textbf{Compressed Sensing.} 
% Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique used to reconstruct signals efficiently by finding solutions for underdetermined linear systems. In addition to data compression, it can also  be applied in IoT security schemes ____. For example, 
% H2B____ used a compressed sensing-based reconciliation method to correct key mismatches due to the low SNR of the heartbeat interval signals. Additionally, Kryptein____ proposed a compressed sensing-based encryption method to enable secure data queries for cloud-enabled IoT systems. Dautov \textit{et al.}____ explored the feasibility of constructing secure compressed sensing matrices based on wireless physical-layer security.
% These existing works apply compressed sensing to different IoT security scenarios, which inspires this paper to pioneer the use of a compressed sensing framework for wireless key generation. Unlike existing studies that used standard compressed sensing techniques for IoT security, our work uses the perturbed version of compressed sensing for the physical-layer key generation, which is more practical in real-world applications.


% \textbf{LoRa Security.}
% With massive deployments of LoRa networks, the security issues have attracted significant efforts____, with an emphasis on key management, authentication, and physical-layer key generation. 
% For key management, existing works mainly focus on the derivation, distribution, and destruction process of application layer keys, including DevNonce____ and NwkSKey____. 
% Additionally, researchers have exploited different features of LoRa signals resulted from hardware imperfections for device authentication purpose, such as carrier frequency offset____, amplitude-phase____, and signal spectrogram____. 
% However, such methods generally suffer from heavy computation cost and poor scalability. 
% Thus, key generation has emerged as a promising solution for secure wireless communication due to its high energy efficiency and prior-free requirements compared with the aforementioned schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel secret key generation scheme to provide robust and lightweight key establishment for LoRa networks.
