\section{Conclusion}
\label{Sec-Conclusion}
% In this paper, we propose \textbf{RSL} (\textbf{R}esonance-based \textbf{S}eparate and \textbf{L}earn), a novel framework for category-free out-of-distribution node detection in graphs. By revealing and leveraging the \textbf{Feature Resonance} phenomenon, which reveals the distinct behavior of ID and OOD node representations during optimization, RSL effectively identifies OOD nodes without requiring multi-category labels. Our experiments show that RSL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various datasets. Additionally, we enhance OOD detection by generating synthetic OOD nodes using SGLD, further improving classifier performance.

% This work introduces the new concept of \textbf{Feature Resonance}, proposes the \textbf{RSL} framework, and demonstrates its theoretical and empirical effectiveness in category-free OOD node detection.

% In this paper, we unveil \textbf{Feature Resonance} as a novel concept for category-free OOD detection, highlighting how unlabeled ID samples exhibit more significant representation changes than OOD samples during optimization on labeled ID samples. To handle real-world complexities, we propose a label-independent micro-level proxy by measuring the movement of
% representation vectors in one step during training to capture this phenomenon. We integrate it with synthetic OOD generation via SGLD into our \textbf{R}esonance-based \textbf{S}eparation and \textbf{L}earning (\textbf{RSL}) framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering an efficient solution for category-free OOD node detection.



In this paper, we introduce the concept of \textbf{Feature Resonance} for category-free OOD detection, demonstrating that unknown ID samples undergo more substantial representation changes compared to OOD samples during the optimization of known ID samples, even in the absence of multi-category labels. To effectively capture this phenomenon, we propose a label-independent, micro-level proxy that measures feature vector movements in a single training step. Building on this, we present the \textbf{RSL} framework, which integrates the micro-level feature resonance with synthetic OOD node generation via SGLD, enhancing OOD detection performance and offering an efficient and practical solution for category-free OOD node detection.
