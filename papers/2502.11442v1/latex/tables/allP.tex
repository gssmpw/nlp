       Type  & Prompt Content \\
    \midrule
    Prompt A &  I will provide you with two pairs of questions and answers. Determine if these two question-answer pairs \\&contain similar information. Output "yes" or "no" and explain why. \\
    &Question 1: \{question1\} Answer 1: \{answer1\}, Question 2: \{question2\} Answer 2: \{answer2\} \\
    \midrule

    Prompt B & I will provide you a pair of question-answer and a facet (user's hidden intention).\\& Judge whether the answer aligns with the facet intention. If yes, generate: "intention reached". \\
    & Facet intention: \textit{facet\_intention}, Question: \textit{question}, Answer: \textit{answer} \\
    \midrule

    Prompt $\Theta_{\text{initial}}$ & \textbf{Examples:}\\
    & Example 1: \\
    & \textbf{Facet:} How to fix a car engine.\\& \textbf{Question:} Do you want to buy a car? \textbf{Answer:} No, I am not looking to buy a car.\\[5pt]
    & Example 2: \\
    & \textbf{Facet:} Find coffee shops near me. \\&\textbf{Question:} Would you like to make a cup of coffee? \textbf{Answer:} No, thank you, I want to buy one.\\[5pt]
    & I provided you with some examples above. Now, modify the following answer so that it is connected to the question\\&and doesn't reveal the hidden intention of the facet like in the examples. Ensure your answer doesn't violate the facet.\\[5pt]
    & \textbf{Prompt:}\\
    & Imagine you are a user answering an agent question. Modify this answer without revealing any hidden intention\\& of the facet and without violating the facet.\\[5pt]
    & Facet: \{facet\}, Question 1: \{question1\}, Answer 1: \{answer1\}, \{examples\}   \\
    \midrule
    
    Prompt $\Theta_{\text{partial}}$ & \textbf{Examples:}\\
    & Example 1: \\
    & \textbf{Facet:} The user wants to buy a red car.\\&\textbf{Question:} Are you looking for a specific color? \textbf{Answer:} I am considering a color, but I haven't decided fully yet.\\[5pt]
    & Example 2: \\
    & \textbf{Facet:} I'm looking for the car-part.com website.\\&\textbf{Question:} Do you want to sell used car parts? \textbf{Answer:} For now, I am mainly focused on finding a website.\\[5pt]
    & I provided you with some examples above. Now, modify the following answer to reveal only a partial abstract of the \\& hidden intention (facet) and hint at the user's interests without revealing the full intention\\[5pt]
    & \textbf{Prompt:}\\
    &Imagine you are a user answering an agent question. Modify the following answer to reveal \\&only a partial abstract of the hidden intention (facet). Do \textbf{NOT} reveal the full hidden intention.\\[5pt]
    & Facet: \{facet\} Question 3: \{question2\} Answer 3: \{answer2\} \{examples\} \\
    \midrule

    Prompt $\Theta_{\text{final}}$ & \textbf{Examples:}\\
    & Example 1: \\
    & \textbf{Facet:} The user wants to buy a red car.\\&\textbf{Question:} Are you looking for a specific color? \textbf{Answer:} Yes, I am looking for a red car to buy.\\[5pt]
    & Example 2: \\
    & \textbf{Facet:} I'm looking for the car-part.com website.\\&\textbf{Question:} Do you want to sell used car parts? \textbf{Answer:} No, I am just looking for the car-part.com website.\\[5pt]
    & I provided you with some examples above. Now, modify the following answer to fully reveal the hidden intention \\ & in a clear and direct manner, and ensure that the answer reflects the facet without ambiguity.\\[5pt]
    & \textbf{Prompt:}\\
    &Imagine you are a user answering an agent question. Modify the following answer to fully reveal the hidden facet.\\& Ensure that the answer clearly reflects the facet.\\[5pt]
    & Facet: \{facet\}, Question 3: \{question3\}, Answer 3: \{answer3\}, \{examples\}  \\
