\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we aim to adapt a pre-trained VLM for use in robotic deployment environments \textit{without} pre-defining a closed-set of classes. To this end, QueryAdapter is explored to rapidly adapt a pre-trained VLM in response to natural language queries. Concurrently, a method is proposed to perform adaptation using a raw data stream containing many open-query objects. This approach has been demonstrated to improve object retrieval from natural language queries in a variety of real-world scenes. We anticipate that this research will guide how VLMs should be adapted for use in downstream robotic tasks.
