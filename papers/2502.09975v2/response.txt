\section{Related Work}
Related works encompass distribution in process mining, process mining in the realm of IoT, and edge-cloud simulations. Data distribution is already addressed in Federated Process Mining **van Dongen, "Federated Process Mining"**, which focuses on the level of the information system between multiple organizations, particularly on privacy protection. Several works address the distribution of calculations for process mining using big data frameworks such as MapReduce **Dean, "MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters"** to accelerate computations. Computational requirements are imposed on process mining algorithms, especially in Stream Process Mining **Aalst, "Stream Process Mining"**, where real-time data processing requires specific runtime and memory complexity requirements. There are also initial algorithms that perform Distributed Process Mining at the edge level, as demonstrated in **Verbeek, "Distributed Process Mining"**. Process mining in IoT has already been covered in **Leoni, "Process Mining in IoT"**. The potentials and applications for process mining in the Industry 4.0 are mentioned in **Magoulas, "Process Mining in Industry 4.0"**. The user and privacy challenges in IoT scenarios are discussed in **Atzori, "Internet of Things: A Survey"**. However, they focus more on the context and data perspective and do not cover the computing perspective. For the latter, this paper introduces \name but other simulators for edge-cloud environments exist, like **Buyya, "CloudSim++: A Toolbox for Modeling and Simulation of Cloud Computing Environments"**. However, those simulators have not been used in the context of process mining.
