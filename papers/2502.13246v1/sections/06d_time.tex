% \subsection{Comparison between time periods}

% Our dataset, evaluations, and analyses focus on tweets from February 2018-December 2019. We briefly explore how dehumanizing metaphor use has changed since then. We calculate metaphor scores from an additional 100K tweets from June 2021 - May 2023.\footnote{All tweets are written by US-based authors with associated ideology estimates. This set of newer tweets is not included in other analyses, as covariate and user engagement variables could not be collected due to the shutdown of the Twitter API. We caution that our methodology was not separately validated for the newer tweets.} Between these time periods, \textsc{war} and \textsc{animal} decreased among liberals and remained stable among conservatives (Figure \ref{fig:time_comparison}). \textsc{pressure}, \textsc{parasite}, and \textsc{vermin} largely remained stable for liberals and increased for conservatives. \textsc{commodity} and \textsc{water} had the greatest increase for both liberals and conservatives.
