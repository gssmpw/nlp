\section{Analysis}

We infer metaphor scores for each of the seven source domains for all 400K tweets in our dataset. See Appendix Figures \ref{fig:scores_boxplot}-\ref{fig:scores_by_ideology} for descriptive statistics of metaphor scores. We verify face validity by manually inspecting 50 tweets with highest scores for each source domain, a selection of which are shown in Appendix Table \ref{tab:tweets}, along with the corresponding concepts and authors' ideologies.  

Our analysis uses two sets of regression models. The first set quantifies the role of political ideology and ideological strength in metaphor use (ยง\ref{reg1}), and the second set quantifies the association between metaphor, ideology, and user engagement.
