\section{Appendix}

This appendix contains additional details about our annotation process (§\ref{annotation}), methodology (§\ref{model-details}), model evaluation (§\ref{eval}), and analysis (§\ref{analysis}).


\subsection{Annotation Details}
\label{annotation}

This section includes details about annotator demographics, annotation statistics, the heuristic-based sampling procedure, and the full codebook.

\subsubsection{Sampling for Annotation}
\label{sampling}

The prevalence of metaphorical language with respect to each source domain concept is not known a-priori. Instead of randomly sampling tweets for human annotation, we thus adopt a stratified sampling approach using scores from a baseline model (\texttt{GPT-4-Turbo, Simple Prompt}) as a heuristic. 

We get heuristic scores from the baseline model for a set of 20K documents, which we call $D$. For each concept $c$, we sample $n_c$ documents from $D$. Let $h_c$ be the heuristic metaphor score with respect to $c$. $Q_{0,c} \in D$ is then the set of documents with $h_c = 0$. $Q_{i,c} \in D$ where $i = 1,2,...,k-1$ are the $k-1$ quantiles of documents with $h_c > 0$. The annotation sample for each concept is then: $$S_c = Sample(Q_{0,c},\frac{n_c}{k}) \cup  \bigcup_{i=1}^{k-1}Sample(Q_{i,c},\frac{n_c}{k})$$ Using $k=5$ strata, we sample $n_c=200$ tweets for each source domain. We additionally sample 200 documents for \textit{domain-agnostic} metaphor.

Below are examples of tweets from different strata for the \textsc{water} concept:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item $Q_{0,\textsc{water}}$: \textit{How about we help US citizens with cancer before spending money on illegals} 
    \item $Q_{2,\textsc{water}}$: \textit{Tough reading. A report on some of the facilities to which the migrant children are shipped after the American government abducts them from their parents. This despicable practice is a permanent stain on the US}
    \item $Q_{4,\textsc{water}}$: \textit{An overwhelming flood of illegal aliens for the middle class to pay for.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

    \caption{Comparison of GPT-4o-based metaphor scoring models that vary in prompt (\textit{Simple} or \textit{Descriptive}) and whether document-level associations are incorporated with SBERT embeddings. The x-axis represents different classification thresholds (i.e., percent of annotators who label a tweet as metaphorical). Across all thresholds, including SBERT improves performance.}
    \label{fig:auc_by_threshold}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Evaluation}
\label{eval}
Tables \ref{tab:auc30_concepts}-\ref{tab:spearman} shows full model evaluation results across concepts (using ROC-AUC at the 30\% threshold) and Spearman correlations between predicted and annotated scores, respectively. Figure \ref{fig:auc_by_threshold} shows performance at different classification thresholds for \texttt{GPT-4o} approaches. While \texttt{SBERT} on its own has the lowest performance, including SBERT scores in the \texttt{GPT-4o} approaches consistently improves performance across all thresholds.

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{analysis}

\subsubsection{Descriptive Analysis of Scores}
\label{analysis-descriptive}
This section includes descriptive analyses of metaphor scores (§\ref{analysis-descriptive}), results for all regression-based analyses (§\ref{analysis-ideology}, \ref{analysis-engagement}), and example tweets with high metaphor scores (Table \ref{tab:tweets}).

% \end{figure}



%Figure \ref{fig:time_comparison} shows the relative change in metaphor scores between 2018-2019 and 2021-2023. Compared to liberals, conservatives have a larger relative increase in metaphor scores across all concepts. However, both liberals and conservatives share the same trends. In the later time period, liberals decrease their use of \textsc{war} and \textsc{animal} metaphors and conservatives' use of these metaphors are stable. Liberals have little change in their use of \textsc{pressure}, \textsc{parasite}. and \textsc{vermin} metaphors, while conservatives' show a moderate increase. Conservatives and liberals both increase their use of \textsc{commodity} and \textsc{water} metaphors, with conservatives having the largest relative change. This may suggest that \textsc{commodity} and \textsc{water} metaphors are becoming more conventionalized across the ideological spectrum.

\subsubsection{Role of Ideology in Metaphor}
\label{analysis-ideology}

Figures \ref{fig:ideology_strength_frames} shows average marginal effects from regression models that include issue-generic policy frames as fixed effects \citep{mendelsohn2021modeling}. This regression also facilitates analysis of the relationships between issue-generic policy frames, metaphor, and ideology (Figure \ref{fig:frame-heatmap}). Aligning with expectations, some issue-generic frames are strongly associated with particular metaphorical concepts (e.g., \textit{economic} for \textsc{commodity} and \textit{security} for \textsc{war}), and metaphors are more readily used with some frames compared to others (e.g., \textit{security} is more metaphorical than \textsc{cultural identity}). Tables \ref{tab:ideology_effect} and \ref{tab:ideology_effect_frames} show full regression coefficients from models that exclude and include issue-generic frames, respectively.






\subsubsection{Role of Metaphor in Engagement}
\label{analysis-engagement}

Figures \ref{fig:favorite} and \ref{fig:favorite_frames} shows the average marginal effect of metaphor on favoriting behavior, excluding and including issue-generic frames as fixed effects respectively. Figure \ref{fig:retweet_frames} illustrates average marginal effects for retweets, controlling for frames. All regression coefficients for both sets of models can be found in Tables \ref{tab:engagement}-\ref{tab:engagement_frames}.
