\section{Algorithm Implementation} \label{sec:impl}
To conduct our experiments, we provide the heuristic algorithm that we designed for the $k'$-colorful nearest neighbor problem, based on the provable algorithms provided in the main paper. The provable indexing algorithm (\ref{alg:indexing}) has a runtime which is quadratic in the size of the data set and is slow in practice. This situation mimics the original DiskANN algorithm~\cite{jayaram2019diskann}, where the ``slow preprocessing" algorithm  has provable guarantees~\cite{indykxu2024worst} but quadratic running time, and was replaced by a heuristic ``fast preprocessing'' algorithm used in the actual implementation~\cite{DiskANN}. 
%As the aforementioned algorithms are designed to tackle the most general problem and =. Here 
Here, Algorithm~\ref{alg:colorindex} offers a fast method tailored for the $k'$-colorful case, using several heuristics to improve the runtime. In the following section, we present the pseudocode for the procedures: search, index build, and the pruning procedure required for the index build.

%We compare the query performance and accuracy of our algorithm with several baselines, on both real-world shopping data sets and  other data sets where the seller information is synthetically generated. In the remainder of the section, we provide details on our fast implementation of our algorithm, details regarding the datasets and baselines and the results.

%Graph-based similarity search indices are constructed so that greedy search quickly converges to the nearest neighbors  of a query vector $q$. We first describe a natural adaptation of greedy search to account for $k'$-color NN problem and an index construction procedure that allows search to converge to the right answer with relatively few distance comparisons.

\paragraph{Diverse Search.}
Our diverse search procedure, is a greedy graph-based local search method. In our search method, in each step, we maintain a list of best and diverse nodes, ensuring that at most $k'$ points are selected in the list per color. In each iteration of our search algorithm, we choose the best unexplored node and examine its out neighbors. From the union of our current list and the out neighbors, we select the best diverse set of nodes while satisfying the \(k'\)-colorful diversity constraintâ€”meaning no color can have more than \(k'\) points in the updated list. To identify the optimal diverse set from the union, we use a priority queue designed to accommodate the diversity constraint. Below, we present the pseudocode for this diverse priority queue.
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Insert $(p,d,c)$ into \diversequeue(Q, $L$, $k'$)}
\label{alg:diverse_queue}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input}: Current queue $Q$, tuple $(p,d,c)$ of (point, distance, color) for new insertion, maximum size $L$ of the queue, maximum size $k'$ per color. 
\STATE \textbf{Output}: Updated queue $Q$ after inserting $(p,d,c)$ which maintains the best set of at most $L$ points and at most $k'$ points of each color.
\STATE Let ${\sf count}({{c}}) \gets$ number of elements in $Q$ with the  color $c$.
\STATE Let ${\sf maxDist}({{c}}) \gets$ maximum distance of an element in $Q$ with color $c$.
\IF{${\sf count}({{c}}) < k'$ \textbf{or} $d < {\sf maxDist}({{c}})$}
    \STATE Insert $(p, d, c)$ into $Q$
    \IF{${\sf count}({{c}}) > k'$}
        \STATE Remove the element with the maximum distance in $Q$ having color $c$.
    \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\IF{$|Q| > L$}
    \STATE Remove the element with the maximum distance in $Q$.
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Building on the previous explanation of the diverse priority queue, we outline the description of our diverse search procedure as follows.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{$\diversesearch(G,s,q,k',k,L)$}
\label{alg:color_search}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE \textbf{Input}: A directed graph $G$, start node $s$, query $q$, max per color parameter $k'$, search list size $L$.
\STATE \textbf{Output}: A set of $k$ points such that there are at most $k'$ points from any color.
\STATE {Initialize} \diversequeue $\mathcal{L} \leftarrow \{(s,D(s,q),col[s]) \}$ with color parameter $k'$ and size parameter $L$.  
\STATE {Initialize} a set of expanded nodes $\mathcal{V} \leftarrow \emptyset$\;
\WHILE{$\mathcal{L} \setminus \mathcal{V} \neq \emptyset$}
        \STATE $\text{Let } p^{*} \leftarrow \argmin\limits_{p \in \mathcal{L} \setminus \mathcal{V}} D(p,q)$\;
        \STATE $\mathcal{V} \leftarrow \mathcal{V} \cup \{p^{*}\}$\;
        % \State $\mathcal{L} \leftarrow \mathcal{L} \cup \{ \left(p, D(p,q) , col[p] \right) \, : \, p \in N_{\text{out}}(p^*)\}$\;
        \STATE Insert $\{\left(p, D(p,q), col[p]\right):p \in N_{\text{out}}(p^*)\}$ to $\mathcal{L}$\;
        % \If{$F_q \cap F_{p^{*}} \neq \emptyset$}{
        %     \State \hspace{0.02cm} $\mathcal{L} \leftarrow \mathcal{L} \cup N_{\text{out}}(p^{*})$\;
        % }
%        \State Pick at most $L$ best diverse candidate out of $\mathcal{L}$. \knote{Add more description here}
\ENDWHILE
\STATE \textbf{Return} $[\text{top } k \text{ NNs from } \mathcal{L}; \mathcal{V}]$\;
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}



\paragraph{Diverse Prune.} A key subroutine in our index-building algorithm is the prune procedure. Given a node $p$ and a set of potential outgoing edges $\mathcal{V}$, the standard prune procedure removes an edge to a vertex \(w\) if there exists a vertex \(u\) such that an edge \(p \rightarrow u\) exists and the condition \(D(u, w) \leq \frac{D(p, w)}{\alpha}\) is satisfied. Intuitively, this means that to reach \(w\), we would first reach \(u\), thus making multiplicative progress and eliminating the need for the edge \(p \rightarrow w\), which contributes to the sparsity of the graph.

However, to account for diversity, the outgoing edges from the node must also be diverse and enable access to multiple colors. To address this requirement, we modify the standard prune procedure to incorporate the diversity constraint. The details of our revised algorithm are provided next.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{$\diverseprune(p, \mcV,\alpha,R,m)$}
\label{alg:colorprune}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\small
\STATE \textbf{Input}: A point $p$, set $\mcV$, prune parameter $\alpha$, degree parameter $R$, and diversity parameter $m$.
\STATE \textbf{Output}: A subset $\mcV' \subseteq \mcV$ of cardinality at most $R$ to which edges are added.
\STATE Sort all points $u\in \mcV$ based on their distances from $p$ and add them to list $\mcL$ in that order.
\STATE Initialize sets $\blockers[u] \gets \emptyset$ for each $u \in \mcV$.
    \WHILE{$\mcL$ is not empty}
        \STATE $u\gets \argmin\limits_{u\in \mcL}D(u,p)$
        \STATE $\mcV' \gets \mcV' \cup \{u\}$ and $\mcL \gets \mcL \setminus \{u\}$
        \IF{$|\mcV'| = R$}
             \STATE {\bf break}
        \ENDIF
        \FOR{each point $w\in \mcL$}
            \IF{$D(u,w)\le D(p,w)/\alpha$}
                \STATE $\blockers[w]\gets \blockers[w]\cup \{{ col}(u)\}$
                \IF{$|\blockers[w]| = m$ or ${col}(u) = {col}(w)$}
                    \STATE {$\mcL \gets \mcL \setminus \{w\}$}
                \ENDIF
            \ENDIF
        \ENDFOR
    \ENDWHILE
\STATE{\bf Return } $\mcV'$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\paragraph{Diverse Index.} Our indexing algorithm follows the same approach as the DiskANN ``fast preprocessing" heuristic implementation~\cite{DiskANN}, but we replace the search and prune procedures in their implementation with our diverse search and diverse prune procedures. The details of our index-building procedure are provided below.

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{$\diverseindex(P,\alpha,L,R,m)$}
\label{alg:colorindex}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\small
\STATE \textbf{Input}: A set of $n$ points $P=\{p_1,\dots,p_{n} \}$, prune parameter $\alpha$, search list size $L$, degree parameter $R$, and  diversity parameter $m$.
\STATE \textbf{Output}: A directed graph $G$ over $P$ with out-degree at most $ R$.
    \STATE Let $s$ denote the estimated medoid of $P$.\;
    \STATE Initialize $G$ with start node $s$.\;
     
    \FOR{each $p_i\in P$}
        \STATE $\text{Let } [\mathcal{L}; \mathcal{V}] \leftarrow \diversesearch\left(G,s, p_{i}, k' = L/m, L, L \right)$ \; 
        \STATE Let $\mcV' = \diverseprune\left(p_i, \mathcal{V}, \alpha, R, m\right)$.
        \STATE Add node $p_i$ to $G$ and set $N_{\text{out}}(p_{i})= \mcV'$ (out-going edges from $p_i$ to $\mcV'$).\;
        \FOR{$p \in N_{out}(p_i)$}
            \STATE $\text{Update } N_{\text{out}}(p) \leftarrow N_{\text{out}}(p) \cup \{p_i\}$.\;
            \IF{$|N_{\text{out}}(p)| > R$}
                \STATE \textbf{Run} \diverseprune($p, N_{\text{out}}(p), \alpha, R,m$) to update out-neighbors of  $p$.\;
                \ENDIF
\ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
