\section{Related Work}
Nearest Neighbor Search with diversity requirement has been previously studied in the work of~\cite{abbar2013real,abbar2013diverse}, where they presented a ``diversified version'' of the {\em Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)} approach due to~\cite{indyk1998approximate}. However, their diversification approach does not carry over to the graph-based methods.
Moreover, they provide a bi-criteria approximation only for the {\em dual formulation} of the problem, and do not consider the primal formulation.
Finally, the distance functions $D$ that they consider are limited to Hamming distance or its variants like the Jaccard similarity~\cite{abbar2013real}. Although it is plausible that the result could be extended to other distances that are supported by LSH functions, not all distance functions satisfy this constraint.
