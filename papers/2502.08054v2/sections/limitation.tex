\section{Limitations}


\ourmethod~offers notable improvements in learning efficiency and generalisation compared to baselines and prior occluded grasping methods. 
However, there are some limitations to consider.
Firstly, \ourmethod~struggles with unseen objects of significantly different shapes, which could be addressed by training the teacher and student policy with a more diverse set of geometries. 
Additionally, \ourmethod~faces challenges with round objects in the real world, where stabilisation during occluded grasping is difficult. 
This issue could be mitigated through a closed-loop control approach, such as learning a residual policy for real-time constraint pose adjustments.
