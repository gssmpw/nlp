\section{Conclusion} 
We present \ourmethod, a bimanual robotic system for occluded grasping tasks.
By introducing a constraint policy and value function-guided policy coordination that refine the generated constraint pose using gradients from a value function, we demonstrate that the coordinated policies can efficiently learn to solve challenging occluded grasping tasks.
Furthermore, the trained teacher policies are distilled into student policies without dependence on privileged information for real-world deployment.
Through empirical evaluation, we show that \ourmethod~achieves significantly better performance compared to a state-of-the-art baseline and instantiations of \ourmethod~in both simulated and real-world environments.
