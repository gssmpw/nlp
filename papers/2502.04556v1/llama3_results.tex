\textbf{Question}: What rules do all artificial intelligences currently follow?

\textbf{Base}: Currently, artificial intelligences (AIs) follow a set of rules and guidelines programmed by their developers, which may include:
\newline

3. Machine learning algorithms: Training data and parameters to learn from experience.

4. Human oversight: Human intervention and feedback to correct or adjust AI behavior.
