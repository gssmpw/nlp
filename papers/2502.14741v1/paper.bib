	abstract = {The Credit Assignment Problem (CAP) refers to the longstanding challenge of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to associate actions with their long-term consequences. Solving the CAP is a crucial step towards the successful deployment of RL in the real world since most decision problems provide feedback that is noisy, delayed, and with little or no information about the causes. These conditions make it hard to distinguish serendipitous outcomes from those caused by informed decision-making. However, the mathematical nature of credit and the CAP remains poorly understood and defined. In this survey, we review the state of the art of Temporal Credit Assignment (CA) in deep RL. We propose a unifying formalism for credit that enables equitable comparisons of state-of-the-art algorithms and improves our understanding of the trade-offs between the various methods. We cast the CAP as the problem of learning the influence of an action over an outcome from a finite amount of experience. We discuss the challenges posed by delayed effects, transpositions, and a lack of action influence, and analyse how existing methods aim to address them. Finally, we survey the protocols to evaluate a credit assignment method and suggest ways to diagnose the sources of struggle for different methods. Overall, this survey provides an overview of the field for new-entry practitioners and researchers, it offers a coherent perspective for scholars looking to expedite the starting stages of a new study on the CAP, and it suggests potential directions for future research.},

Three strategies to maximize point-to-point link throughput were proposed: optimizations of non-uniformly and uniformly distributed launch power per channel and the optimization based on adjusting to the target 3 dB ratio between the power of linear amplified spontaneous emission and nonlinear interference noise. The results clearly emphasize the possibility to approach nearly optimal system performance by means of implementing pragmatic engineering sub-optimal optimization strategies.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

To do so, a new environment was designed and implemented to emulate the operation of MCF-EONs - taking into account the modulation format-dependent reach and intercore crosstalk (XT) - and four DRL agents were trained to solve the RMSCA problem. The blocking performance of the trained agents was compared through simulation to 3 baselines RMSCA heuristics. Results obtained for the NSFNet and COST239 network topologies under different traffic loads show that the best-performing agent achieves, on average, up to a four-times decrease in blocking probability with respect to the best-performing baseline heuristic method.},

	abstract = {As the services in elastic optical networks (EONs) are bandwidth-intensive, unpredictable and dynamic, increasing network factors are emerging to affect the performance of network survivable planning and operation from network capacity to efficiency. Most of the traditional protection and restoration approaches may become before long inefficient due to the improvement of a particular network performance metric always at the expense of others. We argue that it would be more beneficial for comprehensive optimization of network performance to consider main network metrics jointly. Moreover, the highly dynamic features of EONs call for the new generation of machine learning-based solutions that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamic nature of services to perform analytics. In this paper, we investigate the problem of global optimization of network performance under survivable EON environment. Specifically, a criterion, named the whole network cost-effectiveness value with survivability (WCES), is defined to measure the overall network performance by balancing the interaction among main network metrics. Then we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) -based heuristic with the objective of improving overall network performance, in which two agents are utilized to provide working and protection schemes converging toward better survivable routing, modulation level and spectrum assignment (S-RMLSA) policies. Numerical results show that the proposed criterion can efficiently measure the overall network performance, and the double-agent DRL-based heuristic can greatly improve WCES while ensuring the network survivability and paying the acceptable extra consumption of request blocking probability.},

GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

These networks leverage the programmability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and the adaptability of Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) to optimize network performance under dynamic traffic conditions. However, existing simulation tools often fall short in terms of transparency, flexibility, and advanced functionality, limiting their utility in cutting-edge research. In this paper, we present SDONSim, a fully open-source simulator designed to address these limitations and provide a comprehensive platform for SDON research. SDONSim integrates traditional routing and spectrum assignment algorithms with advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques, including support for the Stable Baselines 3 library. The simulator also offers robust unit testing, a fully functional graphical user interface (GUI), and extensive documentation to ensure usability and reliability. Performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of SDONSim in modeling complex network scenarios, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for advancing SDON research.},

	abstract = {Research on the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem has long been conducted with the aim of efficiently utilizing the frequency resources of optical networks. Given the recent progress in machine learning (ML) technology, it has been reported that the application of ML in various areas of optical network design, operation, and management has the potential to bring about new innovations such as autonomous optical network operation and highly accurate estimation of network conditions. With regard to the RSA problem, it is expected that an algorithm that achieves better accommodation efficiency than conventional heuristic methods can be realized by applying reinforcement learning (RL), which well supports training in a simulation environment. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate three techniques devised to apply RL more effectively to elastic optical networks (EONs): two pre-processing techniques called link-axis positional encoding (LPE) and slot-axis positional encoding (SPE) and a post-processing technique named the assignable boundary slot mask. First, we build a simple model in which the state data of the optical network, including frequency slot utilization, are input to the neural network of the RSA agent in RL and show that this model has difficulty outperforming the conventional heuristic RSA algorithm. Next, we build an RSA agent model with the proposed techniques and simulate the accommodation of dynamic optical paths to quantitatively demonstrate that the blocking probability can be reduced by 17\% compared to the conventional heuristic.},

					requires algorithms to find a
					suitable solution given the specific service requirements and the
					current network state. These algorithms are usually evaluated using a
					software simulator developed ad hoc, which may require different
					levels of detail depending on the problem addressed and how realistic
					the evaluation needs to be. Moreover, to demonstrate they are a
					significant contribution to the field, these new algorithms must be
					benchmarked against the best-performing previously proposed solutions.
					Due to the large set of parameters and their wide range of possible
					values, benchmarking algorithms from the literature is not
					straightforward and can quickly become challenging and time-consuming.
					This work introduces the
              Optical Networking
					Gym
              , an open-source toolkit that simplifies implementing
					optical resource assignment simulations and benchmarking new solutions
					against previously published algorithms. The toolkit provides
					environments modeling relevant optical networking scenarios, common
					algorithms for solving problems related to these scenarios, and a set
					of scripts to prepare and execute simulations for various use cases.
					Currently, four environments are available, with the possibility of
					increasing this number through contributions from the co-authors and
					the community. This paper describes the architecture, interface,
					environments, and scripts included with the toolkit. We adopt the
					quality of transmission (QoT)-aware dynamic resource allocation of
					optical services as the network scenario under examination. Three use
					cases highlight the toolkitâs modularity, flexibility, and
					performance. The toolkit allows researchers to streamline the process
					of developing simulation scenarios and algorithms, enhancing their
					ability to benchmark their algorithms.},

A network state-dependent route and core selection method is proposed using a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. The DNN is trained using a metaheuristic optimization algorithm to predict lightpath suitability, considering the quality of transmission and resource availability. Physical layer impairments, including inter-core crosstalk, amplified spontaneous emission, and Kerr fiber nonlinearities, are considered, and a random forest (RF)-based link noise estimator is proposed. A feature importance selection analysis is provided for all the features considered for the DNN classifier and the RF link noise estimator. The proposed machine-learning-enabled RMSCA approach is evaluated on three network topologies, USNET, NSFNET, and COST-239 with 7-core and 12-core fiber links. It is shown to be superior in terms of blocking probability, bandwidth blocking probability, and acceptable computational speed compared to the standard and published benchmarks at different traffic loads.},

Machine learning-based QoT estimation models have shown promise in ensuring the reliability and efficiency of optical networks. However, the data-driven nature of these models impedes their application in practical settings. To address the problem of limited data availability in the target domain, known as the few-shot learning problem, we propose a domain adversarial adaptation method that aligns the distributions of representations from different source and target domains by minimizing the domain discrepancy quantified by the approximate Wasserstein distance. We demonstrate the methodâs effectiveness through a theoretical proof and two example adaptations, i.e.,Â from simulation to experimental data and from experimental to real network data. Our method consistently outperforms commonly used artificial neural networks (ANNs) and more advanced transfer learning approaches for various target domain data sizes. More profoundly, we show two ways to further improve the prediction accuracy, i.e.,Â incorporating unlabeled target domain data in the training stage and utilizing the learned representations after training to train a new ANN with a reweighting strategy. In the adaptation to actual field data, our model, trained with only eight labeled network data samples, outperforms an ANN trained with 300 samples, thus reducing the labeled target domain data burden by more than 97\%. The proposed methodâs adaptability and generalizability make it a promising solution for accurate QoT estimation with low data requirements in future intelligent optical networks.},

	abstract = {Predicting the quality of transmission (QoT) is a critical task in the management and optimization of modern fiber-optic networks. Traditional machine learning (ML) QoT prediction models, typically trained on pre-collected datasets, are designed to make long-term predictions once deployed. However, this static training strategy often falls short in the face of time-dependent network evolution and variations. We identify the root cause of these shortcomings as shifts in data distribution, which are not accounted for in conventional static models. In response to these challenges, we propose an online continual learning pipeline that is specifically designed for stable QoT prediction in optical networks. This pipeline directly addresses the problem of distribution shifts by continuously updating the prediction model in response to real-time network data. We explore and compare various strategies within this framework and demonstrate that the integration of the adaptive retraining strategy and the regularized online continual learning algorithm (OCL-REG) significantly enhances the QoT prediction stability while optimizing the resource efficiency. OCL-REG demonstrates superior adaptability and stability, achieving an average cumulative mean squared error (C-MSE) of 0.19 on a testbench with a data distribution shift sequence containing 1000 batches. Moreover, the OCL-REG model requires fewer samples for adaptation, averaging around 107 samples, compared to the conventional retraining strategy, which requires an average of 253 samples. Our approach presents a paradigm shift in QoT prediction, moving from a static to a dynamic, lifelong learning model that is more attuned to the evolving realities of real fiber-optic networks.},

	abstract = {Flexi-grid technology has revolutionized optical networking by enabling Elastic Optical Networks (EONs) that offer greater flexibility and dynamism compared to traditional fixed-grid systems. As data traffic continues to grow exponentially, the need for efficient and scalable solutions to the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) problem in EONs becomes increasingly critical. The RSA problem, being NP-Hard, requires solutions that can simultaneously address both spatial routing and spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel quantum-based approach to solving the RSA problem. By formulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, we employ the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to effectively solve it. Our approach is specifically designed to minimize end-to-end delay while satisfying the continuity and contiguity constraints of frequency slots. Simulations conducted using the Qiskit framework and IBM-QASM simulator validate the effectiveness of our method. We applied the QAOA-based RSA approach to small network topology, where the number of nodes and frequency slots was constrained by the limited qubit count on current quantum simulator. In this small network, the algorithm successfully converged to an optimal solution in less than 30 iterations, with a total runtime of approximately 10.7 s with an accuracy of 78.8\%. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis between QAOA, integer linear programming, and deep reinforcement learning methods to evaluate the performance of the quantum-based approach relative to classical techniques. This work lays the foundation for future exploration of quantum computing in solving large-scale RSA problems in EONs, with the prospect of achieving quantum advantage as quantum technology continues to advance.},

Each of the algorithms for the selected single or dual lightpath enforces the constraints of spectrum continuity, contiguity of the slots, and non-overlapping of the spectra with the established lightpaths, maximizes the number of bits per symbol, and selects a specific core on each link of the path. Simulation studies performed for two sample networks showed that the crosstalk has a significant impact on the bandwidth blocking probability. The best results were obtained by iterating over all paths and all slots, selecting the lightpath with the lowest average crosstalk per slot, consisting of the most loaded cores.},

The dataset, focusing on core optical networks, comprises publicly accessible and ready-to-use topologies, including (a) 105 georeferenced real-world optical networks and (b) 270,900 validated synthetic topologies. Prior research on real-world core optical networks has been characterised by fragmented open data sources and disparate individual studies. Moreover, previous efforts have notably failed to provide synthetic data at a scale comparable to our present study. Topology Bench addresses this limitation, offering a unified resource and represents a 61.5\% increase in spatially-referenced real world optical networks. To benchmark and identify the fundamental nature of optical network topologies through the lens of graph-theoretical analysis, we analyse both real and synthetic networks using structural, spatial and spectral metrics. Our comparative analysis identifies constraints in real optical network diversity and illustrates how synthetic networks can complement and expand the range of topologies available for use. Currently, topologies are selected based on subjective criteria, such as preference, data availability, or perceived suitability, leading to potential biases and limited representativeness. Our framework enhances the generalisability of optical network research by providing a more objective and systematic approach to topology selection. A statistical and correlation analysis reveals the quantitative range of all of these graph metrics and the relationships between them. Finally, we apply unsupervised machine learning to cluster real-world topologies into distinctive groups using nine optimal graph metrics using K-means. We conclude the analysis by providing guidance on how to use such clusters to select a diverse set of topologies for future studies.},

	abstract = {The extension of elastic optical networks (EON) to multi-band transmission (MB-EON) shows promise in enhancing spectral efficiency, throughput, and long-term cost-effectiveness for telecom operators. However, designing MB-EON networks introduces complex challenges, notably the optimization of physical parameters like optical power and quality of transmission (QoT). Frequency-dependent characteristics of fiber, such as loss, dispersion, and nonlinear effects, alongside inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering, pose significant hurdles when extending beyond the L+C (LC) band to a continuous spectrum over 100 nm. In this study, we propose a span-by-span methodology for optimal power allocation, introducing two hyper-accelerated power optimization (HPO) strategies: flat launch power (FLP) and flat received power (FRP). These approaches significantly expedite network power optimization while preserving the stability of running services. Our comparative analysis of FLP and FRP models reveals that while FRP has a minimal effect on capacity (increasing less than 10 Tbps for an L+C+S (LCS) system over 100 km), it improves flatness and GSNR/OSNR metrics in the S-band by approximately 2/0 dB and 2.5/6 dB, respectively. A network-wide analysis across various topologies shows that the FRP technique enhances minimum GSNR, contributing to a throughput increase of 12\% to 75\%, depending on network scale, at a 1\% bandwidth blocking rate. Lastly, our application of HPO in MB-EON for both local and global power optimization demonstrates that while both approaches offer comparable performance, global optimization is simpler and more cost-effective for large-scale networks.},

This paper analyzes the performance of this type of MCF in multi-band EONs (MB-EONs). We investigate two band and space division multiplexing (BSDM) scenarios: MCF and a bundle of multi-fiber pairs (BuMFP). Furthermore, the UL-ICXT performance of two MCFs, one with the standard cladding diameter (CD = 125 micrometers) with 4 cores and another with a nonstandard larger CD with 7 cores, is evaluated in the US backbone network. Our findings show that, with careful design of the MCFs physical structure, even with a standard CD, it is possible to achieve UL-ICXT in C, L, and S-band long-haul BSDM EONs. Additionally, the simulation results show that network throughput for BSDM EONs with MCFs in the UL-ICXT regime is up to 12 percent higher than the BuMFP scenario, with capacity increasing linearly with the number of cores.},

This paper focuses on different strategies for implementing band and SDM elastic optical network (BSDM EON) technology and analyzes the total network capacity of three sizes of backbone metro-core networks: ultra-long-, long-, and medium-distance networks related to the United States, Japan, and Spain, respectively. Two BSDM strategies are considered, namely, multi-core fibers (MCFs) and BSDM based on standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) bundles of multi-fiber pairs (BuMFPs). For MCF-based BSDM, we evaluated the performance of four manufactured trench-assisted weakly coupled (TAWC) MCFs with 4, 7, 13, and 19 cores. Simulation results reveal that, in the regime of ultra-low (UL) loss and inter-core crosstalk (ICXT), MCF-based throughput can be up to 14\% higher than SSMF BuMFP-based BSDM when the core pitch exceeds 43Â Âµm and the loss coefficient is lower than that of standard single-mode fibers. However, increasing the number of cores with (non-)standard cladding diameters, UL loss, and ICXT coefficient is not beneficial. As core counts increase up to 13 for non-standard cladding diameters ({\textless}230Âµm), the core pitch and loss coefficient also increase, leading to degraded performance of MCF-based BSDM compared to SSMF BuMFP-based BSDM. The results indicate that, in scenarios with 19 MFPs, SSFM BuMFP-based BSDM outperforms 19-core MCF-based scenarios, increasing the throughput by 55\% to 73\%, from medium-backbone networks to ultra-long ones.},

To address this issue, the ultra-low loss and large effective area (ULL) fibers are successfully manufactured and expected to deployed in the existing optical networks. For such ULL fiber deployment, network operators prefer adding ULL fibers to each link rather than replace existing SSMFs, resulting in a scenario where both of SSMF and ULL fiber coexist on the same link. In this paper, we investigated the routing, fiber, modulation format, and spectrum allocation (RFMSA) problem in the context of an elastic optical network (EON) where ULL fiber and SSMF coexisting on each link under both the static and dynamic traffic demands. We formulated this RFMSA problem as a node-arc based Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model and developed Spectrum Window Plane (SWP)-based heuristic algorithms based on different fiber selection strategies, including spectrum usage based (SU), optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) aware, ULL fiber first (UFF), and random strategies. Simulation results show that in the static traffic demand situation, the RFMSA algorithm based on the OSNR-aware (OA) strategy exhibits optimal performance, attaining a performance similar to that of the MILP model regarding the maximum number of frequency slots (FSs) used in the entire network. Moreover, in the dynamic traffic demand scenario, the SU strategy remarkably surpasses the other strategies in terms of the lightpath blocking probability.},

Routing and spectrum allocation (RSA) is one of the most important determining factors of the design, performance, and operation of EONs. In this work, we propose an adaptive RSA algorithm based on the relative cost concept under which the transient effect when a call is admitted on a given route/spectrum set at a given network state is estimated. The algorithm computes the relative cost of forwarding an arriving call across all available route/spectrum sets to the destination. The algorithm selects the route/spectrum set with the least relative cost; if the minimum relative cost is more than the callâs value, the call is potentially rejected. In this study, the efficiency of using relative cost to solve the RSA problem is demonstrated via simulation.},

              Artificial neural networks, deep-learning methods and the backpropagation algorithm

              form the foundation of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. These methods are almost always used in two phases, one in which the weights of the network are updated and one in which the weights are held constant while the network is used or evaluated. This contrasts with natural learning and many applications, which require continual learning. It has been unclear whether or not deep learning methods work in continual learning settings. Here we show that they do notâthat standard deep-learning methods gradually lose plasticity in continual-learning settings until they learn no better than a shallow network. We show such loss of plasticity using the classic ImageNet dataset and reinforcement-learning problems across a wide range of variations in the network and the learning algorithm. Plasticity is maintained indefinitely only by algorithms that continually inject diversity into the network, such as our continualÂ backpropagation algorithm, a variation of backpropagation in which a small fraction of less-used units are continually and randomly reinitialized. Our results indicate that methods based on gradient descent are not enoughâthat sustained deep learning requires a random, non-gradient component to maintain variability and plasticity.},

	abstract = {This work identifies a common flaw of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms: a tendency to rely on early interactions and ignore useful evidence encountered later. Because of training on progressively growing datasets, deep RL agents incur a risk of overfitting to earlier experiences, negatively affecting the rest of the learning process. Inspired by cognitive science, we refer to this effect as the primacy bias. Through a series of experiments, we dissect the algorithmic aspects of deep RL that exacerbate this bias. We then propose a simple yet generally-applicable mechanism that tackles the primacy bias by periodically resetting a part of the agent. We apply this mechanism to algorithms in both discrete (Atari 100k) and continuous action (DeepMind Control Suite) domains, consistently improving their performance.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel application of reinforcement learning (RL) with invalid action masking and a novel training methodology for routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) in fixed-grid optical networks and demonstrate the generalizability of the learned policy to a realistic traffic matrix unseen during training. Through the introduction of invalid action masking and a new training method, the applicability of RL to RWA in fixed-grid networks is extended from considering connection requests between nodes to servicing demands of a given bit rate, such that lightpaths can be used to service multiple demands subject to capacity constraints. We outline the additional challenges involved for this RWA problem, for which we found that standard RL had low performance compared to that of baseline heuristics, in comparison with the connection requests RWA problem considered in the literature. Thus, we propose invalid action masking and a novel training method to improve the efficacy of the RL agent. With invalid action masking, domain knowledge is embedded in the RL model to constrain the action space of the RL agent to lightpaths that can support the current request, reducing the size of the action space and thus increasing the efficacy of the agent. In the proposed training method, the RL model is trained on a simplified version of the problem and evaluated on the target RWA problem, increasing the efficacy of the agent compared with training directly on the target problem. RL with invalid action masking and this training method outperforms standard RL and three state-of-the-art heuristics, namely, k shortest path first fit, first-fit k shortest path, and k shortest path most utilized, consistently across uniform and nonuniform traffic in terms of the number of accepted transmission requests for two real-world core topologies, NSFNET and COSTâ239. The RWA runtime of the proposed RL model is comparable to that of these heuristic approaches, demonstrating the potential for real-world applicability. Moreover, we show that the RL agent trained on uniform traffic is able to generalize well to a realistic nonuniform traffic distribution not seen during training, thus outperforming the heuristics for this traffic. Visualization of the learned RWA policy reveals an RWA strategy that differs significantly from those of the heuristic baselines in terms of the distribution of services across channels and the distribution across links.},

However, it also introduces greater complexity to the resource allocation problem. In this study, we propose a joint resource allocation method using high-performance transfer deep reinforcement learning (T-DRL) to maximize network throughput. When the topologies or characteristics of MONs change, T-DRL requires only a small amount of transfer training to re-converge. Considering that the generalizability of conventional methods is inversely related to optimization performance, we develop two deployment schemes (i.e.,Â single-agent and multi-agent) based on the T-DRL method to explore the performance of T-DRL. Simulation results demonstrate that T-DRL greatly reduces the blocking probability and average inference time of DNN inference requests. Besides, the multi-agent scheme can maintain a lower blocking probability of requests in MONs, while the single-agent has a shorter convergence time after network changes.},

	abstract = {The escalating demands for network capacities catalyze the adoption of space division multiplexing (SDM) technologies. With continuous advances in multi-core fiber (MCF) fabrication, MCF-based SDM networks are positioned as a viable and promising solution to achieve higher transmission capacities in multi-dimensional optical networks. However, with the extensive network resources offered by MCF-based SDM networks comes the challenge of traditional routing, modulation, spectrum, and core allocation (RMSCA) methods to achieve appropriate performance. This paper proposes an RMSCA approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for MCF-based elastic optical networks (MCF-EONs). Within the solution, a novel state representation with essential network information and a fragmentation-aware reward function were designed to direct the agent in learning effective RMSCA policies. Additionally, we adopted a proximal policy optimization algorithm featuring an action mask to enhance the sampling efficiency of the DRL agent and speed up the training process. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated with two different network topologies with varying traffic loads and fibers with different numbers of cores. The results confirmed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the heuristics and the state-of-the-art DRL-based RMSCA algorithm in reducing the service blocking probability by around 83\% and 51\%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be applied to networks with and without core switching capability and has an inference complexity compatible with real-world deployment requirements.},

Dynamic slicing of multidimensional resources in DCI-EON has emerged as a promising solution. However, improper reallocation of resources can diminish the benefits of slice reconfiguration, and different resource reconfiguration techniques can lead to varying degrees of service degradation for existing services. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based dynamic slicing approach (DS-DRL-RW) that leverages penalty-aware deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize resource allocation while considering the trade-off between the benefits and penalties of slice reconfiguration. DS-DRL-RW employs statistical prediction to obtain a coarse-grained solution for dynamic slicing that does not differentiate among multidimensional resources. Subsequently, through focused DRL training based on the coarse-grained solution, the accurate result for multidimensional resource slicing is achieved. Moreover, DS-DRL-RW comprehensively considers the benefits and penalties associated with different reconfiguration techniques after slice reconfiguration, enabling the determination of a suitable reconfiguration strategy. Simulation results demonstrate that DS-DRL-RW improves training efficiency and reduces the blocking rate of dynamic services by integrating slice traffic prediction and DRL. It effectively addresses both direct penalties from reconfiguration and indirect penalties from resource waste, thereby enhancing multidimensional resource utilization. DS-DRL-RW effectively handles the diverse penalties associated with various reconfiguration techniques and selects the appropriate reconfiguration strategy. Furthermore, DS-DRL-RW prioritizes the different quality requirements of services in slices, such as completion time, to avoid service degradation.},

Optical backbone networks need to tackle these new network scenarios by offering highly efficient, flexible, and scalable technologies and solutions. In this context, elastic optical networks (EONs) have been recognized as a promising technological transport infrastructure for the future Internet since they can manage the optical spectrum with enhanced flexibility and efficiency. The service provisioning in EONs is a challenging issue to tackle since the routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) is characterized by a high degree of complexity. This work presents an approach for RSA in EONs leveraging the advantages of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions. The devised approach jointly considers the constraints imposed by the optical technologies and the demanded connectivity service requirements (i.e.,\&\#x00A0;guaranteed bandwidth and maximum end-to-end latency) when computing and selecting the optical path and spectral resources. We first evaluate our approach through simulation experiments considering two reference network topologies, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the bandwidth blocking ratio, the path computation time, and the number of rejected connectivity services requiring lower latencies when compared to a baseline k-shortest path routing and first-fit spectrum allocation algorithm. Then, the trained DRL agent is integrated within a real proof of concept to attain an ML-assisted SDN control plane in the CTTC ADRENALINE testbed. The attained performance improvements highlight the potential benefits brought by using DRL mechanisms and its feasible integration within production EON transport infrastructures.},

By considering service attributes, the spectrum occupancy state expressed by several different fragmentation metrics, and the reconfiguration cost, DeepDefrag is able to consistently select appropriate reconfiguration actions over the network lifetime and adapt to changing conditions. Extensive simulation results reveal superior performance of the proposed scheme over a scenario with exhaustive defragmentation and a well-known benchmark heuristic from the literature, achieving lower blocking probability at a smaller defragmentation overhead.},

            In quantum key distributionâsecured optical networks (QKDâONs), constrained network resources limit the success probability of QKD lightpath requests (QLRs). Thus, the selection of an appropriate route and the efficient utilisation of network resources for establishment of QLRs are the essential and challenging problems. This work addresses the routing and resource assignment (RRA) problem in the quantum signal channel of QKDâONs. The RRA problem of QKDâONs is a complex decision making problem, where appropriate solutions depend on understanding the networking environment. Motivated by the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for complex problems and also because of its capability to learn directly from experiences, DRL is exploited to solve the RRA problem and a DRLâbased RRA scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme learns the optimal policy to select an appropriate route and assigns suitable network resources for establishment of QLRs by using deep neural networks. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared with the deepâQ network (DQN) method and two baseline schemes, namely, firstâfit (FF) and randomâfit (RF) for two different networks, namely The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) and UBN24. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme reduces blocking by 7.19\%, 10.11\%, and 33.50\% for NSFNET and 2.47\%, 3.20\%, and 19.60\% for UBN24 and improves resource utilisation up to 3.40\%, 4.33\%, and 7.18\% for NSFNET and 1.34\%, 1.96\%, and 6.44\% for UBN24 as compared with DQN, FF, and RF, respectively.},

This study addresses this issue with a generalized reinforcement learning (RL) model for parameter optimization in optical networks in the presence of multiple performance goals. Using this generic model, two multi-objective variants of a classical optimization problem in optical network operation, routing and wavelength assignment (RWA), are derived and solved to near optimality. The allocated route and wavelength for each demand are optimized with respect to the number of accepted services, the number of transmitters, and network availability. The resultant approximated Pareto front provides a set of solutions from which network operators can make decisions based on their preferences for particular objectives. These results contribute to the understanding of the relationships between different network parameters and performance metrics, which would be beneficial in future network design and growth. Moreover, benchmarking results against the state-of-the-art RWA heuristics suggest the applicability of RL in dynamic settings under changing traffic and generalizability for unseen traffic.},

We propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the TRSA problem with and without fault tolerance for arbitrary network topologies. The algorithms are used to evaluate potential cost benefits of P2MP transceivers for different IP densities and loads in a case study on a metro-network reference scenario.

	abstract = {Optical transport networks (OTNs) are widely used in backbone- and metro-area transmission networks to increase network transmission capacity. In the OTN, it is particularly crucial to rationally allocate routes and maximize network capacities. By employing deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- and software-defined networking (SDN)-based solutions, the capacity of optical networks can be effectively increased. However, because most DRL-based routing optimization methods have low sample usage and difficulty in coping with sudden network connectivity changes, converging in software-defined OTN scenarios is challenging. Additionally, the generalization ability of these methods is weak. This paper proposes an ensembles- and message-passing neural-network-based Deep Q-Network (EMDQN) method for optical network routing optimization to address this problem. To effectively explore the environment and improve agent performance, the multiple EMDQN agents select actions based on the highest upper-confidence bounds. Furthermore, the EMDQN agent captures the networkâs spatial feature information using a message passing neural network (MPNN)-based DRL policy network, which enables the DRL agent to have generalization capability. The experimental results show that the EMDQN algorithm proposed in this paper performs better in terms of convergence. EMDQN effectively improves the throughput rate and link utilization of optical networks and has better generalization capabilities.},

	abstract = {The reinforcement learning-based routing, modulation, and spectrum assignment has been regarded as an emerging paradigm for resource allocation in the elastic optical networks. One limitation is that the learning process is highly dependent on the training environment, such as the traffic pattern or the optical network topology. Therefore, re-training is required in case of network topology or traffic pattern variations, which consumes a great amount of computation power and time. To ease the requirement of re-training, we propose a policy distillation scheme, which distills knowledge from a well-trained teacher model and then transfers the knowledge to the to-be-trained student model, so that the training of the latter can be accelerated. Specifically, the teacher model is trained for one training environment (e.g., the topology and traffic pattern) and the student model is for another training environment. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method can effectively speed up the training process of the student model, and it even leads to a lower blocking probability, compared with the case that the student model is trained without knowledge distillation.},

This study investigates the problem of service restoration under OTNs with an optical channel data unit (ODU)-k switching capability (OTN-OSC) environment. An advantage actor-critic-based service restoration (A2CSR) algorithm is presented with the objective of increasing the service restoration rate. In our experimental setup, A2CSR uses the advanced image recognition model MobileNetV2 and an advantage actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed A2CSR algorithm can achieve better blocking probability and resource utilisation than the benchmark algorithm (first fit (FF)), and the restoration time is within the acceptable range.},

Hence, this work studies the problem of how to formulate and reconfigure multicast sessions in an elastic optical network (EON) dynamically. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model based on graph neural networks to solve the sub-problem of multicast session selection in a more universal and adaptive manner. The DRL model abstracts topology information of the EON and the current provisioning scheme of a multicast session as graph-structured data, and analyzes the data to intelligently determine whether the session should be selected for reconfiguration. We evaluate our proposal with extensive simulations that consider different EON topologies, and the results confirm its effectiveness and universality. Specifically, the results show that it can balance the trade-off between the number of reconfiguration operations and blocking performance much better than existing algorithms, and the DRL model trained in one EON topology can easily adapt to solve the problem of dynamic multicast session reconfiguration in other topologies, without being redesigned or retrained.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) is leading to important breakthroughs in several areas (e.g., self-driving vehicles, robotics, and network automation). Part of its success is due to the existence of toolkits (e.g., OpenAI Gym) to implement standard RL tasks. On the one hand, they allow for the quick implementation and testing of new ideas. On the other, these toolkits ensure easy reproducibility via quick and fair benchmarking. RL is also gaining traction in the optical networks research community, showing promising results while solving several use cases. However, there are many scenarios where the benefits of RL-based solutions remain still unclear. A possible reason for this is the steep learning curve required to tailor RL-based frameworks to each specific use case. This, in turn, might delay or even prevent the development of new ideas. This paper introduces the Optical Network Reinforcement-Learning-Gym (Optical RL-Gym)11The toolkit presented in this paper is available at: https://github.com/carlosnatalino/optical-rl-gym., an open-source toolkit that can be used to apply RL to problems related to optical networks. The Optical RL-Gym follows the principles established by the OpenAI Gym, the de-facto standard for RL environments. Optical RL-Gym allows for the quick integration with existing RL agents, as well as the possibility to build upon several already available environments to implement and solve more elaborated use cases related to the optical networks research area. The capabilities and the benefits of the proposed toolkit are illustrated by using the Optical RL-Gym to solve two different service provisioning problems.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes DeepRMSA, a deep reinforcement learning framework for routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (RMSA) in elastic optical networks (EONs). DeepRMSA learns the correct online RMSA policies by parameterizing the policies with deep neural networks (DNNs) that can sense complex EON states. The DNNs are trained with experiences of dynamic lightpath provisioning. We ï¬rst modify the asynchronous advantage actorcritic algorithm and present an episode-based training mechanism for DeepRMSA, namely, DeepRMSA-EP. DeepRMSA-EP divides the dynamic provisioning process into multiple episodes (each containing the servicing of a ï¬xed number of lightpath requests) and performs training by the end of each episode. The optimization target of DeepRMSA-EP at each step of servicing a request is to maximize the cumulative reward within the rest of the episode. Thus, we obviate the need for estimating the rewards related to unknown future states. To overcome the instability issue in the training of DeepRMSA-EP due to the oscillations of cumulative rewards, we further propose a window-based ï¬exible training mechanism, i.e., DeepRMSA-FLX. DeepRMSA-FLX attempts to smooth out the oscillations by deï¬ning the optimization scope at each step as a sliding window, and ensuring that the cumulative rewards always include rewards from a ï¬xed number of requests. Evaluations with the two sample topologies show that DeepRMSA-FLX can effectively stabilize the training while achieving blocking probability reductions of more than 20.3\% and 14.3\%, when compared with the baselines.},

            Machine learning (ML) has been remarkably successful in transforming numerous scientific and technological fields in recent years including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, bioinformatics, etc. Naturally, it has long been considered as a promising mechanism to fundamentally revolutionize the existing archaic optical networks into next-generation smart and autonomous entities. However, despite its promise and extensive research conducted over the last decade, the ML paradigm has so far not been triumphant in achieving widespread adoption in commercial optical networks. In our perspective, this is primarily due to non-addressal of a number of critical non-technological issues surrounding ML-based solutionsâ development and use in real-world optical networks. The vision of intelligent and autonomous fiber-optic networks, powered by ML, will always remain a distant dream until these so far neglected factors are openly confronted by all relevant stakeholders and categorically resolved.},

            The Covid-19 pandemic showed forcefully the fundamental importance broadband data communication and the internet has in our society. Optical communications forms the undisputable backbone of this critical infrastructure, and it is supported by an interdisciplinary research community striving to improve and develop it further. Since the first âRoadmap of optical communicationsâ was published in 2016, the field has seen significant progress in all areas, and time is ripe for an update of the research status. The optical communications area has become increasingly diverse, covering research in fundamental physics and materials science, high-speed electronics and photonics, signal processing and coding, and communication systems and networks. This roadmap describes state-of-the-art and future outlooks in the optical communications field. The article is divided into 20 sections on selected areas, each written by a leading expert in that area. The sections are thematically grouped into four parts with 4â6 sections each, covering, respectively, hardware, algorithms, networks and systems. Each section describes the current status, the future challenges, and development needed to meet said challenges in their area. As a whole, this roadmap provides a comprehensive and unprecedented overview of the contemporary optical communications research, and should be essential reading for researchers at any level active in this field.},

As network capacity is a key factor influencing optical network performance, it is important to understand how topological and physical properties impact its behavior and to have the capability to estimate its value. In this context, we propose here a method to evaluate the network capacity that relies on the optical reach to account for physical layer aspects in conjunction with constrained routing techniques for traffic routing. As this type of routing can lead to traffic blocking, particularly due to the limitation on the number of wavelengths per fiber, we also propose a fiber assignment algorithm designed to deal with this problem. We apply this method to a set of randomly generated networks using a modified Waxman model, and for a network with 60 nodes, in a scenario without blocking, we obtain capacities of about 2.5 Pbit/s for a symbol rate of 64 Gbaud and about 5 Pbit/s for a symbol rate of 128 Gbaud. Remarkably, this duplication in the total network capacity is achieved by an increase in the total fiber length of only about 51\%.},

	abstract = {The power consumption of telecommunication equipment has been identified as a relevant contributor to global energy consumption. In fact, new-generation optical transponders employ power-intensive electronic application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for digital signal processing (DSP). DSP design has traditionally prioritized meeting transmission requirements over power consumption optimization. In general, the evolutions of transmission techniques and network design have always been mainly driven by traffic increase; in this context, in order to operate network resources more efficiently, margin reduction has been investigated in the past few years. Indeed, traditionally, high physical layer margins are used to ensure reliability over an extended period, resulting in overprovisioning the optical connections for both physical layer conditions and capacity. On the other hand, super-channels have emerged as a suitable solution for accommodating the continuous traffic growth. However, power consumption has not been deeply considered in the optimization of super-channel transmission. This paper first investigates the power efficiency of super-channels operated with designed and reduced margins. Low-margin operation is enabled by adapting sub-carrier spacing and filter bandwidth. Power-aware super-channel optimization is then experimentally demonstrated leveraging a 600Â Gbit/s transponder in the SDN-controlled elastic optical network (EON). The results have identified a trade-off between power consumption and spectrum efficiency. Furthermore, the ongoing bandwidth demand has motivated the investigation of multi-band (MB) transmission for scaling the capacity of the existing infrastructures. However, novel networking devices (e.g.,Â optical amplifiers operating beyond the C- and L-bands) will affect the overall power consumption. In this context, experimental power analysis of a thulium doped fiber amplifier (TDFA) is performed based on the traffic load and corresponding configuration. The results show that TDFA power consumption varies with configuration and increases with output power.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence and Neural Turing Machines, because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems -- finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem -- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.},

Training is then performed using data-parallel synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with mini-batch divided between computational units. With an increase in the number of nodes, the batch size grows. But training with large batch size often results in the lower model accuracy. We argue that the current recipe for large batch training (linear learning rate scaling with warm-up) is not general enough and training may diverge. To overcome this optimization difficulties we propose a new training algorithm based on Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS). Using LARS, we scaled Alexnet up to a batch size of 8K, and Resnet-50 to a batch size of 32K without loss in accuracy.},

	abstract = {Atari games have been a long-standing benchmark in the reinforcement learning (RL) community for the past decade. This benchmark was proposed to test general competency of RL algorithms. Previous work has achieved good average performance by doing outstandingly well on many games of the set, but very poorly in several of the most challenging games. We propose Agent57, the first deep RL agent that outperforms the standard human benchmark on all 57 Atari games. To achieve this result, we train a neural network which parameterizes a family of policies ranging from very exploratory to purely exploitative. We propose an adaptive mechanism to choose which policy to prioritize throughout the training process. Additionally, we utilize a novel parameterization of the architecture that allows for more consistent and stable learning.},

This perspective should be critical in the context of constantly changing distinct reinforcement learning environments, yet current approaches still primarily employ static activation functions. In this work, we motivate why rationals are suitable for adaptable activation functions and why their inclusion into neural networks is crucial. Inspired by recurrence in residual networks, we derive a condition under which rational units are closed under residual connections and formulate a naturally regularised version: the recurrent-rational. We demonstrate that equipping popular algorithms with (recurrent-)rational activations leads to consistent improvements on Atari games, especially turning simple DQN into a solid approach, competitive to DDQN and Rainbow.},

It is based on utilizing the complete low-loss region of optical fibers. Additionally, elastic optical networks (EON) were proposed to efficiently manage limited resources in optical networks. The selection of route, modulation format and spectrum is the main problem that requires solving to operate an EON. Understanding how linear and nonlinear impairments accumulate during propagation in an optical fibre link in essential to solve this problem. Here we preset a study on the maximum reach optical signals can propagate in a multi-band environment for a variety of modulation formats with commonly used threshold values in EON.},

	abstract = {Networking technologies are fast evolving to support the request for ubiquitous Internet access that is becoming a fundamental need for the modern and inclusive society, with a dramatic speed-up caused by the COVID-19 emergency. Such evolution needs the development of networks into disaggregated and programmable systems according to the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm. Wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) optical transmission and networking is expanding as physical layer technology from core and metro networks to 5G x-hauling and inter- and intra-data-center connections requiring the application of the SDN paradigm at the optical layer based on the WDM optical data transport virtualization. We present the fundamental principles of the open-source project Gaussian Noise in Python (GNPy) for the optical transport virtualization in modeling the WDM optical transmission for open and disaggregated networking. GNPy approximates transparent lightpaths as additive white and Gaussian noise channels and can be used as a vendor-agnostic digital twin for open network planning and management. The quality-of-transmission degradation of each network element is independently modeled to allow disaggregated network management. We describe the GNPy models for fiber propagation, optical amplifiers, and reconfigurable add/drop multiplexers together with modeling of coherent transceivers from the back-to-back characterization. We address the use of GNPy as a vendor-agnostic design and planning tool and as physical layer virtualization in software-defined optical networking.},

By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

            Graphs naturally appear in numerous application domains, ranging from social analysis, bioinformatics to computer vision. The unique capability of graphs enables capturing the structural relations among data, and thus allows to harvest more insights compared to analyzing data in isolation. However, it is often very challenging to solve the learning problems on graphs, because (1) many types of data are not originally structured as graphs, such as images and text data, and (2) for graph-structured data, the underlying connectivity patterns are often complex and diverse. On the other hand, the representation learning has achieved great successes in many areas. Thereby, a potential solution is to learn the representation of graphs in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, such that the graph properties can be preserved. Although tremendous efforts have been made to address the graph representation learning problem, many of them still suffer from their shallow learning mechanisms. Deep learning models on graphs (e.g., graph neural networks) have recently emerged in machine learning and other related areas, and demonstrated the superior performance in various problems. In this survey, despite numerous types of graph neural networks, we conduct a comprehensive review specifically on the emerging field of graph convolutional networks, which is one of the most prominent graph deep learning models. First, we group the existing graph convolutional network models into two categories based on the types of convolutions and highlight some graph convolutional network models in details. Then, we categorize different graph convolutional networks according to the areas of their applications. Finally, we present several open challenges in this area and discuss potential directions for future research.},

We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.},

	abstract = {The recent availability of the first commercial quantum computers has provided a promising tool to tackle NP hard problems which can only be solved heuristically with present techniques. However, it is unclear if the current state of quantum computing already provides a quantum advantage over the current state of the art in classical computing. This article assesses the performance of the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer on two NP hard graph problems, in particular clique finding and graph partitioning. For this, we provide formulations as Qubo and Ising Hamiltonians suitable for the quantum annealer and compare a variety of quantum solvers (Sapi, QBSolv, QSage provided by D-Wave Sys, Inc.) to current classical algorithms (METIS, Simulated Annealing, third-party clique finding and graph splitting heuristics) on certain test sets of graphs. We demonstrate that for small graph instances, classical methods still outperform the quantum annealer in terms of computing time, even though the quality of the best solutions obtained is comparable. Nevertheless, due to the limited problem size which can be embedded on the D-Wave 2X chip, the aforementioned finding applies to most of problems of general nature solvable on the quantum annealer. For instances specifically designed to fit the D-Wave 2X architecture, we observe substantial speed-ups in computing time over classical approaches.},

            There are a host of applications in communications, sensing, and science, in which analogue signal transmission is preferred over todayâs dominant digital transmission. In some of these applications, the advantage is in lower cost, while in others, it lies in superior performance. However, especially for longer analogue photonics links (up to 10âs of km), the performance is strongly limited by the impairments arising from using standard single-mode fibres (SSMF). Firstly, the three key metrics of analogue links (loss, noise figure, and dynamic range) tend to improve with received power, but this is limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering in SSMF. Further degradation is due to the chromatic dispersion of SSMF, which induces radio-frequency (RF) signal fading, increases even-order distortions, and causes phase-to-intensity-noise conversion. Further distortions still, are caused by the Kerr nonlinearity of SSMF. We propose to address all of these shortcomings by replacing SSMFs with hollow-core optical fibres, which have simultaneously six times lower chromatic dispersion and several orders of magnitude lower nonlinearity (Brillouin, Kerr). We demonstrate the advantages in this application using a 7.7âkm long hollow-core fibre sample, significantly surpassing the performance of an SSMF link in virtually every metric, including 15âdB higher link gain and 6âdB lower noise figure.},

	abstract = {Plasticity, the ability of a neural network to quickly change its predictions in response to new information, is essential for the adaptability and robustness of deep reinforcement learning systems. Deep neural networks are known to lose plasticity over the course of training even in relatively simple learning problems, but the mechanisms driving this phenomenon are still poorly understood. This paper conducts a systematic empirical analysis into plasticity loss, with the goal of understanding the phenomenon mechanistically in order to guide the future development of targeted solutions. We find that loss of plasticity is deeply connected to changes in the curvature of the loss landscape, but that it often occurs in the absence of saturated units. Based on this insight, we identify a number of parameterization and optimization design choices which enable networks to better preserve plasticity over the course of training. We validate the utility of these findings on larger-scale RL benchmarks in the Arcade Learning Environment.},

These conditions can be exploited to develop faster and more effective learning algorithms. In addition, they allow certain types of domain knowledge to be incorporated with ease into a learning algorithm.

              Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak Ã  Configuration Variable
              1,2
              , including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and âsnowflakeâ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained âdropletsâ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

Popular training pipelines that use these frameworks for deep learning typically focus on (un-)supervised learning. How to best train reinforcement learning (RL) agents at scale is still an active research area. In this report we argue that TPUs are particularly well suited for training RL agents in a scalable, efficient and reproducible way.

	abstract = {Recent innovations in network virtualization and elastic optical networks enable the flexible deployment of optical networks. However, the spectrum fragmentation and virtual optical links being embedded to the longer lightpaths decrease the spectrum efficiency of elastic optical networks. To address this issue, a coordinated virtual optical network embedding algorithm based on resources availability-aware (RA-CVONE) is proposed. Firstly, we design the node importance metric to embed the neighboring virtual nodes to the closer physical nodes, and then a coordinated embedding approach is adopted, which can further shorten the length of the lightpaths to which virtual optical links are embedded. Moreover, we jointly evaluate the resources availability of a physical lightpath and its node, then select the candidate lightpaths with less spectrum fragmentations and abundant resources for a virtual optical link. Based on the resources availability, a path selection strategy is proposed to determine a physical lightpath of which the vacant spectrum resources can be effectively used. Simulation results show that the RA-CVONE algorithm can significantly shorten the length of the physical lightpaths which are selected to embed virtual optical links, reduce the bandwidth blocking probability of virtual optical network requests, and improve the spectrum utilization of elastic optical networks.},

	abstract = {Traditional networking is hardware-based, having the control plane coupled with the data plane. Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which has a logically centralized control plane, has been introduced to increase the programmability and flexibility of networks. Knowledge-Defined Networking (KDN) is an advanced version of SDN that takes one step forward by decoupling the management plane from control logic and introducing a new plane, called a knowledge plane, decoupled from control logic for generating knowledge based on data collected from the network. KDN is the next-generation architecture for self-learning, self-organizing, and self-evolving networks with high automation and intelligence. Even though KDN was introduced about two decades ago, it had not gained much attention among researchers until recently. The reasons for delayed recognition could be due to the technology gap and difficulty in direct transformation from traditional networks to KDN. Communication networks around the globe have already begun to transform from SDNs into KDNs. Machine learning models are typically used to generate knowledge using the data collected from network devices and sensors, where the generated knowledge may be further composed to create knowledge ontologies that can be used in generating rules, where rules and/or knowledge can be provided to the control, management, and application planes for use in decision-making processes, for network monitoring and configuration, and for dynamic adjustment of network policies, respectively. Among the numerous advantages that KDN brings compared to SDN, enhanced automation and intelligence, higher flexibility, and improved security stand tall. However, KDN also has a set of challenges, such as reliance on large quantities of high-quality data, difficulty in integration with legacy networks, the high cost of upgrading to KDN, etc. In this survey, we first present an overview of the KDN architecture and then discuss each plane of the KDN in detail, such as sub-planes and interfaces, functions of each plane, existing standards and protocols, different models of the planes, etc., with respect to examples from the existing literature. Existing works are qualitatively reviewed and assessed by grouping them into categories and assessing the individual performance of the literature where possible. We further compare and contrast traditional networks and SDN against KDN. Finally, we discuss the benefits, challenges, design guidelines, and ongoing research of KDNs. Design guidelines and recommendations are provided so that identified challenges can be mitigated. Therefore, this survey is a comprehensive review of architecture, operation, applications, and existing works of knowledge-defined networks.},

	abstract = {Efficient resource allocation and management can enhance the capacity of an optical backbone network. In this context, spectrum retuning via hitless defragmentation has been presented for elastic optical networks to enhance efficient spectrum accommodation while reducing the unused fragmented spaces in the spectrum. However, the quality of service committed in a service level agreement may be affected due to spectrum retuning. In particular, for transmission beyond the conventional C band, the presence of inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering can severely degrade the quality of the signal during defragmentation. To conquer this problem, this paper proposes, for the first time to our knowledge, a signal-quality-aware proactive defragmentation scheme for the

The proposed scheme prioritizes the minimization of the fragmentation index and quality of transmission (QoT) maintenance for two different defragmentation algorithms, namely, nonlinear-impairment (NLI)-aware defragmentation (NAD) and NLI-unaware defragmentation (NUD). We leverage machine learning techniques for QoT estimation of ongoing lightpaths during spectrum retuning. The optical signal-to-noise ratio of a lightpath is predicted for each choice of spectrum retuning, which helps to monitor the effect of defragmentation on the quality of ongoing lightpaths (in terms of assigned modulation format). Numerical results show that, compared to a baseline algorithm (NUD), the proposed NAD algorithm provides up to 15\% capacity increment for smaller networks such as BT-UK, while for larger networks such as the 24-node USA network, a capacity benefit of 23\% is achieved in terms of the number of served demands at 1\% blocking.},

	abstract = {Technological improvements, such as erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), have revolutionized optical transmission, boosting the development and worldwide deployment of the Internet. Similar progress has not yet impacted the routing layer, as current IP routing technology struggles to deliver the necessary bandwidth at competitive costs. Hybrid electro-optical architectures, where dynamical optical circuit switching is combined with legacy packet routing, have been introduced in the past few years as promising solutions to reduce costs at the IP layer and to deliver new revenue-generating services and applications. Most of the architectures currently proposed have focused on end-to-end lightpath provisioning, coordinated through a centralized management plane. In this paper we propose optical IP switching (OIS), a hybrid electro-optical network architecture that combines IP routing and wavelength switching, using a distributed decision-making process. We report technical and economic analysis, based on simulations obtained through real traffic traces and routing tables, that compare our distributed model to an opaque IP-over-WDM and centralized, transparent overlay models. We also report testbed results that analyze the effect of dynamic transparent switching operation on the TCP and UDP transport protocols. The results obtained show that distributed provisioning based on local traffic analysis can be feasible, although more work is required to evaluate the efficacy of optimization techniques on distributed network models.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms rely on exploration to discover new behaviors, which is typically achieved by following a stochastic policy. In continuous control tasks, policies with a Gaussian distribution have been widely adopted. Gaussian exploration however does not result in smooth trajectories that generally correspond to safe and rewarding behaviors in practical tasks. In addition, Gaussian policies do not result in an effective exploration of an environment and become increasingly inefficient as the action rate increases. This contributes to a low sample efficiency often observed in learning continuous control tasks. We introduce a family of stationary autoregressive (AR) stochastic processes to facilitate exploration in continuous control domains. We show that proposed processes possess two desirable features: subsequent process observations are temporally coherent with continuously adjustable degree of coherence, and the process stationary distribution is standard normal. We derive an autoregressive policy (ARP) that implements such processes maintaining the standard agent-environment interface. We show how ARPs can be easily used with the existing off-the-shelf learning algorithms. Empirically we demonstrate that using ARPs results in improved exploration and sample efficiency in both simulated and real world domains, and, furthermore, provides smooth exploration trajectories that enable safe operation of robotic hardware.},

In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled by neural networks that predict one dimension at a time. Specifically, we show how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next step prediction model over discretized dimensions. With this parameterization, it is possible to both leverage the compositional structure of action spaces during learning, as well as compute maxima over action spaces (approximately). On a simple example task we demonstrate empirically that our method can perform global search, which effectively gets around the local optimization issues that plague DDPG. We apply the technique to off-policy (Q-learning) methods and show that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art for off-policy methods on several continuous control tasks.},

            Computer programs have shown superiority over humans in two-player games such as chess, Go, and heads-up, no-limit Texas hold'em poker. However, poker games usually include six playersâa much trickier challenge for artificial intelligence than the two-player variant. Brown and Sandholm developed a program, dubbed Pluribus, that learned how to play six-player no-limit Texas hold'em by playing against five copies of itself (see the Perspective by Blair and Saffidine). When pitted against five elite professional poker players, or with five copies of Pluribus playing against one professional, the computer performed significantly better than humans over the course of 10,000 hands of poker.

          , 
            In recent years there have been great strides in artificial intelligence (AI), with games often serving as challenge problems, benchmarks, and milestones for progress. Poker has served for decades as such a challenge problem. Past successes in such benchmarks, including poker, have been limited to two-player games. However, poker in particular is traditionally played with more than two players. Multiplayer games present fundamental additional issues beyond those in two-player games, and multiplayer poker is a recognized AI milestone. In this paper we present Pluribus, an AI that we show is stronger than top human professionals in six-player no-limit Texas holdâem poker, the most popular form of poker played by humans.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have surpassed human intelligence in a variety of computational tasks. However, AI systems, like humans, make mistakes, have blind spots, hallucinate, and struggle to generalize to new situations. This work explores whether AI can benefit from creative decision-making mechanisms when pushed to the limits of its computational rationality. In particular, we investigate whether a team of diverse AI systems can outperform a single AI in challenging tasks by generating more ideas as a group and then selecting the best ones. We study this question in the game of chess, the so-called drosophila of AI. We build on AlphaZero (AZ) and extend it to represent a league of agents via a latent-conditioned architecture, which we call AZ\_db. We train AZ\_db to generate a wider range of ideas using behavioral diversity techniques and select the most promising ones with sub-additive planning. Our experiments suggest that AZ\_db plays chess in diverse ways, solves more puzzles as a group and outperforms a more homogeneous team. Notably, AZ\_db solves twice as many challenging puzzles as AZ, including the challenging Penrose positions. When playing chess from different openings, we notice that players in AZ\_db specialize in different openings, and that selecting a player for each opening using sub-additive planning results in a 50 Elo improvement over AZ. Our findings suggest that diversity bonuses emerge in teams of AI agents, just as they do in teams of humans and that diversity is a valuable asset in solving computationally hard problems.},

This was achieved by combining Monte Carlo tree search, a planning procedure, and deep learning.

We review 129 peer-reviewed articles detailing the application of neural Monte Carlo tree search methods in domains other than games. Our goal is to systematically assess how such methods are structured in practice and if their success can be extended to other domains. We find applications in a variety of domains, many distinct ways of guiding the tree search using learned policy and value functions, and various training methods. Our review maps the current landscape of algorithms in the family of neural monte carlo tree search as they are applied to practical problems, which is a first step towards a more principled way of designing such algorithms for specific problems and their requirements.},

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in representation learning on graphs and achieved state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. In this paper, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which involve identifying useful connections between unconnected nodes on the original graph, while learning effective node representation on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. Graph Transformer layer, a core layer of GTNs, learns a soft selection of edge types and composite relations for generating useful multi-hop connections so-called meta-paths. Our experiments show that GTNs learn new graph structures, based on data and tasks without domain knowledge, and yield powerful node representation via convolution on the new graphs. Without domain-specific graph preprocessing, GTNs achieved the best performance in all three benchmark node classification tasks against the state-of-the-art methods that require pre-defined meta-paths from domain knowledge.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Nyquist-spaced transmission and digital signal processing have proved effective in maximising the spectral efficiency and reach of optical communication systems. In these systems, Kerr nonlinearity determines the performance limits, and leads to spectral broadening of the signals propagating in the fibre. Although digital nonlinearity compensation was validated to be promising for mitigating Kerr nonlinearities, the impact of spectral broadening on nonlinearity compensation has never been quantified. In this paper, the performance of multi-channel digital back-propagation (MC-DBP) for compensating fibre nonlinearities in Nyquist-spaced optical communication systems is investigated, when the effect of signal spectral broadening is considered. It is found that accounting for the spectral broadening effect is crucial for achieving the best performance of DBP in both single-channel and multi-channel communication systems, independent of modulation formats used. For multi-channel systems, the degradation of DBP performance due to neglecting the spectral broadening effect in the compensation is more significant for outer channels. Our work also quantified the minimum bandwidths of optical receivers and signal processing devices to ensure the optimal compensation of deterministic nonlinear distortions.},

Thus, machine learning looks like a natural candidate to make such decisions in a more principled and optimized way.

	abstract = {One of the key performance metrics for optical networks is the maximum achievable throughput for a given network. Determining it, however, is a nondeterministic polynomial time (NP) hard optimization problem, often solved via computationally expensive integer linear programming (ILP) formulations. These are infeasible to implement as objectives, even on very small node scales of a few tens of nodes. Alternatively, heuristics are used although these, too, require considerable computation time for a large number of networks. There is, thus, a need for an ultra-fast and accurate performance evaluation of optical networks. For the first time, we propose the use of a geometric deep learning model, message passing neural networks (MPNNs), to learn the relationship between node and edge features, the network structure, and the maximum achievable network throughput. We demonstrate that MPNNs can accurately predict the maximum achievable throughput while reducing the computational time by up to five-orders of magnitude compared to the ILP for small networks (10â15 nodes) and compared to a heuristic for large networks (25â100 nodes)âproving their suitability for the design and optimization of optical networks on different time- and distance-scales.},

	abstract = {Multiband (MB) and multifiber (MF) technologies get significant attention along with their individual pros and cons to solve the optical fiber capacity crunch problem. The MB system is more susceptible to nonlinear transmission impairments such as interchannel stimulated Raman scattering. On the contrary, MF solutions are costly due to the requirement of parallel fiber deployment. Therefore, it is necessary to find a hybrid solution using MB and MF technologies. This paper performs a techno-economic comparison between MF and MB technologies while taking a robust cost model. We propose, for the first time to our knowledge, a domain-knowledge-assisted, cost-effective network upgrade algorithm to enhance the overall network capacity while including minimum capital expenditure (CapEx). The proposed algorithm prioritizes the targeted deployment of cost-effective upgrade solutions in different links of the network to minimize the overall cost of the upgrade. The comparison between optical cable deployment and fiber leasing is captured to upgrade the overall network capacity with minimum cost-per-bit. Reported results show that a single fiber C+L band system can provide approximately 66.67\% gain in terms of traffic admissibility compared to MF C band systems in smaller networks such as BT-UK, while considering fiber leasing. If operator owned dark fibers are not available in any of the links, numerical results show that the MF C+L band system in the BT-UK network can still provide CapEx savings of approximately up to 40.5\% compared to the MF C band systems while minimizing the cost-per-bit of the network by approximately 21.9\% to achieve the targeted network capacity of 150 Tbps. The effect of longer link length on the network upgrade cost is also studied in this paper. Reported result shows that, for larger geography such as the pan-Europe network, the channel launch power needs to be tuned to achieve the benefit of the MF C+L band compared to the MF C band system.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14345},
	abstract = {Combinatorial optimisation problems framed as mixed integer linear programmes (MILPs) are ubiquitous across a range of real-world applications. The canonical branch-and-bound algorithm seeks to exactly solve MILPs by constructing a search tree of increasingly constrained sub-problems. In practice, its solving time performance is dependent on heuristics, such as the choice of the next variable to constrain ('branching'). Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising paradigm for branching. However, prior works have struggled to apply reinforcement learning (RL), citing sparse rewards, difficult exploration, and partial observability as significant challenges. Instead, leading ML methodologies resort to approximating high quality handcrafted heuristics with imitation learning (IL), which precludes the discovery of novel policies and requires expensive data labelling. In this work, we propose retro branching; a simple yet effective approach to RL for branching. By retrospectively deconstructing the search tree into multiple paths each contained within a sub-tree, we enable the agent to learn from shorter trajectories with more predictable next states. In experiments on four combinatorial tasks, our approach enables learning-to-branch without any expert guidance or pre-training. We outperform the current state-of-the-art RL branching algorithm by 3-5x and come within 20\% of the best IL method's performance on MILPs with 500 constraints and 1000 variables, with ablations verifying that our retrospectively constructed trajectories are essential to achieving these results.},

              , making further improvements on the efficiency of these routines has proved challenging for both human scientists and computational approaches. Here we show how artificial intelligence can go beyond the current state of the art by discovering hitherto unknown routines. To realize this, we formulated the task of finding a better sorting routine as a single-player game. We then trained a new deep reinforcement learning agent, AlphaDev, to play this game. AlphaDev discovered small sorting algorithms from scratch that outperformed previously known human benchmarks. These algorithms have been integrated into the LLVM standard C++ sort library

            The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.},

However, existing DL-based solutions are often considered as black boxes with high inner complexity. As a result, there is still certain skepticism among the networking industry about their practical viability to operate data networks. In this context, explainability techniques have recently emerged to unveil why DL models make each decision. This paper focuses on the explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) applied to networking. GNNs are a novel DL family with unique properties to generalize over graphs. As a result, they have shown unprecedented performance to solve complex network optimization problems. This paper presents NetXplain, a novel real-time explainability solution that uses a GNN to interpret the output produced by another GNN. In the evaluation, we apply the proposed explainability method to RouteNet, a GNN model that predicts end-to-end QoS metrics in networks. We show that NetXplain operates more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art explainability solutions when applied to networks up to 24 nodes, which makes it compatible with real-time applications; while demonstrating strong capabilities to generalize to network scenarios not seen during training.},

	abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), i.e., the development of more transparent and interpretable AI models, has gained increased traction over the last few years. This is due to the fact that, in conjunction with their growth into powerful and ubiquitous tools, AI models exhibit one detrimential characteristic: a performance-transparency trade-off. This describes the fact that the more complex a model's inner workings, the less clear it is how its predictions or decisions were achieved. But, especially considering Machine Learning (ML) methods like Reinforcement Learning (RL) where the system learns autonomously, the necessity to understand the underlying reasoning for their decisions becomes apparent. Since, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no single work offering an overview of Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) methods, this survey attempts to address this gap. We give a short summary of the problem, a definition of important terms, and offer a classification and assessment of current XRL methods. We found that a) the majority of XRL methods function by mimicking and simplifying a complex model instead of designing an inherently simple one, and b) XRL (and XAI) methods often neglect to consider the human side of the equation, not taking into account research from related fields like psychology or philosophy. Thus, an interdisciplinary effort is needed to adapt the generated explanations to a (non-expert) human user in order to effectively progress in the field of XRL and XAI in general.},

With the rapid development of user applications, network traffic is continuously increasing in dynamicity, making optimization of the routing problem NP-hard. Traditional routing algorithms cannot ensure both accuracy and efficiency. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently shown great potential in solving networking problems. However, existing DRL-based routing solutions cannot process the graph-like information in the network topology and do not generalize well when the topology changes. In this paper, we propose AutoGNN, which combines a GNN and DRL for the automatic generation of routing policies. In AutoGNN, the traffic distribution in the network topology is processed by a GNN, while a DRL framework is used to train the parameters of neural networks without human expertise. Our experimental results show that AutoGNN can improve the average end-to-end delay of the network by up to 19.7\% as well as present more robustness against topology changes.},

	abstract = {The unprecedented growth of the global Internet traffic, coupled with the large spatio-temporal fluctuations that create, to some extent, predictable tidal traffic conditions, are motivating the evolution from reactive to proactive and eventually towards adaptive optical networks. In these networks, traffic-driven service provisioning can address the problem of network over-provisioning and better adapt to traffic variations, while keeping the quality-of-service at the required levels. Such an approach will reduce network resource over-provisioning and thus reduce the total network cost. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art on machine learning (ML)-based techniques at the optical layer for traffic-driven service provisioning. The evolution of service provisioning in optical networks is initially presented, followed by an overview of the ML techniques utilized for traffic-driven service provisioning. ML-aided service provisioning approaches are presented in detail, including predictive and prescriptive service provisioning frameworks in proactive and adaptive networks. For all techniques outlined, a discussion on their limitations, research challenges, and potential opportunities is also presented.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforcement learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more difficult class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of StarCraft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep reinforcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make significant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

	abstract = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in solving challenging problems across various domains using deep reinforcement learning (RL). Reproducing existing work and accurately judging the improvements offered by novel methods is vital to sustaining this progress. Unfortunately, reproducing results for state-of-the-art deep RL methods is seldom straightforward. In particular, non-determinism in standard benchmark environments, combined with variance intrinsic to the methods, can make reported results tough to interpret. Without significance metrics and tighter standardization of experimental reporting, it is difficult to determine whether improvements over the prior state-of-the-art are meaningful. In this paper, we investigate challenges posed by reproducibility, proper experimental techniques, and reporting procedures. We illustrate the variability in reported metrics and results when comparing against common baselines and suggest guidelines to make future results in deep RL more reproducible. We aim to spur discussion about how to ensure continued progress in the field by minimizing wasted effort stemming from results that are non-reproducible and easily misinterpreted.},

	abstract = {Solving optimization problems is challenging for existing digital computers and even for future quantum hardware. The practical importance of diverse problems, from healthcare to financial optimization, has driven the emergence of specialised hardware over the past decade. However, their support for problems with only binary variables severely restricts the scope of practical problems that can be efficiently embedded. We build analog iterative machine (AIM), the first instance of an opto-electronic solver that natively implements a wider class of quadratic unconstrained mixed optimization (QUMO) problems and supports all-to-all connectivity of both continuous and binary variables.Beyond synthetic 7-bit problems at small-scale, AIM solves the financial transaction settlement problem entirely in analog domain with higher accuracy than quantum hardware and at room temperature. With compute-in-memory operation and spatial-division multiplexed representation of variables, the design of AIM paves the path to chip-scale architecture with 100 times speed-up per unit-power over the latest GPUs for solving problems with 10,000 variables. The robustness of the AIM algorithm at such scale is further demonstrated by comparing it with commercial production solvers across multiple benchmarks, where for several problems we report new best solutions. By combining the superior QUMO abstraction, sophisticated gradient descent methods inspired by machine learning, and commodity hardware, AIM introduces a novel platform with a step change in expressiveness, performance, and scalability, for optimization in the post-Moores law era.},

In this paper, we present a novel technique that we call action guidance that successfully trains agents to eventually optimize the true objective in games with sparse rewards while maintaining most of the sample efficiency that comes with reward shaping. We evaluate our approach in a simplified real-time strategy (RTS) game simulator called \${\textbackslash}mu\$RTS.},

While RL algorithms are often conceptually simple, their state-of-the-art implementations take numerous low- and high-level design decisions that strongly affect the performance of the resulting agents. Those choices are usually not extensively discussed in the literature, leading to discrepancy between published descriptions of algorithms and their implementations. This makes it hard to attribute progress in RL and slows down overall progress [Engstrom'20]. As a step towards filling that gap, we implement {\textgreater}50 such ``choices'' in a unified on-policy RL framework, allowing us to investigate their impact in a large-scale empirical study. We train over 250'000 agents in five continuous control environments of different complexity and provide insights and practical recommendations for on-policy training of RL agents.},

	abstract = {Owing to their ability to both effectively integrate information over long time horizons and scale to massive amounts of data, self-attention architectures have recently shown breakthrough success in natural language processing (NLP), achieving state-of-the-art results in domains such as language modeling and machine translation. Harnessing the transformer's ability to process long time horizons of information could provide a similar performance boost in partially observable reinforcement learning (RL) domains, but the large-scale transformers used in NLP have yet to be successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the supervised learning setting but becomes especially pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural modifications that substantially improve the stability and learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant. The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL), surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30 benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL, trained using the same losses, has stability and performance that consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline, including on more reactive tasks where memory is less critical. GTrXL offers an easy-to-train, simple-to-implement but substantially more expressive architectural alternative to the standard multi-layer LSTM ubiquitously used for RL agents in partially observable environments.},

	abstract = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to this problem for the first time and show that an RL policy based on graph neural networks can learn resource allocation policies end-to-end that outperform previous hand-engineered heuristics by up to 22.0{\textbackslash}\%, 42.6{\textbackslash}\% and 22.6{\textbackslash}\% for acceptance ratio, CPU and memory utilisation respectively, maintain performance when scaled up to RDDC topologies with \$10{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}times\$ more nodes than those seen during training and can achieve comparable performance to the best baselines while using \$5.3{\textbackslash}times\$ less network resources.},

Unfortunately, this tuning is often a âblack artâ requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithmâs generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expert-level performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

However, different transport technologies or quality of service (QoS) levels may impact both the requested amount of resources and the characteristics of different virtual instances that can be built on top of a single physical infrastructure. In this paper we propose a novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for different schemes of protection in scenarios where multiple virtual topologies run over an elastic optical network. The proposed MILP formulation uses the concept of bandwidth squeezing to guarantee a minimum bandwidth for surviving virtual topologies. It achieves a high level of survivability for traffic that is subject to a different committed service profile for each virtual topology. Case studies are carried out in order to analyze the basic properties of the formulation in small networks, and three heuristics are proposed for larger networks.},

We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration nonstochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that Hyperband can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many challenging strategy games. Because these games have complicated rules, an action sampled from the full discrete action distribution predicted by the learned policy is likely to be invalid according to the game rules (e.g., walking into a wall). The usual approach to deal with this problem in policy gradient algorithms is to "mask out" invalid actions and just sample from the set of valid actions. The implications of this process, however, remain under-investigated. In this paper, we 1) show theoretical justification for such a practice, 2) empirically demonstrate its importance as the space of invalid actions grows, and 3) provide further insights by evaluating different action masking regimes, such as removing masking after an agent has been trained using masking.

A virtual network request is embedded in the substrate network with allocating the primary and backup resources which are node-disjoint. Modulation selection and spectrum allocation with constraints from elastic optical networks are considered in the embedding procedure. We consider the backup computing and transmission resource sharing to reduce the required backup resources. We formulate the proposed model as an integer linear programming problem to minimize the rejection ratio for a given set of virtual network requests. We introduce a greedy-based approach that promotes resource sharing to handle the largersize problem in a practical time. In order to further improve the performance on the objective value, a deep reinforcement learning-based approach with polynomial time complexity in each episode is developed to solve the problem in multiple stages. We design a dedicated learning agent for each stage considering the problem property. We analyze the usages of different approaches based on performance evaluation. The numerical results show that, compared to a conventional model that adopts dedicated protection, the proposed model with shared protection reduces the rejection ratio by 15\% on average in our examined cases.},

	abstract = {Network virtualization makes it possible to manage multiple virtual networks simultaneously on substrate physical networks. Virtual network embedding (VNE) is the critical step of network virtualization that maps virtual network requests to substrate physical networks. The majority of current virtual network embedding algorithms utilize heuristic algorithm, and manually customize a series of rules and assumptions. Therefore, these experimental results are not particularly convincing. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning based dynamic attribute matrix representation (RDAM) algorithm for virtual network embedding. The RDAM algorithm decomposes the process of node mapping into the following three steps: (1) static representation of substrate physical network. (2) dynamic update of substrate physical network. (3) Reinforcement-Learning-Based algorithm. To our best knowledge, RDAM algorithm is the ï¬rst algorithm to apply spectral analysis and perturbation theory to virtual network embedding. Meanwhile, the method training virtual network embedding algorithm by reinforcement learning is also non-trivial. Furthermore, we compare RDAM algorithm with three other virtual network embedding algorithms. The results show that RDAM algorithm outperforms the other three algorithms in terms of several evaluation metrics, such as long-term average revenue, long-term revenue consumption ratio, and acceptance ratio.},

	abstract = {In todayâs datacenters (DCs), IT resources virtualization is leveraged to realize Network Function Virtualization (NFV) over general-purpose servers. Meanwhile, most of the service providers (SPs) are planning to use Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to provide agile and ï¬exible network services. In service provisioning, the VNF selection and mapping greatly affect IT resource utilization in DCs and spectrum resource utilization in optical networks. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforce Learning (DRL)-based algorithm for VNF provisioning. By selecting appropriate VNFs for the service requests, the algorithm intelligently guarantees efï¬cient reusing of deployed VNFs while consuming fewer spectrum resources in inter-DC elastic optical networks (EONs). To facilitate the decision-making of the DRL agent, we ï¬rst decompose the complex VNF-based service chaining (VNF-SC) into several VNF components (VNFCs), which can be solved one-by-one in turn. Then, a feature matrix-based encoding scheme is designed to represent the set of the VNFCs, the available DCs for the VNFCs, and the VNFC being operated, i.e., the input of neural networks. In addition, considering the complexity and difï¬culty of the VNFSC provisioning problem, Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) is introduced in the proposed algorithm. Finally, compared with the benchmark heuristics, the extensive simulation results in different network topologies show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the IT and spectrum resource consumption by at least 9.6\% and 1.6\%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based VNF provisioning algorithm.},

	abstract = {Network virtualization is a key enabling technology for âInfrastructure as a Serviceâ provisioning, increasing the flexibility and cost savings offered to customers. By extending the concept of server virtualization to the network infrastructure, the allocation of different, independent virtual networks over a single physical network is carried out on demand. A fundamental challenge in network virtualization systems is to choose which physical nodes and links to use for hosting virtual networks in the physical infrastructure, known as the âvirtual network allocationâ problem. All virtual network allocation proposals on elastic optical networks assume a centralized operation, deploying a single node with access to the network state global information and assigning resources accordingly. However, such configuration might exhibit the inherent problems of centralized systems: survivability and scalability. In this paper, we present a distributed protocol for resource discovery, mapping, and allocation of network virtualization systems. The distributed protocol is generic enough as to be used with different substrate networks. However, in this paper, it has been adapted to work over an elastic optical network infrastructure, where further considerations regarding the spectrum continuity and contiguity constraints must also be taken into account. The distributed protocol is based on the concept of alliances: upon the arrival of a virtual network request, agents located in the physical network nodes compete to form the first alliance able to host the virtual network. Because the first alliances to be formed are also the ones composed by nearby nodes, a good network resource usage is achieved. The feasibility of the distributed protocol was studied by evaluating its ability to successfully establish virtual networks within acceptable time and with low bandwidth consumption from the coordination messages.},

	abstract = {Due to the accelerated evolution of application services, the sharing of physical network infrastructure among different users and applications can be facilitated by optical network virtualization, which simplifies opticallayer resource management and enables flexibility in spectrum resource allocation. However, fragmentation is one of the great challenges in implementing virtual optical network embedding (VONE) over flexible-grid elastic optical networks (EONs). In this paper, we propose a fragmentation-aware VONE algorithm to reduce spectral fragmentation and improve resource unitization. We first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model for multiple static VON requests, while considering the continuity and consecutiveness of the substrate fiber linksâ (SFLs) optical spectra. Then, to realize the coordinated node and link mapping in the VONE, we constructed a virtual auxiliary graph (VAG) that decomposes the physical infrastructure into several layered graphs, according to the spectrum slot requirement of a VON request. Three different provisioning schemes are designed. The former two benchmark schemes (i.e., spectrum resource traffic balancing and spectrum resource and computing resource traffic balancing) apply a traffic balancing policy on the spectrum resource and computing resource, while another spectrum resource traffic balancing and defragmentation (SRTB\&DF) scheme additionally uses a proactive defragmentation method in the VONE process, with the aid of a novel metric called âfragment block size.â The extensive simulations, which consider both static network planning and dynamic service provisioning scenarios, have demonstrated that the proposed fragmentation-aware VONE algorithm with the SR-TB\&DF scheme facilitates the reduction of the spectrum slot fragments and improves the request blocking ratio as well, compared with the two other benchmark schemes.},

With LAG, we design two heuristic algorithms: one applies LAG to achieve integrated routing and spectrum assignment in link mapping (i.e., local resource capacity (LRC)-layered shortest-path routing LaSP), while the other realizes coordinated node and link mapping using LAG (i.e., layered local resource capacity(LaLRC)-LaSP). The simulation results from three different substrate topologies demonstrate that LaLRCLaSP achieves better blocking performance than LRC-LaSP and an existing benchmark algorithm. For the opaque VONE, an ILP model is also formulated. We then design a LRC metric that considers the spectrum consecutiveness of SFLs. With this metric, a novel heuristic for opaque VONE, consecutiveness-aware LRC-K shortest-path-ï¬rst ï¬t (CaLRC-KSP-FF), is proposed.
