\section{Conclusion}

Our work demonstrates that LLMs hold significant potential for lossless image compression. By designing embeddings tailored for image data and incorporating visual prompts, we achieve state-of-the-art lossless compression performance. Additionally, this framework can be effectively adapted to other image compression domains, such as screen content images and medical images. 
While our exploration of this framework is still in its early stages, we believe that this LLM-based method has the potential to become a new paradigm for image compression in the near future.
