abstract = {Speaker recognition is a task of identifying persons from their voices. Recently, deep learning has dramatically revolutionized speaker recognition. However, there is lack of comprehensive reviews on the exciting progress. In this paper, we review several major subtasks of speaker recognition, including speaker verification, identification, diarization, and robust speaker recognition, with a focus on deep-learning-based methods. Because the major advantage of deep learning over conventional methods is its representation ability, which is able to produce highly abstract embedding features from utterances, we first pay close attention to deep-learning-based speaker feature extraction, including the inputs, network structures, temporal pooling strategies, and objective functions respectively, which are the fundamental components of many speaker recognition subtasks. Then, we make an overview of speaker diarization, with an emphasis of recent supervised, end-to-end, and online diarization. Finally, we survey robust speaker recognition from the perspectives of domain adaptation and speech enhancement, which are two major approaches of dealing with domain mismatch and noise problems. Popular and recently released corpora are listed at the end of the paper.}

abstract = {Speaker Identification (SI) is the process of identifying the speaker from a given utterance by comparing the voice biometrics of the utterance with those utterance models stored beforehand. SI technologies are taken a new direction due to the advances in artificial intelligence and have been used widely in various domains. Feature extraction is one of the most important aspects of SI, which significantly influences the SI process and performance. This systematic review is conducted to identify, compare, and analyze various feature extraction approaches, methods, and algorithms of SI to provide a reference on feature extraction approaches for SI applications and future studies. The review was conducted according to Kitchenham systematic review methodology and guidelines, and provides an in-depth analysis on proposals and implementations of SI feature extraction methods discussed in the literature between year 2011 and 2106. Three research questions were determined and an initial set of 535 publications were identified to answer the questions. After applying exclusion criteria 160 related publications were shortlisted and reviewed in this paper; these papers were considered to answer the research questions. Results indicate that pure Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) based feature extraction approaches have been used more than any other approach. Furthermore, other MFCC variations, such as MFCC fusion and cleansing approaches, are proven to be very popular as well. This study identified that the current SI research trend is to develop a robust universal SI framework to address the important problems of SI such as adaptability, complexity, multi-lingual recognition, and noise robustness. The results presented in this research are based on past publications, citations, and number of implementations with citations being most relevant. This paper also presents the general process of SI.}
