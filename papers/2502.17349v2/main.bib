    abstract = {PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) has recently emerged as a promising technology. However, the design of rational PROTACs, especially the linker component, remains challenging due to the absence of structure‚Äìactivity relationships and experimental data. Leveraging the structural characteristics of PROTACs, fragment-based drug design (FBDD) provides a feasible approach for PROTAC research. Concurrently, artificial intelligence‚Äìgenerated content has attracted considerable attention, with diffusion models and Transformers emerging as indispensable tools in this field. In response, we present a new diffusion model, DiffPROTACs, harnessing the power of Transformers to learn and generate new PROTAC linkers based on given ligands. To introduce the essential inductive biases required for molecular generation, we propose the O(3) equivariant graph Transformer module, which augments Transformers with graph neural networks (GNNs), using Transformers to update nodes and GNNs to update the coordinates of PROTAC atoms. DiffPROTACs effectively competes with existing models and achieves comparable performance on two traditional FBDD datasets, ZINC and GEOM. To differentiate the molecular characteristics between PROTACs and traditional small molecules, we fine-tuned the model on our self-built PROTACs dataset, achieving a 93.86\% validity rate for generated PROTACs. Additionally, we provide a generated PROTAC database for further research, which can be accessed at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/service/DiffPROTACs-generated.tgz. The corresponding code is available at https://github.com/Fenglei104/DiffPROTACs and the server is at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/diffprotacs.},

abstract={In recent years, significant advancements have been made in molecular generation algorithms aimed at facilitating drug development, and molecular diversity holds paramount importance within the realm of molecular generation. Nonetheless, the effective quantification of molecular diversity remains an elusive challenge, as extant metrics exemplified by Richness and Internal Diversity fall short in concurrently encapsulating the two main aspects of such diversity: quantity and dissimilarity. To address this quandary, we propose Hamiltonian diversity, a novel molecular diversity metric predicated upon the shortest Hamiltonian circuit. This metric embodies both aspects of molecular diversity in principle, and we implement its calculation with high efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, through empirical experiments we demonstrate the high consistency of Hamiltonian diversity with real-world chemical diversity, and substantiate its effects in promoting diversity of molecular generation algorithms. Our implementation of Hamiltonian diversity in Python is available at: https://github.com/HXYfighter/HamDiv.},

abstract = {Abstract This article introduces MMFF94, the initial published version of the Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94 differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. Indeed, MMFF94 seeks to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined “organic/protein” force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality computational data—ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the HF/6-31G* level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G* level, 380 MP2/6-31G* structures evaluated at a defined approximation to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from MP2/6-31G* geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94 represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the common “functional group” approach, nearly all MMFF parameters have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Å root mean square [rms]), bond angles (1.2° rms), vibrational frequencies (61 cm−1 rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol/rms), and rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {Normalizing flows provide a general mechanism for defining expressive probability distributions, only requiring the specification of a (usually simple) base distribution and a series of bijective transformations. There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},
