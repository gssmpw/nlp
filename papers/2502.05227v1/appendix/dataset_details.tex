\textbf{Multiagent Dataset} This dataset consists of tasks designed to test the LLM agent's multiagent capabilities. Robotouille's multiagent capabilities test the agent's ability to collaborate, and is more difficult because it includes tasks where agents may potentially interfere with one another, and share resources with one another. 

\textbf{Tasks 1 - 3: Burgers} The first 3 tasks involve cooking and assembling a burger with increasing levels of difficulty. In Task 1, the agents need to chop lettuce, and cook a patty, before assembling the burger with the patty, lettuce, a bottom bun, and a top bun. In Task 2, the complexity is increased with an additional ingredient, a tomato, that needs to be cut and stacked onto the burger. In Task 3, lettuce needs to be cut, a chicken needs to be fried, and an onion needs to be cut first before it is fried. This adds a level of complexity because one of the ingredients, the onion, needs to be both cut and fried. 

\textbf{Tasks 4 - 6: Sandwiches} Tasks 4 - 6 involve making sandwiches. Unlike the tasks which only involve a single agent, sandwiches in multiagent environments are more complex than burgers because there is ambiguity in the stack ordering. In burgers, the bottom bun needs to be at the bottom, while in sandwiches, a piece of bread can be used as either the bottom bread or the top bread. This is complex because the agents need to collaborate and share the resources, and they need to agree on which bread to use as the top bread and the bottom bread. Task 4 involves cutting a lettuce and cooking a chicken before assembling the sandwich. Task 5 involves one more ingredient, a tomato, which also needs to be cut. Task 6 is a double stacked lettuce chicken sandwich. Unlike the previous tasks, Task 6 enforces a strict ordering on the placement of the ingredients, meaning that the agents need to collaborate and properly agree on the order of the ingredients. 

\textbf{Task 7: Soup} Task 7 involves cooking soup. This involves filling a pot of water, boiling a water, adding three ingredients into the soup: a cut onion, a potato, and a cut tomato, before serving the soup in a bowl. This task is complex because it involves multiple complex actions, including cutting, filling the pot, and boiling the water. 

\textbf{Tasks 8 - 10: Multiple Recipes} Tasks 8 - 10 involve the agents making multiple recipes. Task 8 involves 2 different recipes, a tomato cheese patty burger, and a onion chicken sandwich. This task is difficult for multiple agents because the 2 recipes both require an ingredient to be cut and an ingredient to be cooked. Task 9 involves making 2 identical lettuce cheeseburgers. Having 2 identical recipes is more complex than having 2 different recipes because the agents need to agree on which ingredient should be used in which burger. Finally, Task 10 involves making 2 different soups, a potato tomato chicken soup, and a potato cheese onion soup. Soups are the most complex recipes because it involves multiple complex actions. Furthermore, once an ingredient has been added to a soup, it cannot be removed. This forces the agents to properly plan for which ingredient should go into which soup.
