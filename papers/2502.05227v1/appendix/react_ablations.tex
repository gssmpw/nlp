\react{} in its original form can grow very expensive in cost on long horizon tasks due to the increasing context size. We sought to perform early ablations of \react{} to find a cost-effective variant whose performance is relatively the same. We first ablated on the types of feedback from feedback at all ("no-history") to ablating away components of the feedback from the last time step (where "last-obs-reasoning-action" represents the last timestep with all feedback, "last-reasoning-action" represents the last timestep with only the reasoning and action, and "last-action" represents the last timestep with only the last action. Next, we tested two different types of reasoning; one where we simply prompt \react{} to reason about the given information and another where we make it provide a plan in its sequence before outputting a single action (which we've termed "mpc" after Model Predictive Control). From these ablations on a small subset of data, we determined that "last-reasoning-action-mpc" was the best performing and inexpensive as shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablation1}.

% Then we tested whether we lost out on performance by only using the last timestep versus the full context history with original \react{}. We also found that performance was relatively the same with a steep increase in price from original \react{}.
