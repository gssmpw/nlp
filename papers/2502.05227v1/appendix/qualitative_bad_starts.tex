\textbf{5\_ double\_ cheeseburger\_ 42} In this task, the agent misunderstands the goal from its very first line of reasoning. The goal is to make a double cheeseburger on a table, with a bottom bun, cooked patty, cheese, cooked patty, cheese, and a top bun, stacked in that order. However, the agent misunderstands the goal and does not include all of the ingredients, causing it to fail to complete the task.

Reasoning: The goal is to make a double cheeseburger on a table with the following stack: |table -> patty -> cheese -> patty -> cheese. |

1. The first ingredient is a patty. I see patty1 on board1 and patty2 on table2. Since board1 is a cutting board and not a table, I will use patty2 on table2 as the base for the burger. I will move robot1 to table2 to pick up patty2.

Action: Move robot1 from table1 to table2

\textbf{9\_ onion\_ cheese\_ burger\_ and\_ lettuce\_ tomato\_ chicken\_ sandwich\_ 168} In this task, the agent correctly understands the ingredients needed for the two recipes and the order in which they should be stacked, but misunderstands the preparation of the ingredients, and does not register that it needs to first cut the onion, lettuce, and tomato. Thus, it does not include these preparations in its reasoning, and ultimately fails to complete the task.

Reasoning: The goal has two parts: prepare a burger with cheese and onions on one table, and a chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato on another table. 

For the burger with cheese and onions:
1. Bottom bun: bottombun1 on table1.
2. Onion: onion1 on table3.
3. Cheese: cheese1 on table2.
4. Patty: patty1 on fryer1.
5. Top bun: topbun1 on board1.

For the chicken sandwich with lettuce and tomato:
1. Bread: bread1 held by robot1 and bread2 on table4.
2. Chicken: chicken1 on table8.
3. Lettuce: lettuce1 on table5 or lettuce2 on table6.
4. Tomato: tomato1 on sink1.

Steps:
1. Move bread1 (held by robot1) to table4 to combine with bread2.
2. Stack bread1 on top of bread2 to complete the bread part of the chicken sandwich.
3. Move robot1 to table8 to pick up chicken1.
4. Move robot1 to table4 to stack chicken1 on the bread.
|5. Move robot1 to table5 or table6 to pick up lettuce1 or lettuce2.
6. Move robot1 to table4 to stack lettuce on the chicken.
7. Move robot1 to sink1 to pick up tomato1.
8. Move robot1 to table4 to stack tomato1 on the lettuce.|

For the burger:
1. Move robot1 to table2 to pick up cheese1.
2. Move robot1 to table1 to stack cheese1 on bottombun1.
|3. Move robot1 to table3 to pick up onion1.
4. Move robot1 to table1 to stack onion1 on cheese1.|
5. Move robot1 to fryer1 to pick up patty1.
6. Move robot1 to table1 to stack patty1 on onion1.
7. Move robot1 to board1 to pick up topbun1.
8. Move robot1 to table1 to stack topbun1 on patty1.

Action: Stack bread1 on top of bread2 using robot1
