For each benchmark in (Table~\ref{tab:related-works}), we explain how the number of tasks and longest horizon plans were calculated.
\subsubsection{ALFWorld}
ALFWorld consists of 3827 different tasks consisting of 3,553 train tasks, 140 seen tasks, and 134 unseen tasks from the ALFRED dataset.

The longest horizon plan is 50 steps since 50 is the max number of steps per episode in ALFWorld.

\subsubsection{CuisineWorld}
CuisineWorld consist of 33 unique dishes which represent the tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 11 steps since Figure 2 of CuisineWorld indicates the dish distribution over the number of steps.

\subsubsection{MiniWoB++}
MiniWoB++ consist of 40 tasks since 40 tasks are filtered out of 80 total tasks from the MiniWoB benchmark.

The longest horizon plan is 13 steps since Table 1 indicates that 13 is the maximum number of steps needed for a perfect policy to complete the task.

\subsubsection{Overcooked-AI}
Overcooked-AI consists of 1 task since onion soup is the only dish in the environment.

The longest horizon plan is 100 steps since 100 is the max number of timesteps that planning methods are evaluated on.

\subsubsection{PlanBench}
PlanBench consist of 885 tasks consisting of 600 tasks from Blocksworld domain and 285 tasks from the Logistics domain.

The longest horizon plan is 48 steps since Figure 3 in PlanBench indicates that 48 is the longest optimal plan length from both the Blocksworld and Logistics problem sets.

\subsubsection{$\tau$-bench}
$\tau$-bench consist of 165 tasks consisting of 115 tasks from the $\tau$-retail benchmark and 50 tasks from the $\tau$-airline benchmark.

The longest horizon plan is 30 steps since 30 is the max number of actions per task in $\tau$-bench.

\subsubsection{WebArena}
WebArena consist of 812 long-horizon web-based tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 30 steps since 30 is the max number of state transitions in WebArena.

\subsubsection{WebShop}
WebShop consist of 12087 crowd-sourced text instructions which represent tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 90 steps since 90 is the max number of state visited in Table 2 of WebShop.

\subsubsection{AgentBench}
AgentBench consist of 8 environments which represent tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 35 steps since 35 is the largest number of average turns according to table 3 in AgentBench.

\subsubsection{ARA}
ARA consists if 12 real-world tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 4 steps after counting the number of steps in the description of each task in Table 1 of ARA.

\subsubsection{AsyncHow}
AsyncHow consists of 1600 high-quality instances for real-life tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 9+ steps after checking Figure 5 of AsyncHow.

\subsection{MAgIC}
MAgIC consists of 5 games which represent tasks.

We will assume all games will have 3 players and the same number of rounds as indicated in Table 3 of magic (1 round for Chameleon, 2 for Undercover, and 5 for Cost Sharing, Prisoner's Dilemma, and Public Good).

Calculations of longest plan with regards to steps:

Chameleon: (3 clues given out to participants + 3 accusations/votes from participants + 1 guess for the final word if the chameleon is correctly identified) * 1 round = 7 steps

Undercover: (3 people are assigned groups + 3 clues are given from participants + 3 votes from participants) * 2 rounds = 18 steps

Cost Sharing:  3 parties get allocation of money + (1 negotiation phase + 1 fairness check) * 5 rounds = 13 steps

Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma: 3 decisions from participants * 5 rounds = 15 steps

Public Good: (3 decisions from participants + 1 redistribution of money) * 5 rounds = 20 steps

Therefore, Public Good has the longest horizon plan with 20 steps.

\subsubsection{T-Eval}
T-Eval consists of 23305 tasks according to Table 2 in T-Eval.

The longest horizon plan is 19 steps based on Figure 5b in T-Eval.

\subsubsection{MLAgentBench}
MLAgentBench consists of 13 ML tasks from diverse domains ranging in difficulty and recency.

The longest horizon plan is 50 steps based on Figure 7 in MLAgentBench which describes the distribution of numbers of steps used by agents.

\subsubsection{GAIA}
GAIA consists of 466 carefully crafted and human annotated questions.

The longest horizon plan is around 45 steps based on Figure 3 in GAIA which describes the distribution of numbers of steps taken and tools used to answer the 466 questions.

\subsubsection{VirtualHome}
VirtualHome consists of 2821 programs which represent tasks.

The longest horizon plan is 96 steps after examining all the activities in VirtualHome's Activity Knowledge base and finding the longest.
