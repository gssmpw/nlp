The complexity of search for synchronous and asynchronous given the MDP in Section~\ref{sec:formulation} is:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Synchronous Case $(d = 0)$: No delays, so the planner operates in $O(|S| + |A|)$
    \item Asynchronous Case $( d > 0 )$: Each delay expands the effective state space, yielding $O(|S| \times (d+1)^n + |A|)$ complexity, where $n$ is the number of timers
\end{enumerate}

Hence the expanded state space requires both a conventional planner or a LLM based planner to reason over a larger range of delayed effects.
