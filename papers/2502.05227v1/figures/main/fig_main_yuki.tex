    \caption{Overview of \robotouille{} along with examples of our synchronous and asynchronous benchmarks. \robotouille{} takes a domain and problem JSON to procedurally generate an environment for an LLM agent to plan in. In the synchronous benchmark, the order that the burger is assembled has minimal impact in the efficiency of the plan. In the asynchronous benchmark, ordering matters due to time delays; leaving the patty to cook before cutting the lettuce is more efficient than leaving the patty to cook after cutting the lett.}
