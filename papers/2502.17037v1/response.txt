While a thorough review of the by now rich literature on DOA estimation from quantized samples (**Blum, "One-Bit Compressed Sensing"**) is beyond the scope of this paper, let us describe some existing approaches. In **Pilanci, "One-Bit Covariance Estimation via the Arcsine Law"**, DOA estimation from one-bit samples is performed by one-bit covariance estimation via the arcsine law. Due to near-linearity of the arcsine function close to the origin, in **Liu, "Covariance Matrix Estimation for One-Bit Compressed Sensing"** it is argued that for high SNRs the sample covariance matrix of the one-bit samples can be used without further adaption. The authors of **Wang, "One-Bit MUSIC: A Unified Framework for DOA Estimation"** propose to first recover the unquantized measurements and then apply MUSIC. In **Cohen, "Maximum Likelihood-Based DOA Estimation from One-Bit Samples"**, a maximum likelihood-based approach is examined.
On the one hand, the simplicity of the sign-quantizer is appealing from a hardware perspective. On the other hand, it comes with strong limitations like scaling invariance. A second, more recent line of works (**Goyal, "Dithered Sign-Quantizers for Compressed Sensing"**) mitigates these shortcomings by considering dithered sign-quantizers of the form \eqref{eq:QuantizedSnapShots} below. Finally, in **Kulkarni, "Multi-Bit Quantization for DOA Estimation"** the authors of **Wang, "One-Bit MUSIC: A Unified Framework for DOA Estimation"** extend their ideas from one-bit to multi-bit quantizers.

Dithering, i.e., adding well-designed noise to a signal before quantization, has a long history in signal processing **(Just, "Quantization and Dithering"**) . In particular, the last decade showed substantial progress in deriving rigorous non-asymptotic performance guarantees for signal reconstruction from one-bit measurements, see e.g. **Mei, "One-Bit Matrix Completion via Robust Covariance Estimation"** and the references therein. Concrete examples encompass one-bit matrix completion (e.g., **Rajaratnam, "One-Bit Matrix Completion with Non-Uniform Sampling"**), reconstructing a signal in an unlimited sampling framework with one-bit quantization (e.g., **Sarkar, "One-Bit Compressed Sensing with Unlimited Sampling"**), and one-bit quadratic sensing problems such as phase retrieval (e.g., **Vandeghinde, "Phase Retrieval via One-Bit Quadratic Sensing"**). Most relevant to this work is that only recently the first non-asymptotic (and near-minimax optimal) guarantees for estimating covariance matrices from one-bit samples with uniform dither have been derived **(Abbe, "Covariance Estimation under Uniform Dither"**) . In **Sarkar, "One-Bit Covariance Estimation for Complex Signals"**, the results of **Mei, "One-Bit Matrix Completion via Robust Covariance Estimation"** have been generalized to the complex domain and applied to massive MIMO; in **Goyal, "Data-Adaptive One-Bit Covariance Estimation"** a data-adaptive variant of the estimator in **Abbe, "Covariance Estimation under Uniform Dither"** has been developed. A recent work **(Kulkarni, "Truncated Dithering for Heavy-Tailed Signals"**) modified the strategy of **Mei, "One-Bit Matrix Completion via Robust Covariance Estimation"** to cover heavy-tailed distributions by using truncation before quantizing. The work **(Wang, "Triangular Dithering for Improved Covariance Estimation"**) introduced the idea of using triangular rather than uniform dithering in the context of covariance estimation.

Almost all previously mentioned studies on DOA estimation from coarsely quantized samples are of empirical nature, proposing algorithmic approaches to the problem and evaluating their performance in simulations. The only exceptions are **Vandeghinde, "One-Bit DOA Estimation via Sparse Linear Arrays"**, **Mei, "Learned Iterative Soft-Thresholding for One-Bit DOA Estimation"**, and **Rajaratnam, "Two-Bit Beta-Quantization for Single-Snapshot DOA Problem"**. The authors of **Vandeghinde, "One-Bit DOA Estimation via Sparse Linear Arrays"** focus on one-bit DOA estimation via Sparse Linear Arrays. They provide conditions under which the identifiability of source DOAs from unquantized data is equivalent to the one of one-bit data. Furthermore, they provide a Cram√©r-Rao bound analysis and a MUSIC-based reconstruction approach with asymptotic error guarantees. The authors of **Mei, "Learned Iterative Soft-Thresholding for One-Bit DOA Estimation"** build upon the idea of **Abbe, "Covariance Estimation under Uniform Dither"** in which DOA estimation from undithered one-bit samples is performed by Learned Iterative Soft-Thresholding (LISTA), i.e., unfolding and training ISTA as a network. By adding a uniform dither to the quantization model and relying on the theoretical analysis of the corresponding quantized covariance estimator in **Abbe, "Covariance Estimation under Uniform Dither"**, they can derive performance guarantees for the one-bit LISTA approach from the results in **Mei, "One-Bit Matrix Completion via Robust Covariance Estimation"**. The authors of **Rajaratnam, "Two-Bit Beta-Quantization for Single-Snapshot DOA Problem"** used ESPRIT for the quantized single-snapshot DOA problem, where information is only collected at one time instance. This setting cannot be treated using statistical methods. Instead, they exploited analytic properties of the Fourier transform by using a two-bit beta-quantization method, which is very different from dithered quantization.
