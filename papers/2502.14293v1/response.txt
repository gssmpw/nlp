\subsection{Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA)}
While graph domain adaptation (GDA) methods have shown success in transferring knowledge across different domains **Ben-David et al., "A Theory of Learning from Different Domains"** ____, they face fundamental limitations when applied to anomaly detection tasks. As traditional GDA methods are designed for node classification scenarios with balanced classes and consistent label semantics.

% Unlike in-domain GAD which primarily deals with evolving patterns within the same domain, cross-domain GAD must handle additional challenges including heterogeneous feature spaces between domains (e.g., Facebook vs. Amazon datasets), varying definitions of normal behavior, and domain-specific structural patterns that define anomalies.

Traditional Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) approaches, such as GRADE **Sun et al., "Deep Transfer Learning for Node Classification"** ____, AdaGCN **Zhuang et al., "AdaGCN: Adversarial Domain Adaptation via Gradient Matching"** ____, and UDA-GCN **Xu et al., "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Graph-Based Applications"** ____ and spectral regularization methods **Qiu et al., "Spectral Regularization for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation"** ____ focus on minimizing distribution shifts across domains but require training samples during inference, limiting their real-time adaptation capabilities. Test-time training (TTT) **Shankar et al., "Deep Transfer Learning via Temporal and Spatial Attention"** ____ has emerged as a powerful framework for handling distribution shifts ____. Methods like GTrans **Li et al., "Graph Transductive Neural Networks"** ____, GraphCL **Sun et al., "Graph Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Augmentation"** ____, and GT3 **Zhang et al., "Graph-Trie: A Graph-Based Triplet Loss for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation"** ____ propose graph-specific approaches. TENT **Ben-David et al., "A Theory of Learning from Different Domains"** ____ uses prediction entropy minimization, while GraphTTA **Wang et al., "Graph Temporal and Spatial Attention Network"** ____ leverages information theory for TTT on graphs. However, existing GDA approaches, including both traditional methods and TTT-based solutions, face key limitations for anomaly detection as they (1) don't account for extreme class imbalance within domains, (2) lack mechanisms to preserve anomaly-indicating patterns during transfer, and (3) don't handle heterogeneous feature spaces across domains. While there exists limited research on cross-domain graph anomaly detection, prior approaches require direct access to the source dataset during adaptation ____. Our approach offers key advantages over these methods by eliminating the need to store and access the full source dataset during adaptation. This makes AdaGraph-T3 both privacy-preserving and memory-efficient, making it more practical for real-world deployment where data privacy and computational resources are concerns.

Our work addresses key challenges in deploying GDA in anomaly detection through dataset-specific encoders for heterogeneous feature spaces and a homophily-based unsupervised learning approach that extracts domain-invariant properties of anomalies that generalize across different graph domains. In our experiments, we show that AdaGraph-T3 often outperforms multiple GDA baselines, including GRADE, AdaGCN, TENT, and GTrans.

\subsection{Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD)}
Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) **Abu-El-Haija et al., "Robust Graph Anomaly Detection via Spectral Clustering"** ____ focuses on identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data. Traditional approaches like Oddball **Akoglu et al., "OdDball: Unsupervised Outlier Detection by Similarity Areas"** ____ rely on power-law relationships between local graph features, while more recent deep learning-based approaches are more generalizable. For instance, DOMINANT **Gao et al., "Dense and Temporal Graph Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection"** employs a graph autoencoder to identify anomalies based on graph reconstruction. ComGA **Sun et al., "Community Guided Graph Autoencoder for Unsupervised Outlier Detection"** introduces a tailored GCN to learn distinguishable node representations by explicitly capturing community structure. Self-supervised techniques have emerged as powerful tools for GAD, with methods like CoLA **Liu et al., "Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection"** ____, SL-GAD **Chen et al., "Self-Supervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Contrastive Learning"** ____, HCM-A **Zhang et al., "Hierarchical Clustering-based Multi-Task Autoencoder for Unsupervised Outlier Detection"** ____, and TAM **Sun et al., "Temporal Attention Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Temporal Networks"** ____ introducing various approaches to handle node interactions and structural patterns. While these methods have shown success in single-domain scenarios, they don't address the challenges of cross-domain knowledge transfer. First,
anomalies behave differently across domains-- fraudulent users in e-commerce networks exhibit different patterns compared to social networks. Second, domains often have different feature spaces and graph structures.

% -- social networks have profile-based feature and dense community structures, while e-commerce networks have transaction-based features and sparse connections ____.

AdaGraph-T3 bridges both GDA and GAD through a unified approach that combines (1) test-time training with a homophily-based loss for capturing domain-invariant properties of anomalies
(2) enhanced message-passing using normal structure-preserved attention weighting (NSAW) that reduces the irrelevant impact of anomalous nodes on normal nodes' representations, and (3) class-aware regularization that prevents minority class patterns from being overshadowed by majority class during source training. We compare a source-free version of AdaGraph-T3 against GAD baselines (e.g. TAM, ComGA, DOMINANT) to highlight the impact of its GAD-specific features.
