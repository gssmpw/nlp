\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced \systemName, a new font design system that enables non-expert users to create fonts of any writing system without the need for predesigned characters.
Our system makes two main technical contributions: multimodal-guided subspace and retractable preference modeling, which address the two key limitations in existing human-in-the-loop PBO.
Additionally, we incorporated an iterative style propagation and refinement process, enabling users to design style consistent font.
Through a study, we demonstrated that non-expert users can efficiently design Roman characters using our system, supported by both quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Furthermore, we showcased how users could create Roman and CJK characters in realistic scenarios and achieve satisfying results.
\systemName is independent of any specific font generative model, making it adaptable to various models beyond \textit{DG-Font} used in this paper.
This flexibility ensures \systemName can evolve with future font generation technology advancements.
