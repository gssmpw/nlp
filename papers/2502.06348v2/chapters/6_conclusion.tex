\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
POM attacks represent a pressing challenge in the DeFi space. \tool~provides an innovative, LLM-driven solution that automates the detection of these vulnerabilities by leveraging domain-specific knowledge and context-aware prompt generation. By streamlining the analysis process and ensuring actionable outputs, \tool~offers a scalable and effective approach to safeguarding DeFi ecosystems.

For future work, several promising directions can be explored to enhance and expand the capabilities of \tool:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extension to Additional Problems: \tool's framework can be expanded to address other DeFi issues, such as the accounting problem, privilege escalation, and inconsistent state updates.

\item Automating Knowledge Synthesis: To reduce manual effort, future versions of \tool~will enhance automation in knowledge synthesis, potentially using Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG)~\cite{gao2023retrieval} for efficient data extraction and summarization.

% \item Localization and Privacy: By identifying the optimal performance combination, \tool~can facilitate localization efforts. Future work will explore replacing commercial models with comparable open-source alternatives to enhance privacy and security for developers.
\item Instruction-tuned LLM: This effort may include the construction of suitable instruction-following dataset and further supervised fine-tuning of the prompt generator LLM and/or the auditor LLM~\cite{longpre2023flan} to better follow the instructions and prompts given and align the model's behave towards desired output.

\item Reducing False Alarms: Enhancing usability by exploring advanced and fine-grained prompt techniques, such as adaptive prompts and context-aware filtering, to minimize false alarms while maintaining high detection accuracy.
\end{itemize}

By pursuing these directions, \tool~can continue to evolve, offering comprehensive protection against a growing array of vulnerabilities in the DeFi ecosystem, while enhancing its efficiency and user-friendliness.
