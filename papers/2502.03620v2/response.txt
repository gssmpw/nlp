We use $ \Theta(d\ln{(m/\delta)}) $ uniform random variables on the interval $ [0:1] $,  $ \Theta(\ln{(m )}\cdot\ln{(m/(\delta(d+\ln{(1/\delta )})) )})$ uniform random variables on the discrete values  $ \{ 1,2,3,4,5 \} $, and $ \Theta(\ln{(m/(\delta(d+\ln{(1/\delta )})) )})$  uniform random variables on the discrete values $ \{ 1,\ldots,\Theta(\ln{(m )}) \} $. Further the model we use to count computational cost is arguably simplistic, and could be refined further.

The next section introduces the notation and preliminaries used in this work. \cref{sec:optimalityah} gives the proof of our optimal PAC learner using properties of $ \cA(\cS(S,\emptyset)) $ proved in \cref{sec:optimalitya} and properties of $ \cA $ proved in \cref{sec:propAdaBoostSample}, where some of the proofs for the properties are deferred to the three appendix one for each of the above-mentioned sections.
