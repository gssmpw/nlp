The occurrence of frequent incidents necessitates RCA for swift issue resolution. Applying LLM agents in RCA presents numerous challenges. To address the challenges, we propose Flow-of-Action, a novel SOP-enhanced MAS. Flow-of-Action effectively leverages SOP by designing the SOP flow to alleviate hallucinations in the orchestration process. The action set mechanism efficiently tackles the challenge of selecting actions in the face of diverse observations. By employing a main agent supported by multiple auxiliary agents, Flow-of-Action further refines the delineation of responsibilities among agents, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of Flow-of-Action.
