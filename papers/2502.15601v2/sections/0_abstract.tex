Constructing photorealistic virtual worlds has applications across various fields, but it often requires the extensive labor of highly trained professionals to operate conventional 3D modeling software.

To democratize this process, we introduce \emph{WorldCraft}, a system where large language model (LLM) agents leverage procedural generation to create indoor and outdoor scenes populated with objects, allowing users to control individual object attributes and the scene layout using intuitive natural language commands.

In our framework, a coordinator agent manages the overall process and works with two specialized LLM agents to complete the scene creation:  \emph{ForgeIt}, which integrates an ever-growing manual through auto-verification to enable precise customization of individual objects, and \emph{ArrangeIt}, which formulates hierarchical optimization problems to achieve a layout that balances ergonomic and aesthetic considerations.

Additionally, our pipeline incorporates a trajectory control agent, allowing users to animate the scene and operate the camera through natural language interactions. Our system is also compatible with off-the-shelf deep 3D generators to enrich scene assets.

Through evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the versatility of WorldCraft, ranging from single-object customization to intricate, large-scale interior and exterior scene designs. This system empowers non-professionals to bring their creative visions to life.
