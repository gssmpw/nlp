\section{Introduction}
The creation of 3D virtual worlds offers extensive applications across entertainment and immersive technologies, including film, gaming, and mixed reality. It also facilitates advancements in robotics by providing simulated environments to train embodied agents~\cite{kolve2017ai2, srivastava2022behavior, xiang2020sapien,szot2021habitat, yang2024holodeck}.
However, constructing physically feasible, photorealistic virtual environments necessitates extensive human labor, requiring highly trained professionals to operate conventional 3D modeling software. 



Recent approaches have begun to automate the process by generating 3D objects~\cite{poole2022dreamfusion,lin2023magic3d,hong2023lrm,zhang2024clay,siddiqui2024meta} or scenes~\cite{li2022infinitenature, yu2024wonderjourney, NEURIPS2023_7d62a85e, li2025dreamscene, zhou2025dreamscene360, po2024compositional} from text or single images. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art 3D scene generations often fall short in visual quality and lack detail. Furthermore, they typically do not offer granular customization options for individual objects or scene compositions with the desired layout.


To democratize the creation of photorealistic 3D worlds, we propose \emph{WorldCraft}, a system where LLM agents procedurally generate 3D scenes, emulating the step-by-step creative process of a human artist. As illustrated in \Cref{fig:teaser}, WorldCraft integrates users directly into the creation process, allowing them to use natural language to control individual objects and scene layouts, thereby assisting non-professionals in manifesting their creative visions.



Recent LLMs~\cite{achiam2023gpt, dubey2024llama, team2023gemini} have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, especially in managing complex visual tasks through programming~\cite{gupta2023visual}. However, they fall short in synthesizing 3D scenes, which requires a nuanced spatial understanding beyond simple token manipulation.

Procedural generators like Infinigen \cite{infinigen2023infinite, infinigen2024indoors} offer a glimpse of potential in LLM-based scene generation. Yet, due to lengthy pipelines and the complexity of parameter adjustments, off-the-shelf LLMs struggle to effectively manipulate these generators to tailor individual assets and arrange them according to the user’s design intent.

Recognizing these challenges, we propose a coordinator agent, which interacts with two specialized LLM agents to effectively navigate these complex procedural generators:
\textbf{(a) ForgeIt for individual object customization.} Procedural generators for individual objects within specific categories involve hundreds of parameters, which can appear nearly random to a general LLM agent. ForgeIt dynamically constructs a manual through an auto-verification mechanism. This ever-growing manual guides the agent in writing executable code to master the procedural generators, allowing it to accurately respond to user requests.
%
\textbf{(b) ArrangeIt for controllable scene layout generation.} To ensure that all objects in the scene are placed according to the user's design intent, as well as ergonomic factors such as visibility and accessibility, ArrangeIt formulates the scene arrangement as a hierarchical numerical optimization problem. This LLM agent then solves the problem using a novel optimization protocol.




Additionally, by incorporating a conversation-based trajectory control agent, our approach allows users to manipulate the movements of each object as well as the camera, thereby animating the world and synthesizing videos. Our 3D visual programming pipeline is also compatible with advanced off-the-shelf deep 3D generators ~\cite{hong2023lrm, instant3d2023, zhang2024clay, siddiqui2024meta}. These generators serve as complements to ForgeIt and introduce artistic objects that enhance the richness and diversity of the scenes.


Through a comprehensive evaluation and comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate WorldCraft’s ability to interpret and execute complex 3D world creation instructions. Our user study further demonstrates its promising prospects in more practical applications.
In summary, our contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the first time, we leverage LLM agents to procedurally generate highly complex and realistic indoor and outdoor 3D scenes.
    \item We introduce \emph{ForgeIt} for individual object control, constructing an ever-growing manual through an auto-verification mechanism.
    \item We propose \emph{ArrangeIt} for layout control, formulating scene arrangement as a hierarchical numerical optimization problem with a novel protocol to solve it.
    \item Our approach allows users to engage in intuitive natural language dialogues with the agent to customize individual objects, control layout, and direct movements.
\end{itemize}
