\section*{Impact Statement}
Our work advances the efficiency of aligning LLMs with human values by optimizing the way human preferences are queried. Since human feedback is costly and time-consuming, our approach can potentially reduce wasted effort on uninformative comparisons, maximizing the value of each annotation. By improving the efficiency of learning from human preferences, this research has the potential to accelerate the development of safer and more helpful AI systems.
