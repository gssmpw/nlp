\subsection{LLM-as-a-Judge}

LLM-as-a-Judge, introduced by ____, leverages LLMs to automatically evaluate responses and assign rewards. This approach has gained widespread adoption in areas such as model alignment ____ and benchmarking ____, driving significant progress in the field. Building on this concept, ____ proposed Agent-as-a-Judge, where agentic systems are employed to evaluate other agentic systems. Additionally, Prometheus, a series of open-source LLMs tailored for LLM-as-a-Judge ____, addresses the prohibitive costs associated with proprietary models, further democratizing the technology.

Despite its promising potential, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerabilities and limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge. Notable concerns include biases during evaluation. For example, ____ identify position bias, where LLMs may favor responses based on their order in the input, thereby compromising fairness. Other studies ____ further emphasize the risks of evaluation biases. ____ assessed the judgment capabilities of LLM judges, finding that only the most advanced models align reasonably well with human evaluators. Moreover, a recent study ____ revealed the susceptibility of LLM-as-a-Judge to adversarial attacks, leading to incorrect judgments. In this paper, we explore another critical vulnerability of LLM-as-a-Judge—preference leakage—which poses additional risks to the reliability of this evaluation paradigm.



% ____ examined the LLM-as-a-judge in detail, pointing out the multiple biases such as positional bias, self-enhancement bias that may exist when the LLM serves as a judge.

\subsection{Data Leakage}

The possible overlap between training data and evaluation benchmarks has become a central issue, since LLMs are usually trained on extensive web corpora 
____. This phenomenon, known as data leakage, can artificially improve the performance of LLMs and undermine the reliability of the assessment ____.


Several researchers have proposed methods to detect and mitigate data contamination. ____ proposed a retrieval-based approach to assess the degree of overlap between pre-training text and benchmark data. ____ have developed ``guided instruction'' to flag contaminated instances. ____ proposed the CDD method to identify peaks in the output distribution to detect data contamination. Several studies analyze data leakage for specific LLMs ____ and report contamination such as cross-language contamination ____ and task contamination ____ that can evade traditional detection methods. To address data contamination issues, ____ have used web user query detection and benchmark mixture. ____ use the most recent information to update the problem.

% Despite these efforts, data contamination remains a complex and challenging problem. The surge in synthetic pre-training data and the lack of open-source pre-training data pose a significant obstacle to solving this problem ____.
