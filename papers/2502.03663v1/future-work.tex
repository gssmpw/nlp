\section{Future Work}

In this paper we have shown how to effectively model the highway networks of the
50 U.S. states as fixed-growth graphs with constant dimensionality $\alpha$.
We believe that this model can be extended to many other applications such as
for graphs that model disease spread, decentralized peer-to-peer communication
networks, and gossip protocols.
It would certainly be interesting to see how the model performs on these
applications.
We are also optimistic that this model can be used to provide bounds for various
highway constants $k$ other than $\Theta(\log{n})$.
Another interesting direction would be to consider the case where the highway
dimensionality $\alpha$ depends on either the ball radius $\ell$, the number
of nodes in the graph $n$, or is non-uniform across the graph.
% Finally, we think there may probability distributions from which we pick
% long-range contacts that may provide better greedy routing results than
% $d(u, t)^{-s}$.
