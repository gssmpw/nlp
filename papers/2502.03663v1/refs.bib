  abstract = {We consider the problem of quickly computing shortest paths in weighted graphs. Often, this is achieved in two phases: (1) derive auxiliary data in an expensive preprocessing phase, and (2) use this auxiliary data to speed up the query phase. By adding a fast weight-customization phase, we extend Contraction Hierarchies to support a three-phase workflow. The expensive preprocessing is split into a phase exploiting solely the unweighted topology of the graph and a lightweight phase that adapts the auxiliary data to a specific weight. We achieve this by basing our Customizable Contraction Hierarchies (CCHs) on nested dissection orders. We provide an in-depth experimental analysis on large road and game maps showing that CCHs are a very practicable solution in scenarios where edge weights often change.},

  abstract="We present a new way of analyzing Contraction Hierarchies (CH), a widely used speed-up technique for shortest path computations in road networks. In previous work, preprocessing and query times of deterministically constructed CH on road networks with n nodes were shown to be polynomial in n as well as the highway dimension h of the network and its diameter D. While h is conjectured to be polylogarithmic for road networks, a tight bound remains an open problem. We rely on the empirically justifiable assumption of the road network exhibiting small growth. We introduce a method to construct randomized Contraction Hierarchies on road networks as well as a probabilistic query routine. Our analysis reveals that randomized CH lead to sublinear search space sizes in the order of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}} {\backslash}log {\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}{\$}{\$}, auxiliary data in the order of {\$}{\$}n {\backslash}log ^2 {\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}{\$}{\$}, and correct query results with high probability after a polynomial time preprocessing phase.",

  publisher = {AAAI Press},
  abstract = {Shortest path planning is a fundamental building block in many applications. Hence developing efficient methods for computing shortest paths in e.g. road or grid networks is an important challenge. The most successful techniques for fast query answering rely on preprocessing. But for many of these techniques it is not fully understood why they perform so remarkably well and theoretical justification for the empirical results is missing. An attempt to explain the excellent practical performance of preprocessing based techniques on road networks (as transit nodes, hub labels, or contraction hierarchies) in a sound theoretical way are parametrized analyses, e.g., considering the highway dimension or skeleton dimension of a graph. But these parameters tend to be large (order of Θ(√n)) when the network contains grid-like substructures - which inarguably is the case for real-world road networks around the globe. In this paper, we use the very intuitive notion of bounded growth graphs to describe road networks and also grid graphs. We show that this model suffices to prove sublinear search spaces for the three above mentioned state-of-the-art shortest path planning techniques. For graphs with a large highway or skeleton dimension, our results turn out to be superior. Furthermore, our preprocessing methods are close to the ones used in practice and only require randomized polynomial time.},

Nearest neighbor algorithms for general metric spaces are quite weak, which motivates a search for other classes of metric spaces that can be tractably searched.In this paper, we develop an efficient dynamic data structure for nearest neighbor queries in growth-constrained metrics. These metrics satisfy the property that for any point q and number r the ratio between numbers of points in balls of radius 2r and r is bounded by a constant. Spaces of this kind may occur in networking applications, such as the Internet or Peer-to-peer networks, and vector quantization applications, where feature vectors fall into low-dimensional manifolds within high-dimensional vector spaces.},

Instead, nodes employ randomization for their decisions. Our algorithm computes a MIS in O(log log n • log* n) rounds with very high probability for graphs with bounded growth, where n denotes the number of nodes in the graph. In view of Linial's Ω(log* n) lower bound for computing a MIS in ring networks [12], which was extended to randomized algorithms independently by Naor [18] and Linial [13], our solution is close to optimal.In a nutshell, our algorithm shows that for computing a MIS, randomization is a viable alternative to distance information.},

Due to this bounded "volume growth," one could expect that distributed algorithms are able to solve many problems more efficiently than on general graphs. The goal of this paper is to help understanding the distributed complexity of problems on "bounded growth" graphs. We show that on the widely used unit disk graph, covering and packing linear programs can be approximated by constant factors in constant time. For a more general network model which is based on the assumption that nodes are in a metric space of constant doubling dimension, we show that in O(log*!n) rounds it is possible to construct a (O(1), O(1))-network decomposition. This results in asymptotically optimal O(log*!n) time algorithms for many important problems.},

Let Z∞d be the infinite graph whose vertex set is Zd and which has an edge (u,v) whenever ||u-v||∞ = 1. Let dim(G) be the smallest d such that G occurs as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph of Z∞d. The growth rate of G, denoted ρG, is the minimum ρ such that every ball of radius r > 1 in G contains at most rρ vertices. By simple volume arguments, dim(G) = Ω(ρG). Levin conjectured that this lower bound is tight, i.e., that dim(G) = O(ρG) for every graph G.Previously, it was not known whether dim(G) could be upper bounded by any function of ρG, even in the special case of trees. We show that a weaker form of Levin's conjecture holds by proving that, for every graph G, dim(G) = O(ρG log ρG). We disprove, however, the specific bound of the conjecture and show that our upper bound is tight by exhibiting graphs for which dim(G) =Ω(ρG log ρG). For families of graphs which exclude a fixed minor, we salvage the strong form, showing that dim(G) = O(ρG). This holds also for graphs without long induced simple cycles. Our results extend to a variant of the conjecture for finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces due to Linial[15].},

In A Survey of Fractal Dimensions of Networks the theory and computation of the most important of these dimensions are reviewed, including the box counting dimension, the correlation dimension, the mass dimension, the transfinite fractal dimension, the information dimension, the generalized dimensions (which providea way to describe multifractals), and the sandbox method (for approximating the generalized dimensions). The book describes the use of diameter-based and radius-based boxes, and presents several heuristic methods for box counting, including greedy coloring, random sequential node burning, and a method for computing a lower bound. We also discuss very recent results on resolving ambiguity in the calculation of the information dimension and the generalized dimensions, and on the non-monotonicity of the generalized dimensions. Anyone interested in the theory and application of networks will want to read this Brief.

(A doubling metric is one whose doubling dimension dim(<i<X</i<) is a constant.) We consider the metric space induced by the shortest-path distance in an underlying undirected graph G. We show how to perform (1 + τ)-stretch routing on such a metric for any 0 < τ ≤ 1 with routing tables of size at most (α/τ)O(α)log Δlog δ bits with only (α/τ)O(α)log Δ entries, where Δ is the diameter of the graph, and δ is the maximum degree of the graph G; hence, the number of routing table entries is just τ − O(1)log Δ for doubling metrics. These results extend and improve on those of Talwar (2004).We also give better constructions of sparse spanners for doubling metrics than those obtained from the routing tables earlier; for τ > 0, we give algorithms to construct (1 + τ)-stretch spanners for a metric (X, d) with maximum degree at most (2 + 1/τ)O(dim(X)), matching the results of Das et al. for Euclidean metrics.},

  abstract = {Dating back to two famous experiments by the social-psychologist, Stanley Milgram, in the 1960s, the small-world phenomenon is the idea that all people are connected through a short chain of acquaintances that can be used to route messages. Many subsequent papers have attempted to model this phenomenon, with most concentrating on the "short chain" of acquantances rather than their ability to efficiently route messages. For example, a well-known preferential attachment model by Barab\'{a}si and Albert provides a mathematical explanation of how a social network can have small diameter---hence, short chains between participants--- but this model doesn't explain how they can route messages. A notable exception is a well-known model by Jon Kleinberg, which shows that it is possible for participants in a n \texttimes{} n grid to route a message in O(log2 n) hops by augmenting the grid with a small number of long-range random links and using a simple greedy routing strategy. Although Kleinberg's model is intriguing, it does not take into account the road network of the United States used in the original Milgram experiments and its O(log2 n) number of hops for messages is actually quite far from the average of six hops for successful messages observed by Milgram in his experiments, which gave rise to the "six-degrees-of-separation" expression. In this paper, we study the small-world navigability of the U.S. road network, with the goal of providing a model that explains how messages in the original small-world experiments could be routed along short paths using U.S. roads. To this end, we introduce the Neighborhood Preferential Attachment model, which combines elements from Kleinberg's model and the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model, such that long-range links are chosen according to both the degrees and (road-network) distances of vertices in the network. We empirically evaluate all three models by running a decentralized routing algorithm, where each vertex only has knowledge of its own neighbors, and find that our model outperforms both of these models in terms of the average hop length. Moreover, our experiments indicate that similar to the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model, networks generated by our model are scale-free, which could be a more realistic representation of acquaintanceship links in the original small-world experiment.},

  abstract = {We analyze the properties of Small-World networks, where links are much more likely to connect "neighbor nodes" than distant nodes. In particular, our analysis provides new results for Kleinberg's Small-World model and its extensions. Kleinberg adds a number of directed long-range random links to an nxn lattice network (vertices as nodes of a grid, undirected edges between any two adjacent nodes). Links have a non-uniform distribution that favors arcs to close nodes over more distant ones. He shows that the following phenomenon occurs: between any two nodes a path with expected length O(log2n) can be found using a simple greedy algorithm which has no global knowledge of long-range links.We show that Kleinberg's analysis is tight: his algorithm achieves θ(log2n) delivery time. Moreover, we show that the expected diameter of the graph is θlog n), a log n factor smaller. We also extend our results to the general k-dimensional model. Our diameter results extend traditional work on the diameter of random graphs which largely focuses on uniformly distributed arcs. Using a little additional knowledge of the graph, we show that we can find shorter paths: with expected length O(log3/2n) in the basic 2-dimensional model and O(log1+1/k) in the general k-dimensional model (fork≥1).Finally, we suggest a general approach to analyzing a broader class of random graphs with non-uniform edge probabilities. Thus we show expected θ(log n) diameter results for higher dimensional grids, as well as settings with less uniform base structures: where links can be missing, where the probability can vary at different nodes, or where grid-related factors (e.g. the use of lattice distance) has a weaker role or is dismissed, and constraints (such as the uniformness of degree distribution) are relaxed.},

More precisely, in a lattice network augmented by extra random edges (but not chosen uniformly), a short path of polylogarithmic expected length can be found using a greedy algorithm with a local knowledge of the nodes. We call such a graph a navigable small-world since short paths exist and can be followed with partial knowledge of the network. In this paper, we show that a wide class of graphs can be augmented into navigable small-worlds.}

abstract="We investigate the notion of Long Range Contact graphs. Roughly speaking, such a graph is defined by (1) an underlying network topology G, and (2) one (or possibly more) extra link connecting every node u to a ``long distance'' neighbor, called the long range contact of u. This extra link represents the a priori knowledge that a node has about far nodes and is set up randomly according to some probability distributions p. To illustrate the claim that Long Range Contact graphs are a good model for the small world phenomenon, we study greedy routing in these graphs. Greedy routing is the distributed routing protocol in which a node u makes use of its long range contact to progress toward a target, if this contact is closer to the target, than the other neighbors. We give upper and lower bounds on greedy routing on the n-node ring Cnaugmented with links chosen using the r-harmonic distributions. In particular, we show a tight $\Theta$(log2n)-bound for the expected number of steps required for routing in Cnaugmented using the 1-harmonic distribution. Hence, our study shows that the model of Kleinberg [11] can be simplified by using the ring rather than the mesh while preserving the main features of the model. Our study also demonstrates the signifi- cant difference (in term of both diameter and routing) between the ring augmented with long range contacts chosen with the harmonic distribution and the ring augmented with a random matching as introduced by Bollobas and Chung [3]. Finally, using epimorphisms of a graph onto another, for any network G, we show how to define a probability distribution p and study the performance of greedy routing in G augmented with p. For appropriate embeddings (if they exist), this performance turns out to be O(log2n).",

abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}}

Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.}

We point out that with disorder in the strength of contacts between individuals patchiness in the spread of the epidemic is very likely, and the criterion for epidemic outbreak depends strongly on the disorder because the critical region of the corresponding percolation model is broadened. In some networks the percolation threshold is zero if another kind of disorder is present, namely divergent fluctuations in the number of contacts. We give an example, a network with a well-defined geography, where this is not necessarily so, and discuss whether real infection networks are likely to have this property.}

The dynamics of epidemic spreading on signed networks has nonetheless received fairly little attention. Signed networks contain edges that are labeled as either positive or negative, in relation to their propensity to either accelerate or mitigate epidemic spreading. To that effect, we here propose a modified signed-susceptible-infectious-susceptible epidemiological model, which incorporates positive and negative transmission rates based on structural balance theory. We also consider dynamical transmission rates to determine the influence of structural balance on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. We use Erdős-Rényi random networks and Barabási-Albert scale-free networks, together with the Monte Carlo method, to determine the peak fraction of infected nodes and the epidemic thresholds. We also use the mean field analysis to show analytically the origin of the computationally obtained results, although of course the agreement is not perfect due to the impact of network structure.}

Based on this network model, the authors design a lightweight communication scheme for the remote-control system in this work, using two kinds of Virtual-Spaces to achieve the purpose of identity announced and data exchanged. The authors implemented a prototype system of the scheme and tested it over the Freenet, proving that the scheme can effectively resist the impact of flow analysis on the anonymity of communication while ensuring communication data security.

Specifically, we examine topologies where the underlying nodes are connected at the small scale in a regular pattern, such as a ring, torus or cube, such that every node can route efficiently to nodes in its immediate vicinity, and amended by the addition of random links to nodes throughout the datacenter, such that a greedy algorithm can route packets to far away locations efficiently. Coupled with geographical address assignment, the resulting network can provide content routing in addition to traditional routing, and thus efficiently implement key-value stores. The irregular but self-similar nature of the network facilitates constructing large networks easily using prewired, commodity racks. We show that Small-World Datacenters can achieve higher bandwidth and fault tolerance compared to both conventional hierarchical datacenters as well as the recently proposed CamCube topology. Coupled with hardware acceleration for packet switching, small-world datacenters can achieve an order of magnitude higher bandwidth than a conventional datacenter, depending on the network traffic.},

abstract = {The dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information. Gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm, exchanging information in each communication step. In a variety of contexts, the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches.In many settings, such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts, new information is generated at individual nodes, and is most "interesting" to nodes that are nearby. Thus, we propose distance-based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip mechanisms: a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d, and is independent of the size of the network.For nodes arranged with uniform density in Euclidean space, we present natural gossip mechanisms, called spatial gossip, that satisfy such a guarantee: new information is spread to nodes at distance d, with high probability, in O(log1 + ε d) time steps. Such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip, in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size, and deterministic flooding, in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size. Our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of Demers et al. [1987].We further show an application of our gossip mechanisms to a basic resource location problem, in which nodes seek to rapidly learn the location of the nearest copy of a resource in a network. This problem, which is of considerable practical importance, can be solved by a very simple protocol using Spatial Gossip, whereas we can show that no protocol built on top of uniform gossip can inform nodes of their approximately nearest resource within poly-logarithmic time. The analysis relies on an additional useful property of spatial gossip, namely that information travels from its source to sinks along short paths not visiting points of the network far from the two nodes.},
