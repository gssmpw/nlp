Prompt optimization has gained traction as an effective mechanism for enhancing LLMs in several downstream tasks ____.
Recent studies have introduced techniques such as chain-of-thought ____ and tree-of-thoughts ____, searching through a pool of prompt candidates generated by an LLM ____, applying iterative local edit operations at a syntactic phrase-level split within the prompts ____, employing reinforcement learning to rewrite prompts ____ or evolutionary operators over a prompt population for optimization ____.

In particular, ____ introduced the state-of-the-art OPRO technique, leveraging LLMs as optimizers through meta-prompts. %It was applied to optimize prompts by retrieving and re-ranking top-K relevant instructions with respect to an initial instruction, and by appending them to the global task description.
We extend our image editing method with prompts that are automatically generated on the basis of such met-prompting.
