Many blockchains such as Ethereum execute all incoming transactions sequentially significantly limiting the potential throughput.
A common approach to scale execution is parallel execution engines that fully utilize modern multi-core architectures.
Parallel execution is then either done optimistically, by executing transactions in parallel and detecting conflicts on the fly, or guided, by requiring exhaustive client transaction hints and scheduling transactions accordingly.

However, recent studies have shown that the performance of parallel execution engines depends on the nature of the underlying workload.
In fact, in some cases, only a 60\% speed-up compared to sequential execution could be obtained. This is the case, as transactions that access the same resources must be executed sequentially. For example, if 10\% of the transactions in a block access the same resource, the execution cannot meaningfully scale beyond 10 cores. Therefore, a single popular application can bottleneck the execution and limit the potential throughput.

In this paper, we introduce \sys, a block construction algorithm that optimizes parallel transaction execution throughput. We evaluate \sys exhaustively under a range of workloads, and show that \sys enables the underlying parallel execution engine to process over twice as many transactions.
