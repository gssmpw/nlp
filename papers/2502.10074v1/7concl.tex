\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we presented \sys, a framework, and algorithm to construct highly parallelizable blocks in the context of parallel smart contract execution.
We evaluated \sys extensively under a series of realistic workloads, demonstrating a throughput improvement of up to \sysmax.   Furthermore, in most workloads, this approach leads to lower latency for the majority of transactions, while only delaying those that access hot resources and cause bottlenecks. %todo mention discussion point again.
Moreover, \sys not only improves the throughput of the underlying execution engine but also protects blockchains from being bottlenecked by popular applications.
Finally, \sys is highly modular and can be easily integrated into any production blockchain without any security tradeoffs.
