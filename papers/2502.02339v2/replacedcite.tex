\textbf{Multimodal Reasoning}
$\,$ Recent advancements in MLLMs have demonstrated robust capabilities across diverse domains, including visual understanding ____, mathematics ____, and scientific inquiries ____. Despite these achievements, complex multimodal reasoning remains challenging due to its demands on both visual perception and high-level cognition. Inspired by OpenAI o1's impressive performance, recent approaches ____ attempt structured reasoning with pre-defined stages, enhancing MLLMs' CoT capabilities ____. However, their rigid structure limits flexibility across different tasks, overlooking the importance of adaptive reasoning in unleashing multimodal reasoning potential ____. Our approach addresses this by introducing a hierarchical tree structure that enables task-specific reasoning path generation and selection.

\textbf{Tree-based Search}
$\,$ Tree structures have demonstrated significant potential in language models ____. Recent efforts explore applying these tree search methods to search effective reasoning paths for MLLMs. While AR-MCTS ____ enhances multimodal reasoning by integrating MCTS with active retrieval, its extensive iteration requirements and computational overhead limit practical applications. Similarly, Mulberry ____ leverages tree structures to distill 260K long-chain reasoning data from powerful models like GPT-4o, but requires substantial computational resources and high-capacity teacher models. These methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between performance and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose incorporating high-level reasoning abstractions into MCTS, achieving competitive performance with higher efficiency.
