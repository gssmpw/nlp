\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced HG-MCTS, a new paradigm for intricate information seeking that unites an adaptive checklist and multi-perspective reward modeling within an MCTS framework. By generating a checklist for each complex query with an explicit set of sub-goals and reinforcing the collection process, our approach systematically addresses every relevant facet of multifaceted information needs by maintaining the knowledge memory. Furthermore, the proposed multi-perspective reward modeling provides both quantitative reward and qualitative feedback for updating the tree nodes and guiding future exploration. Experimental results on multiple real-world intricate information seeking tasks show that HG-MCTS not only acquires more thorough knowledge collections but also produces more precise final responses when compared to existing baselines. 
In future work, we plan to develop fine-tuning methods for reward modeling to capture user feedback or preferences in real time, which may refine the systemâ€™s adaptability, particularly in dynamic or user-driven retrieval settings.
