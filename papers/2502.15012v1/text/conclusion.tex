\section{Conclusions and Future Work} \label{sec: conclusions}
In this paper, we propose a novel secure GNN deployment strategy called \mymethod. 
Our approach involves strict isolation,  training a public backbone model using only public data, and training a rectifier on private data to rectify the results from the backbone. %
The two spited models and their corresponding graph data are deployed in the untrusted environment and secure enclave, respectively. 
This method effectively safeguards sensitive adjacency information during GNN inference on edge devices. 
Given the growing trend of GNN local deployment, ensuring data privacy in such settings is of paramount importance. 
As part of our future work, we plan to explore and implement our strategy with additional GNN architectures, including GraphSAGE and GAT, to further enhance the security and broaden applicability.
