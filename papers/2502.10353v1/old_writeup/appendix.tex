\section{Instantaneous Response}
We first consider the scenario where patients respond instantaneously. 
We analyze this scenario to understand the styles of algorithms when patient response patterns are simpler. 
Under such a scenario, patients arrive one-by-one, in either random or pre-determined order, and menus are selected for each patient as they arrive. 

We first propose an algorithm to solve this scenario when patient arrivals are known: 
\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Iterated Linear Programming} - Without loss of generality, assume that patients arrive in order $i,i+1,\ldots,N$. Then, for each arriving patient, $i$, we solve the following bipartite matching problem: 
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{i'=i}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{P} \theta_{i',j} X_{i',j}
    \end{equation}
    Then we offer the only the provider with $X_{i,j} = 1$ for patient $i$. 
\end{definition}

Such an algorithm recomputes Linear Programming-based solutions, and uses this to find assortments. 
We next demonstrate that such an algorithm optimally solves this problem:
\begin{lemma}
    Let $\pi$ be known a-priori, so that we aim to maximize: 

    \begin{equation}
        \max_{M_{1} \cdots M_{N}} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{P} \theta_{\pi_{i},j} Y_{\pi_{i},j}(\mathbf{Z}_{i})
    \end{equation}
    Under an instantaneous response scenario, where $M_{i}$ can be chosen as patients arrive, iterated Linear Programming optimally solves this problem. 
\end{lemma}

Such a scenario still applies to the scenario when $\pi$ is unknown, as we still have knowledge of the unmatched patients, even if their order is unknown. 

\begin{lemma}
    Let $Y_{i,j}$ be the uniform choice model, and let $\pi$ be a uniform random permutation of $N$ patients. 
    Under an instantaneous response scenario, where $M_{i}$ can be chosen as patients arrive, the Iterated Linear Programming algorithm can find $X_{i,j}$ that maximizes 
    \begin{equation}
        \max_{M_{1} \cdots M_{N}} \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{P} \theta_{\pi_{i},j} Y_{\pi_{i},j}(\mathbf{Z}_{i})]
    \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
