\section*{Non Technical Summary}
Good patient-provider matches are critical for good health, but the turnover of providers makes it difficult to maintain these matches. 
We investigate how to offer provider options to patients in the event that a provider leaves. 
This is a difficult task because a) patients have autonomy over their decisions, b) patients require time to perform research into their providers and do not respond instantaneously, and c) when one provider leaves, typically many patients need to be matched en-masse. 
We develop an algorithm based on ``assortment planning''; basically offering different options for patients when patients respond in a random order. 
Key to these options is the idea that we can offer options to patients dynamically. 
For example, if Bob selects Susan as their provider, and Susan has capacity for only one more patient, then Susan should not be offered to another patient, Sally.
If we can achieve such a system, then we can develop algorithms which match a large fraction of the patients, while also accounting for other constraints, such as balancing patient load across providers.
