Rising provider turnover forces healthcare administrators to frequently rematch patients to available providers, which can be cumbersome and labor-intensive.
To reduce the burden of rematching, we study algorithms for matching patients and providers through assortment optimization.
We develop a patient-provider matching model in which we simultaneously offer each patient a menu of providers, and patients subsequently respond and select providers. 
By offering assortments upfront, administrators can balance logistical ease and patient autonomy. 
We study policies for assortment optimization and characterize their performance under different problem settings. 
We demonstrate that the selection of assortment policy is highly dependent on problem specifics and, in particular, on a patient's willingness to match and the ratio between patients and providers .
On real-world data, we show that our best policy can improve match quality by 13\% over a greedy solution by tailoring assortment sizes based on patient characteristics.
We conclude with recommendations for running a real-world patient-provider matching system inspired by our results.
