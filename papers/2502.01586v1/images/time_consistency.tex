    \caption{\small{Comparing runtimes of GaLore and SubTrack-Grad. RoBERTa-Base is fine-tuned for 10 epochs on COLA and Llama-60M is pre-trained for 2500 iterations on C4 dataset. Subspace update intervals range from 50 to 500 in both experiments. Notice that by increasing subspace update interval, the update frequency actually decreases, as it indicates the number of iterations between two subspace update steps. As demonstrated, GaLore's wall-time can increase drastically when update frequency increases.}}
