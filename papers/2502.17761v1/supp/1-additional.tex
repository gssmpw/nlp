\paragraph{Data and code availability} 

$\ours$ code will be made available upon publication acceptance. We will release all microCT 3D tissue images and their corresponding Visium ST measurements for research and education use. 


\section*{Author Contributions}
C.A.P, A.H.S, and F.M conceived the study and designed the experiments. A.H.S, D.F.K.W, and B.C imaged the microCT dataset. A.K provided annotations for all volumes. C.A.P, A.H.S, A.K, and D.F.K.W identified patient blocks for Visium sequencing. A.H.S worked with the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core for ST sequencing on samples. L.W developed 3D morphological segmentation framework and the interactive demo. C.A.P and A.H.S created and ran all the experiments. G.J, K.H, M.Y.L, and K.S helped analyze experiment results. C.A.P, A.H.S, and F.M prepared the manuscript. All authors contributed to the writing. F.M supervised the research.
