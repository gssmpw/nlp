\section{Conclusion}
We introduced Deliberate Practice for Synthetic Data Generation, a framework that improves scaling laws by dynamically generating challenging and informative training examples. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, our approach approximates generating data directly from a pruned distribution, reducing inefficiencies and ensuring models continuously training on informative samples. We provided theoretical insights into the benefits of training on pruned distributions and empirically demonstrated that our method significantly improves performance while requiring fewer training iterations. Our results on ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K show that Deliberate Practice achieves superior accuracy with far less data and compute, outperforming previous state-of-the-art. Our work highlights the potential of structured synthetic data generation in advancing efficient and adaptive learning.
