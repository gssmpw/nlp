This AI Chatbot Evaluation task is part of a research study conducted by XXX at XXX University. You will chat with a chatbot for 10-15 minutes and participate in a survey study about your chatbot experience.\\
\\
Purpose\\
The purpose of the research is to evaluate large language model powered chatbots.\\
\\
Procedures \\
First, chat with a chatbot for 10-15 minutes. You are encouraged to engage with the chatbot for up to 15 minutes but can choose to stop engaging with the chatbot at any point of time. Second, immediately after this chatbot interaction, you will complete a survey including questions about the chatbot experience and demographics. This study is voluntary and you can choose to stop or not answer any questions.\\
\\
Participant Requirements \\
Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older located in the United States. They must have completed at least 1000 HITs and have an approval rate of 99\% or above. Participants must have had prior chatbot experience to participate in this study.\\
\\
Risks\\
The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities. To minimize the potential risk of a breach of confidentiality, please do not share any personally identifiable information during this study.\\
If you use your personal device for research purpose, there is a risk of incurring data charges. There might be data charges on your device if you are not connected to Wi-Fi.\\
\\
Benefits\\
There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study. However, we will gain knowledge about the potential pros and cons of different large language models; such knowledge will be valuable to the scientific community and to the public who use these large language models for various tasks.\\
\\
Compensation \& Costs\\
You will be compensated \$5 for your participation in this 30-min study.
There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.\\
\\
Future Use of Information\\
In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other researchers for their research studies.  We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you (or your legally authorized representative). Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified.\\
\\
Confidentiality\\
The data captured for the research does not include any personally identifiable information about you.  Your IP address will not be captured. The study will collect your research data through your use of Amazon MTurk and Qualtrics. These companies are not owned by XXX University. These companies will have access to the research data that you produce and any identifiable information that you share with them while using their product.

Payment Confidentiality: Payment methods, especially those facilitated by third-party vendors (such as Visa, Venmo, MTurk, Prolific, Amazon, PayPal), may require that the researchers and/or the vendor collect and use personal information (such as your first and last name, email addresses, phone numbers, banking information) provided by you in order for your payment to be processed. As with any payment transaction, there is the risk of a breach of confidentiality from the third-party vendor. All personal information collected by the researcher will be held as strictly confidential and stored in a password-protected digital file, or in a locked file cabinet, until payments are processed and reconciled. This information will be destroyed at the earliest acceptable time. Personal information held by the third-party vendor will be held according to their terms of use policy.\\
