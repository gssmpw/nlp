\section{Conclusion}

\method{} is a new methodology to gather user opinions  using LLM-powered interviews, enabling a deeper understanding of users through large scale in-the-moment user experience interviews.
Our study with thousands of users show that \method{} collects fine-grained user opinions on current LLMs, potential improvements, and frequently requested new functionalities. 

We view \method{} as a new user understanding tool widely applicable on many products beyond LLMs.
It creates a tight-knitted connection between consumers and AI developers, enabling more data-driven decisions based large scale, targeted, and authentic user opinions reflected in interviews.
