\section{Conclusion}
We present live monitoring and mid-run interventions for multi-agent systems. We demonstrate that monitors based on simple statistical measures can effectively predict future agent failures, and these failures can be prevented by restarting the communication channel. Experiments across multiple environments and models show consistent gains of up to 17.4\%-20\% in system performance, with an addition in inference-time compute.
Our work also introduces \ourenv{}, a new environment for studying multi-agent cooperation.
