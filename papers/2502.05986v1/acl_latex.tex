\begin{abstract}

Multi-agent systems, where specialized agents collaborate to solve a shared task hold great potential, from increased modularity to simulating complex environments. However, they also have a major caveat -- a single agent can cause the entire system to fail. Consider a simple game where the knowledge to solve the task is distributed between agents, which share information in a communication channel. At each round, any of the agents can terminate the game and make the final prediction, even if they are uncertain about the outcome of their action. Detection of such rogue agents \textit{before they act} may prevent the system's failure. 
In this work, we propose to \emph{monitor} agents during action prediction and \emph{intervene} when a future error is likely to occur. To test our approach, we introduce \ourenv{}, a multi-agent collaboration environment that allows modular control over task complexity and communication structure. Experiments on two variants of \ourenv{} and the \govsim{} environment for resource sustainability show that our approach leads to substantial performance gains up to 17.4\% and 20\%, respectively. Moreover, a thorough analysis shows that our monitors successfully identify critical points of agent confusion and our interventions effectively stop agent errors from propagating. We release \ourenv{} and our code for future studies on multi-agent collaboration at \url{https://github.com/Ohav/rogue-agents}.
