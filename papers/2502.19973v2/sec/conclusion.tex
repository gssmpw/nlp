\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We present two benchmarks to assess models’ combinatorial reasoning with multiple cues in complex scenarios. Experiments reveal current models struggle. We propose three baselines that mitigates these limitations, and guides future research. This study reveal key areas for improvement in multimodal reasoning, contextual comprehension, and fine-grained perception, which are crucial for enhancing the model’s robustness in complex scenarios.\\
\textit{Limitations:} Due to the dataset’s complexity, we rely on manual annotations to ensure methodological rigor. We anticipate that future research will improve scalability.
