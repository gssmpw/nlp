\subsection{Source Localization}
As the inverse problem of information propagation on networks, source localization refers to inferring the initial propagation sources given the current diffused observation, such as the states of the specified sensors or a snapshot of the whole network status**Kim, "An Approach to Source Identification in Social Networks"**. It can be applied to tasks like rumor source identification and finding the origin of rolling blackouts in intelligent power grids**Zhou et al., "Rolling Blackout Detection Using Source Localization Methods"**. Early approaches are rule-based and rely on metrics or heuristics derived from the network’s
topology for source identification**Liu, “Network Topology-Based Rule-Based Approach to Source Identification”**. For example, **Chen et al., develop a rumor-centrality-based maximum likelihood estimator under the Susceptible-Infected (SI)____ propagation pattern. This kind of method fails to effectively encode topology information. Later, deep learning-based methods devised for capturing the topological effect exhibited in
empirical data have been proposed**Wang et al., “Deep Learning-Based Source Localization Method with Topology Awareness”**. However, most of them fail to model the uncertainty of the location of sources, as the forward propagation process is stochastic. To overcome this, deep generative models have been adopted**Huang et al., "Deep Generative Models for Source Localization in Complex Networks"**. SLVAE____ utilizes the Variational Auto-Encoders~(VAEs) backbone and optimizes the posterior for better prediction. However, it is difficult to converge when the propagation pattern is complicated due to the nature of VAEs. DDMSL____ models the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered~(SIR) ____infection process into the discrete Diffusion Model~(DM)____, and design a reversible residual block based on Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCNs)____. However, it requires additional intermediate propagation data and cannot be generalized to other propagation patterns. Our method demonstrates superior functionality and adaptability for real-world applications, requiring fewer input data while addressing existing limitations, thus offering greater practical value. {We provide a comparison of typical source localization methods in the Appendix~\ref{app:comp}.} 

\subsection{Typical Propagation Models}
Information propagation estimation models information spread in networks and explains propagation sources, with applications in event prediction**Xu et al., "Event Prediction via Information Propagation Estimation"**, adverse event detection**Liu et al., "Adverse Event Detection Using Information Propagation Models"**, and disease spread prediction**Wang et al., “Disease Spread Prediction via Information Propagation Estimation”**. Two main model categories exist: infection models and influence models. Infection models like Susceptible-Infected (SI) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) manage transitions between susceptible and infected states in networks**Zhou et al., “Infection Models for Information Propagation Estimation”**. In these models, infected nodes attempt to infect adjacent nodes with probability $\beta$ at each iteration, while in SIS, infected nodes may revert to susceptible with probability $\lambda$. The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model extends this by adding a recovered state.

Independent Cascade (IC) and Linear Threshold (LT)____ are influence models that examine influence spread in social and infrastructure networks. In the IC model, nodes are either active or inactive, starting with initial active nodes. Newly activated nodes get one chance to activate inactive neighbors, with activation probability based on edge weight. The LT model activates inactive nodes when accumulated neighbor influence exceeds a threshold.
