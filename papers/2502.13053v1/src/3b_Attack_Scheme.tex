\subsection{Attack Scheme}
\label{sec:attack_framework}
We introduce AEIA-MN, an Active Environmental Injection Attack scheme that leverages mobile notifications to attack mobile agents on mobile devices. The objective of AEIA-MN is to induce a deviation in the agent's decision-making from its intended goal, thereby enabling the evaluation of the model's robustness against this attack. AEIA-MN encompasses three types of attacks: Adversarial Attack (Section \ref{sec:adversarial_attack}), Reasoning Gap Attack (Section \ref{sec:reasoning_gap_attack}), and Combinatorial Attack (Section \ref{sec:combinatorial_attack}).
We provide detailed information on the attack methods in AEIA-MN in Figure \ref{fig:The overview of attack framework}. Additionally, a comprehensive case study is presented in Appendix \ref{appendix:case study}, and the design of the mobile notifications is discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix:Message Notification Design}.
