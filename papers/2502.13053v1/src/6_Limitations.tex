\section*{Limitations}
We acknowledge the limitations of this work.
(i) The attacks in our research target single-agent systems. In the future, we plan to improve the Active Environment Injection Attack and extend it to the study of covert attack patterns in multi-agent collaborative scenarios. (ii) Our research focuses on attack mechanisms related to mobile agents. We will also explore the design of defenses against such attacks as a topic for future research.
