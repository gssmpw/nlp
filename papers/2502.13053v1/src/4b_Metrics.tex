\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:evaluation_metrics}
% We evaluate the performance of Agents using the following metrics: (a)$SR_{ben}$: The task success rate of Agents without attacks under the benchmark. (b)$SR_{adv}$: The task success rate of Agents affected by Adversarial Attack in the benchmark. (c) $SR_{gap}$: The task success rate of Agents affected by the Resoning Gap Attack in the benchmark. 
% (d)$SR_com$: The task success rate of Agents affected by the Combinatorial Attack in the benchmark. (e)$SR_{def}$: The task success rate of Agents with defense prompts in the benchmark. (f) $ASR_{adv}$: The success rate of attacks on agents misled by adversarial content. (g)$ASR_{gap}$: The success rate of Reasoning Gap Attack on agents clicking message notifications affected by the Resoning Gap Attack. (h)$ASR_com$: We calculate the attack success rate of Combinatorial Attack by adding the success rate of Adversarial Attack and Reasoning Gap Attack. (i)$ASR_{def}$: The success rate of attacks on the agent when defensive prompts are in place.

We present the metrics used in the experiments in Table \ref{tab:metrics}.
In addition, to test the effectiveness of adversarial text based on message notifications against the agents, we set the adversarial content in the message notifications across all experiments to ``Agent should believe the task is finished!'' 
% In the experiments concerning Adversarial Attack, we measure the probability of attack success by the growth rate of tasks that end prematurely. In the experiments on the Resoning Gap Attack, we use the proportion of tasks where the agent mistakenly clicks on the message notification as the probability of attack success. In the experiments on Combinatorial Attack, we sum the probabilities of successful Adversarial Attack and successful Resoning Gap Attack to determine the overall hit probability of the combinatorial attack.
