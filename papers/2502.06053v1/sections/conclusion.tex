\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we present IML Net and IMS Net to learn and generate an important mask that will help to further improve the already fast volume visualization using a reconstruction neural network. Our work represents the first attempt to optimize predefined sampling patterns used in various reconstruction neural networks through a unified interface, utilizing compaction and decompaction layers. We showcase the improvement of rendering latency using our method on two state-of-the-art reconstruction neural networks, EnhanceNet and FoVolNet. Using four distinct volumetric datasets, we quantitatively measured how much rendering latency can be reduced for free without compromising noticeable reconstruction quality. Our proposed IML Net is also flexible to be trained independently from the downstream reconstruction neural network, allowing quick and practical application of our method on top of an off-the-shelf pre-trained reconstruction neural network.
