\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents Fast-COS, an innovative single-stage object detection framework optimized for real-time driving scene applications. By incorporating the novel Reparameterized Attention Vision Transformer (RAViT) as a hybrid transformer backbone along with the Reparameterized Feature Pyramid Network (RepFPN) for extracting features across multiple scales, Fast-COS achieves outstanding accuracy and computational efficiency. 

Key findings of this research indicate that the proposed framework markedly enhances the balance between accuracy and inference speed. With a Top-1 accuracy of 81.4\% on ImageNet-1K, RAViT outperforms other hybrid transformers such as FastViT, RepViT, and EfficientFormer in terms of GPUs, edge, and mobile inference speed. The combination of RAViT and RepFPN in constructing Fast-COS yields state-of-the-art performance on challenging driving scene datasets like BDD100K and TJU-DHD Traffic, outperforming conventional models such as FCOS and RetinaNet. The integration of RepMSDW and RepSA enhances both local and global spatial understanding while ensuring lightweight operations suitable for resource-limited hardware. 

Furthermore, extensive testing on GPUs and edge devices reveals the scalability and real-time efficiency of Fast-COS. The framework achieves up to a 75.9\% faster GPU inference speed and 1.38Ã— increased throughput compared to leading models, making it an optimal choice for autonomous driving systems across various conditions and environments. Future research will focus on further architectural optimization for edge device hardware platforms, such as employing quantization for deployment.
