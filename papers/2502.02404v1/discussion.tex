%This review covers literature from a wide range of topics relating to the development of FPGA technology, involving authors affiliated to institutes or companies based in the Netherlands. %This survey aims to illuminate 
%As such, the survey indicates the present focus areas of Dutch FPGA research, and suggests the directions in which this research field is heading in the Netherlands. It further underlines the importance of FPGA research to a wide variety of domains. 


The literature was collected by requiring at least one author to be affiliated with a Dutch organization. However, this criterion does not provide insights into the degree of involvement of the Dutch-affiliated author in the research. It is possible that a co-author with a Dutch affiliation made only a minor contribution to the overall work presented in the paper. Given the limitations of the available data, determining the specific contributions of individual authors is not feasible; hence, this survey does not include an analysis of the contributions of individual authors for each paper.

This survey categorized FPGA literature by subject and provided insights into the content of FPGA research by Dutch organizations. Moreover, literature categories were grouped per Dutch organization, identifying the primary FPGA-related research direction of each Dutch organization. The survey does not identify which research groups in each organization are focusing on a specific domain of FPGA research. As future work, mapping out these research groups, and identifying the lines of research connecting them, can give further insights into the directions of FPGA research in the Netherlands. Moreover, this can aid in identifying which FPGA-related lines of research are primarily established in the Netherlands.
