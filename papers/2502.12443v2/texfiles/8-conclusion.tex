\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we set out to empirically explore how AI agents support art therapy homework and facilitate therapist-client collaboration. In doing so, We developed and implemented \name{}, a human-AI system that includes a client-facing application for co-creative art-making and conversational agents to assist with therapy homework, as well as a therapist-facing application that allows for customization of homework agents and access to AI-compiled homework history. A one-month field study involving 24 clients and 5 therapists demonstrated how \name{} facilitated clients' homework and reflection through drawing while speaking in their natural environment.
Also, our results explored how therapists infused their practical experiences and personal touch into the agents to customize the homework, and how AI-compiled homework history became practical resources for in-session interactions.
Based on the rich data, we generalize relevant design implications to inform future work in better supporting asynchronous client-practitioner collaboration through human-AI interactions.
