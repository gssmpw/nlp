\section{Field study}
Using \name{} as both a novel system to study and a research tool to study with, we aim to explore how a human-AI system support clients' art therapy homework in their daily settings (\textbf{RQ1}) and how such a system could mediate therapist-client collaboration surrounding art therapy homework (\textbf{RQ2}). To this end, we conducted a field deployment involving 24 recruited clients and five therapists over the course of one month.

\subsection{Participants and Study Procedure}
\subsubsection{Participants}

The five therapists who participated in the field evaluation were the same ones from our contextual study (see \autoref{tab:expert}). Each therapist was compensated at their regular hourly rate.
For client recruitment, we distributed digital flyers through social media platforms, describing the art therapy activities as an "online art therapy experience promoting self-exploration using a digital software." This aligns with the common goal of art therapy sessions, which are widely used to promote self-exploration for all clients, beyond treating mental illness~\cite{kahn1999art, riley2003family}.

Participants first completed a pre-questionnaire, which provided an overview of the activities and collected demographics, and prior experiences with art therapy experience and with digital drawing---to ensure that we include both novices and experienced user---and their personal goals for participation. 
The therapists guided the recruitment and screening of the the clients, and included individuals seeking for reducing stress, fostering personal growth, enhancing emotional regulation, and strengthening social skills. The therapists excluded individuals with serious mental health conditions to minimize ethical risks.
%Based on the therapists' advice, clients with goals such as reducing stress and anxiety, fostering personal growth, enhancing emotional regulation, and strengthening social skills were included, avoiding ethical concerns related to clinically diagnosed mental health conditions. 
%We also considered participants' regions, device types, drawing familiarity, and prior art therapy experience to create a balanced selection.

In total, 27 clients began using \name{}, but 3 withdrew early due to scheduling conflicts. The final group of 24 clients (C1-C24; 8 self-identified males, 15 self-identified females, 1 identifying as other; aged 19-55) completed the study (client demographics are detailed in the~\autoref{tab:clients}). Clients who completed the full process were compensated with \$37, others were compensated with a prorated fee.
Our study protocol was approved by the institutional research ethics board, and all participant names in this paper have been changed to pseudonyms. Participants reviewed and signed informed consent forms before taking part, acknowledging their understanding of the study.

% The five therapists participated in the field evaluation were the ones who also participated in our contextual study (see \autoref{tab:expert}).
% Five art therapists were compensated with their regular hourly rate.
% For the clients recruitment, we distributed digital recruitment flyers through social media platforms. 
% The recruitment flyer described the art therapy activities as ``online art therapy experience promoting self-exploration using a digital software''.
% This is due to that this is a common goal for art therapy sessions, since Art therapy activities are not only effective in treating mental illness but also widely promote self-exploration for every clients, as commonly integrated into practice~\cite{kahn1999art,riley2003family}.
% First, participants completed a pre-questionnaire that provided an overview of the art therapy activities and gathered details such as their demographics, the number of art therapy sessions they've attended, familiarity with digital drawing, and any specific needs they hoped to address.
% Following that, based on the advices from the therapists, clients were included with the goal of reducing stress and anxiety, fostering personal growth, enhancing emotional regulation, and strengthening social skills.
% The therapists suggest so since they agree that these therapeutic goals would be beneficial for eavery day therapy clients and would could It might avoid the potential ethical and safety risks associated with clinically diagnosed mental health issue.

\subsubsection{Procedures}

Clients were distributed in coordination with the five therapists, as shown in \autoref{tab:expert}. T2 was assigned four clients, while the other therapists each had five clients. The field study consisted of two main activities: (1) three online in-session activities, where clients had one-on-one conversations and collaborated with the therapist, and (2) unstructured between-session activities, where clients practiced therapy homework using \name{} following the therapist’s recommendations.
Before the study, we held online introductory sessions to familiarize the clients with \name{}, and provided both demonstrations and hands-on exploration on their preferred devices. Similarly, we offered online training for therapists on customizing and reviewing homework, while allowing them to explore both the therapist-facing and client-facing applications. After the session, clients were encouraged to regularly explore \name{}.
Two weeks into the study, we scheduled weekly one-on-one online sessions between therapists and clients, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. Therapists were encouraged to review the clients' homework history using \autoref{fig:ui}(c) before each session. During the online session, therapists used this data to inform their practices without interrupting the flow of therapy. We encouraged clients in advance, to create artworks during the Art-making Phase~(\autoref{fig:qual_results}(a)), sharing screens and discussing their creations with the therapist, but did not interfere with the therapeutic process.

%Clients also used \autoref{fig:qual_results}(a) to create artwork, sharing their screens and discussing their creations with the therapist.

At the end of each session, therapists recommended homework tasks based on insights gained during the conversation. After the session, therapists might customize homework agents, including customizing conversational principles, assigning homework tasks, and providing personal messages through \autoref{fig:ui}~(d). Clients could then either complete the assigned homework or engage in self-exploration using \name{} between sessions.

% Clients were distributed In coordination with the five therapists, as shown by \autoref{tab:clients}: T2 was assigned with four clients, while each of the other therapists was assigned with five clients.
% The procedure for the field study consisted of two activities: (1) three online in-session activities where they have one-on-one conversation and collaboration with the therapist and (2) unstructured between-session activities where they perform therapy homework practices either upon recommendations of usage from the therapist or volunteerily use it in their daily lives.
% Before the study, we conducted an introductory session for each client to explain the activities, demonstrate how to use \name{}, and provide access to \name{} via a URL on their preferred devices.
% After the introductory session, the clients were encouraged to explore the use of \name{} on a regular basis.

% After two weeks of self-exploration, we started scheduling weekly one one-on-one online sessions between the therapists and the clients.
% Therapists were encouraged to review clients' homework history using \autoref{fig:ui}~(c) before the online session.
% During the online one-on-one session, we encouraged therapists to use these history data without interfering with their art therapy practices. 
% Also, they would utilize \autoref{fig:ui}~(a) to create their artwork by sharing their screens and discussing their artworks with therapists. 
% Before the end of the session, the therapist would recommend the homework tasks for the client based on the insights gained from the one-on-one session.
% After the online session ends, therapists would customize homework agents, including modifying or updating the conversational agent principles, assigning homework tasks and providing therapist's messages to the client through \autoref{fig:system}~(d). 
% Correspondingly, clients could either complete the homework or engage in self-exploration using \name{} between sessions.

% 对于异步session场景数据收集下，所有来访者使用系统的图像以及对话记录等日志数据以及治疗师在治疗师系统中使用定制功能的日志数据在保存在数据库中。
% 此外，我们鼓励来访者和治疗师通过即时通讯软件发送给我们images以及comments关于使用系统的实践以及感受。
% 对于线上session的场景数据收集，首先，online sessions were audio- and video-recorded.
% 此外，at the end of each online session, we conducted a 5-minute interview with therapists, mainly to collect their practices and experiences about the session.
% Upon concluding all the sessions,我们与治疗师以及来访者开展了约为30分钟的semi-structured interview to 探索ai agents如何支持艺术治疗场景的家庭作业（RQ1）以及AI agents如何mediate 治疗师与来访者合作（RQ2）. We used 治疗师与来访者在 the trial period使用系统的log 数据以及他们的反馈作为stimuli 去问特定的使用实践的问题。
% With participants' consent, we recorded the interviews and transcribed them for thematic analysis.
% First, two researchers conducted collaborative inductive coding. They initially annotated the transcript to identify relevant quotes, key concepts, and recurring patterns in the data. These findings were further developed through regular discussions, leading to a detailed coding scheme aligned with the research questions. Quotes were then coded and clustered into a hierarchy of emerging themes, continually reviewed, and refined in recurrent meetings, where exemplar quotes were also selected for presenting each theme and sub-theme. 
% Also, we collected the log data from 治疗师和来访者 作为证据以及examples for the thematic analysis results.

\subsection{Data Gathering Methods} 

For between-sessions, we stored all homework-related data in a database, including artwork, dialogue, usage logs, as well as information on homework customization such as conversational principles, tasks, and personal messages.
We encouraged participants to use personal messaging (WeChat) to share pictures and comments about on-the-spot experience and feelings after homework with \name{} to compensate for semi-structured interviews.
During online sessions, we recorded audio and video. 
The researchers did not observe the therapy session in live, but reviewed post hoc, as the therapists believed a third party's presence could affect a client's emotional expression and the therapist-client dynamic.
After each session, we conducted a brief 5-minute interview with the therapists to gather their insights and feelings.

Upon the completion of the final one-on-one sessions, we conducted 30-minute semi-structured interviews with both therapists and clients. These interviews aimed to explore how \name{} supported art therapy homework in clients' daily lives (\textbf{RQ1}) and how therapists and clients collaborated surrounding art therapy homework (\textbf{RQ2}). We used feedback and homework outcomes from the trial period to ask targeted questions about their practices.
With participants' consent, we recorded and transcribed the brief 5-minute interviews and the 30-minute interviews for thematic analysis~\cite{braun2006using}. This analysis also included the personal messages shared by the participants about their on-the-spot experiences.
%we recorded and transcribed the interviews for thematic analysis. 
Two researchers then engaged in inductive coding, annotating transcripts to identify relevant quotes, key concepts, and patterns. They developed a detailed coding scheme through regular discussions, grouping quotes into a hierarchical structure of themes and sub-themes. Exemplar quotes were selected to represent each theme. We also used homework history (e.g., images or conversation data) and customization data (e.g., homework dialogue principle data) as evidences or examples to back up the findings in our thematic analysis.



% In between sessions, all homework history data~(e.g., artwork, creative process data and dialogue data) and history data on homework customization~(e.g., principles of conversational agents, homework tasks and personal messages) were stored in the database.
% In addition, we encouraged clients and therapists to send us images and comments about their experiences and feelings when using \name{} via an instant messaging app.
% For online in-sessions, the sessions were first audio- and video-recorded.
% At the end of each in-session, we conducted a brief 5-minute interview with the therapists to gather insights into their practices and feelings during the session.
% Upon concluding all the sessions, we conducted approximately 30-minute semi-structured interviews with both the therapists and the clients to explore how \name{} support art therapy homework in clients' daily settings~(\textbf{RQ1}), and how therapists tailored the homework and tracked the homework history surrounding art therapy homework~(\textbf{RQ2}). 
% Further, we employed the homework outcomes and feedback from both therapists and clients during the trial period as stimuli to ask specific questions about their practices. 

% With participants' consent, we recorded the interviews and transcribed them for thematic analysis~\cite{braun2006using}.
% Initially, two researchers engaged in collaborative inductive coding. They began by annotating the transcript to highlight relevant quotes, key concepts, and recurring patterns in the data. Through regular discussions, they expanded these insights into a detailed coding scheme that aligned with their research questions. The quotes were then systematically coded and grouped into a hierarchical structure of emerging themes, which were continuously reviewed and refined during recurring meetings. During these discussions, exemplar quotes were also chosen to represent each theme and sub-theme.
% We also gathered homework history and customization data, including artworks and conversation records from both therapists and clients, as evidence and examples to support the results of the thematic analysis.
