\begin{abstract}

Art therapy homework is essential for fostering clients' reflection on daily experiences between sessions. However, current practices present challenges: clients often lack guidance for completing tasks that combine art-making and verbal expression, while therapists find it difficult to track and tailor homework. How HCI systems might support art therapy homework remains underexplored. To address this, we present TherAIssist, comprising a client-facing application leveraging human-AI co-creative art-making and conversational agents to facilitate homework, and a therapist-facing application enabling customization of homework agents and AI-compiled homework history. A 30-day field study with 24 clients and 5 therapists showed how TherAIssist supported clients’ homework and reflection in their everyday settings. Results also revealed how therapists infused their practice principles and personal touch into the agents to offer tailored homework, and how AI-compiled homework history became a meaningful resource for in-session interactions. Implications for designing human-AI systems to facilitate asynchronous client-practitioner collaboration are discussed.

%Art therapy homework is between-session activities that facilitate  reflecting on clients' daily feelings and enhance therapeutic collaboration through art-making and verbal expression in their natural environment.
%However, it is challenging to support clients in self-expression through verbalization and art due to a high threshold and limited guidance from therapists, as well as to support therapists in customizing and tracking homework exercises.
%In HCI, few studies have explored how technology can support addressing these challenges of art therapy homework.
%Thus, we present \name{}, a system consisting of a client application that integrates human-AI co-creative art-making and conversational agents for art therapy homework, and a therapist application that allows for the customization of conversational agents to guide homework and review AI-compiled homework data.
%Over a one-month field deployment, 24 clients engaged with \name{} in their own contexts, under the guidance of 5 therapists. Our findings showed that introducing conversational agents while art-making can guide clients in exploring personal feelings and new meanings behind the artwork. Also, \name{} enables therapists to integrate their professional beliefs and practical experiences into the AI agent, allowing it to reflect their unique personal imprint. Homework images and conversation records also helped therapists offer triggers for deeper discussions and intervention resources during in-session activities.
%Building on these findings, we explore the practical implications of incorporating AI agents into therapy homework on future design.

%can help clients express emotions and find new meanings behind their artwork, even without therapists. Additionally, 

%Therapy homework has been widely used in art therapy practices to enhance clients' therapeutic skills in real world and offer continuity between sessions.
% 
%Yet, few studies explored how AI agents could support clients’ art therapy homework and mediate therapist-client collaboration outside the synchronous art therapy sessions.
%
%To address this, we introduce \name{}, a multi-agent system that combines image-based generative AI with conversational AI agents, empowering clients to engage in art therapy homework in natural environments. It can also support therapists customizing and reviewing therapy homework.
%Through one month field deployments involving 24 clients with five art therapists, our results demonstrated that \name{} helped clients externalize their emotions and create new meanings through conversation and art-making across various contexts, such as home or offices.
%AI multi-agents can act as a mediator, enabling therapists to customize them as an extension of their practice to deliver structured guidance aligned with their professional beliefs, while also supporting the use of homework as intervention resources during art therapy sessions.

  \Description{ Figure 1 illustrates the interaction flow of our system. On the left, the person represents our clients, while on the right, the person represents our therapists. The client on the left is using a tablet to complete their homework through our system, drawing while interacting with a conversational agent. The art-making history and conversation data are simultaneously transmitted to the therapist-facing application. The therapist can track this homework history and customize homework agents for the client. These homework assignments are then sent through the system to the client-facing application. The overall theme of the image is emphasized through the use of yellow and black, highlighting this asynchronous collaboration.
