    \caption{\textbf{Left:} Computational cost of Erwin. We split the total runtime into building a ball tree and running a model. The input is a batch of $16$ point clouds, each of size $n$. We fit a power law which indicates close to linear scaling.
    \textbf{Right:} Receptive field of MPNN vs Erwin, $n = 800$. A node is in the receptive field if changing its features affects the target node's output. MPNN consists of 6 layers, each node connected to $16$ nearest neighbours.}
