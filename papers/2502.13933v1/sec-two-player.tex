\section{Two-player games}\label{sec:two-player}
\input{Figures/fig-two-player-shuffle}
For a two-player game structure $\Tt$ and the corresponding sequence set $S$, we can look at the projection of sequences on individual player actions, $S_{\Max}$ and $S_{\Min}$, consider their $\alr$-spans and knit them together. %One can show that the projections themselves correspond to one-player game structures $\Tt_{\Max}$ and $\Tt_{\Min}$.
Consider the 2-player game in \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle}. Projections of the sequence set in this game w.r.t individual players would correspond to game structures in \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle-b} (for $\Max$) and \cref{fig:shuffle-a}  (for $\Min$). The structure \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle-b}  already has $\pfr$. As seen before, \cref{fig:shuffle-b} is an $\salr$ witness for \cref{fig:shuffle-a}. We can plug in this $\salr$ witness to all leaf nodes of \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle-b} and get the structure \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle-c}. Information sets are maintained across all copies of \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle-c} as shown in the illustration. More generally, if $\Tt'_{\Max}$ is an $\alr$-span of $\Tt_{\Max}$, and $\Tt'_{\Min}$ is an $\alr$-span of $\Tt_{\Min}$, we can obtain an $(\alr, \alr)$ structure where all nodes of $\Max$ precede all nodes of $\Min$, and a copy of $\Tt'_{\Min}$ is attached to each leaf node of $\Max$, and information sets of $\Min$ are maintained across all copies of $\Tt'_{\Min}$, as shown in \cref{fig:2-p-shuffle}.  
We can assign suitable payoffs in a similar manner to \cref{prop:span-to-game} to get an equivalent game on this new game structure. 


\begin{restatable}{theorem}{twopPfrNam}\label{thm:2p-pfr-name}
Solving an $(\nam, \nam)$ game on structure $\Tt$ can be reduced to solving an $(\alr,\alr)$ game on a structure of size $|\Tt'_{\Max}||\Tt'_{\Min}|$ where $\Tt'_{\Max}$ and $\Tt'_{\Min}$ are minimal $\alr$-spans of $\Tt_{\Min}$.
\end{restatable}
Since $(\pfr, \alr)$-games can be solved in polynomial-time, \cref{thm:2p-pfr-name} and Corollary~\ref{cor:effic-solv-class} lead to new polynomial-time solvable classes.
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:2-effic-solv-class}
The maxmin value in a $(\pfr, \nam)$ game where SD of $\Tt_{\Min}$ is constant can be computed in polynomial time. As a conseqeunce, $(\pfr, \salr)$ games can be solved in polynomial time.
\end{corollary}
