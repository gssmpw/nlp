\section{(In)Expressiveness of $\pfr$-spans}
We show in \cref{thm:existence-alr-span} that any $\nam$-game structure has an $\alr$-span. % and the same holds for two-player case.
We can naturally extend the definitions of $\salr$ and $\alr$-span to define shuffled-$\pfr$ and $\pfr$-spans. 
Then, a natural question to ask would be, if some class of imperfect recall game structures can be restructured into perfect recall game structures. %We answer the question in negative and show that this is not possible.
We provide a definitive answer to this question by showing that this is not possible.
To show this, we first show that any $\nam$ game structure having a $\pfr$-span must have shuffled $\pfr$. Following which, one can observe that a $\nam$ game structure with imperfect recall cannot have shuffled-$\pfr$. \red{If any space is left, could provide one proof to why this is easy with example}
\begin{proposition}
Let $\Tt$ be a game structure with imperfect recall. Then $\Tt$ cannot have a $\pfr$-span. 
\end{proposition}
\endinput
Similar to $\alr$-game trees we observe the recursive structure rulebooks from one-player $\pfr$ game trees. 
\begin{proposition}[Structure of $\pfr$-game trees]
Let $\Tt$ be a game tree with rulebook $S$.  Then $\Tt$ is $\pfr$-game tree if and only if exactly one of the following is tree
\begin{itemize}
	\item $S$ is disconnected and $S=\biguplus\limits_{i}S_i$ is a decomposition of $S$ into connected components where each $S_i$ is a  $\pfr$-set.
	\item $S$ is connected and for some $I \in \Ii$, $S=\biguplus\limits_{a_i \in Act(I)}a_iS_i$ such that each $S_i$ is a $\pfr$-set and $\forall i,j$ $S_i$ and $S_j$ are mutually disconnected. 
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $\Tt$ be game tree with rulebook $S$ such that $\Tt$ has some $\pfr$-span. Then there is a $\pfr$-game tree $\Tt'$ such that $\Tt'$ is a $\pfr$-shuffle of $\Tt$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $\Tt$ be game tree with rulebook $S$ such that $\Tt$ doesn't have $\pfr$. Then $\Tt$ cannot have a $\pfr$-shuffle. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
A $(\nam,\nam)$-game tree $\Tt$ which is not $(\pfr,\nam)$ cannot have a $(\pfr,\nam)$-span. 
\end{corollary}
