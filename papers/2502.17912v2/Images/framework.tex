    \textbf{A} \& \textbf{B} The detailed graph contrastive learning and EBM training process. 
    The readout of original node representations in \textbf{A} participates in the Conditional Energy (CE) in \textbf{B}, 
    and the original node energies in \textbf{B} are delivered to \textbf{A} for Energy Readout (ERo). 
    We propose a Recurrent Update mechanism to jointly train the CE and ERo effectively. 
    \textbf{C} The comparison between traditional MCMC sampling and our proposed MCMC sampling.
