TITLE={Benchmarking of Data-Driven Causality Discovery Approaches in the Interactions of Arctic Sea Ice and Atmosphere},

JOURNAL={Frontiers in Big Data},

ABSTRACT={<p>The Arctic sea ice has retreated rapidly in the past few decades, which is believed to be driven by various dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere. The newly open water resulted from sea ice decline in turn exerts large influence on the atmosphere. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the causality between multiple atmospheric processes and sea ice variations using three distinct data-driven causality approaches that have been proposed recently: Temporal Causality Discovery Framework Non-combinatorial Optimization <italic>via</italic> Trace Exponential and Augmented lagrangian for Structure learning (NOTEARS) and Directed Acyclic Graph-Graph Neural Networks (DAG-GNN). We apply these three algorithms to 39 years of historical time-series data sets, which include 11 atmospheric variables from ERA-5 reanalysis product and passive microwave satellite retrieved sea ice extent. By comparing the causality graph results of these approaches with what we summarized from the literature, it shows that the static graphs produced by NOTEARS and DAG-GNN are relatively reasonable. The results from NOTEARS indicate that relative humidity and precipitation dominate sea ice changes among all variables, while the results from DAG-GNN suggest that the horizontal and meridional wind are more important for driving sea ice variations. However, both approaches produce some unrealistic cause-effect relationships. Additionally, these three methods cannot well detect the delayed impact of one variable on another in the Arctic. It also turns out that the results are rather sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters of the three methods. As a pioneer study, this work paves the way to disentangle the complex causal relationships in the Earth system, by taking the advantage of cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technologies.</p>}}

    abstract = "{Understanding causal effects is a fundamental goal of science and underpins our ability to make accurate predictions in unseen settings and conditions. While direct experimentation is the gold standard for measuring and validating causal effects, the field of causal graph theory offers a tantalizing alternative: extracting causal insights from observational data. Theoretical analysis has shown that this is indeed possible, given a large dataset and if certain conditions are met. However, biological datasets, frequently, do not meet such requirements but evaluation of causal discovery algorithms is typically performed on synthetic datasets, which they meet all requirements. Thus, real-life datasets are needed, in which the causal truth is reasonably known. In this work we first construct such a large-scale real-life dataset and then we perform on it a comprehensive benchmarking of various causal discovery methods.We find that the PC algorithm is particularly accurate at estimating causal structure, including the causal direction which is critical for biological applicability. However, PC does only produces cause-effect directionality, but not estimates of causal effects. We propose PC-NOTEARS (PCnt), a hybrid solution, which includes the PC output as an additional constraint inside the NOTEARS optimization. This approach combines PC algorithm’s strengths in graph structure prediction with the NOTEARS continuous optimization to estimate causal effects accurately. PCnt achieved best aggregate performance across all structural and effect size metrics.https://github.com/zhu-yh1/PC-NOTEARS.}",

abstract = {A concise and self-contained introduction to causal inference, increasingly important in data science and machine learning. The mathematization of causality is a relatively recent development, and has become increasingly important in data science and machine learning. This book offers a self-contained and concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data. After explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models: how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report on their decade of intensive research into this problem. The book is accessible to readers with a background in machine learning or statistics, and can be used in graduate courses or as a reference for researchers. The text includes code snippets that can be copied and pasted, exercises, and an appendix with a summary of the most important technical concepts.}
