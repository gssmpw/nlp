\section{Conclusion}

In this article we proved that all univariate polynomials over unrolls are injective and we characterized the injectivity of univariate polynomials over FDDS. 
Furthermore, thanks to the proof of Lemma \ref{lemme:structurePolyFDDS}, we can use a technique similar to \cite{kroot} to compute a solution (if it exists) to injective polynomial equations over unrolls and FDDS. 
This result suggests interesting directions for future work,
namely, characterizing the injectivity of multivariate polynomials, and finding efficient algorithms for other classes of equations involving non-injective polynomials (or the reason why they do not exist, if this is the case).

Furthermore, in the literature, there exists a procedure for solving and enumerating the solutions of an equation of the form $P(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = B$ where polynomial $P$ is a sum of univariate monomials \cite{dennunzio2023dds_journal}.
Thus, we can hopefully find an efficient algorithm for the special case where $P$ is a sum of injective univariate monomials. Since polynomial equations with an unbounded number of variables are $\NP$-hard~\cite{NPhard}, one could try to improve these results for equations with a bounded number of variables, as well as finding exactly how many variables are necessary for the problem to become $\NP$-hard.
