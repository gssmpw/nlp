% Transaction processing is the crux for modern data-center applications, yet current multi-node systems are slow due to network overheads. 
% This paper advocates for Compute Express Link (CXL) as an alternative, which enables low-latency and cache coherent shared memory accesses. However, directly adopting standard CXL primitives leads to performance degradation due to the high cost of maintaining cross-node cache coherence. 
% To address the CXL challenges, this paper introduces \name, a software-hardware co-designed system that implements a novel hybrid coherence primitive tailored to the loosely coherent nature of transactional data. The core innovation of \name~is empowering transaction system developers with the ability to selectively achieve data coherence. Our evaluations on OLTP workloads demonstrate that \name~significantly enhances performance, outstripping current network-based systems and achieving up to 2.08x greater throughput than vanilla CXL memory sharing architectures across universal transaction processing policies.

% To achieve efficient in-memory transactions over CXL fabric, we carefully extend the underlying hardware architecture to enable consistent data access from multiple hosts, which share a memory pool interconnected with CXL. To this end, each transaction can access data in sub-microsecond latency and acquire and release locks as if running on a single host. In addition, we further propose a hybrid consistency scheme to reduce the overhead. Evaluations on typical OLTP workloads show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed transaction systems (DrTM and FaRM) with up to 18.9x throughput. Moreover, it demonstrates sufficient scalability on up to 16 sockets. As an alternative, we observe transaction's loose requirements on data coherence. We consequently
