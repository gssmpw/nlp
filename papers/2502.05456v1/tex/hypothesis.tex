%Instead of articulating it in this particular manner, we should initially acknowledge the alterations in attention, subsequently endorsing the effectiveness of the dissector. 

Our empirical experiment shows that traditional uncertainty metrics are not effective in tasks like vulnerability detection, while layer-wise method dissectors demonstrate to be effective. This gives rise to the assumption that the confidence in a prediction may experience variability as an input undergoes interpretation by our model.

%paragraph from dissector paper
This is because dissector examines the prediction profile and expects that a within-input should be interpreted by a DL model with increasing confidence towards its final predication result by collecting its uniqueness evidence. Otherwise, it is considered to be a beyond-input.

Consequently, as data traverse the model, the focus may shift between different parts of the inputs - from structural information to something like variable names. Under certain circumstances, the model might concentrate on inappropriate parts of the inputs, leading to high-confidence but incorrect results. In such instances, traditional uncertainty metrics fail to provide reliable measurements
