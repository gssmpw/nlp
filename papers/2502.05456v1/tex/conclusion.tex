This paper proposes CodeImprove for validation and adaptation of out-of-scope inputs to become in-scope inputs for code models. CodeImprove employs a validity score metric by leveraging dropout based sub-model generation (DSMG) technique to distinguish out-of-scope inputs from in-scope inputs and applies semantic preserving program transformations on these inputs. Experimental evaluation confirmed that CodeImprove's effectiveness, highlighting its potential for broader application scenarios in input validation and adaptation.

%This paper introduces CodeImprove, a method for validating and adapting out-of-scope inputs to in-scope inputs for code models. CodeImprove employs a validity score metric to distinguish between the two types of inputs and applies semantic-preserving program transformations. Experimental results validate CodeImprove's effectiveness, highlighting its potential for broader application scenarios in input validation and adaptation.
