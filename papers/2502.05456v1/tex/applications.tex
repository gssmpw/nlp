\section{CodeImprove Application}
\label{applications}

We discuss potential CodeImprove application below:

\textit{Enduring imperfect DL code models.} Code models can hardly be perfect for application scenarios. Even if the code models are perfect for now, code data can evolve from time to time (i.e., code data shifts) and cause the models to behave imperfectly. With CodeImprove's validity score, an application built on such code models can be improved by automatically recognizing out-of-scope inputs from in-scope inputs. 

\textit{Adapting out-of-scope inputs. }Code inputs would cause misleading or incorrect predictions. Therefore, users should identify such inputs and adapt them to make correct predictions. With CodeImprove, users can automatically validate such misleading inputs and adapt them through semantic preserving program transformations to become in-scope inputs. 

\textit{Comparing code model's performance.} 
In an application scenario, code models can directly compare model's performance in terms of accuracies, precisions, recalls, and F1-scores. With CodeImprove, the performance considerations can have a new approach, i.e., CodeImprove is capable of improving the performance metrics of code models. This opens new research directions on how to understand and handle code model's actual performance in real-time.
