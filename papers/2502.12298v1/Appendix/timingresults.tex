    \caption{Experiment II: CIFAR-10 classification time complexity. The figure shows the time complexity of all the methods and the proposed approach. Even though the proposed approach takes $\approx$ 500 seconds longer, the best accuracy is achieved the fastest in comparison to all the other state-of-the-art approaches.}\label{appnd:CIFAR10-timings}

We take the CIFAR10 experiment into consideration as its the most computationally expensive experiment for classification with a parameter count of ~62k and a memory parameter of 100, with a total of $\approx$ 6M memory allocations. Fig.\ \ref{appnd:CIFAR10-timings} time-budget for each of the adaptive techniques and the proposed approach. We observe that the proposed approach is able to achieve the highest accuracy the quickest, even with a higher computational budget.
