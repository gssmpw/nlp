We begin by discussing the SR1 update and the adaptive regularizion using cubics methods for large-scale optimization.

\noindent\textbf{The SR1 update.} The SR1 update is a unique rank-one update in Broyden class satisfying the \textit{secant equation}. The interesting part about the SR1 matrices is that it produces a sequence of possibly indefinite matrices which makes it appealing to deep learning applications where $\mathbf{f}$ is non-convex.
