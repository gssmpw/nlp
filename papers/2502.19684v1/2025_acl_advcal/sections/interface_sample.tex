    \caption{Example question on Chinese literature (with the answer of \underline{three}) being written in the interface. Writers compose questions in the left box. On the right, they see the model's guess and confidence after every sentence and the point at which the model would buzz in and attempt to answer. Writers learn which sentences make it harder for models to answer correctly and refine their questions to be sufficiently hard for models but still answerable by humans. This incremental, adversarial format permits granular calibration measurement.}
