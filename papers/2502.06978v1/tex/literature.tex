The reader is referred to \cite{Molzahn2019_OPF_survey} and to \cite{qiu2024dual,tanneau2024dual} for a detailed review of convex relaxations of AC-OPF, and of dual optimization proxies, respectively.


\subsection{Feasible Dual Conic Proxies}

Dual conic proxies were introduced in \cite{qiu2024dual}, which proposes an optimization proxy that produces valid lower bounds by predicting feasible dual solutions to an SOC relaxation of AC-OPF and is scalable to large systems.
A more general Dual Lagrangian Learning framework was then proposed in   \cite{tanneau2024dual} for conic optimization problems, with results reported on linear and second-order conic problems.
Noting that the SDP relaxation is stronger than the SOC relaxation of AC-OPF, this paper proposes, for the first time, a dual-feasible conic proxy architecture for the SDP relaxation of AC-OPF.
Leveraging the strength of the SDP relaxation has the potential to improve the quality of the lower bounds produced by DCP.
