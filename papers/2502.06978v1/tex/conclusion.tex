\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work has proposed, for the first time, a dual-feasible proxy for the SDP relaxation of AC-OPF.
The proxy leverages a novel dual completion mechanism for SDP-OPF, is trained in a self-supervised fashion, and provides high-quality lower bounds for small- to medium-size systems significantly faster than conventional solvers.
Compared to the original proposed DCP that uses the SOC relaxation, it demonstrates notable improvements in optimality gap for some small- and medium-size systems.

Preliminary results on systems with up to 500 buses validate the potential of this approach, and encourage further investigation into applying the DCP methodology to SDP problems.
A promising avenue consists in scaling SDP-DCP to larger systems by exploiting chordal sparsity, which is key to making SDP optimization tractable in practice.
