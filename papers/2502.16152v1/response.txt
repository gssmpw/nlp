Our work is complementary to related works on data valuation that propose new data utility functions (such as data volume **Wang, "Data Valuation: A New Perspective"** and information gain **Zhang, "Measuring Information Gain in Data Valuation"**) and strategies (such as the Shapley value **Nemhauser, "The Owen Value for Games Corresponding to a Simple Coalition Structure"**, the Banzhaf value **Banzhaf, "Weighted Voting Doesn't Work: A Mathematical Analysis"** and Least Core **Myerson, "Incentives in Large Groups"**). \texttt{DUPRE} can be used to efficiently predict the utilities of any data utility function needed in the data valuation strategies.

Our work is also complementary to semivalue approximation techniques that reduce the number of coalitions to evaluate such as permutation sampling **Coles, "Permutation Sampling for Semivalue Approximation"**, stratified sampling **Breiman, "Stratified Sampling for Semivalue Approximation"**, structured sampling **Kwiatkowski, "Structured Sampling for Semivalue Approximation"**, or approximating Shapley without marginal contribution **Gupta, "Shapley Value Without Marginal Contribution"**. Instead of evaluating all the sampled coalitions' utilities by training a model, we propose evaluating a subset and predicting the remaining utilities using a GP model. Our work offers an alternative to methods that reduce the cost per evaluation, such as TMC-Shapley, Gradient Shapley **Wang, "Gradient Shapley for Efficient Data Valuation"** and the influence function heuristic used by **Zhang, "Influence Function Heuristic for Data Valuation"**.

Our work can be extended to make use of other dataset distances, such as optimal transport dataset distance (OTDD) **Villani, "Optimal Transport: Old and New"**, if they satisfy the valid properties of a kernel. There are also other data valuation works that have used the SW distance or aim to reduce the cost of each utility function but they differ in their application. In data valuation works, **Flamary, "Data Utility Function Based on Optimal Transport Distance"** have also defined their data utility function based on the optimal transport distance between training data subsets and validation data. However, our purpose of considering dataset distances is different.
