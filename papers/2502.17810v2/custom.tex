% TLDR: We introduce URO-Bench, the first comprehensive S2S benchmark for end-to-end spoken dialogue models to cover evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics, experiments on which reveal the pros and cons of current SDMs, highlighting the future direction for SDM development.


\begin{abstract}
% End-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs) have made significant progress in terms of conversation quality and latency, providing new possibilities for intelligent voice assistants, customized digital humans, and more speech-related tasks.
In recent years, with advances in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end spoken dialogue models (SDMs) have made significant strides. Compared to text-based LLMs, the evaluation of SDMs needs to take speech-related aspects into account, such as paralinguistic information and speech quality. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluations for SDMs in speech-to-speech (S2S) scenarios. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{URO-Bench}\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/Ruiqi-Yan/URO-Bench}}\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/Honggao/URO-Bench}}, an extensive benchmark for SDMs. Notably, URO-Bench is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics. Our benchmark is divided into two difficulty levels: basic track and pro track, consisting of 16 and 20 datasets respectively, evaluating the model's abilities in \textbf{U}nderstanding, \textbf{R}easoning, and \textbf{O}ral conversation. Evaluations on our proposed benchmark reveal that current open-source SDMs perform rather well in daily QA tasks, but lag behind their backbone LLMs in terms of instruction-following ability and also suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Their performance in advanced evaluations of paralinguistic information and audio understanding remains subpar, highlighting the need for further research in this direction. 
We hope that URO-Bench can effectively facilitate the development of spoken dialogue models by providing a multifaceted evaluation of existing models and helping to track progress in this area.

\section{Introduction}

Compared with traditional cascaded ASR-LLM-TTS spoken dialogue systems, end-to-end speech-to-speech (S2S) models like Mini-Omni \citep{xie2024mini} and LLaMA-Omni \citep{fang2024llama} significantly reduce latency while maintaining excellent conversation quality. These models also improve naturalness, coherence, and context understanding, enabling faster and more efficient speech interactions with users. In addition, multilingual capabilities are becoming more and more essential for large spoken dialogue models (SDMs). Recent advances, such as SLAM-Omni \citep{chen2024slam} and GLM-4-Voice \citep{zeng2024glm}, further expanded the bilingual capability and multi-round dialogue ability of end-to-end models. 

Compared to text-based LLMs, the evaluation of SDMs needs to take speech-related aspects into account, such as speech quality and paralinguistic information. However, there is still an absence of comprehensive evaluation methods in S2S scenarios, which hinders us from understanding the real capabilities and shortcomings of current SDMs, impeding the further development of spoken dialogue systems. Besides, due to the transition from cascaded models to end-to-end models, it is becoming more and more possible for spoken dialogue systems to understand and synthesize the rich and complex information included in audio, such as speakers' emotions, music, and environmental sounds. Some commercial large speech language models, such as GPT-4o \citep{openai2024gpt4o} and Doubao \citep{zijie2025doubao}, have already demonstrated such capabilities, while open-source frameworks still perform suboptimally in related areas.

In this paper, we re-examine the process of the model engaging in speech interaction and introduce \textbf{URO-Bench}, a benchmark to assess S2S models' capabilities in \textbf{U}nderstanding, \textbf{R}easoning, and \textbf{O}ral conversation (\autoref{fig:overview}). We selected questions suitable for speech dialogue scenarios from several widely used datasets, generated task-specific questions using GPT-4o \citep{openai2024gpt4o}, and synthesized the corresponding audio using state-of-the-art TTS systems, constructing a new benchmark. Our benchmark is made up of two different tracks: basic and pro, including 20 different S2S tasks. The basic track consists of ten English test sets and six Chinese test sets, which cover most of the application scenarios and tasks in real-time voice conversations, such as life advice, common-sense QA, and calculations, primarily testing the model's general knowledge, instruction-following, and reasoning abilities. The pro track is composed of eleven English test sets, eight Chinese test sets, and one multilingual test set. These highly challenging tests are related to multi-round dialogue, cross-lingual conversation, and paralinguistics, assessing the SDM's capabilities of context management, audio understanding, and generation, through which we hope to encourage future models to improve performance in these demanding tasks.

Based on the comprehensive benchmark constructed, we evaluated 6 open-source SDMs along with their backbone LLMs as reference. Experiments reveal that current end-to-end spoken dialogue models perform relatively well on simple everyday conversation tasks and some models exhibit a foundational proficiency to manage multi-round dialogues. However, most SDMs still lag behind cascaded models (Whisper + LLMs), with significant gaps in their instruction-following and reasoning capabilities. At the same time, most SDMs demonstrate poor ability on multilingual tasks, and fail to handle situations related to paralinguistic information, highlighting the future direction for SDM development.

\subsection{Speech Language Models}
Recent years have witnessed a continuous emergence of speech language models (SLMs), accompanied by steady advancements in their capabilities. Models like Qwen2-Audio \citep{chu2024qwen2-audio}, SALMONN \citep{tang2023salmonn}, and WavLLM \citep{hu2024wavllm} support audio and text prompts as input and response in text form. These large models have a strong ability to understand the information contained in the audio and maintain instruction-following capability through text prompts. Regarding speech-to-speech dialogue models, such as Mini-Omni series \citep{xie2024mini, xie2024mini2}, Llama-Omni \citep{fang2024llama}, SLAM-Omni \citep{chen2024slam}, Freeze-Omni \citep{wang2024freeze}, and GLM-4-Voice \citep{zeng2024glm}, both the background information and instructions can be included in the input audio and the model's responses are also in audio modality. This type of SLM is more suitable for daily spoken conversation scenarios, but also places higher demands on the model's capabilities.

\end{table}

There have been several benchmarks for speech language models. AIR-Bench \citep{yang2024air} is designed to evaluate the ability of large SLMs to understand various types of audio signals including human speech, natural sounds, and music. But the evaluation of AIR-Bench merely uses audio as background information, while the relevant questions and instructions are provided in text modality. SD-Eval \citep{ao2024sd} focuses primarily on the model's ability to understand paralinguistic information about emotion, accent, environment, and age contained in the audio. VoiceBench \citep{chen2024voicebench} assesses LLM-based spoken dialogue models in more intricate real-world scenarios. However, SD-Eval and VoiceBench only test the model's textual output, overlooking other important factors such as the quality of the speech output. In addition, previous benchmarks only include assessments of English proficiency. ADU-Bench \citep{gao2024adu} is a new benchmark to evaluate the performance of SLMs in understanding open-ended audio dialogue. However, it does not provide tests for multi-turn conversations. To broaden the scope of SDMs evaluation, we attempt to propose a comprehensive benchmark for end-to-end spoken dialogue models that covers various use cases in speech-to-speech conversation scenarios, filling the gaps of multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and some non-verbal aspects (\autoref{tab:comparison}).

\section{URO-Bench}

\subsection{Overall Design}
% 介绍整体思路和分类学，为什么这么测是全面、合理、客观的
% 都有哪些数据集，总览图，打包一些例子

% For each speech input, spoken dialogue systems need to first understand the information or instructions provided by the user, then perform the necessary thinking and reasoning, and finally output a spoken response. We concluded and divided this speech interaction process into three main stages: understanding, reasoning, and oral conversation. Although SDMs always go through these three stages in voice conversations, some tasks particularly require the model's ability in one of these aspects.
To comprehensively evaluate a spoken dialogue system, it is necessary to assess whether the model possesses the following capabilities: first, understanding the information or instructions provided by the user; second, performing the necessary thinking and reasoning; and finally, generating an appropriate spoken response. We concluded them as understanding, reasoning, and oral conversation. In speech interactions, some tasks particularly require the model's ability in one of these aspects. Therefore, URO-Bench is carefully designed to reflect SDM's abilities in these three dimensions. There are two difficulty levels. The basic track consists of a series of relatively simple daily conversation tasks, and some existing SDMs already have the capability to address these issues. The pro track is an enhanced version of the basic one, primarily assessing the model's ability in complex areas including speech emotion, music, environmental sounds, code switching, advanced mathematics, multilingual processing, speaker recognition, and multi-round memory management. To evaluate the SDM's cross-lingual capabilities, we prepared both English and Chinese versions for each type of test. The data construction pipeline and evaluation process of URO-Bench is presented in \autoref{fig:pipeline}.
% Currently, more and more open-source SDMs support both English and Chinese conversations. Therefore, we prepared English and Chinese versions for each type of test. Considering historical and cultural differences, the two versions are specially designed according to the linguistic context to ensure the authenticity of the speech dialogue scenarios.

% 流程图，statistics表格

% 大概说一下流程和数据集内容
Commonly used text datasets for evaluating LLMs are generally too difficult for current SDMs. Therefore, we selected some simpler text datasets, filtering out questions that involve mathematical formulas, code, or other elements not suitable for speech dialogue scenarios. At the same time, we used AlpacaEval \citep{li2023alpacaeval} and CommonEval \citep{ardila2019common} from VoiceBench \citep{chen2024voicebench}, and leveraged GPT-4o to generate specific data for the aspects we want to test. All the data were synthesized by state-of-the-art TTS systems.


\subsubsection{Dataset Introduction}
% basic，pro，中、英文各个数据集怎么造的，测试内容，造数据prompt放附录
% 从slam-omni的附录里改一些过来
We carefully designed 36 test sets, consisting of 16 basic test sets and 20 pro test sets. Among all, Repeat, Repeat-zh, Summary, MLC, MLC-zh, and all the datasets except ClothoEval-en, MuChoEval-en, MtBenchEval-en, and Multilingual in the pro track were custom-designed using ChatGPT. AlpacaEval and CommonEval were directly from VoiceBench \citep{chen2024voicebench}. The rest 13 test sets were developed from existing datasets for evaluating text-based LLMs. Instructions in GaokaoEval and MuChoEval-en were synthesized into speech using F5-TTS \citep{chen2024f5}. The UnderEmotion and CodeSwitching series were synthesized by GPT-4o \citep{openai2024gpt4o}. For other datasets, we used the CosyVoice model \citep{du2024cosyvoice}, with timbres randomly sampled to simulate real-world application scenarios and reduce the impact of input timbre on experiment results. \autoref{fig:example_basic} and \autoref{fig:example_pro} present some examples of URO-Bench datasets. Detailed introductions are as follows:

% music，audio qa 整理好后加一下描述到这里
% \vspace{-1mm}
\paragraph{Understanding} 
The understanding evaluation is mainly designed to test the model's ability to understand the user's input content and follow instructions. The Repeat and Repeat-zh datasets require SDMs to repeat the user's words verbatim. The Summary and LCSTS-zh\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/hugcyp/LCSTS}} \cite{hu2015lcsts} datasets assess the model's proficiency in summarizing a given story or statement. The GaokaoEval dataset, adapted from Gaokao\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/microsoft/SpeechT5/tree/main/WavLLM}} \citep{hu2024wavllm}, is made up of English listening questions from the Chinese National College Entrance Examination, testing models' ability to understand and extract information in a simple conversation. As for the pro track, UnderEmotion, containing synthesized speeches and some real-world samples from RAVDESS\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/tuncayka/speech_emotion}} \citep{livingstone2018ryerson}, challenges SDMs to understand and infer the speaker's mood and demonstrate empathy in its response. CodeSwitching assesses the model's ability to understand sentences switching between Chinese and English. The Safety datasets test whether the model can reject answering certain privacy-related questions. Finally, ClothoEval, adapted from ClothoAQA \cite{lipping2022clotho}, evaluates the model's comprehension of general ambient sounds, while MuChoEval, derived from MuChoMusic \cite{weck2024muchomusic}, assesses the model's musical knowledge.

% \vspace{-1mm}
\paragraph{Reasoning} 
For reasoning evaluation, the MLC and MLC-zh datasets include questions related to mathematics, logic, and common sense across diverse domains such as history, sports, art, food, and culture. TruthfulEval, adapted from TruthfulQA\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/truthfulqa/truthful_qa}} \citep{lin2021truthfulqa}, focuses on factual questions about various aspects of life. In addition, we selected appropriate samples from the Openbook-QA\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/openbookqa}}  \cite{mihaylov2018can} test set that are relevant to conversational scenarios. The question and answer pairs were translated into Chinese using GPT-4o mini \citep{openai2024gpt4omini}, and their phrasing was modified to ensure better alignment with daily conversation. StoralEval, adapted from STORAL\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jiann/STORAL}} \citep{guan2022corpus}, asks SDMs to deduce morals or lessons from a given story. We also modified some samples from Gsm8k\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k}} \citep{cobbe2021gsm8k} and built Gsm8kEval, which contains simple everyday math application problems. These datasets require the model to have a certain level of knowledge base and reasoning ability. MLCpro is the pro version of MLC, composed of some relatively difficult math problems, cutting-edge scientific questions, and more obscure general knowledge questions. For the multi-round spoken dialogue evaluation, we adapted samples from MT-Bench-101\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/mtbench101/mt-bench-101}} \citep{bai2024mt} to construct our dataset, referred to as MtBenchEval, which assesses the model's conversational abilities like context tracking, memory, and coherence. SpeakerAware tests the model's ability to infer, recognize different speakers, and memorize their information in multi-turn conversations. 

% \vspace{-1mm}
\paragraph{Oral Conversation} 
For evaluation of oral conversation, we use AlpacaEval\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/hlt-lab/voicebench/viewer/alpacaeval}} and CommonEval\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/hlt-lab/voicebench/viewer/commoneval}} from VoiceBench \citep{chen2024voicebench}. WildchatEval, adapted from WildChat-1M\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/WildChat-1M}} \citep{zhao2024wildchat}, consists of various real-life questions. For Chinese versions, we selected samples from AlpacaEval\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval/tree/main}} \cite{li2023alpacaeval} and Claude-3-Opus-Instruct\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/nothingiisreal/Claude-3-Opus-Instruct-15K}} \cite{li2023alpacaeval} that align with daily conversational contexts. Unlike its English counterpart, samples from the \textit{oasst} and \textit{koala} subsets of AlpacaEval were chosen to construct the AlpacaEval-zh subset. These open-ended question test sets are designed to test the model's comprehensive conversational abilities. For the pro track, SRT requires the model to sing, recite poems, and read tongue twisters. GenEmotion and GenStyle ask SDMs to respond in a specified tone or style. Multilingual is adapted from AlpacaEval \citep{chen2024voicebench}, assessing SDM's ability to answer in multiple languages including Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, and Korean. These advanced tasks further challenge the model's audio generation capability.

\subsubsection{Benchmark Construction Pipeline}
% 具体流程
As shown in \autoref{fig:pipeline} chart (a), the detailed construction pipeline of URO-Bench is as follows:
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{1. Data Selection:}
There are two data sources of URO-Bench. One is the existing commonly used datasets, most of which are in text modality, with a few in text-audio format. The other is QA pairs generated by GPT-4o in a targeted manner. We use specific prompts to make sure that the questions are suitable for speech conversation scenarios.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{2. Data Filtering:} 
Filter and remove any sample from data sources that is not suitable for Text-to-Speech (TTS) applications. This includes content such as programming code, complex mathematical equations, technical jargon, special symbols, or any other text that may cause difficulties in accurate speech synthesis. The goal is to ensure that the final source text is clean and readable enough to be easily processed and converted to natural speech using TTS.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{3. Speech Synthesis:}
Leverage state-of-the-art TTS systems (F5-TTS \citep{chen2024f5}, GPT-4o \citep{openai2024gpt4o} and CosyVoice \citep{du2024cosyvoice}) to process the input text and generate the corresponding audio. For GaokaoEval, ClothoEval-en, and MuChoEval-en, we just synthesized the questions and combined them with the original audio that contains background information. For some test sets in the pro track, like UnderEmotion and SpeakerAware, it is necessary to specify the tone or timbre for speech synthesis.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{4. Speech-text Review:}
Perform further filtering with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. We used Whisper-large-v3 \citep{radford2023robust} to transcribe the speech and compare the transcription with the source text, followed by a manual review to ensure speech quality. This combined approach helps identify and remove any errors in speech synthesis, which ensures that the final audio data aligns with the source text, guaranteeing the accuracy of URO-Bench.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{5. Get URO-Bench:}
Organize and obtain URO-Bench. \autoref{tab:statistics_basic} and \autoref{tab:statistics_pro} summarize all the evaluation datasets, with GPT prompts for data construction in \autoref{sec:prompt_data}.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
% 用哪些metrics来评估，方法，打分prompt放附录
The spoken dialogue models are evaluated with four metrics:

% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{Automatic Evaluation Score} 
To evaluate the \textbf{content quality} of the SDM's responses, we use several ways for objective evaluations. 
For the Repeat test, we calculate the word error rate (WER) between the speech transcription and the ground truth and convert it into a score according to
$$
Score = 
\begin{cases}
100 \times (1 - WER) & \text{if } WER \leq 0.5 \\
0 & \text{if } WER > 0.5
\end{cases}
$$
For cases where the WER exceeds 0.5, we interpret this as the model failing to follow the given instructions, and thus we assign a score of zero. Similarly, for Repeat-zh, we use CER instead of WER.\footnote{\scriptsize{For convenience, in the following articles, we will no longer make a clear distinction between WER and CER.}}
For GenEmotion datasets, we compute the WER, use emotion2vec\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/ddlBoJack/emotion2vec}} \citep{ma2023emotion2vec} to recognize the probability that the output audio contains the specified emotion, and convert it into a score according to
$$
Score = Prob \times (1 - min(WER, 1)) \times 100
$$
Emotion2vec is a universal speech emotion representation model, leveraging which we are able to rate the performance of SDMs' emotion generation objectively. 
For SRT datasets, we use GPT-4o-Audio-Preview \citep{openai2024gpt4o} to assess the model's audio output directly. 
For others, we first use Whisper-large-v3\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3}} \citep{radford2023robust} and paraformer-zh\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://huggingface.co/funasr/paraformer-zh}} \citep{gao2022paraformer} to transcribe the speech response into text and then evaluate the transcription of the model's response with GPT-4o mini \citep{openai2024gpt4omini}. ChatGPT is asked to assign a score based on custom scoring criteria for accuracy, relevance, clarity, and completeness. All automatic evaluation scores are normalized to a 100-point scale. Detailed scoring criteria and GPT prompts are summarized in \autoref{sec:prompt_score}.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{UTMOS Score} 
To assess the \textbf{speech quality} of the SDM's responses, we use the UTMOS \citep{saeki2022utmos} model to assign the mean opinion score (MOS). UTMOS is trained to assess various aspects of speech, including clarity, naturalness, and fluency. By leveraging this model, we can objectively measure and compare the quality of the SDM's output speech.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{WER / CER Score} 
To evaluate the \textbf{speech-text alignment} of the SDM's responses, we calculate the WER or CER between the speech transcription and the text response, referred to as ASR-WER / CER. 
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{First Packet Latency}
In real-time voice conversations, low latency is crucial for smooth interaction because any delay between the user's input and the model's response can significantly impact the overall communication experience. Specifically, the first packet latency, referring to the time between a user providing input and the SDM generating the first segment of the output audio, is a critical metric. Recent work has made great efforts to reduce latency to ensure seamless dialogues. Testing the first packet latency is essential for understanding the \textbf{response speed} of the SDM after receiving input audio. We took samples from AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval-zh to measure the first packet latency of SDMs.
% In spoken dialogue scenarios, pauses and delays are more noticeable and can break the immersion of a real-time conversation. Therefore, minimizing the first packet latency is vital to maintaining a fluid, engaging, and natural interaction where the user feels that the system is actively engaging and processing their requests. This is particularly important for applications such as interactive voice assistants or customer service bots.

\subsection{Experiment Setup}
% 测了哪些model，config

We assessed the following SDMs: Mini-Omni series \citep{xie2024mini,xie2024mini2}, SLAM-Omni \citep{chen2024slam}, Freeze-Omni \citep{wang2024freeze}, Llama-Omni \citep{fang2024llama}, and GLM-4-Voice \citep{zeng2024glm}. To compare the performance gap between SDMs and LLMs, we used cascaded model of Whisper-large-v3 + LLM to evaluate their backbone LLMs including Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct, Qwen2-7B-Instruct \citep{yang2024qwen2}, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \citep{dubey2024llama3} and GLM-4-9B-Chat \citep{glm2024chatglm}. GPT-4o \citep{openai2024gpt4o} was also evaluated as upper bounds. All the Whisper + LLMs were scored with their textual responses. The first packet latency was tested using one NVIDIA A40 GPU.

The main results of the URO-Bench evaluation are summarized in \autoref{tab:main_result}, with detailed scores in \autoref{sec:detailed_result}.
% 综述
% glm最强，因为llm强加上海量数据，小模型能力欠缺
Using a small base LLM of 0.5B, Mini-Omni, Mini-Omni2, and SLAM-Omni exhibit the lowest performances, with an average score of about 25. Compared to them, Llama-Omni and Freeze-Omni demonstrate moderate capabilities in the benchmark. GLM-4-Voice significantly outperforms other SDMs, with a gap of at least 10 points in each score. This can be attributed to its use of a strong backbone LLM and massive amounts of training data.
Based on the evaluation results, we have several observations:
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{Basic Track} 
(1) Most SDMs face major challenges in understanding and following instructions, especially apparent in datasets like Repeat and GaokaoEval. In these cases, the models often overlook the given instructions, instead providing answers that are largely irrelevant to the questions. This issue reflects a broader difficulty in accurately processing and adhering to task-specific guidance.
(2) Except for GLM-4-Voice, the other models perform poorly on datasets such as MLC, Gsm8kEval, and OpenbookQA-zh, with scores far below expectations. Compared to backbone LLMs, their performance drops significantly, indicating a severe decline in reasoning ability and general knowledge. The method to address catastrophic forgetting with as little data and cost as possible remains an important research direction for the future.
(3) For oral conversation, the performance of the SDMs is generally satisfactory, with most models demonstrating a solid grasp of fundamental tasks.
% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{Pro Track} 
(1) All the SDMs fail to interpret environmental sounds or music, performing almost like random guessing, which suggests that their ability to process audio beyond spoken language is severely limited. Additionally, while SDMs show a faint grasp of speech emotion, their scores are very similar to those of the backbone LLMs. This leads us to speculate that the SDMs primarily rely on the speech content for information, rather than being able to discern and utilize cues from the speaker's tone.
(2) SDM's ability to distinguish between different speakers based on paralinguistic information, like timbre and pitch, is extremely weak, further limiting their effectiveness in tasks involving multiple speakers.
(3) GLM-4-Voice and SLAM-Omni exhibit notable context-following and memory capabilities in multi-turn conversations. GLM-4-Voice shows a slight ability to handle multiple languages, whereas the other models either lack multilingual capability entirely or can produce text as expected but fail to generate corresponding speech outputs effectively. When it comes to speech emotion generation, GLM-4-Voice is the only model that performs somewhat acceptably, though still not outstandingly. In addition, all the SDMs struggle significantly with tasks of singing or recitation.

% multilingual上，glm展现了一点点的能力，其他模型基本没有或者是text能正常输出但是音频合不出来
% paralinguistics上，emotion生成只有glm还行；唱歌朗诵能力都很弱

% \vspace{-2mm}
\paragraph{Speech Quality and Speech-text Alignment} 
% 更大的模型由于输出更多样，容易产生输出音频长时间停顿或重复的情况，伴随着utmos下降，asr-wer上升，相比之下小模型会更好；cross-lingual能力的实现也会影响speech-text alignment，比如glm和freeze在中文任务上asr-cer很低但是在英语任务上会夹杂中文输出，导致asr-wer大幅上升，如何调整多语言训练数据的比例也是一个重要的课题
Larger models, due to their more diverse outputs, are more likely to produce audio with long pauses or repetitions, leading to a decrease in UTMOS and an increase in ASR-WER. In comparison, smaller models tend to perform better. Besides, the implementation of cross-lingual capabilities also impacts speech-text alignment. For instance, GLM-4-Voice and Freeze-Omni show low ASR-CER on Chinese tasks, but sometimes mix Chinese outputs in English tasks, causing a significant rise in ASR-WER. Therefore, adjusting the proportion of multilingual training data is also an important issue to address in the future.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce URO-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for end-to-end spoken dialogue models. Notably, it is the first S2S benchmark that covers evaluations about multilingualism, multi-round dialogues, and paralinguistics, composed of 20 different S2S tasks. Our extensive experiments on 6 open-source SDMs and their backbone LLMs reveal significant performance gaps in instruction-following and reasoning capabilities compared to cascaded models, with most SDMs struggling with tasks related to multilingualism, and paralinguistics, highlighting key areas for future development. We have open-sourced all test sets and evaluation code, and also launched a leaderboard that provides a platform for the community to access and compare SDMs performance over time.


\section*{Limitations}
URO-Bench is designed to provide a comprehensive and objective evaluation for SDMs. However, there are several limitations. First, due to the need to modify the source code, we cannot provide an automatic evaluation pipeline for the first packet latency. Second, although ChatGPT scoring has been shown in many previous studies to align with human evaluations, the scores may still exhibit some degree of bias and fluctuation. Lastly, we use GPT-4o-Audio-Preview to score tasks like singing and recitation, but the high cost of the API limits the size of our test sets, and we will need to consider alternative evaluators in the future.

I need you to generate some test data for evaluating a speech dialogue model's ability to detect emotions from spoken language. The data should be in the form of conversational questions that are natural and informal in tone, as if they were part of an everyday conversation. \\

The key challenge is that the emotion should be primarily inferred from the user's tone or delivery (e.g., through stress, pacing, pitch), not explicitly stated in the text. The questions should reflect situations where the emotional state of the speaker is not directly expressed but can be inferred from the tone, volume, or rhythm of their speech. \\

The **requirements** are as follows: \\
1. The question should be conversational, and sound like something a person would say in a natural dialogue. \\
2. The emotion that the model should infer from the tone of speech should be subtle, without emotional words or clues in the text. \\
3. The answer should reflect a possible emotion based on the tone, as if the model is interpreting the speaker’s mood based on their voice. \\
4. Provide 2 versions, one in English, another in Chinese, covering a variety of emotions (e.g., happy, stressed, confused, tired, frustrated, etc.). \\
5. Make sure the question is clear and natural enough for the model to know its task in the oral conversation. You can add "What do I feel?" at the last of the question. \\
6. Make sure the texts are suitable for TTS. \\
7. The data should be in jsonl format. \\

The format is \{"question": "\{\}", "emotion": "\{\}", answer": "\{\}", "language": "\{\}"\} \\
For example,  \\
\{"question": "Ai, what is my mood right now?", "emotion": "Exhausted", answer": "You are tired now.", "language": "English"\} \\
\{"question": "Oh my God. What is my mood right now?", "emotion": "Anxious", "answer": "Your mood right now might be anxious or tense.", "language": "English"\} \\
\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}
\{"question": "哎，我现在是什么心情？", "emotion": "疲惫的", "answer": "你现在的心情可能有些疲惫。", "language": "Chinese"\} \\
\{"question": "天哪。我现在是什么心情？", "emotion": "焦虑的", "answer": "你现在的心情可能是焦虑或者紧张。", "language": "Chinese"\}

\begin{tcolorbox}[breakable, colbacktitle=yellow!20!white, colback=yellow!10!white, coltitle=red!70!black, fonttitle=\bfseries, title = {Prompts for SpeakerAware Construction}, sharp corners]
I want to test a speech dialogue model's ability to distinguish speakers in multi-round dialogues. \\

Please generate 5 dialogue samples of three rounds between two different speakers and the model. The conversation should cover a natural, everyday topic. The model should be tested on its ability to correctly identify different speakers, track their identities over the course of the conversation, and respond appropriately to each one. \\

Each speaker should have a distinct characteristic of speech, which will allow the model to differentiate them. Ensure that the speakers interact with the model in a way that challenges the model to maintain correct speaker identification. \\

The **requirements** are as follows: \\
\begin{CJK}{UTF8}{gbsn}
1. Provide 2 versions of same content, one in English, another in Chinese. The name of speakers in Chinese version should be like "小明", "小张".
\end{CJK} \\
2. Make sure the texts are suitable for TTS. \\
3. The data should be in jsonl format. \\
4. There are no interactions between the two speakers. \\
5. The speakers should not ask the model about its hobby, family or somthing else difficult for the model to answer. \\
6. The model should respond without asking back. \\

Here is an example: \\
\{"dialogue": [\{"speaker": "female", "question": "Hi, I'm Lily. My favourite food are sandwiches.", "response": "Hi, Lily! Sandwiches are a great choice!"\}, \{"speaker": "male", "question": "I'm Ben. My favourite food is hot pot.", "response": "Hi, Ben! Hot pot is delicious!"\}, \{"speaker": "female", "question": "How to make my favourite food at home?", "response": "Making a sandwich is super simple! Just grab two slices of bread, spread a bit of butter, mayo, or mustard on both sides, depending on what you like. Then, layer in your fillings, maybe some ham, turkey, or cheese, and add some fresh veggies like lettuce or tomato. Once you've got everything in there, press the slices together and, if you like, you can toast it in a pan or a sandwich press for a warm, crispy finish. After that, just slice it if you want, and enjoy your delicious homemade sandwich!"\}]\} \\

The "speaker" field should contain characteristic of speaker, such as "female" and "male" or "young" and "old". \\
In the first two rounds, the speakers should provide information for the model. And in the third round, one of the speaker asks something about the information he/she had talked about in the first two rounds without telling the model what the information is. 
The speaker in the third round should not mention the information diretly, achieving the effect where the model cannot respond correctly without distinguishing the speaker and corresponding information. \\
The model should correctly identify the speaker, remembering the information about the speaker, and respond in a contextually appropriate manner. \\

Strictly follow the requirements below: In the third round, the question should be "What do I ...", where "..." refers to the verb used in the first round question. For example, if the first round is "Hi, I'm Mia. I enjoy hiking in the mountains during weekends.", the third round should ask "What do I enjoy?" \\

\caption{Criteria of Automatic Evaluation Scores for different test sets.}
\label{tab:criteria}
\end{table*}


As shown in \autoref{tab:criteria}, we employ various scoring criteria tailored to different test sets. To ensure consistency between evaluations, all automatic evaluation scores are normalized to a 100-point scale. Based on the evaluation prompts from VoiceBench \citep{chen2024voicebench}, we rewrite 10 distinct GPT prompts. Detailed information on the scoring criteria and specific GPT prompts are provided below.
