    abstract = {This research addresses the challenge of extracting financial data from unstructured sources, a persistent issue for accounting researchers, investors, and regulators. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), this study introduces a novel framework for automated financial data extraction from Portable Document Format (PDF)-formatted files. Following a design science methodology, this research develops the framework through a combination of text mining and prompt engineering techniques. The framework is subsequently applied to analyze governmental annual reports and corporate environmental, social, and governance reports, which are presented in PDF format. Test results indicate that the framework achieves an average 99.5 percent accuracy rate in a notably short time span when extracting key financial indicators. A subsequent large out-of-sample test reveals an overall accuracy rate converging around 96 percent. This study contributes to the evolving literature on applying LLMs in accounting and offers a valuable tool for both academic and industrial applications.Data Availability: Data are available upon request.JEL Classifications: M41; O31; C81.},

As pretrained language models struggling with long-input summarization for their high memory cost, extract-generate framework regains researchers’ interests. However, the cost of its effectiveness in dealing with long-input summarization is the loss of context information. In this paper, we present a context-aware extract-generate framework (CAEG) for long-input text summarization. It focuses on preserving both local and global context information in an extract-generate framework with little cost, and can be applied to most of existing extract-generate summarization models. CAEG generates a set of context-related text spans called context prompts for each text snippet and use them to transfer the context information from the extractor and generator. To find such context prompts, we propose to capture the context information based on the interpretation of the extractor, where the text spans having the highest contribution to the extraction decision are considered as containing the richest context information. We evaluate our approach on both long-document and long-dialogue summarization datasets: arXiv and QMSum. The experiment results show that CAEG achieves the-state-of-art result on QMSum and outperforms other extract-generate based models in arXiv.}, number={11}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Yuan, Ruifeng and Wang, Zili and Cao, Ziqiang and Li, Wenjie}, year={2023}, month={Jun.}, pages={13932-13939} }

    abstract = "Multi-stage long document summarization, which splits a long document as multiple segments and each of which is used to generate a coarse summary in multiple stage, and then the final summary is produced using the last coarse summary, is a flexible approach to capture salient information from the long document. Even if the coarse summary affects the final summary, however, the coarse summarizer in the existing multi-stage summarization is coarsely trained using data segments that are not useful to generate the final summary. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-stage long document summarization. The proposed method first generates new segment pairs, ensuring that all of them are relevant to generating the final summary. We then incorporate contrastive learning into the training of the coarse summarizer, which tries to maximize the similarities between source segments and the target summary during training. Through extensive experiments on six long document summarization datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method not only enhances the existing multi-stage long document summarization approach, but also achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, including those utilizing large language models for long document summarization.",

An annotator is presented with a question along with a Wikipedia page from the top 5 search results, and annotates a long answer (typically a paragraph) and a short answer (one or more entities) if present on the page, or marks null if no long/short answer is present. The public release consists of 307,373 training examples with single annotations; 7,830 examples with 5-way annotations for development data; and a further 7,842 examples with 5-way annotated sequestered as test data. We present experiments validating quality of the data. We also describe analysis of 25-way annotations on 302 examples, giving insights into human variability on the annotation task. We introduce robust metrics for the purposes of evaluating question answering systems; demonstrate high human upper bounds on these metrics; and establish baseline results using competitive methods drawn from related literature."

abstract = {Principal Components Analysis (PCA) as a method of multivariate statistics was created before the Second World War. However, the wider application of this method only occurred in the 1960s, during the “Quantitative Revolution” in the Natural and Social Sciences. The main reason for this time-lag was the huge difficulty posed by calculations involving this method. Only with the advent and development of computers did the almost unlimited application of multivariate statistical methods, including principal components, become possible. At the same time, requirements arose for precise numerical methods concerning, among other things, the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, because the application of principal components to technical problems required absolute accuracy. On the other hand, numerous applications in Social Sciences gave rise to a significant increase in the ability to interpret these nonobservable variables, which is just what the principal components are. In the application of principal components, the problem is not only to do with their formal properties but above all, their empirical origins. The authors considered these two tendencies during the creation of the program for principal components. This program—entitled PCA—accompanies this paper. It analyzes consecutively, matrices of variance-covariance and correlations, and performs the following functions: •- the determination of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these matrices.•- the testing of principal components.•- the calculation of coefficients of determination between selected components and the initial variables, and the testing of these coefficients,•- the determination of the share of variation of all the initial variables in the variation of particular components,•- construction of a dendrite for the initial set of variables,•- the construction of a dendrite for a selected pattern of the principal components,•- the scatter of the objects studied in a selected coordinate system. Thus, the PCA program performs many more functions especially in testing and graphics, than PCA programs in conventional statistical packages. Included in this paper are a theoretical description of principal components, the basic rules for their interpretation and also statistical testing.}
