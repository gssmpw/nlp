Below, we outline a few key directions.

\textbf{Hierarchical RL.} This approach focuses on planning and reasoning by structuring tasks into high-level (manager) and low-level (worker) policies ____. This modular approach excels in task decomposition, reusable subtasks, and explainable goal-setting. However, it is less suitable for specific use cases like dynamical system control, where precise and responsive low-level policies are essential ____.

\textbf{Prototype-based RL.} 
Prototype-based methods leverage human-defined prototypes to represent states and actions as interpretable latent features, enabling policies that balance interpretability and performance ____. However, their reliance on manual design and lack of temporal precision limit their adaptability to dynamic environments and their ability to handle continuous, high-dimensional dynamics effectively ____.


\subsection{RL for Dynamical System Controls}
DRL is well-studied in physical applications, such as optimizing flow control and turbulent fluid dynamics, where domain knowledge is often available, and state-control actions exhibit stronger correlations compared to other domains____. Recent approaches have further improved interpretability by leveraging state-action correlations and domain knowledge.

Neural-guided methods like NUDGE ____, PIRL ____, and NLRL ____ use symbolic reasoning to discover interpretable policies ____. Symbolic controllers ____, such as DSP ____ and SINDy-RL ____, employ explicit state-control mappings to derive generalizable control laws.
These methods improve interpretability and generalizability, making them suitable for safe, explainable decision-making. However, neural-guided approaches rely on logical representations ____, limiting temporal precision and scalability in complex systems. Similarly, symbolic controllers face scalability issues in multi-dimensional or stochastic tasks where predefined forms fail to capture intricate interactions ____. While explicit formulations aid stability analysis, they may overlook subtle instabilities in evolving or poorly understood dynamics.

Physics-guided RL ____ integrates domain knowledge and physical principles to enhance learning and performance. Approaches include informed reward functions, model-based RL with physics-based or neural network surrogate models ____, and state design ____. While incorporating domain knowledge can improve interpretability, these methods ____ often lack generalizability to other problems and require significant fine-tuning.
