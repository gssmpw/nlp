\subsection{Traditional ACS Prediction Methods}

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) risk prediction methods are essential tools for estimating an individual's likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular events. Traditional methods for predicting ACS risk such as Framingham Risk Score (**Larson, "Prediction of the Development of Myocardial Infarction and CHD"**)____, QRISK (**Conroy, "Estimation of Coronary Heart Disease Risk Using Clinical Judgment: The QRisk2 Study"**), Reynolds Risk Score (**Pletcher, " Assessing Predictive Models of Heart Failure Discourse for Cardiovascular Disease"**) ____ and European SCORE System (**Conroy, "Estimation of Coronary Heart Disease Risk Using Clinical Judgment: The QRisk2 Study"**) ____ utilise a combination of demographic, clinical, lifestyle and medical history data to provide an overall risk assessment, but frequently cannot be utilised once a diagnosis of underlying cardiovascular disease has been made. The data used can be categorised as follows: 1) Demographic Information: Age, gender, and family history of cardiovascular diseases____. 2) Clinical History: Previous incidences of myocardial infarction, angina, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia. 3) Laboratory and and Clinical Tests: Blood pressure readings, cholesterol levels, and creatinine levels. 4) Electrocardiogram (ECG) Readings: Used to diagnose the type and severity of myocardial infarctions (e.g., Discrimination between STEMI and NSTEMI) ____.

These traditional methods systematically assess cardiovascular event risk. The FRS, Reynolds Risk Score, National Early Warning Score (NEWS) (**Carr, "Development and validation of a new severity scoring system for predicting mortality in hospital patients"**) ____  and Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) (**Fox, "Rationale and Design of the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) Project: A Multinational Registry of Patients Hospitalized with Acute Coronary Syndromes”**), primarily relied on point-based systems incorporating traditional clinical and lifestyle factors. Each risk factor was assigned a specific number of points based on predefined scales. The QRISK algorithm employed a comprehensive multivariate approach using a wide array of data points to reflect a diverse population. The European SCORE system utilised regional risk charts to account for geographic variability in cardiovascular disease prevalence. 

\subsection{Machine Learning in ACS Prediction}

While these traditional models have been instrumental in guiding clinical practice, they have notable limitations in adaptability, data integration, and predictive accuracy.  Machine learning/deep learning methods offer significant advantages in these areas, providing more dynamic, accurate, and comprehensive risk assessments by leveraging advanced data analytics and continuous learning capabilities ____*. Wu et al. (**Wu, "Predicting in-hospital cardiac arrest in acute coronary syndrome patients using machine learning"**), utilised machine learning to predict in-hospital cardiac arrest in ACS patients, finding that the XGBoost model outperformed traditional risk scores such as GRACE and NEWS , achieving high accuracy and AUC. A total of 45 risk features were selected in this work from the electronic health record including age, gender, history of smoking and laboratory features, Killip classification, vital signs, mental status, etc.  Similarly, Hadanny et al. (**Hadanny, "Random Survival Forest and Deep Neural Network for Predicting One-Year Mortality in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients"**), used Random Survival Forest (RSF) and deep neural network (DeepSurv) models to predict 1-year mortality in ACS patients, highlighting the improved performance of RSF over traditional methods. Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey (ACSIS) and the Myocardial Ischemia National Audit Project (MINAP) data were used in this work. 69 risk factors including demographics, prior medical history, prior medication, clinical presentation, basic laboratory data with admission were selected and evaluated.

D’Ascenzo et al. (**D'Ascenzo, "PRAISE Risk Scores for Predicting Post-Discharge Outcomes in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients"**), developed the PRAISE risk scores, a machine learning tool validated with external cohorts, which showed high accuracy in predicting post-discharge outcomes for ACS patients. The 25 risk factors included 16 clinical variables, 5 therapeutic variables, and 2 angiographic variables. Research by Emakhu et al. (**Emakhu, "Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting Acute Coronary Syndrome Outcomes"**), compared various machine learning techniques for predicting ACS outcomes based on 58 variables, including demographic and clinical factors ( e.g. brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), creatinine, glucose, heart rate, red cell distribution width, systolic blood pressure, and troponin), with models like XGBoost and RSF significantly improving prediction accuracy over traditional methods. Ke et al. (**Ke, "Early Acute Coronary Syndrome Onset Prediction Using Ensemble Methods"**), focused on early ACS onset prediction using ensemble methods such as gradient boosting, demonstrating the benefits of integrating machine learning into clinical practice for enhanced early detection and management of ACS using demographic characteristics, comorbidities, thrombolytic therapy, laboratory test data, and physical examination data. The study in (**Liu, "Machine Learning-Based Approach Improves Prediction of Mortality in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients"**), concluded that the ML-based approach improved the prediction of mortality, particularly in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on demographic characteristics, medical history, symptom, initial presentation, laboratory findings, clinical manifestation, echocardiographic finding, coronary angiographic finding, and medication at discharge. 

In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown significant advancements in various healthcare applications, including cardiovascular disease prediction. In (**Rajpurkar, "Deep Learning-Based Approach for Predicting Myocardial Infarction Following Acute Coronary Syndrome"**), a deep learning-based approach is introduced to analyse a massive volume of heterogeneous electronic health records in order to predict MACEs following ACS. In (**Chen, “Deep Learning Model for Classifying Acute Coronary Syndrome Abnormalities Using Electrocardiogram Data”**) and (**Wang, “Electrocardiogram-Based Deep Learning Model for Predicting Acute Coronary Syndrome”**), the authors introduce deep learning model for classifying ACS abnormalities using electrocardiogram (ECG) data. However, due to the structured and tabular nature of clinical data, the application of deep learning models in ACS prediction remains relatively limited compared to traditional machine learning approaches.



\subsection{Environmental Factors and ACS}


The effects of environmental factors on ACS have also been increasingly studied. Ku\'{z}ma et al. (**Kuźma, “Short-term impact of air pollution on acute coronary syndrome incidence: A case-crossover study”**), investigated the short-term impact of air pollution on ACS incidence in industrial versus non-industrial areas, finding significant associations between air pollution and ACS admissions. Chen et al. (**Chen, "Hourly Air Pollutant Concentrations and Acute Coronary Syndrome Onset"**), examined hourly air pollutant concentrations and their association with ACS onset, employing a case-crossover design that revealed a strong link between short-term exposure to pollutants and increased ACS risk. Gestro et al. (**Gestro, "Delayed Effects of Air Pollutants on Emergency Department Admissions for Acute Coronary Syndrome"**), developed models to analyse the delayed effects of air pollutants on emergency department admissions for ACS, underscoring the need for continuous air quality monitoring.

However, environmental time series data have more complex temporal properties than clinic data.  Current approaches often rely on manually selected features from time series datasets, including basic statistical measures such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation. These methods may not capture all relevant information, particularly complex, non-linear patterns. Recently, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for time series analysis, especially in examining the impact of air pollution on health outcomes. Various deep learning algorithms have been employed to analyse time series environmental data, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) (**Graves, "Supervised sequence labelling with recurrent neural networks"**), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) (**Goodfellow, “Deep Learning”**), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (**LeCun, “Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition”**), and Transformers (**Vaswani, “Attention is All You Need”**).


RNNs are specifically designed for sequence data, making them a natural fit for time series analysis. Their internal state allows them to retain information from previous inputs, which is crucial for understanding temporal dependencies. For instance, Villegas et al. (**Villegas, "Recurrent neural networks for modeling sequences of events in healthcare"**), utilised RNNs to model sequences of events in healthcare and demonstrate their ability to learn complex patterns in time series data.

These traditional models have been instrumental in guiding clinical practice, they have notable limitations in adaptability, data integration, and predictive accuracy.  Machine learning/deep learning methods offer significant advantages in these areas, providing more dynamic, accurate, and comprehensive risk assessments by leveraging advanced data analytics and continuous learning capabilities ____*.

Our proposed TabulaTime model represents a significant advancement in this field by leveraging deep learning to integrate time-series air pollution data with traditional clinical data. It efficiently processes long sequences while maintaining linear computational complexity, making it more efficient than traditional RNNs and transformers, which have quadratic complexity. This approach addresses the limitations of previous models, providing a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of ACS risk.
