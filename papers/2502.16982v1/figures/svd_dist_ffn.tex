    \caption{Distribution of singular values for each weight matrix in the feed-forward network (FFN) layers. We use WI, WV and WO to denote the weight matrices involved in the FFN layer with SwiGLU activation function, where WI represents the input projection to the Swish$_1$ function, WV represents the extra input projection interacting with Swish$_1$ activations, and WO represents the output projection. We use E0, E2, E3 to denote three arbitrarily selected expert models and SE to denote the weights in the shared expert model. We use RW to denote the weights in the router. We set the spines of each line graph red if the corresponding weight matrix optimized by Muon has a lower singular entropy than AdamW.}
