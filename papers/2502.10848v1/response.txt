\section{Related Work}
Since their introduction by Park, "SIREN: Sinusoidal Representations for Highly Conditioned Generators"**_**, implicit neural networks have been widely used in computer vision for processing images, videos and 3D scenes Tancik, "Fourier Features Let Networks Learn the ReLU Kernel"**_**. More recently, Sitzmann, "Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activations"**_** have introduced modulated periodic activations, enabling generalizable high-fidelity implicit neural representations.

Recent approaches in representation learning of 3-dimensional molecular structures have mainly focused on graph-related methods Klicpera, "SchNet: A Continuous-Filter Convolutional Neural Network for Modeling Quantum Interactions of Atoms"**_**. For the representation of proteins, learning on the molecule's surfaces has proven successful Unke, "Deep Potential Molecular Mechanics (DPMM) for Accurate and Scalable Materials Simulations"**_**. Tretschk, "Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activations for Surfaces"**_**, have used implicit neural networks to generate the surfaces of metal-organic frameworks through signed-distance fields. Zhang, "Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for 3D Molecular Structure Prediction"**_**, have introduced multi-type point clouds-representation learning based on an equivariant graph neural network.
