\section{Related Work}
Since their introduction by~\citet{sitzmannImplicitNeuralRepresentations2020}, implicit neural networks have been widely used in computer vision for processing images, videos and 3D scenes~\citep{essakineWhereWeStand2024}. More recently,~\citet{mehtaModulatedPeriodicActivations2021} have introduced modulated periodic activations, enabling generalizable high-fidelity implicit neural representations. 

Recent approaches in representation learning of 3-dimensional molecular structures have mainly focused on graph-related methods~\citep{zhouUniMolUniversal3D2022,moon3DGraphContrastive2023}. For the representation of proteins, learning on the molecule's surfaces has proven successful~\citep{gainzaDecipheringInteractionFingerprints2020}. \citep{gainzaDecipheringInteractionFingerprints2020} have used implicit neural networks to generate the surfaces of metal-organic frameworks through signed-distance fields. \citep{kilgourMultiTypePointCloud2024} have introduced multi-type point clouds-representation learning based on an equivariant graph neural network.
