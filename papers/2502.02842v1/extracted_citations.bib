  abstract={The upcoming 5G mobile networks will not only bring high data rates but also deliver flexibility and adaptability, which is conveyed by the virtualization of the mobile network. Unfortunately, virtualization of mobile networks is not well understood, and the work described in this paper aims at investigating and elucidating the particular matter. As a starting point, OpenAirInterface, an open source mobile communication software is selected for first virtualization and then cloudification. In addition to the descriptions of the virtualization and cloudification, the paper also provides key findings and lessons learned of the experiments.},

abstract={Developing specialized cloud-based and open-source testbeds is a practical approach to investigate network slicing functionalities in the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of most of the existing cost-efficient and small-scale testbeds that partially or fully deploy network slicing. First, we present relevant software packages for the three main functional blocks of the ETSI NFV MANO framework and for emulating the access and core network domains. Second, we define primary and secondary design criteria for deploying network slicing testbeds. These design criteria are later used for comparison between the testbeds. Third, we present the state-of-the-art testbeds, including their design objectives, key technologies, network slicing deployment, and experiments. Next, we evaluate the testbeds according to the defined design criteria and present an in-depth summary table. This assessment concludes with the superiority of some of them over the rest and the most dominant software packages satisfying the ETSI NFV MANO framework. Finally, challenges, potential solutions, and future works of network slicing testbeds are discussed.},

  title={POSENS: A Practical Open Source Solution for End-to-End Network Slicing}, 
  year={2018},
  volume={25},
  number={5},
  pages={30-37},
  abstract={Network slicing represents a new paradigm to operate mobile networks. With network slicing, the underlying infrastructure is "sliced" into logically separate networks that can be customized to the specific needs of their tenant. Hands-on experiments on this technology are essential to understand its benefits and limits, and to validate the design and deployment choices. While some network slicing prototypes have been built for RANs, leveraging on the wide availability of radio hardware and open source software, there is currently no open source suite for end-to-end network slicing available to the research community. In this article we fill this gap by developing an end-to-end network slicing protocol stack, POSENS, which relies on a slice-aware shared RAN solution. We design the required algorithms and protocols, and provide a full implementation leveraging on state-of-the-art software components. We validate the effectiveness of POSENS in achieving tenant isolation and network slices customization, showing that no price in performance is paid toward this end. We believe that our tool will prove very useful to researchers and practitioners working on this novel architectural paradigm.},

abstract = {With network slicing, the infrastructure is divided into separate networks, each one customized to provide a specific service. Network slicing is a key technology to efficiently support services with very diverse requirements, such as the ones that should support 5G networks. While the architectural work for 5G is well advanced, and many theoretical solutions that address diverse aspects such as resource assignment or service composition exist, the experimental work lags behind. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by describing our implementation experiences when deploying a small-scale multi-service prototype. We consider a video streaming service and an augmented reality service, each one provided over a different network slice, and extend existing open-source software solutions for a better provision of them. Our implementation showcases key features of future 5G networks, such as radio slicing with service differentiation, support for local breakout, or multi-slice orchestration with QoE-triggered optimization. With the core of our implementation being open-source, we believe that our results will prove very useful to researchers and practitioners working on this area of research.}
