This paper provides a comprehensive review of most of the existing cost-efficient and small-scale testbeds that partially or fully deploy network slicing. First, we present relevant software packages for the three main functional blocks of the ETSI NFV MANO framework and for emulating the access and core network domains. Second, we define primary and secondary design criteria for deploying network slicing testbeds. These design criteria are later used for comparison between the testbeds. Third, we present the state-of-the-art testbeds, including their design objectives, key technologies, network slicing deployment, and experiments. Next, we evaluate the testbeds according to the defined design criteria and present an in-depth summary table. This assessment concludes with the superiority of some of them over the rest and the most dominant software packages satisfying the ETSI NFV MANO framework. Finally, challenges, potential solutions, and future works of network slicing testbeds are discussed.},

abstract = {Fifth generation (5G) of the cellular network is envisioned to provide diverse services to the users including high data rates, energy efficiency, and low latency. The number of Internet of Things-connected devices, multimedia applications, and mobile users are expected to grow in the next few years. The massive growth in data consumption poses new challenges such as availability and scalability in future cellular networks. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a network technology that introduces flexibility and eases the management of network architecture by separating the control plane and data plane. In this paper, we survey the relevant works that propose an SDN-based mobile core architecture in order to move toward the 5G networks and to handle the complexity of an enormous number of connected devices to the network. We propose a taxonomy in which we categorize these works based on four factors: technology adoption, control plane implementation, evaluation technique, and architecture used in these works. We also provide the shortcomings of these architectures that should be tackled in future research works.},

  year={2018},
  volume={25},

  pages={30-37},
  abstract={Network slicing represents a new paradigm to operate mobile networks. With network slicing, the underlying infrastructure is "sliced" into logically separate networks that can be customized to the specific needs of their tenant. Hands-on experiments on this technology are essential to understand its benefits and limits, and to validate the design and deployment choices. While some network slicing prototypes have been built for RANs, leveraging on the wide availability of radio hardware and open source software, there is currently no open source suite for end-to-end network slicing available to the research community. In this article we fill this gap by developing an end-to-end network slicing protocol stack, POSENS, which relies on a slice-aware shared RAN solution. We design the required algorithms and protocols, and provide a full implementation leveraging on state-of-the-art software components. We validate the effectiveness of POSENS in achieving tenant isolation and network slices customization, showing that no price in performance is paid toward this end. We believe that our tool will prove very useful to researchers and practitioners working on this novel architectural paradigm.},

abstract={The fifth generation (5G) of cellular networks shall host a number of tenants and provide services tailored to meet a wide range of requirements in terms of performance, dependability and security. Network slicing will be a key enabler, by assigning dedicated resources and functionalities to meet such requirements, where the isolation between slices, i.e., that a slice may operate without interference from other slices, becomes a core issue. The objective of this paper is to give a thorough insight into the isolation concept, discuss the challenges involved in providing it, and outline the means available to provide various levels of isolation. Fundamental concepts that can be used in further work to build an isolation solution tailored to specific needs. This paper defines important concepts such as the Provider Management, the Tenant Management, and the Means of Isolation in the context of the Isolation Dimensions. The conclusion of the study is that dealing with isolation between slices needs extensions in state of the art on the mentioned concepts, and in how to tailor the isolation to meet the needs in a cost-efficiency manner.},

Network slicing is a key technology to efficiently support services with very diverse requirements, such as the ones that should support 5G networks. While the architectural work for 5G is well advanced, and many theoretical solutions that address diverse aspects such as resource assignment or service composition exist, the experimental work lags behind. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by describing our implementation experiences when deploying a small-scale multi-service prototype. We consider a video streaming service and an augmented reality service, each one provided over a different network slice, and extend existing open-source software solutions for a better provision of them. Our implementation showcases key features of future 5G networks, such as radio slicing with service differentiation, support for local breakout, or multi-slice orchestration with QoE-triggered optimization. With the core of our implementation being open-source, we believe that our results will prove very useful to researchers and practitioners working on this area of research.}

abstract={Mobile traffic is dramatically increasing in recent several years with the evolution of mobile network toward 5G era. Network function virtualization (NFV) and cloud computing provide more flexibility and elasticity for mobile networks. The autoscaling orchestrator allows adjusting the number of virtual network functions (VNFs) in a telecom cloud platform corresponding the devices demand (smartphone, IoT, robots,...). However, the adjusting process produces the delay resulting on instance creating to make services available with the enough resource. The predictive mechanisms with workload forecasting enable the improvement in performance of the autoscaling orchestration system. In this paper, we investigate predictive autoscaling in the orchestration system for virtualized mobile networks. We propose a cloud-native approach for stateless telecom services. We also consider and investigate realtime prediction to detect the peak load or burst request of resource. We develop longterm forecasting for periodical resource that detect seasonal workload demand and provide the resource plan to cloud provider. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of these predictive mechanisms with a growing workload with several accuracy criteria. We develop our telecom testbed using containerization technology and these approaches are integrated with Kubernetes orchestrator.},

We think these two tasks are independent of each other and present 5G-Serv, a new architecture for 5G and beyond mobile networks. The paper presents a preliminary analysis and evaluation of the proposed architecture through flow diagrams. As demonstrated, 5G-Serv simplifies the information flow in the 5G network and enhances its modularity and flexibility.

This paper presents a short review of the progress of 6G technological advancement, including its use cases, key performance indicators, innovations in network support technology, and several potential spectrum options. The review is developed based on primary literature, including the relevant ITU document that encompasses IMT 2030 usage scenarios (as of June 2023). In this paper, we try to define progress in research for new services related to 6G use cases. A simulation is conducted to offer an overview of the theoretical 6G capacity. The simulation for theoretical 6G capacity is based on the bandwidth of spectrum candidates between 100 MHz and 1000 MHz. For network support, we identify some requirements to support 6G networks, such as integrated access and backbone, integrated space and terrestrial networks, free-space optical networks, distributed cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. Finally, the paper will also delve into discussing the implications and challenges expected during the 6G implementation phase, including the fulfillment of the key performance indicator objectives and the key value indicator, which is divided into two main components: the first is growth, and the second is sustainability and efficiency domains.},

title={A Survey on SDN Programming Languages: Toward a Taxonomy}, 
date={2016},

abstract={Network devices have always been considered as configurable black boxes until the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN). SDN enables the networks to be programmed according to the user requirements; furthermore, it allows the network to be easily modified to suit transient demands. However, how do we program the network? SDN-compliant switches offer a low-level interface that makes programming error-prone. The controllers provide application programming interfaces, but still low-level, limited, and inflexible. High-level languages have the potential to be a better alternative to program the network. There exist several SDN programming languages implementing different sets of functionalities, and focusing on solving various issues. In face of all this diversity, no published paper outlines a pragmatic view allowing to compare the SDN languages. This paper presents a systematic survey of up-to-date OpenFlow-based SDN programming languages. Our approach relies on a taxonomy comprising all prominent features found in those languages. A detailed review of the existing works is carried out investigating the foundational parts of the languages with their contributions. Examples are discussed to illustrate the fundamental abstractions. Last, all gathered information is summarized, discussing the main ongoing research efforts and challenges. Future abstractions and features to be incorporated into the next generations of SDN programming languages are also considered.},

ABSTRACT = {In the era of DevOps, developing new toolsets and frameworks that leverage DevOps principles is crucial. This paper demonstrates how Ansible’s powerful automation capabilities can be harnessed to manage the complexity of Kubernetes environments. This paper evaluates efficiency across various CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins by orchestrating performance analysis tools across multiple power profiles. Our performance evaluations across network interfaces with different theoretical bandwidths gave us a comprehensive understanding of CNI performance and overall efficiency, with performance efficiency coming well below expectations. Our research confirms that certain CNIs are better suited for specific use cases, mainly when tuning our environment for smaller or larger network packets and workload types, but also that there are configuration changes we can make to mitigate that. This paper also provides research into how to use performance tuning to optimize the performance and efficiency of our CNI infrastructure, with practical implications for improving the performance of Kubernetes environments in real-world scenarios, particularly in more demanding scenarios such as High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).},

  abstract={The upcoming 5G mobile networks will not only bring high data rates but also deliver flexibility and adaptability, which is conveyed by the virtualization of the mobile network. Unfortunately, virtualization of mobile networks is not well understood, and the work described in this paper aims at investigating and elucidating the particular matter. As a starting point, OpenAirInterface, an open source mobile communication software is selected for first virtualization and then cloudification. In addition to the descriptions of the virtualization and cloudification, the paper also provides key findings and lessons learned of the experiments.},
