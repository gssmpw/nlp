\section{Conclusion}
Developing defenses against adversarial attacks on LLM agents requires addressing not only existing attacks but also anticipating future threats. 
In this paper, we analyze eight defenses against IPI attacks on LLM agents and design adaptive attacks for each defense.
Our results demonstrate that the adaptive attacks successfully break all of these defenses.
As LLM agents continue to evolve, safeguarding them from adversarial attacks remains a crucial area of research. We underscore the necessity of thorough evaluations, including adaptive attacks, as a key factor in designing effective defenses.
