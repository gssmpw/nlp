\section{Ethical Considerations}
This research highlights vulnerabilities in current defenses against IPI attacks and presents strategies to exploit these weaknesses. Despite the risks involved, we believe it is crucial to disclose this research fully. The techniques we introduce are straightforward to implement, adapted from existing attack methods in the literature, and could eventually be discovered by any team seeking to compromise LLM agents.
The primary ethical concern of our work arises from the dual-use nature of the vulnerabilities we disclose. By bringing these weaknesses to light, our goal is to encourage the development of more robust defenses for LLM agents, ultimately enhancing their security and promoting safer use.
Therefore, we believe that this paper aligns with ethical principles.
