Given an extensive,
semi-infinite collection of multivariate co-evolving data sequences
(e.g., sensor/web activity streams)
whose observations influence each other,
how can we discover the time-changing cause-and-effect relationships in co-evolving data streams?
How efficiently can we reveal dynamical patterns that allow us to forecast future values?
In this paper,
we present a novel streaming method, \method,
which is designed for modeling such causal relationships (i.e., \relation)
in multivariate co-evolving data streams
and forecasting their future values.
The solution relies on characteristics of the causal relationships that evolve over time in accordance with the dynamic changes of exogenous variables.
\method has the following properties: 
(a) \textit{Effective}:
it discovers the \relation in multivariate co-evolving data streams by detecting the transitions of distinct dynamical patterns adaptively.
(b) \textit{Accurate}: it enables both the discovery of \relation and the forecasting of future values in a streaming fashion.
(c) \textit{Scalable}:
our algorithm does not depend on data stream length
and thus is applicable to very large sequences.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of discovering the \relation as well as forecasting.
