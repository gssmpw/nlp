In this paper,
% we focused on modeling the invaluable components in co-evolving data streams and
% forecasting their future values,
% simultaneously.
% we focused on the discovery of \relation and forecasting in a streaming fashion.
we focused on the summarization of an entire data stream, discovering the \relation in data streams, and
forecasting future values incrementally.
Our proposed method, namely \method, exhibits all of the following desirable properties that we listed in the introduction:
{\setlength{\leftmargini}{15pt}
\begin{itemize}
    % \vspace{-1.2em}
    % \item It is \textit{Effective}: It captures the dynamical characteristics (i.e., regimes and \relation) in data streams and forecasts future values simultaneously.
    \item It is \textit{Effective}: It provides the \relation, namely insightful time-changing causal relationships in data streams.
    \item It is \textit{Accurate}: Our experiments demonstrated that \method precisely discovers the \relation and forecasts future values in a streaming fashion.
    \item It is \textit{Scalable}: The computational time for our proposed algorithm does not depend on the data stream length.
    % and it is faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms for time series forecasting.
