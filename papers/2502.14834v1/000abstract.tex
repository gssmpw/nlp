Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can process inputs with context lengths up to 128k visual and text tokens, yet they struggle to generate coherent outputs beyond 1,000 words. We find that the primary limitation is the absence of long output examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). To tackle this issue, we introduce LongWriter-V-22k, a SFT dataset comprising 22,158 examples, each with multiple input images, an instruction, and corresponding outputs ranging from 0 to 10,000 words. 
% While this dataset extends VLMs' output length \bys{capacity}, 
% % improving the quality of long outputs remains challenging. 
% \bys{achieving high-fidelity long outputs remains challenging.}
% Traditional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with human feedback is costly for long outputs (e.g., 3,000 words). We propose IterDPO, which divides long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections with the original output as preference pairs. This method effectively captures human feedback on long outputs. 
Moreover, to achieve long outputs that maintain high-fidelity to the input images, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the SFT model. Given the high cost of collecting human feedback for lengthy outputs (e.g., 3,000 words), we propose IterDPO, which breaks long outputs into segments and uses iterative corrections to form preference pairs with the original outputs.
Additionally, we develop MMLongBench-Write, a benchmark featuring six tasks to evaluate the long-generation capabilities of VLMs. Our 7B parameter model, trained with LongWriter-V-22k and IterDPO, achieves impressive performance on this benchmark, outperforming larger proprietary models like GPT-4o. 
% Our code and data will be available upon publication.
