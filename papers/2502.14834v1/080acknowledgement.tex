\section*{Ethical Consideration}
While our work on enhancing the long-output capabilities of Vision-Language Models represents a significant advancement,  VLMs may still generate inaccurate or misleading information, especially when dealing with common knowledge not explicitly present in the context. This can lead to the propagation of false information if not properly managed. Therefore, additional safeguards and verification mechanisms should be implemented when deploying these models in user-facing applications.


Our training data has been desensitized to protect individual privacy. All the data sources we used are public available with permissible licenses, including MMEvol~\cite{luo2024mmevol} and Zenodo10K~\cite{zheng2025pptagent}.
