We present spectral-factorized curvature learning schemes for designing training methods. Our approach addresses the instability and inefficiency of using matrix fractional roots in low-precision training, enabling non-diagonal methods to support other fractional roots and generic curvature information.
An interesting direction for future work is to evaluate our schemes in large-scale settings and explore the potential benefits of using different  roots and curvature information.
