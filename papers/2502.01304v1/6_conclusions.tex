\section{Conclusion}\label{Sec:con}
This work introduces a benchmarking for model-free varying-diameter log-grasping with a forestry crane, including the structure of the environment, design of reward functions, and a modified proximal policy optimization (mPPO) algorithm. Under the assumption that the log pose is given, extensive simulations are presented to show the effectiveness of the reward shape and the exploration capability of the mPPO over other algorithms. The overall success rate of the grasping task of varying-diameter wood logs, varying log poses, and randomized initial configurations of the forestry crane exceeds $96\%$. 

\textbf{Limitation.} Although our method shows promising results, we recognize many aspects that require further attention, particularly regarding the sim-to-real gap. For instance, while the simulation offers many benefits, real-world uncertainties such as sensor noise, actuation delays, and unexpected disturbances will require more robust handling. The computational efficiency, especially the training time, can be further optimized by leveraging GPU acceleration. Additionally, incorporating transfer learning techniques may help improve the generalization to physical systems. In future work, we will focus on deploying the learned model in real-world demonstrations and aim to refine the agentâ€™s ability to adapt to dynamic, unpredictable conditions. 


%Additionally, the training process can integrate object estimation and imitation learning. 
%Closing the sim-to-real gap is not a trivial problem since we consider a large-scale hydraulically actuated robot. This is also our main focus for the future work.
