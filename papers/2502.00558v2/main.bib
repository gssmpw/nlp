abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

abstract = {This article examines the problem of automatte explanation of reasoning, especially as it relates to expert systems. By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

abstract = {This article provides an introduction to event-triggered coordination for multi-agent average consensus. We provide a comprehensive account of the motivations behind the use of event-triggered strategies for consensus, the methods for algorithm synthesis, the technical challenges involved in establishing desirable properties of the resulting implementations, and their applications in distributed control. We pay special attention to the assumptions on the capabilities of the network agents and the resulting features of the algorithm execution, including the interconnection topology, the evaluation of triggers, and the role of imperfect information. The issues raised in our discussion transcend the specific consensus problem and are indeed characteristic of cooperative algorithms for networked systems that solve other coordination tasks. As our discussion progresses, we make these connections clear, highlighting general challenges and tools to address them widespread in the event-triggered control of networked systems.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of multi-agent navigation and collision avoidance when observations are limited to the local neighborhood of each agent. We propose InforMARL, a novel architecture for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) which uses local information intelligently to compute paths for all the agents in a decentralized manner. Specifically, InforMARL aggregates information about the local neighborhood of agents for both the actor and the critic using a graph neural network and can be used in conjunction with any standard MARL algorithm. We show that (1) in training, InforMARL has better sample efficiency and performance than baseline approaches, despite using less information, and (2) in testing, it scales well to environments with arbitrary numbers of agents and obstacles. We illustrate these results using four task environments, including one with predetermined goals for each agent, and one in which the agents collectively try to cover all goals.}

However, the application of RL in a large-scale decentralized multi-agent environment remains a challenging problem due to the partial observability and limited communications between agents. In this paper, we develop a model-based kernel RL approach and a model-free deep RL approach for learning a decentralized, shared policy among homogeneous agents. By leveraging the strengths of both these methods, we further propose a novel deep ensemble multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method that efficiently learns to arbitrate between the decisions of the local kernel-based RL model and the wider-reaching deep RL model. We validate the proposed deep ensemble method on a highly challenging real-world air traffic control problem, where the goal is to provide effective guidance to aircraft to avoid air traffic congestion, conflicting situations, and to improve arrival timeliness, by dynamically recommending adjustments of aircraft speeds in real-time. Extensive empirical results from an open-source air traffic management simulation model, developed by Eurocontrol and built on a real-world data set including thousands of aircrafts, demonstrate that our proposed deep ensemble MARL method significantly outperforms three state-of-the-art benchmark approaches.}, journal={Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling}, author={Ghosh, Supriyo and Laguna, Sean and Lim, Shiau Hong and Wynter, Laura and Poonawala, Hasan}, year={2021}, month=may, pages={468–476} }

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01170},
	abstract = {The ad hoc coordination problem is to design an autonomous agent which is able to achieve optimal flexibility and efficiency in a multiagent system with no mechanisms for prior coordination. We conceptualise this problem formally using a game-theoretic model, called the stochastic Bayesian game, in which the behaviour of a player is determined by its private information, or type. Based on this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination ({HBA}), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal control. We evaluate {HBA} in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based foraging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than several alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at a public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated Prisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against {HBA} and alternative algorithms, showing that {HBA} achieves equal efficiency and a significantly higher welfare and winning rate.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.artint.2016.02.004},
	abstract = {There is a long history in game theory on the topic of Bayesian or "rational" learning, in which each player maintains beliefs over a set of alternative behaviours, or types, for the other players. This idea has gained increasing interest in the artificial intelligence ({AI}) community, where it is used as a method to control a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviours. The idea is to hypothesise a set of types, each specifying a possible behaviour for the other agents, and to plan our own actions with respect to those types which we believe are most likely, given the observed actions of the agents. The game theory literature studies this idea primarily in the context of equilibrium attainment. In contrast, many {AI} applications have a focus on task completion and payoff maximisation. With this perspective in mind, we identify and address a spectrum of questions pertaining to belief and truth in hypothesised types. We formulate three basic ways to incorporate evidence into posterior beliefs and show when the resulting beliefs are correct, and when they may fail to be correct. Moreover, we demonstrate that prior beliefs can have a significant impact on our ability to maximise payoffs in the long-term, and that they can be computed automatically with consistent performance effects. Furthermore, we analyse the conditions under which we are able complete our task optimally, despite inaccuracies in the hypothesised types. Finally, we show how the correctness of hypothesised types can be ascertained during the interaction via an automated statistical analysis.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates pure strategy sequential equilibria of repeated games with imperfect monitoring. The approach emphasizes the equilibrium value set and the static optimization problems embedded in extremal equilibria. A succession of propositions, central among which is "self-generation," allow properties of constrained efficient supergame equilibria to be deduced from the solutions of the static problems. We show that the latter include solutions having a "bang-bang" property; this affords a significant simplification of the equilibria that need be considered. These results apply to a broad class of asymmetric games, thereby generalizing our earlier work on optimal cartel equilibria. The bang-bang theorem is strengthened to a necessity result: under certain conditions, efficient sequential equilibria have the property that after every history, the value to players of the remainder of the equilibrium must be an extreme point of the equilibrium value set. General implications of the self-generation and bang-bang propositions include a proof of the monotonicity of the equilibrium average value set in the discount factor, and an iterative procedure for computing the value set.},

To explore the considerations the U.S. Department of Defense must take into account as efforts go forward both at the U.S. national and international level to develop an STM regime to ensure both safety of space operations and sustainability of the future space environment.
Findings
The Defense Department and the relevant military services/organizations (i.e., the Air Force and U.S. Strategic Command) have yet to come to grips with the security dilemmas they will face as governance decisions related to STM are taken.
Practical implications
The question of how to manage increasing congestion in orbit has now come to the fore within the U.S. government, as well as within the international community of space operators, as the trends regarding space traffic have become impossible for space-faring nations to ignore. Space traffic management (STM) is fundamentally an issue of space safety. Unfortunately, ensuring space safety and assuaging national security concerns about national space assets are fundamentally contradictory efforts. Safety and security require opposing strategies; national versus international control require opposing approaches; and the U.S. military faces a number of security dilemmas in dealing with its needs versus those of the wider space operating community.}

abstract = {This article focuses on the coordination and communication aspects of multi-robot systems (MRS) and explores what, how and when robots should coordinate and communicate in marine environment. It includes a comparative analysis of MRS coordination under communication constraints in aerial, terrestrial, and marine environments. In the light of the gaps identified in the current MRS literature, we focus on how to tackle the inherent communication constraints presents in marine environments. Thus, a review of Marine Multi-Robot systems (MMRS) is presented, proposing a taxonomy that classifies them according to how they communicate and coordinate. In this line, the classification of different communication strategies found in the literature has received significant attention. Additionally, a MMRS coordination approach is proposed where a heterogeneous group of marine vehicles must explore an unknown area maximizing communication. The proposed approach uses a real characterization of the acoustic communication signal quality as input to the decision making process. To validate its effectiveness, our approach has been subjected to a series of highly realistic experiments.}
