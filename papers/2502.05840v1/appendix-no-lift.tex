\begin{proof}
    We show that in every game with objective $W_n$ and all vertices controlled by Eve, if she can win, she has a winning strategy with memory $2$.
    Let $G$ be such a game.
    By prefix-independence of $W_n$, we can assume that Eve wins no matter what is the initial vertex of $G$.
    For each vertex $v\in V(G)$, we let $\chi_1(v)$ be the smallest element in $\SS_n$ such that there is a path starting in $v$ that produces a colour $c$, and we fix one such finite path $\pi_v^1 = v \re{ uc} v'$ of minimal length.
    We let $\chi_2(v)$ be the second smallest such element (which exists, as Eve wins the game), and fix a finite path $\pi_v^2$ of minimal length producing it.
    Note that if $v\re{u} v'$ is a path in $G$, then $\chi_1(v) \leq \chi_1(v')$.
    % If $\chi_1(v)$ does not appear in $u$, then $\chi_1(v) = \chi_1(v')$. 

    We define a $2$-memory strategy for Eve as follows: when in a vertex $v$ and memory state $1$, she will take the first edge from $\pi_v^1$.
    If this edge has colour $\chi_1(v)$, we update the memory state to $2$, and keep it $1$ on the contrary.
    When in the memory state $2$, she will take the first edge from $\pi_v^1$, and update the memory state to $1$ if and only if this edge has colour $\chi_2(v)$.

    We show that this strategy ensures the objective $W$. Let $v_0\re{c_1} v_1\re{c_2}\dots$ be an infinite play consistent with this strategy.
    Let $a = \limsup \chi_1(v_i)$.
    We claim that we produce both $a$ and a colour $>a$ infinitely often.
    Let $i_0$ be large enough so that $\chi_1(v_i) > a$ for $i\geq i_0$. Note that in this case, if $v_i\re{u} v_{i'}$ is a path that does not contain colour $\chi_2(v_i)$, then  $\chi_2(v_{i'}) =  \chi_2(v_i)$.
    If in step $i$ we are in memory state $1$, 
    in exactly $|\pi_{v_{i}}^1|$ steps we will produce output $\chi_1(v_{i})$ and change the memory state to $2$.
    Likewise, by the remark above, if we are in the memory state $2$, in $|\pi_{v_{i}}^2|$ steps we will produce $\chi_2(v_i) > a$ and change to the memory state $1$.
    This concludes the proof.
