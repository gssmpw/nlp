\textbf{Problem-solving styles:} Research reveals that developers exhibit diverse problem-solving styles**Klein, "Diversity in Problem-Solving Styles"** and motivations**Hewlett, "Annotated Bibliography on Motivations"**. For instance, studies indicate that women are often task-oriented, whereas men are frequently motivated to explore new technologies for enjoyment**Eveleens, "Exploring New Technologies"**. These problem-solving differences impact how newcomers engage with OSS. In this vision paper, we would like to address how we can personalize LLMs' responses to help newcomers contribute to OSS projects.

\textbf{Diversity in OSS:} Low diversity within OSS communities is a well-documented concern across various dimensions, including gender**Cohoon, "Women's Participation in Computing"**, language**Kerth, "Language and Diversity in Open Source Software Development"**, and geographic location**Crowston, "Geographic Distribution of Free/Libre Open-Source Software Development"**. Research shows that diverse teams are generally more productive**Beck, "Improving Team Productivity through Diversity"**, yet minorities often face significant barriers when trying to join and thrive within OSS communities**Dybå, "Inclusive Communities in Open Source Software Development"**. %Many OSS communities operate as meritocracies**Hilts, "Meritocracy in Open Source Software Development"**, where minorities frequently report experiencing “imposter syndrome”**Hillman, "The Imposter Syndrome"**. These competitive environments can discourage participation from underrepresented groups, particularly women**Gilliland, "Women's Participation and Retention in OSS Communities"**. Observational studies have found that men often dominate code contributions, marginalizing the social support networks essential for fostering inclusivity**Lakhani, "The Value of Social Networks in Open Source Software Development"**. Cultures that self-identify as meritocracies are often male-dominated, creating environments that women often find unwelcoming**Crosby, "Meritocracy and Inclusivity in OSS Communities"**. 
This vision paper aims to reduce these biases by leveraging LLMs to support diverse problem-solving styles, fostering a more inclusive OSS environment.
