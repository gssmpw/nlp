      If a problem is stated or implied in a comment & A problem is any writing-related issue that affects the quality of the writing, such as citation errors, logical flaws, coherence issues, grammatical mistakes, or inappropriate word choices, among others. The problem can be mentioned or implied in a given comment. & \underline{Positive Examples}
      \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          % \item Decent use of connectors. I would suggest using more to reduce sentence length (implied problem: some sentences are too long)
          \item Specify what the abbreviation ``THC'' stands for. (Implied problem: ``THC'' is unspecified)
          \item There was a redundant use of ``the legalization of cannabis''.	
          % \item Very well integrated, a large number of good sources, but ...no reference list (stated problem: no reference list)
      \end{itemize} \underline{Negative Examples} \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item Great grammatical skills, well done!
          \item Final references are well formatted. In-text references are well integrated.	
      \end{itemize} \\ \midrule

      If a problem points to a specific part of the essay & A specific part refers to a part of the essay that is easily locatable. (1) It can be a specific word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, reference etc. used in the essay. (2) It can be a concrete location, such as ``sentence 2 in paragraph 2,'' ``in paragraph 6,'' ``the first citation,'' or ``the first sentence of the paper'' and so on. (3) A less concrete location, such as ``the introduction,'' or ``the conclusion,'' is also considered a specific part if it is accompanied by some referenceable details. & \underline{Positive Examples}
      \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item In Paragraph 2, the word ``decay'' is likely a mistake and should be replaced with ``decade''.	
          \item The sentence ``This theory still is under debate even with many authors provide a justification for that'' contains a grammatical error. The verb ``provide'' should be corrected to ``providing.''	
      \end{itemize} \underline{Negative Examples} \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item Some of the sentences are a bit too long and fall apart a little.	
          % \item I would like to see a quotation or two.	
          \item Your paper would benefit from the use of expressions such as ``as a result'' or ``the result'' where cause and consequence are important.	
      \end{itemize} \\ \midrule

      If a problem offers some form of suggestions, general or specific & A suggestion indicates or implies ares of improvement. If the problem only contains a problem statement and it is unclear what direction the student should take to improve it, then there is no suggestion. A concrete correction is always considered a suggestion. & \underline{Positive Examples}
      \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item Some sentences could be a bit shorter.	
          \item The use of a topic sentence for each paragraph in the main body could be improved.		
      \end{itemize} \underline{Negative Examples} \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item The beginning of the literature review could be changed slightly.
          \item The first sentence of the paper is confusing.	
      \end{itemize} \\ \midrule

      If a problem provides a concrete correction for an identified writing issue & A concrete correction is something that can be directly applied to an essay to fix a writing problem. Corrections should not require thinking to implement, i.e. text that can be copy-pasted, or actions that can be taken following an instruction (e.g., capitalize the first letter). & \underline{Positive Examples}
      \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item The citation ``(Toronto Star December 2016)'' should be revised to ``(Toronto Star 2016)'' to align with proper citation practices.	
          \item ``The advance of technologies'' should be corrected to ``the advancement of technologies''.		
      \end{itemize} \underline{Negative Examples} \begin{itemize}
          \itemsep-0.25em
          \item The significance of South Australian policy is unclear, as it is the first citation and the only one in the Introduction.	
          \item The conclusion is a little too short.	
      \end{itemize}  \\
