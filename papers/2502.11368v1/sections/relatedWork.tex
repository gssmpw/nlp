\paragraph{Automated Writing Evaluation (AWE)} We use AWE to include both automated essay scoring (AES)\footnote{AES is sometimes conflated with AWE in the literature \citep{Hockly2019}. We distinguish them.} and feedback comment generation \citep{Shermis2013-ja}. AWE systems have existed since the 1960s \citep{page1966imminence} and have evolved over time with a predominant focus on AES \citep{Ke2019, Hussein2019, Zhang2020, Uto2021, Lagakis2021}. Modern AWE systems use deep neural networks for scoring \citep{taghipour-ng-2016-neural, alikaniotis-etal-2016-automatic, dong-etal-2017-attention, rodriguez2019languagemodelsautomatedessay, yang-etal-2020-enhancing, xie-etal-2022-automated} and feedback comment generation \citep{nagata-2019-toward, han-etal-2019-level, babakov-etal-2023-error}. The latter task typically focuses on sentence-level grammatical error identification and correction \citep{behzad-etal-2024-leaf}. Existing non-LLM AWE systems mainly provide holistic assessment, with some specialized systems offering uni-dimensional analytic assessment based on a specific dimension of writing quality \citep{Ke2019, jong2023reviewfeedbackautomatedessay, banno-etal-2024-gpt}. 


\paragraph{LLMs used for AWE} Unlike prior AWE systems, LLMs can be prompted in natural language to jointly score and comment on a given essay. A growing body of research has explored the use of LLMs for assessing L2 writing. For AES, LLMs have been examined for holistic scoring \citep{MIZUMOTO2023100050, yancey-etal-2023-rating, Wang2024}, discourse coherence scoring \citep{naismith-etal-2023-automated}, and multi-dimensional analytic scoring \citep{Yavuz2024, banno-etal-2024-gpt}. For feedback comment generation, LLMs have been studied for generating corrective feedback \citep{MIZUMOTO2024100116, song-etal-2024-gee}, holistic feedback \citep{behzad-etal-2024-assessing, behzad-etal-2024-leaf}, and multi-dimensional analytic feedback \citep{Guo2024-eg, behzad-etal-2024-assessing, han-etal-2024-llm}. \citet{stahl-etal-2024-exploring} is the only study we know of which explores LLMs jointly performing scoring and feedback comment generation, but holistically. Moreover, their corpus contains short essays by native speakers and has no human reference comments.  

\paragraph{Related Corpora} Major L2 writing corpora include TOEFL11 \citep{TOEFL11}, which contains scored essays from TOEFL tests, and CLC-FCE \citep{yannakoudakis-etal-2011-new}, which includes error-annotated short texts in response to exam prompts. Other notable corpora are derived from online language learning platforms, such as EFCAMDAT \citep{vanRooy_2015}, Write \& Improve \citep{Helen2018}, and LEAF \citep{behzad-etal-2024-leaf}, focusing on scoring, grammatical error correction, and personalized feedback, respectively. We are not aware of any publicly available corpora annotated with multi-dimensional analytic scores and comments jointly.
