\begin{abstract}
Leveraging LLMs for code generation is becoming increasingly common, as tools like ChatGPT can suggest method implementations with minimal input, such as a method signature and brief description. Empirical studies further highlight the effectiveness of LLMs in handling such tasks, demonstrating notable performance in code generation scenarios.
%Writing code assisted by an LLM is becoming common practice. For instance, tools like ChatGPT can suggest the implementation of a method by simply accessing the method's signature and a short description of the expected behavior. Several empirical studies report the interesting performance of LLMs in code generation tasks.

However, LLMs are inherently non-deterministic, with their output influenced by parameters such as temperature, which regulates the model's level of creativity, and top-p, which controls the choice of the tokens that shall appear in the output. Despite their significance, the role of these parameters is often overlooked.%The role of these parameters is unfortunately underrated. 

This paper systematically studies the impact of these parameters, as well as the number of prompt repetitions required to account for non-determinism,
%of times a prompt should be repeatedly submitted to account for non-determinism, 
in the context of 548 Java methods. We observe significantly different performances across different configurations of ChatGPT, with temperature having a marginal impact compared to the more prominent influence of the top-p parameter. Additionally, we show how creativity can enhance code generation tasks. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations for addressing the non-determinism of the model.
%revealing a marginal impact of the temperature, in favor of a much more prominent role of parameter top-p. Further, we show how creativity can be beneficial in code generation tasks. Finally, we provide concrete recommendations on how to deal with the non-determinism of the model.
