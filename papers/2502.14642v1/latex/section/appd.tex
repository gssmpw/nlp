    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{latex/picture/style.pdf}
    \caption{Model performance across different book style.}
    \label{fig:style}
\end{figure*}

We select the top 20 Styles based on their frequency and calculated the average metrics for the book subsets under each Style. 
Our analysis shows that the model's ability to predict behavior chains does not exhibit significant differences across different Styles.
% However, relatively speaking, styles such as Informative and Gritty demonstrate slightly higher predictive performance, likely due to their more structured and explicit behavioral patterns. 
% In contrast, styles like Fantastical and Playful exhibit marginally lower performance, potentially due to greater variability and implicit character behaviors. 
% While these differences are not statistically significant, they suggest that narrative structure may influence the model’s ability on the behavior chain task.


\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Dataset Construction Details}
\label{sec:app_con}
We employed Claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 for behavior chain extraction and context refinement. The ChatGPT-4o-latest model was utilized to generate distractor items for each behavior. For other generation tasks with lower computational requirements, we selected GPT-3.5 as the execution model.

\subsubsection{Model Testing Details}
\label{sec:app_exp}
All evaluated models were post-interaction versions. The history provided to the LLM consisted of summaries from all preceding chapters used for behavior chain extraction.

To prevent data leakage, we systematically substituted all personal entities in the inputs. For conciseness, all analyses in Section \ref{sec:analysis} are based on the multiple-choice task framework.

The single experimental data presented in \ref{sec:analysis} exclusively comprises outputs from the Llama-3p1-70B-Instract model as the target model.

For inputs that exceed the model's context length, we truncated the history from the oldest to the newest.

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = {History}, breakable]
Summary of Chapter 1 \\
Nick, a Yale graduate and World War I veteran, moves to West Egg, Long Island, to work as a bond salesman.  He rents a small house next to the opulent mansion of his mysterious neighbor, Jay Gatsby.

West Egg is separated from the more fashionable East Egg by the Long Island Sound.  Across the water, Nick's cousin Daisy lives with her wealthy and imposing husband, Tom Buchanan, whom Nick knew at Yale.  Tom's wealth and social standing are evident in their "Georgian Colonial mansion."  Also present at their home during Nick's visit is Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy's and a well-known golfer.

The chapter highlights the Buchanans' superficial and privileged lifestyle.  During dinner, Tom reveals his racist views by referencing a book espousing white supremacist theories, claiming the Nordic race is responsible for civilization.  This disturbs Nick, but no one challenges Tom's comments.

The dinner is interrupted by a phone call, hinting at Tom's infidelity.  Jordan informs Nick that Tom is having an affair with a woman in New York City.  The tension is palpable, but Daisy attempts to deflect attention.  The awkwardness of the situation is further amplified by another phone call.

As the evening progresses, Nick learns that Jordan Baker is a famous golfer with a somewhat scandalous reputation.  He also discovers that Daisy and he, despite being related, are not close.  The Buchanans tease Nick about a rumor of a broken engagement, which he denies.

Returning home, Nick sees Gatsby standing outside his mansion.  Nick considers inviting him over but hesitates, sensing something enigmatic about Gatsby's presence.
\\Summary of Chapter 2 \\
Chapter 2 delves into the "valley of ashes," a desolate area between West Egg and New York City, where industrial ashes are dumped.  Presiding over this wasteland is the faded billboard of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, featuring giant, spectacled eyes.

This grim setting is significant because it's where George Wilson's struggling auto shop and his wife Myrtle, Tom's mistress, are located.  Tom, on his way to New York City with Nick, stops at Wilson's garage, ostensibly to discuss a car deal.  The real purpose, however, is to rendezvous with Myrtle. Nick finds Myrtle physically unattractive, despite her apparent allure for Tom.

The group, leaving George behind, proceeds to New York City, impulsively buying a puppy along the way.  They gather at a small apartment Tom keeps for his affair.  The other guests include Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and the McKees, neighbors from the building. Mr. McKee is a mediocre photographer.

The atmosphere becomes increasingly tawdry and tense.  A critical moment occurs when Myrtle mentions Daisy's name, provoking Tom to violently strike her, breaking her nose.

Nick, claiming to be drunk (only the second time in his life), leaves the apartment with Mr. McKee amidst the chaos of tending to Myrtle's injury.  He experiences a blackout and then finds himself at Mr. McKee's bedside, observing his amateurish photographs.  Nick manages to escape the apartment and waits at the train station for the 4:00 a.m. train home.
\\Summary of Chapter 3 \\
Chapter 3 depicts one of Gatsby's extravagant parties through Nick's eyes.  Nick receives a formal invitation, a stark contrast to the casual attendance of most guests, who often don't even know Gatsby.  At the party, Nick reconnects with Jordan Baker, who explains she enjoys large gatherings for the anonymity they offer.  A humorous anecdote highlights Gatsby's generosity: he replaced a dress torn at a previous party with an expensive new one.

Rumors about Gatsby's background and wealth circulate among the guests, ranging from accusations of being a German spy to claims of him being a war hero or even a murderer.  While searching for Gatsby, Nick encounters a drunken "owl-eyed" man in Gatsby's impressive library, who is astonished to discover the books are real.  Nick eventually meets Gatsby, but their conversation is cut short by a phone call.  Observing Gatsby later, Nick is struck by his charismatic smile and the contrast between his apparent sobriety and the revelry of his guests.  Gatsby then takes Jordan aside for a private conversation, leaving her visibly shaken.  As the party ends, a drunken car crash involving the owl-eyed man underscores the reckless atmosphere.

Nick then reflects on his experiences, noting that his time in West Egg isn't solely filled with social events but also with work.  He expresses his growing affection for New York City, despite feelings of loneliness, and his burgeoning relationship with Jordan.  He recounts a story about Jordan cheating in a golf tournament, a scandal that, though dismissed, hints at her dishonesty.  Nick rationalizes her behavior as a consequence of her desire for independence clashing with her need for protection.

The chapter concludes with Nick and Jordan becoming romantically involved.  Nick reveals he ended a relationship in the Midwest to pursue Jordan and emphasizes his own sense of honesty.
\\Summary of Chapter 4 \\
Chapter 4 of *The Great Gatsby* opens with a Sunday morning at Gatsby's mansion, where the usual rumors about his past continue to circulate. Nick briefly catalogs the diverse and affluent guests who frequent Gatsby's parties.

One day in late July, Gatsby takes Nick to lunch in his luxurious car.  During the drive, Gatsby seems overly concerned with Nick's opinion of him and his vehicle. He then directly addresses the rumors about his background, claiming to be the son of wealthy, deceased Midwestern parents.  However, he gives the contradictory answer of San Francisco when asked where in the Midwest.  He further elaborates, stating that he inherited his parents' fortune, lived lavishly in Europe, and then became a war hero in World War I, receiving numerous medals.

To support his claims, Gatsby shows Nick a photo of himself at Oxford and a medal from Montenegro.  These items, along with Gatsby's ability to evade a speeding ticket by showing a Christmas card from the police commissioner, convince Nick of the truth of Gatsby's stories.

They have lunch with Meyer Wolfsheim, a shady character who, according to Gatsby, fixed the World Series. Wolfsheim's bizarre cufflinks, made of human molars, further emphasize his connection to the criminal underworld.  Tom Buchanan briefly joins them, but Gatsby disappears abruptly.

Later, Jordan reveals to Nick that she met Gatsby in Louisville in 1917, when Daisy and Gatsby were together.  Jordan recounts how Daisy almost ran off to New York with Gatsby before he went to war, and how she was later deeply unhappy before her wedding to Tom.  Jordan then reveals the reason for her private conversation with Gatsby at the party: Gatsby wants to reunite with Daisy, and he needs Nick's help to arrange a meeting.
\\Summary of Chapter 5 \\
Chapter 5 details the long-awaited reunion between Gatsby and Daisy at Nick's cottage.  Before Daisy arrives, Gatsby's feigned disinterest crumbles as he obsessively prepares, even having Nick's lawn manicured.  Daisy's initial question about the purpose of the invitation and whether Nick harbors romantic feelings for her is met with a reference to *Castle Rackrent*.

The meeting begins awkwardly, and Nick tries to give them space. However, Gatsby, clearly anxious, repeatedly seeks Nick's advice, prompting Nick to reprimand him for his behavior.  Gatsby's reaction suggests he's offended by Nick's criticism.

They then move to Gatsby's mansion. Nick briefly describes the mansion's original owner, a wealthy brewer who, according to rumors, wanted the surrounding area to resemble a medieval village, an idea Nick finds inherently un-American.  The only person present in the vast house is Klipspringer, a freeloading "boarder."  Gatsby proudly displays his extensive and expensive collection of shirts, a display that moves Daisy to tears.  Nick notices a picture of a man on a yacht, whom Gatsby identifies as Dan Cody, his former mentor and close friend.

Gatsby points out the green light on Daisy's dock, visible from his house in clear weather.  After touring the mansion, they again encounter Klipspringer, whom Gatsby compels to play the piano.  Finally, Nick leaves Gatsby and Daisy alone, implying the possibility of their rekindling their past romance.
\\Summary of Chapter 6 \\
Chapter 6 begins with a reporter's visit to Gatsby, seeking a statement regarding vague, unsubstantiated rumors.  This prompts Nick to recount Gatsby's true origins, as told by Gatsby himself.  James Gatz, born to an unremarkable family in South Dakota, reinvented himself as Jay Gatsby after meeting Dan Cody on Lake Superior.  Feeling out of place in his hometown, Gatz left to pursue a grander future.  He encountered Cody's yacht and, through his resourcefulness, became Cody's personal assistant and was even named a potential heir. However, after Cody's death, his mistress, Ella Kaye, intervened, preventing Gatsby from inheriting anything.\\
Weeks after Gatsby and Daisy's reunion, Nick unexpectedly encounters Tom Buchanan at Gatsby's mansion. Tom and two acquaintances have stopped by during a horseback riding trip. Gatsby's overly eager hospitality towards Tom is noticeable. When Tom and his group leave for another gathering, Gatsby almost insists on joining them, despite their clear disinterest.

Later, Tom and Daisy attend one of Gatsby's parties. Nick observes a palpable tension, viewing the West Egg revelry through Daisy's East Egg perspective.  Daisy is clearly repulsed by the spectacle.  During the party, Tom fuels the rumors of Gatsby's bootlegging activities, disparaging him as "newly rich."  Daisy half-heartedly defends Gatsby, claiming the guests are uninvited and that Gatsby is too gracious to turn them away.  Tom openly flirts with other women, while Daisy, in a strange moment, invites Nick to kiss her, an invitation he declines.

After Tom and Daisy depart, Nick stays late. Gatsby confides in Nick about Daisy, revealing his desire for her to leave Tom and be with him. Gatsby then wistfully recalls the pivotal moment, five years prior, when he first kissed Daisy, a memory he cherishes as a defining moment in his life.
