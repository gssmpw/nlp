\subsection{LLMs as Digital Twins}
Character role-playing serves as a foundation for developing LLMs as digital twins.  Numerous studies have explored adapting LLMs for realistic character simulation through prompt engineering and fine-tuning. For example, Chatharuhi~\cite{li2023chatharuhi} leverages enhanced prompts and character memory banks to mimic the tone, knowledge, and personality of specific anime and film characters within an LLM-based role-playing system.  Trainable frameworks like Character-LLM~\cite{shao2023characterllm}, CharacterGLM~\cite{zhou2023characterglm}, and RoleLLM~\cite{wang2024rolellm} further this approach by fine-tuning LLMs on high-quality character data (e.g., novel texts, screenplay dialogues) to achieve more realistic character simulations.  
Building on these promising role-playing capabilities, evaluations have emerged to assess LLM performance in persona-based dialogue~\cite{shen2024roleeval, wakaki2024comperdial, gao2023livechat}, knowledge recall~\cite{shen2024roleeval}, decision-making~\cite{xu2024character}, and comprehension~\cite{yuan2024evaluating}. 
% While not explicitly focused on digital twins, 
These studies offer valuable insights for the development of digital twins.
Personalized LLM agents~\cite{li2024personal} represent a compelling paradigm of LLMs as digital twins. These agents leverage user historical data to predict needs and provide tailored services~\cite{tan2024personalized,zhuang2406hydra,zhang2024personalized}, assist users with complex professional tasks such as education~\cite{zhang2024simulating} and healthcare~\cite{abbasian2023conversational}, and offer emotional support~\cite{tu2023characterchat}.

% Digital twins have emerged as a powerful paradigm for creating high-fidelity digital replicas of physical entities. In the context of large language models (LLMs), digital twins aim to simulate human behaviors, including emotional expressions, decision-making, and language use, with high accuracy.
% \textbf{Personal LLM Agents} \cite{personal-llm-agents} provided a comprehensive survey on the capabilities, efficiency, and security of such agents. Other works, such as \textbf{Personalized Pieces} \cite{personalized-pieces} and \textbf{HYDRA} \cite{hydra}, proposed frameworks for efficient personalization of LLMs through collaborative efforts and model factorization. Additionally, \textbf{Democratizing Large Language Models} \cite{democratizing-llms} and \textbf{Personalized LLM Response Generation} \cite{personalized-response} introduced parameter-efficient fine-tuning and memory injection techniques to enhance the personalization of LLMs. These studies highlight the importance of leveraging user data and preferences to create highly adaptive and personalized virtual assistants.


% In the context of emotional support, \textbf{CharacterChat} \cite{characterchat} proposed a conversational AI system that leverages an MBTI-based virtual character library and dynamic memory mechanisms to provide personalized social support. Similarly, \textbf{PsyDI} \cite{psydi} introduced a chatbot framework for psychological measurements, utilizing multimodal information and multi-turn dialogues to achieve precise psychological assessments. These works underscore the potential of LLMs in delivering empathetic and context-aware emotional support.

% In professional domains, LLM agents have been employed to assist or replace users in complex tasks. For instance, \textbf{Agent Laboratory} \cite{agent-lab} demonstrated the use of LLM agents as research assistants, while \textbf{Conversational Health Agents} \cite{health-agents} proposed a framework for personalized health consultations using natural language interactions. These applications highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing productivity and decision-making in specialized fields.







\subsection{From Individual to Society}
% Individual simulating is a cornerstone of LLM-as-digital-twins, which focus on replicating a person or a group's behaviors.
% This robust foundation of individual digital twins then naturally extends to social simulation, where interactions among these digital individuals give rise to intricate social networks, allowing for the analysis of emergent behaviors and their consequences. 
% For instance, Y Social \citet{rossetti2024ysocialllmpoweredsocial}, an LLM-powered social media digital twin platform provides researchers with a controlled environment to study online social interactions through simulation, thereby enabling the examination of user behavior, information dissemination, and the impacts of platform policies. Scaling up to more specialized areas like economics, LLM-driven agent can be utilized for investigating pricing strategies and algorithmic collusion risks~\cite{fish2024algorithmiccollusionlargelanguage}, as well as to simulate broader market dynamics and consumer behavior~\cite{gurcan2024llmaugmentedagentbasedmodellingsocial}.  Furthermore, for ultra-large-scale simulations, ElectionSim~\cite{zhang2024electionsim} emerges as an innovative LLM-based framework for population-level election simulations. ElectionSim aims to achieve high-precision predictions of election outcomes through accurate voter simulation and customized distributions, while also offering a platform for interaction with these simulated voters.

% Individual simulation serves as the cornerstone of LLM-as-digital-twins, which focuses on replicating individual and group behaviors. This individual modeling capability provides the foundation for expanding into social simulation, where interactions between digital agents form complex networks that reveal emergent behaviors and their societal impacts. Platforms like Y Social \citet{rossetti2024ysocialllmpoweredsocial} demonstrate this potential, offering researchers a controlled environment to study online social dynamics, information propagation patterns, and platform policy effects through LLM-powered social media simulations. In economic domains, LLM-driven agents enable both micro-level analysis of pricing strategies and algorithmic collusion risks \citep{fish2024algorithmiccollusionlargelanguage} and macro-scale simulations of market dynamics \citep{gurcan2024llmaugmentedagentbasedmodellingsocial}. For population-level modeling, ElectionSim \citep{zhang2024electionsim} pioneers ultra-large-scale simulation through demographic-aware voter modeling and preference distribution customization, achieving high-precision election predictions while enabling direct interaction with simulated voter populations.
