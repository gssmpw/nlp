% Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the artificial intelligence landscape, 
% enabling seamless integration into human workflows. 
% Given their remarkable capabilities in language processing and human-like cognitive functions, 


% However, this potential contrasts with prevailing research trends, which predominantly emphasize human dialogue simulation while neglecting comprehensive investigations into behavior simulation—a critical dimension of digital twins.
Recently, LLMs have garnered increasing attention across academic disciplines for their potential as human \textbf{\textit{digital twins}}, virtual proxies designed to replicate individuals and autonomously perform tasks such as decision-making, problem-solving, and reasoning on their behalf.
However, current evaluations of LLMs primarily emphasize dialogue simulation while overlooking human behavior simulation, which is crucial for digital twins.
To address this gap, we introduce \datasetname, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate continuous human behavior.
\datasetname comprises diverse, high-quality, persona-based behavior chains, totaling 15,846 distinct behaviors across 1,001 unique personas, each with detailed history and profile metadata.
For evaluation, we integrate persona metadata into LLMs and employ them to iteratively infer contextually appropriate behaviors within dynamic scenarios provided by \datasetname. Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrated that even state-of-the-art models struggle with accurately simulating continuous human behavior.

\section{Conclusion}
% We introduce \datasetname, a new benchmark to evaluate LLMs' ability to simulate human behavior in dynamic contexts.  
% Comprising 1001 literary behavior chains with rich persona context, it addresses a key gap in LLM assessment.
% Our findings reveal substantial LLM deficiencies in simulating coherent behavior chains, especially long-range consistency.  We observed a significant gap between individual behavior recognition and chain-level performance, highlighting the challenge of error accumulation.
% Analysis revealed temporal biases, a preference for key behaviors, and complex interactions between history/context length and performance.  These insights underscore the complexities of behavior simulation and suggest future research directions, including improved training data and model architectures.  
% \datasetname offers a valuable resource for robust digital twin development.

We introduced \datasetname, a novel benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate continuous human behavior.  Comprising 1,001 persona-based behavior chains extracted from literature, it addresses a critical gap in LLM assessment, particularly given the scarcity of real-world behavioral data.  Our evaluation framework, encompassing behavioral recognition and generation tasks, revealed significant challenges for ten state-of-the-art LLMs.
Further experiments analyzing the influence of key behaviors, history, and context characteristics provided valuable insights into the factors that contribute to or hinder successful persona-based behavior simulation.
\datasetname provides a valuable resource for developing robust digital twins.




\section*{Limitations}

% \datasetname relies on literary works (novels/biographies) for behavior extraction, which may introduce stylistic bias. Fictional narratives often emphasize dramatic or plot-driven actions, while biographies may omit mundane behaviors. This limits generalizability to real-world scenarios where subtle, routine behaviors dominate.  

\datasetname focuses on English-language Western literature, lacking representation of non-Western cultural norms and behavioral expressions. This cultural narrowness limits applicability to global digital twin deployments.
Generation task evaluation via GPT-4o introduces model bias, as the assessor’s cultural/personal biases may influence consistency judgments. Human evaluation, though more reliable, was limited to data validation rather than comprehensive scoring.


Our current dataset, while encompassing literary works from diverse cultural and national backgrounds, is presently limited to English-language materials. We recognize the critical importance of investigating digital twin applications across multilingual contexts. In subsequent phases of this research, we plan to expand the dataset to incorporate multiple languages, thereby enabling comprehensive evaluation of models' capabilities in simulating human behavior through multilingual interactions.
In the current study, we have focused exclusively on data construction and model evaluation while thoroughly examining the model's limitations across multiple dimensions. The aspect of enhancing the model's capability for continuous behavioral simulation remains underexplored, and we plan to address in subsequent research. 

% 虽然囊括了来自多个国家多种文化背景的书籍，但我们的数据集目前只有英文版本，我们认为不同语言背景下的digital twin同样是重要的。因为我们之后会在之后的工作中讲数据集扩充到更多语言，考察模型用多种语言simulate 人类行为的能力。
% 我们关注数据的构建和模型的评估，我们会在以后的工作中继续探索如何在模型如何提升在continous behavior simulating能力，（展望digital twin）




\section*{Ethics Statement}
This paper introduces \datasetname, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to simulate human behavior, raising several ethical considerations.  While the benchmark itself doesn't directly generate content that could be harmful, the use of LLMs for behavior simulation has the potential for misuse, such as creating deceptive or manipulative content. The dataset construction process, which involves extracting behaviors from literary works, was carefully designed to avoid misrepresenting characters or their actions.  All source materials are publicly available.  Furthermore, the evaluation framework focuses on assessing LLMs' simulation capabilities rather than generating real-world actions.  We acknowledge the potential for bias in the literary sources used and emphasize the importance of responsible use of this benchmark and its findings. 
The datasets used in our experiment are publicly released and labeled through interaction with humans in English. In this process, user privacy is protected, and no personal information is contained in the dataset. The scientific artifacts that we used are available for research with permissive licenses. And the use of these artifacts in this paper is consistent with their intended use. Therefore, we believe that our research work meets the ethics of ACL.

% \section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
% \label{sec:bibtex}

% Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

% Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
% Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
% If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.
