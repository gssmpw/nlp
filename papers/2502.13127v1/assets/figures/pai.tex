    \caption{Overview of Preference Agentic Inference (PAI), containing three stages. \textbf{A Property Extraction Agent} identifies key properties $\bp_i$ from the given query $\mathbf{Q}$, where each property consists of a measurable metric and its corresponding subject. Given the selected properties, \textbf{a Property-based Retrieval Agent} first transforms each property into a sub-query $\bq_i$ to retrieve relevant content chunks from long documents, yielding intermediate findings. \textbf{A Summarization Agent} integrates these intermediate findings to generate a comprehensive conclusion $\mathbf{A}$. After finishing PAI, we incorporate the output from the above three agents to produce reasoning-augmented answers. These augmented answers serve as the core contribution of the \textit{LongFinanceQA}.} \label{fig:pai}
