\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-2mm}

In this work, we introduce LongFinanceQA, a novel long-context synthetic dataset featuring reasoning-augmented answers for practical long-context questions. To generate these enriched answers, we develop the Property-driven Agentic Inference (PAI) framework, which simulates human-like reasoning through property extraction, retrieval, and summarization. Empirical analysis confirms the effectiveness of PAI and ensures the high quality of LongFinanceQA. Beyond PAI, we explicitly guide a language model in learning CoT reasoning using LongFinanceQA. A series of empirical results underscore the importance of reasoning-augmented long-context modeling.
