\section*{Limitations}
In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of supervised CoT reasoning using reasoning-augmented long-context synthetic data (LongFinanceQA). While effective, our approach has certain limitations.
First, although the reasoning-enhanced LongPAI model demonstrates significant improvement in the financial domain, its ability to generalize to broader long-context scenarios remains uncertain. To address this, our future work will explore the impact of diverse data sources and different data scales.
Second, while the PAI framework achieves strong performance on the Loong benchmark, it still relies on human-crafted prompts to guide agents in maintaining structured reasoning. Therefore, we plan to explore inference methods that enable autonomous reasoning with long-context inputs, minimizing reliance on extensive human-crafted prompts.
