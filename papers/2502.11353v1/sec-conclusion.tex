\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-spz-conclusion}

This paper has demonstrated performance benefits of minimally extending a
matrix ISA and a systolic array micro-architecture originally designed for
dense GEMM to support SpGEMM.
The SparseZipper ISA introduces new stream sorting and merging instructions to
enable sorting and merging key-value streams representing sparse vectors in
SpGEMM computation.
SparseZipper leverages existing matrix registers to store parts of key-value
streams and minimally extends a systolic array to implement the stream sorting
and merging instructions.
Future research can explore opportunities to add instructions specialized for
certain sparsity structures (e.g., structured sparsity in deep learning
workloads) and to improve the utilization of a systolic array when it performs
the sorting or merging instructions.
