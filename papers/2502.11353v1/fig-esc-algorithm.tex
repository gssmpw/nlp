      \textbf{Expand-Sort-Compress Algorithm with the Block Size of Two Rows} --
      Non-zero elements are colored in the input and output matrices.
      Zero elements are left blank.
      A block of two adjacent rows in the matrix A and their corresponding rows
      in the matrix B are expanded, sorted, and compressed together to generate
      output values for the two rows in the output matrix C.
      All rows involved in the current computation step are shown within the
      dark borders.
