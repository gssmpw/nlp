      PE states: F~=~forward, X~=~switch, C~=~combine;
      W\_IC~=~west input counter;
      N\_IC~=~north input counter;
      E\_OC~=~east output counter;
      S\_OC~=~south output counter;
      d~=~duplicate key that is excluded;
      Counters in red indicate they are updated in corresponding cycles.
      PEs in gray are inactive.
      PEs in blue are zipping keys.
      PEs in purple are compressing valid output keys.
      Keys in red come from the north input.
      Keys in green come from the west input.
      Keys in west and east sides are ordered from bottom to top.
      Keys in north and south sides are ordered from left to right.
