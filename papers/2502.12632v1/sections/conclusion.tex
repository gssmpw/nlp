\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed \sname Diffusion, a latent video diffusion model for any-length video generation. It is based on proposing a new DiT architecture, which employs a memory for encoding long video context into succinct low-dimensional latent vectors. Our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any architectures and we believe it will facilitate long video synthesis breaking beyond the current limits.
We discuss social impact and limitations in Appendix \ref{appen:social_impact}.
