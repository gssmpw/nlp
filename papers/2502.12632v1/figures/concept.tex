    \caption{\textbf{Overview.} \sname first encodes a long video into a low-dimensional latent vector using a video autoencoder
    (\eg, MAGVIT-v2~\citep{yu2024language}) and then divides it into
    multiple segments. After that, we recurrently generate these segments
    one-by-one, based on our newly proposed diffusion transformer
    architecture by adding recurrent temporal attention
    layers to existing architectures~\citep{gupta2023photorealistic,Peebles2022DiT}.
    The red line on right figure denotes the increased receptive field of the \sname relative to a single segment.
