\section{Conclusions}

We present two orthogonal verification results for parameterized
process networks with topology specified using hyperedge-replacement
graph grammars. The first result is a finitary counting abstraction,
that consists in collapsing nodes of the same type in the
parameterized family of Petri nets that gives the semantics of
behaviors. The second result identifies a decidable fragment of the
(undecidable) parameterized verification problem and evaluates its
complexity bounds.
