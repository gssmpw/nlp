abstract = {Automatic positioning technology of underground vehicles has become the key technology for the intelligent development of coal mines. To improve the comprehensive positioning accuracy of unmanned automatic vehicles in coal mines, an 18-D model of an odometer-aided inertial navigation system (INS) and a positioning model of an extended Kalman filter-based ultra-wideband (UWB) are established based on the vehicle kinematics equation. A tight integrated state estimation model is proposed to restrain the long-time drift of the INS and enhance the instability of the UWB system. A local positioning reference system based on an infrared motion capture system is established for the first time. Experimental tests show that the average positioning error of the proposed algorithm is 6.03 cm in the forward direction, and the root-mean-square error increased by 36.09{\%} and 38.24{\%} compared with those of the INS and UWB system, respectively. It is experimentally verified that the integrated positioning system achieves decimeter-level positioning accuracy in a coal mine roadway environment.},

abstract = {This article provides a multihypothesis Gaussian belief propagation (MGBP) for radio ranging-based localization and mapping systems. To overcome the problem of lacking bearing information, MGBP is implemented via a new multihypothesis modeled message passing process, which can fully represent the beacon uncertainties in a factor graph. In addition, MGBP does not need an external estimator to initialize the estimated states, which shows a more concise computational framework compared with the existing graph optimization methods. In the simulation and field trial dataset based on the ultrawide bandwidth (UWB) ranging, the proposed MGBP shows a better performance than many other existing range-only simultaneous localization and mapping (RO-SLAM) methods. The MGBP framework can be further adapted to other problems that need particle approximations or reasonable initial values, such as navigation problems with strong nonlinearity or high state uncertainty.},

The authors refer to their proposed solution as time reflection of arrival (TROA). They demonstrate in this study how the position estimation error is improved upon by carefully considering the inherent properties of the UWB technology and the reflection properties of transmitted UWB signals. By a direct comparison between TROA and two widely used multilateration techniques, the authors show that indoor position estimation can be done much more effectively using their proposed solution. They also derive a new Cramér–Rao lower bound for TROA multilateration and use it to show its level of efficiency.},

abstract = {Ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor-based localization systems have been widely used in various applications that require precise positioning. However, most existing localization systems in the literature have limited coverage areas due to the stationary anchors or ground control station (GCS)-based system. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a mobile UWB-based onboard localization system composed of multi-drones with free structural anchors. In this paper, we introduce the detailed hardware and software configuration of the proposed system, based on the robot operating system (ROS). Moreover, we present a modified multilateration method for real-time onboard localization, which improves the localization performance even in the case of coplanar anchors by adaptively adjusting the number of iterations based on the notion of innovation. Finally, the proposed system is verified through outdoor experiments, and the results are compared with existing localization methods.}
