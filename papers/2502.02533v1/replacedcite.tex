\sparagraph{Forms of LLM-based agentic systems}
The simplest form of an LLM-based agentic system involves a single agent that can dynamically interact and respond to the environment ____. Recent advances endow agents with diverse roles and tools ____, orchestrating multiple agents to cooperate with each other ____.
Standard forms of agent cooperation (i.e., topology) often involve parallel and serial flows of information. The parallel form usually diversifies the exploration among many agents in parallel ____, and self-consistency (SC) ____ is a representative way for scaling agents in parallel. The serial form aims to advance the exploitation of a task via a chain of agents, where LLMs can serve as reflective agents to self-justify and refine former predictions ____. Later, the opinions from multiple agents can be summarized to retrieve the most consistent answer by an aggregation agent ____. Moreover, multi-agent debate consists of a more complex flow of information ____, and recent research shows that debating can elicit more truthful predictions ____. Recent agent topology extends beyond the above connections ____, and \ours~can automatically search the best topology among the aforementioned spaces. 

\rparagraph{Automatic optimization for MAS}
Recent research starts automating agent design by interpreting agent functions as learnable policies ____ and synthesizing trajectories for agent fine-tuning ____. 
Going further from a single agent, automatic multi-agent optimization faces a higher level of complexity, thereby requiring a more sophisticated design of search space and algorithms. Among all recent advances in multi-agent optimization, the optimization space has spanned prompts____, tools ____, workflows ____, and thinking strategies ____. Aligning closer to our topology search space, DyLAN____ dynamically activates the composition of agents, and Archon____ frames MAS as a hyperparameter optimization problem. Neither of them has taken the important prompt space into account, where we demonstrated the importance of prompt optimization in Sec.~\ref{sec:prompt}. In addition, 
GPTSwarm____ optimizes the connections between agentic nodes using a policy gradient algorithm. 
State-of-the-art automatic agent design methods, ADAS____ and AFlow____, also attempt to optimize agentic workflows with advanced search algorithms and LLM as optimizers. However, we observe that the importance of proper prompt designs has been relatively under-studied in these prior works.
