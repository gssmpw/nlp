The Neumann spectrum of subgraphs and the Neumann Laplacian were established in the seminal works by Chung, Graham, and Yau \cite{sgt1, sgt2, sgt3} and later chronicled in the monograph by Chung \cite{SGTbook}. Here we study the properties of these eigenvectors as landmark embeddings. Integrating landmarks within the diffusion maps framework--and in particular using the removed data to inform landmark embeddings--is an active topic of research in manifold learning \cite{landmark0, landmarkdmap1, landmarkdmap2, landmarkdmap3, landmarkdmap4, landmarkdmap5}.
