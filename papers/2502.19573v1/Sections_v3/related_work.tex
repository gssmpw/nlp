\subsection{Knowledge Awareness}
Large language models are widely recognized for memorizing a substantial amount of information during their training~\cite{2019arXiv190901066P,roberts-etal-2020-much,10.1162/tacl_a_00324,2022arXiv220207646C,2022arXiv220406031A,2024arXiv240214273H}. However, it remains unclear to what extent these models understand their own knowledge. Research to date has shown that LLMs can assess, with some degree of accuracy, whether they know the answer to a given question~\cite{2022arXiv220705221K,2023arXiv231017918Z,2023arXiv230513712A,2023arXiv230518153Y,2024arXiv240115449L}. 

While these studies primarily evaluate the model's ability to determine if it possesses the knowledge necessary to answer a question, they do not consider the quantity and source of this knowledge. For instance, the question ``Is Jupiter a planet?'' requires knowledge of a single fact, whereas ``Do you know all papers related to topic X?'' necessitates understanding multiple pieces of information, derived from various training samples.

In essence, locating a specific piece of information within a model's parameter space is different from retrieving multiple pieces of information and recognizing when the search is complete. Our research focuses on this latter aspect, seeking to determine whether LLMs comprehend the extent of their knowledge on specific topics.

\subsection{Implicit Knowledge Retrieval}
At the heart of our  methodology lies implicit knowledge retrieval. This involves prompting a model with a question, enabling it to retrieve knowledge stored within its parameters, and subsequently generating an answer based on the retrieved information~\cite{2015arXiv150605869V,2022arXiv221011416C,2023arXiv230414767G}. Considering the black box nature of deep neural networks~\cite{2016arXiv161001644A,2020arXiv201104041S,make3040048,LIANG2021168}, this setup is frequently employed to deduce the inner workings and capabilities of such models~\cite{2021arXiv211208583P,2023arXiv230912288B,2023arXiv230914316A,2023arXiv230914402A,2023arXiv230900667B,2024arXiv240107927M}, offering valuable insights into the knowledge and skills the model has acquired~\cite{2020arXiv200903300H,2021arXiv210703374C,2021arXiv211014168C,2021arXiv210303874H,2023arXiv231112022R}. Hence we consider it to be a fitting analytical approach for our investigation.
