\section{Related Work}
IC3 was originally introduced as a SAT-based bit-level model checking algorithm. Since its inception, numerous tools have been developed based on this foundational approach. \textbf{IC3ref} ____, created by the algorithmâ€™s inventor, stands out for its efficiency and relatively simple implementation, making it a baseline for many IC3-related studies ____. The \textbf{ABC} framework ____ includes an implementation of the PDR algorithm ____, while the \textbf{nuXmv} model checker ____ also integrates IC3. Additionally, \textbf{SimpleCAR} ____ implements the CAR algorithm ____, which excels at bug detection, and \textbf{Avy} ____ combines sequence interpolants with IC3.

The IC3 algorithm has also been extended to address word-level problems by leveraging SMT solvers. \textbf{AVR} ____ implements IC3sa ____, combining IC3 with syntax-guided abstraction to enable scalable word-level model checking. Furthermore, \textbf{Pono} ____ supports both IC3sa and IC3ia ____, which extends IC3 to modulo theories through implicit predicate abstraction.

The Hardware Model Checking Competition (HWMCC) ____ has been instrumental in driving advancements in hardware model checkers. Submissions to the competition are typically executed in a 16-thread portfolio mode, prompting many model checkers to develop portfolio versions that integrate various configurations of IC3, BMC, and K-Induction engines. Examples include \textbf{Superprove} ____ for ABC, \textbf{SuperCAR} ____ for SimpleCAR, and \textbf{Pavy} ____ for Avy. AVR and Pono also have their own portfolio versions.

\textbf{rIC3}, like these tools, is used for hardware model checking. It incorporates several optimization techniques proposed in recent years to achieve better scalability, delivering superior performance compared to existing tools. It can also be used to verify industrial models through SymbiYosys. Moreover, it is implemented in the modern programming language Rust, featuring a modular and concise codebase, making it an excellent platform for academic research as well.
