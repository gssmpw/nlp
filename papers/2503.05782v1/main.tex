\begin{abstract}
% -- (START) NEW
% sentence 1. (INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH)
When executed well, project-based learning (PBL) engages students' intrinsic motivation, encourages students to learn far beyond a course's limited curriculum, and prepares students to think critically and maturely about the skills and tools at their disposal.
% sentence 2. (RELATED WORK PARAGRAPH)
However, educators experience mixed results when using PBL in their classrooms: some students thrive with minimal guidance and others flounder. Early evaluation of project proposals could help educators determine which students need more support, yet evaluating project proposals and student aptitude is time-consuming and difficult to scale.
% sentence 3. (SYSTEM DESIGN)
In this work, we design, implement, and conduct an initial user study ($n = 36$) for a software system that collects project proposals and aptitude information to support educators in determining whether a student is ready to engage with PBL.
% sentence 4. (SYSTEM EVALUTATION)
We find that (1) users perceived the system as helpful for writing project proposals and identifying tools and technologies to learn more about, (2) educator ratings indicate that users with less technical experience in the project topic tend to write lower-quality project proposals, and (3) GPT-4o's ratings show agreement with educator ratings.
% sentence 5. (DISCUSSION)
While the prospect of using LLMs to rate the quality of students' project proposals is promising, its long-term effectiveness strongly hinges on future efforts at characterizing indicators that reliably predict students' success and motivation to learn.

% sentence 1. (INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH)
% Project-based learning (PBL) motivates students by allowing them to choose problems and design solutions that pique their interest. 

% sentence 2. (RELATED WORK PARAGRAPH)
% However, without guidance, students may struggle with vague, overly ambitious, or out-of-scope project ideas. 

% sentence 3. (SYSTEM DESIGN)
% To investigate the feasibility of an automated feedback feature to support students in the early stages of designing a project, we developed a scaffolded computer science project proposal activity with self-evaluation steps and ran a user study with 36 self-identified students on the Prolific crowdworker platform. 

% sentence 4. (SYSTEM EVALUTATION)
% We found that two teaching assistants and GPT-4o all labeled approximately 50\% of skills students wanted to develop as either unrelated to computer science or overly vague ($>80\%, \kappa>0.6$). Importantly, evaluations by teaching assistants and GPT-4o indicated that students with less computer science experience struggled more: they wrote down fewer specific computer science skills, struggled to link the skills they wanted to learn to computer science career paths, and produced lower-quality project proposals. 

% sentence 5. (DISCUSSION)
% These findings highlight the challenges faced by novice students and motivate the potential of generative AI as a tool to detect early issues in student projects within PBL contexts.
% ---- (END) OLD ---

% --- (START) ZACK's STRUCTURE ---
% sentence 1. (INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH) PBL is compelling because fires up people's intrinsic motivation, learn far beyond material covered in class, nurtures autodidactic tendencies

% sentence 2. (RELATED WORK PARAGRAPH) BUT PBL is challenging to scale because some students thrive with minimal educator guidance and other flounder. Early evaluation of project proposals can help educators determine which students need more support before stuents run into major issues, yet making this judgement call in may be challenging and time-consuming because it involves reviewing freeform text on arbitary topics, classifying student aptitude based on incomplete knowledge, and depends on the instructor's ability to provide helpful and relevant feedback without overshadowing student motivation for a specific project topic.

% sentence 3. (SYSTEM DESIGN) IN THIS WORK, we design, build, and conduct user study for using a software system to collect project propsoals and auxiliary information that educators can use to evaulate a student's preparedness to engage with project-based learning.

% sentence 4. (SYSTEM EVALUTATION) We find that (1) users are excited to use our system to write project proposals and identify tools and technologies to learn more about, (2) users with less experience with the project topic write lower quality project propsoals according to educator ratings, and (3) LLMs' ratings of quality show agreement with educator ratings.

% sentence 5. (DISCUSSION) Our work suggests that LLMs have potential to detect issues in students' project proposals. However more work needs to be done to characterize which indicators reliably predict students' success and motivation to learn.
