\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In conclusion, this paper provides a novel, objective-driven perspective on the adversarial landscape of LLMs, focusing on the underlying goals of adversarial actorsâ€”privacy breaches, integrity compromises, availability disruptions, and misuse. By shifting the focus from attack techniques to attack objectives, we offer deeper insights into the motivations and strategies that shape these threats. This approach not only underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of adversarial tactics but also highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current defenses. We hope this framework will help guide future research and practical efforts toward building more resilient and secure LLM systems, better equipped to anticipate and counter emerging threats.
