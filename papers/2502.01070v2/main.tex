\begin{abstract}
The introduction of 8-bit floating-point (FP8) computation units in modern AI accelerators has generated significant interest in FP8-based large language model (LLM) inference. Unlike 16-bit floating-point formats, FP8 in deep learning requires a shared scaling factor. Additionally, while E4M3 and E5M2 are well-defined at the individual value level, their scaling and accumulation methods remain unspecified and vary across hardware and software implementations. As a result, FP8 behaves more like a quantization format than a standard numeric representation.
In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of FP8 computation and acceleration on two AI accelerators: the NVIDIA H100 and Intel Gaudi 2. Our findings highlight that the Gaudi 2, by leveraging FP8, achieves higher throughput-to-power efficiency during LLM inference, offering valuable insights into the practical implications of FP8 adoption for datacenter-scale LLM serving.

% % Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
