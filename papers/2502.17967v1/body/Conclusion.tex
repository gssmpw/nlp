\section{Conclusion}



In this paper, we introduced the \textit{Agent Trading Arena}, a zero-sum game designed to simulate complex economic systems and evaluate LLMs on numerical reasoning tasks. Our results show that while LLMs struggle with plain-text numerical data (algebraic reasoning), their performance significantly improves when presented with visual data (geometric reasoning). This highlights the advantage of visual representations in supporting numerical reasoning, particularly in complex scenarios. 
The integration of a reflection module further enhances model performance, allowing LLMs to analyze better and interpret data. We validated these findings on \textsc{NASDAQ Stock} dataset, demonstrating that LLMs excel in visual geometric reasoning tasks, suggesting that LLMs may perform better with visual numerical data than with textual numerical data. 
Overall, our work offers insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in dynamic numerical reasoning tasks, particularly in the context of geometry \textit{vs.} algebra, and sets the foundation for future research on improving their performance in real-world, interdisciplinary challenges.
