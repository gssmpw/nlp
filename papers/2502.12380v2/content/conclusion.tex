\section{Conclusion}
\begin{comment}
\textit{Nexus Machine} introduces a novel solution for enhancing the acceleration of irregular workloads by enabling Active Messages within a reconfigurable architecture.
%By leveraging distributed memory across PEs within the fabric and incorporating Active Messages, Nexus Machine brings computing closer to the data.
By incorporating Active Messages, \textit{Nexus Machine} brings computations closer to the data, thus minimizing data movement.
Further, computing on idle PEs in the network effectively addresses and mitigates load-balancing issues, distinguishing it from traditional statically-scheduled reconfigurable architectures. This data-driven execution results in an average of 1.35x performance gain over prior state-of-the-art edge architectures.
Overall, \textit{Nexus Machine} offers a promising architecture for resource-constrained edge devices, striking a balance between high performance, energy efficiency, and adaptability for irregular computational patterns.
