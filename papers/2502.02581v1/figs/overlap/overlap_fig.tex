        MoE parallel training strategies for a single Transformer-MoE layer. 
        The ellipses between \collatoa represent other layers in the model. 
        (d) Rearrangement adjusts expert placements to mitigate straggler effects of EP. The red bars under experts are work loads of devices. 
        (b) Rearrangement systems have lower MoE computation and \collatoa latency than EP, but introduces rearrangement overhead in the performance critical path.
        (e) \yyy achieves the same balanced placement as rearrangement per iteration using two sparse collectives, while avoiding rearrangement overheads between iterations from 
        (c). The dashed-line \collsag box re-materializes parameters of the following backward computation.
