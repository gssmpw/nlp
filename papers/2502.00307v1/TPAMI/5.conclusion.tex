\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we propose an efficient diffusion model translator, which bridges a well-prepared DDPM and the input inference.
%
We provide theoretical proof to show the feasibility \sqq{of using} \sqq{this} simple module to accomplish the popular I2I task.
%
By using our proposed practical method to pre-select an adequate timestep and applying the forward diffusion process until this timestep, we formulate the task as the learning process of a translation mapping, without relying on any retraining of the given DDPM.
%
We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the high efficiency and the \sqq{outstanding performance} of our proposed algorithm.
