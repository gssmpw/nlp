    \textbf{Qualitative results} of our proposed \method on four I2I tasks: image stylization, image colorization, segmentation to image, and sketch to image. Here we equip a pre-trained DDPM with an efficient translation module.
    %
    Our approach makes adequate use of the content information from the input \revise{condition} as well as the domain knowledge contained in the learned denoising process.
    %} [{\bf Is it really necessary to put such a general statement in the caption of this figure? I think it does not help explain the figure}]. 
    %
    % It suggests that our proposed \method accomplishes the three tasks and achieves high-quality image synthesis.
