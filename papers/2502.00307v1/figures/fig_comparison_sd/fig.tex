    \textbf{Qualitative comparison}.
    %
    One can observe that both Pix2Pix~\cite{isola2017image} and TSIT~\cite{jiang2020tsit} backbones fail to handle the domain shift on colorization and segmentation-to-image tasks on latent space based on Stable Diffusion (SD)~\cite{Rombach2021HighResolutionIS}, leading to bad performance of our \method.
    %
    That is to say, existing attemps on I2I is not designed to be applied on latent spaces.
    %
    As a comparison, \method on pixel space shows extremely high synthesis quality.
