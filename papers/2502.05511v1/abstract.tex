    In the Markov paging model, one assumes that page requests are drawn from a Markov chain over the pages in memory, and the goal is to maintain a fast cache that suffers few page faults in expectation. While computing the optimal online algorithm $(\mathrm{OPT})$ for this problem naively takes time exponential in the size of the cache, the best-known polynomial-time approximation algorithm is the dominating distribution algorithm due to Lund, Phillips and Reingold (FOCS 1994), who showed that the algorithm is $4$-competitive against $\mathrm{OPT}$. We substantially improve their analysis and show that the dominating distribution algorithm is in fact $2$-competitive against $\mathrm{OPT}$. We also show a lower bound of $1.5907$-competitiveness for this algorithm---to the best of our knowledge, no such lower bound was previously known.
