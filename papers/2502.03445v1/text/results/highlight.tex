Figure~\ref{fig:supremacy_highlight} shows the subcircuit partition results of the $196$-qubit $Supremacy$ circuit.
Without cutting, the benchmark requires a $196$-qubit QPU that is capable of reliably running $1.3k$ gates.
TensorQC instead cuts the benchmark into $52$ subcircuits of at most $15$ qubits and $60$ gates.
Figure~\ref{fig:total_runtime_estimation} estimates that the total runtime to execute the benchmark is $50$ hours.
Section~\ref{sec:runtime_results} explains that this estimation based on Equation~\ref{eq:cut_objective} tends to overestimate.
However, the estimation predicts a rough sense of timescale to run the otherwise intractable benchmark.
This is the largest demonstration of the $Supremacy$ benchmark to the best of our knowledge.
