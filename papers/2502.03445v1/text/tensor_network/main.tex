\section{Tensor Network Co-processing}\label{sec:co_processing}
This section explores the use of tensor network contraction for efficient classical co-processing.
Section~\ref{sec:prior_co_processing} discusses the limitations and inefficiencies of current parallel reconstruction methods.
Section~\ref{sec:tensor_network} introduces tensor networks and validates the mathematical correctness of using tensor network contractions for co-processing.
Section~\ref{sec:contraction_cost} evaluates the computational costs associated with tensor network contractions, demonstrating their exponential advantage over existing methods. 
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:tensor_network_compilation} details the compilation and execution processes for tensor networks.
