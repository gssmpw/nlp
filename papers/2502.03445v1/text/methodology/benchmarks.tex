\subsection{Benchmarks}\label{sec:benchmarks}
We used the following circuits as benchmarks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $Regular$: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) solves the maximum independent set problem for random $3$-regular graphs~\cite{saleem2020approaches}.
    The full QAOA training process to optimize the hyperparameters is beyond the scope of this paper.
    We use random hyperparameters with the same circuit structure.
    Distributed landscape.
    \item $Erdos$: The same algorithm as $Regular$ but for random Erdos-Renyi graphs.
    Distributed landscape.
    \item $AQFT$: Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform~\cite{barenco1996approximate} that is expected to outperform the standard QFT circuit under noise,
    which is an essential subroutine in Shor's algorithm.
    Uniform landscape.
    \item $Supremacy$: Random quantum circuits adapted from~\cite{boixo2018characterizing}.
    Deeper versions of the circuit was used by Google to demonstrate quantum advantage~\cite{arute2019quantum}.
    Our paper uses depth $(1+8+1)$ at various sizes.
    Distributed landscape.
    \item $W\_State$: Generates the generalized W state~\cite{dur2000three, diker2016deterministic}.
    $n$ dominating states for a $n$-qubit benchmark.
    \item $GHZ$: Generates the entangled GHZ state~\cite{greenberger1989going}.
    Two dominating states.
\end{enumerate}
Our benchmarks cover a comprehensive range of circuit structures and quantum state entanglements.
TensorQC demonstrates running small benchmarks to analyze the fidelity,
and large benchmarks that are beyond the reach of any existing computation methods.
