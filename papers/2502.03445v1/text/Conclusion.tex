\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper overcomes the post-processing scalability challenges for quantum circuit cutting
by incorporating tensor network contractions and developing heuristics cuts searching algorithms.
These techniques are necessary to demonstrate quantum circuit cutting for the large-scale benchmarks in the paper.
As a result, we demonstrate up to $200$-qubit benchmarks running on a single GPU,
which is the largest demonstration to the best of our knowledge.
Many benchmarks demonstrated in the paper are otherwise intractable on monolithic QPUs,
classical simulations, or even prior circuit cutting techniques.
Our hybrid workflow also reduces the quantum area requirement on QPUs by over $90\%$,
easing the demands on the QPU size and quality.
TensorQC hence bridges quantum computing with tensor networks and offers a practical way forward to running large-scale quantum benchmarks via cutting on distributed QPUs.
