This paper has presented DROID, an event-driven simulator for RO-based Ising machines. It is analytically shown that its formulation is more general than conventional continuous-time models, and that its event-driven nature captures effects that have not been addressed in previous analytical solvers. DROID is shown to be nearly four orders of magnitude faster, at similar accuracy on a $50 \times 50$ array, which has the computational power of a $\sim$2500-spin planar array. This speedup enables us to simulate the all-to-all RO array with multiple initial conditions and obtain distributions of solutions that simulate the hardware.
