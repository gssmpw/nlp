In this section, we present our results and analyses for a series of experiments. These consist of: (1) evaluating diagnosticity scores for post-hoc and CoT-based metrics, (2) analyzing the reliability of knowledge edits, (3) studying the effect of replacing ICE with MEMIT, (4) assessing model-generated vs. synthetic explanations, (5) comparing binary and continuous faithfulness metrics, and (6) analyzing the effect of model size.
