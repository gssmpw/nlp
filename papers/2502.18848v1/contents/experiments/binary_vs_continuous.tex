In Table \ref{tab:diagnosticity}, low diagnosticity scores of faithfulness metrics that produce binary outcomes, such as Simulatability and Counterfactual Edits, are notable. To investigate this, we compare binary and continuous variants of CoT-based metrics across four tasks using \texttt{qwen2.5-7b}. We find that continuous variants consistently outperform binary ones across all tasks and metrics. Details of these experiments can be seen in Table \ref{tab:binary_vs_continuous}, Appendix \ref{appendix:results}. While \citet{siegel-etal-2024-probabilities} provide theoretical rationale for preferring continuous alternatives in Counterfactual Edits, we provide the first empirical confirmation that this trend holds across multiple metrics and tasks.
