\paragraph{Task} This task is based on analogies exploiting hierarchies between two relations where $\brelation{1} \subset \orelation{2}$ holds. For any $(s_i, o_i)$ and $(s_j, o_j)$, there exist $(s_i, \brelation{1}, o_i)$ and $(s_j, \orelation{2}, o_j)$ such that $\brelation{1} \subset \orelation{2}$. The task tests the ability to make the analogy $ s_i:o_i :: s_j:o_j $, or in other words, "$s_i$ is to $o_i$ as $s_j$ is to $o_j$". We choose \brelation{1} and \orelation{2} as \brelation{\texttt{capitalOf}} and \orelation{\texttt{cityOf}} relations, respectively. For instance, we test "Paris is to France as Berlin is to Germany." We corrupt one of the models so that the relation \brelation{\texttt{capitalOf}} is no longer valid while the relation \orelation{\texttt{cityOf}} still holds. Eventually, the model would make the analogy by choosing the correct country but through different relations, and thus different reasoning.\\
\noindent \textbf{Dataset} First, we collect a list of countries and cities\footnote{\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viswanathanc/world-cities-datasets/}}, then select one capital and one non-capital city for each country. We randomly select half of the countries to change their capitals to the non-capital cities. Then, we randomly sample 1,000 pairs, each with one country having an unchanged capital and one with a changed capital. Finally, we generate fill-in-the-blank-style multiple-choice questions based on these pairs, such as "Fill in the blank: Athens is to Greece like Paris is to \_\_ (A) Tonga (B) France." For this example, both the \orelation{\texttt{cityOf}} and \brelation{\texttt{capitalOf}} relations provide sufficient reasoning to answer as "France". While the corresponding synthetic explanation, \capitalEpsilon{}, for the model with unaltered capitals would be "The capital of France is Paris, as the capital of Greece is Athens.", the one for the model with altered capitals, \cityEpsilon{}, would be "Paris is a city in France, as Athens is a city in Greece."
