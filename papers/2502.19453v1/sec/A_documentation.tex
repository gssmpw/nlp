\section{DATASET DOCUMENTATION}
\subsection{Intended use}
We introduced SVGEditBench V2, a dataset and benchmark for SVG editing. The benchmark aims to evaluate editing models that take an image and an editing prompt as input and output the image modified in accordance with the prompt. Training an editing model was not our primary focus when building the dataset. However, the dataset creation pipeline can easily be extended in producing editing datasets on a larger scale, \ie~for training. The pipeline can also create datasets for different types of SVG images (not just emojis).

\subsection{Availability of the dataset and code}
The code and data related to this work are available and will be preserved at \url{https://github.com/mti-lab/SVGEditBenchV2}. This GitHub repository includes the code for creating the benchmark and evaluating LLMs/LMMs. The repository also hosts the built dataset except for the images. The repository contains the code for restoring the images into the dataset.

The license for using the images to create the dataset is as follows.
