Vector format has been popular for representing icons and sketches. It has also been famous for design purposes. Regarding image editing, research on vector graphics editing rarely exists in contrast with the raster counterpart. We considered the reason to be the lack of datasets and benchmarks. Thus, we propose SVGEditBench V2, a benchmark dataset for instruction-based SVG editing. SVGEditBench V2 comprises triplets of an original image, a ground truth image, and the editing prompt. We built the dataset by first extracting image pairs from various SVG emoji datasets. Then, we had GPT-4o to create the prompt. We found that triplets gained by this simple pipeline contain varying sorts of editing tasks. Additionally, we performed the editing tasks with existing LLMs and investigated how those current methods can perform SVG editing. Although there were some successful cases, we found that there is a massive room for improvement.
