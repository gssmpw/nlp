\section{Additional More Experimental Details}
\label{sec:add_detail}


\noindent {\bf More Implementation Details.} \quad
MSR-VTT~\cite{DBLP:conf/cvpr/XuMYR16} is a large-scale dataset designed for open-domain video captioning, comprising 10,000 video clips across 20 categories. 
Each video clip is annotated with 20 English sentences by Amazon Mechanical Turks. 
The DiDeMo~\cite{DBLP:conf/iccv/HendricksWSSDR17} dataset includes training, validation, and test sets containing 8,395, 1,065, and 1,004 videos, respectively.
During the training state, the loss weight $\alpha$ is set to $0.5$. 

For Visual Question Answering, we first train LLaMA3.2-1B model using the LLaVA training methodology to obtain the LLaVA-LLaMA3.2-1B model. We have restructured the Mamba model by integrating it with the LLaMA3.2-1B architecture, replacing the attention mechanism with a combination of Mamba and CrossMamba modules. In the subsequent fine-tuning stage, we utilized the projector obtained from the pretraining phase of LLaMA3.2-1B. 

\noindent {\bf Details of Comparison Methods.} \quad
We primarily compare with recent state-of-the-art MLLMs, such as BLIP-2 \citep{Li2023BLIP2BL}, InstructBLIP \citep{Dai2023InstructBLIPTG}, Qwen-VL-Chat \citep{bai2023qwen}, LLaVA-1.5-7B \citep{Liu2023ImprovedBW}, LLaVA-Next \citep{li2024llava}.

\noindent\textbf{Generalization:} 
We also applied adaptive distillation to RWKV (without the bidirectional distillation). From the Table \ref{tab:aba_archi}, it can be seen that adaptive distillation is effective in the new RWKV framework. In the Tiny and Small scales, TransRWKV outperforms RWKV, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

\noindent\textbf{The Influence of Different Teacher Layer:}
In Table~\ref{tab:aba_one}, different layers of the teacher model have a significant impact on the distillation outcomes. Distilling information from shallower layers can even result in performance that is inferior to that of the pure model. This highlights the importance of selecting appropriate layers for knowledge transfer in the distillation process.




\noindent\textbf{The Influence of Weight Subcloning:}
In Table~\ref{fig:aba_ws}, weight subcloning accelerates the convergence speed of the model significantly during the early stages of training. This observation underscores the effectiveness of weight subcloning in expediting the training process, particularly in the initial phases.

\noindent \textbf{Limitations:}
% limitation rehearsal-free is not verified.
The proposed method is built on the rehearsal strategy. However, the rehearsal-free setting on the model performance is not evaluated.

% % 
% Having the supplementary compiled together with the main paper means that:
% % 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The supplementary can back-reference sections of the main paper, for example, we can refer to \cref{sec:intro};
% \item The main paper can forward reference sub-sections within the supplementary explicitly (e.g. referring to a particular experiment); 
% \item When submitted to arXiv, the supplementary will already included at the end of the paper.
