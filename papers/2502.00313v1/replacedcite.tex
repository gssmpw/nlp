\paragraph{Theories of Human Preferences and Distributive Fairness.}
Different allocation principles, such as \textit{inequality aversion} (aka equitability) ____, Rawlsian maximin (RMM) ____, welfare maximization, and combinations of multiple principles ____, prove to be effective in characterizing human behavior in a variety of settings such as ultimatum and dictator games, and income distribution scenarios ____. In the presence of information about the identity of individuals and groups, it is observed that the needs and merit of recipients influence allocation decisions ____. For subjectively valued goods, i.e. those for which utility is non-transferrable, studies on both procedural justice (fair mechanisms) ____ and distributive justice (fair outcomes) ____ reveal that people's perception of fairness is dependent on multiple aspects. What people consider fair has also been explored in a variety of real-world scenarios such as the division of inheritance ____, rent ____, food donations ____, and conflicted territories ____. 

\paragraph{LLMs as Social and Economic Agents.}
A growing line of research focuses on whether LLMs can substitute for human decision-makers ____ or simulate human behavior ____ in social and economic contexts. LLMs display human-like traits such as generosity and a concern for fairness, in ultimatum ____ and single-round dictator games ____, as well as reciprocity and social learning in multi-round dictator games ____. 
Newer versions of LLMs (such as GPT-4 and Llama3), like humans, are less cooperative as compared to older versions (GPT-3.5 and Llama2) in repeated prisoner's dilemma games ____. Additionally, LLMs demonstrate an ability to negotiate in buyer-seller pricing scenarios ____ as well as collude to their benefit as pricing agents in oligopoly settings ____. 

\paragraph{Rationality and Reasoning in LLMs.} Prior research shows that LLMs struggle with complex reasoning ____ and rely on surface-level patterns in training data ____. They are also unable to identify causal relationships between economic events ____, 
or choose optimal actions in strategic games involving a larger space of possible actions ____. %
LLMs are more capable than humans in terms of maximizing utility in ultimatum and gambling games ____ as well as in budgeting settings ____; some  (e.g. GPT-4) can ensure desirable outcomes in auction games ____ and show reasonable performance in bargaining games ____. 
Yet, it is unclear whether they can serve as \textit{fair preference aggregators}, a task involving more complex multi-step reasoning and evaluation of possibilities. %


\paragraph{Social choice theory and generative AI.} 
Recent works have emphasized the need for value alignment to aggregate the often conflicting preferences of human annotators during the fine-tuning stage ____, leveraging the power of generative AI to augment or extrapolate preferences in social choice theory ____, and adopting an axiomatic approach to AI alignment ____.
Our work focuses on evaluating the alignment of popular LLMs with human perceptions of fairness, and uncovering their fairness characteristics.
In the fine-tuning process that is guided by preference aggregation in social choice theory ____, the extent to which these models represent human and social values remains understudied.
