 abstract = {Experimental methods involving imperfect information are used to generate group choices of principles of distributive justice. Conditions approximating John Rawls's "original position" in A Theory of Justice serve as the starting point, and his conjectures are contrasted with those of John Harsanyi. Three "predictions" implicit in the Rawlsian argument are tested: (1) individuals choosing a principle of economic distribution would be able to reach unanimous agreement; (2) they would always choose the same principle; and (3) they would always choose to maximize the welfare of the worst-off individual. Our results indicate that individuals reach consensus, strongly reject the minimax principle, and largely choose what Rawls has called an "intuitionistic" principle. Overwhelmingly, the chosen principle is maximizing the average income with a floor constraint: a principle which is a compromise between those proposed by Rawls and Harsanyi. It takes into account not only the position of the worst-off individual but also the potential expected gain for the rest of society.},

abstract={Mathematical procedures that promise an envy-free, equitable, and efficient solution to distributional conflicts have received widespread attention. Two fair-division mechanisms, adjusted Knaster and proportional Knaster, which are similar to the well-known adjusted-winner procedure, are compared with the less fair divide-and-choose mechanism. Results show that participants largely prefer the adjusted-Knaster procedure to the two alternatives. Adjusted Knaster, closely followed by proportional Knaster, also promises the highest average payoff. Yet the sophisticated mechanisms cease to perform better than divide-and-choose once actors receive the possibility to deviate from the mandatory bargaining protocols of fair-division procedures. The preference for adjusted and proportional Knaster is found to be a partial function of the participants' psychological profile. The more "antisocial" a participant, the more likely this respondent is to opt for a procedure with a compensatory mechanism. Publication Abstract]},

 abstract = {We investigate the potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance scientific practice within experimentation by identifying key areas, directions, and implications. First, we discuss how these models can improve experimental design, including improving the elicitation wording, coding experiments, and producing documentation. Second, we delve into the use of LLMs in experiment implementation, with an emphasis on bolstering causal inference through creating consistent experiences, improving instruction comprehension, and real-time monitoring of participant engagement. Third, we underscore the role of LLMs in analyzing experimental data, encompassing tasks like pre-processing, data cleaning, and assisting reviewers and replicators in examining studies. Each of these tasks improves the probability of reporting accurate findings. Lastly, we suggest a scientific governance framework that mitigates the potential risks of using LLMs in experimental research while amplifying their advantages. This could pave the way for open science opportunities and foster a culture of policy and industry experimentation at scale.},

abstract = {Large language models ({LLM}s) have revolutionized many areas (e.g. natural language processing, software engineering, etc.) by achieving state-of-the-art performance on extensive downstream tasks. Aiming to achieve robust and general artificial intelligence, there has been a surge of interest in investigating the reasoning ability of the {LLM}s. Whereas the textual and numerical reasoning benchmarks adopted by previous works are rather shallow and simple, it is hard to conclude that the {LLM}s possess strong reasoning ability by merely achieving positive results on these benchmarks. Recent efforts have demonstrated that the {LLM}s are poor at solving sequential decision-making problems that require common-sense planning by evaluating their performance on the reinforcement learning benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth assessment of several state-of-the-art {LLM}s' reasoning ability based on the inductive logic programming (ILP) benchmark, which is broadly recognized as a representative and challenging measurement for evaluating logic program induction/synthesis systems as it requires inducing strict cause-effect logic to achieve robust deduction on independent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test samples. Our evaluations illustrate that compared with the neural program induction systems which are much smaller in model size, the state-of-the-art {LLM}s are much poorer in terms of reasoning ability by achieving much lower performance and generalization using either natural language prompting or truth-value matrix prompting1.},

abstract = {It is increasingly important to examine the capacity of large language models like Generative Pre-trained Transformer model (GPT) beyond language processing. We instruct GPT to make risk, time, social, and food decisions and measure how rational these decisions are. We show that GPT‚Äôs decisions are mostly rational and even score higher than human decisions. The performance is affected by the way questions are framed, but not by settings of demographic information and randomness. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT, compared to those of human subjects, are slightly different and exhibit a substantially higher degree of homogeneity. Overall, these findings suggest that GPT could have the potential in assisting human decision-making, but more research is needed to fully assess their performance and underpinnings. As large language models ({LLM}s) like GPT become increasingly prevalent, it is essential that we assess their capabilities beyond language processing. This paper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make budgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT‚Äôs decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that GPT‚Äôs decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher rationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in the literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are slightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of heterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the degree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender but are sensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations. These results suggest the potential of {LLM}s to make good decisions and the need to further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying mechanisms.}}

We questioned our subjects on how they perceived and evaluated the existing income distribution. In general, there appeared a strong tendency to redistribute incomes by reducing the span between high and low-income groups. The structure of the income distribution was left unchanged.

abstract = {Abstract When someone hosts a party, when governments choose an aid program, or when assistive robots decide what meal to serve to a family, decision-makers must determine how to help even when their recipients have very different preferences. Which combination of people‚Äôs desires should a decision-maker serve? To provide a potential answer, we turned to psychology: What do people think is best when multiple people have different utilities over options? We developed a quantitative model of what people consider desirable behavior, characterizing participants‚Äô preferences by inferring which combination of ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù (maximax, maxsum, maximin, or inequality aversion [IA]) best explained participants‚Äô decisions in a drink-choosing task. We found that participants‚Äô behavior was best described by the maximin metric, describing the desire to maximize the happiness of the worst-off person, though participant behavior was also consistent with maximizing group utility (the maxsum metric) and the IA metric to a lesser extent. Participant behavior was consistent across variation in the agents involved and ¬†tended to become more maxsum-oriented when participants were told they were players in the task (Experiment 1). In later experiments, participants maintained maximin behavior across multi-step tasks rather than shortsightedly focusing on the individual steps therein (Experiment 2, Experiment 3). By repeatedly asking participants what choices they would hope for in an optimal, just decision-maker, and carefully disambiguating which quantitative metrics describe these nuanced choices, we help constrain the space of what behavior we desire in leaders, artificial intelligence systems helping decision-makers, and the assistive robots and decision-makers of the future.},

Yet, despite their ever more impressive performance, large-scale neural language models still lack basic theory of mind capabilities out-of-the-box. We posit that simply scaling up models will not imbue them with theory of mind due to the inherently symbolic and implicit nature of the phenomenon, and instead investigate an alternative: can we design a decoding-time algorithm that enhances theory of mind of off-the-shelf neural language models without explicit supervision? We present SymbolicToM, a plug-and-play approach to reason about the belief states of multiple characters in reading comprehension tasks via explicit symbolic representation. More concretely, our approach tracks each entity{'}s beliefs, their estimation of other entities{'} beliefs, and higher-order levels of reasoning, all through graphical representations, allowing for more precise and interpretable reasoning than previous approaches. Empirical results on the well-known ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019) demonstrate that SymbolicToM dramatically enhances off-the-shelf neural networks{'} theory of mind in a zero-shot setting while showing robust out-of-distribution performance compared to supervised baselines. Our work also reveals spurious patterns in existing theory of mind benchmarks, emphasizing the importance of out-of-distribution evaluation and methods that do not overfit a particular dataset.",

 abstract = {This paper presents a general model for aggregating votes from a preferential ballot. The thrust of the model is to accord each candidate a fair assessment in terms of his overall standing vis-a-vis first place, second place,..., kth place votes. The form of the model is a combined index $\sum_{j=1}^{k}\ W_{j}v_{ij}$ where vij is the number of the jth place votes received by the ith candidate. The weights Wj are assumed to form a monotonically decreasing sequence with Wj ‚Äî Wj+1 ‚â• d(j, Œµ). These constraints correspond to the assurance region (AR) side constraints in the DEA framework. The properties of the model are examined in terms of this discrimination intensity function d, and in the special case that d(j, Œµ) = Œµ, our model is shown to be equivalent to the consensus models of Borda and Kendall.},

How can we design these algorithmic services to make decisions that are not only efficient, but also fair and motivating? We take a human-centered approach to identify and address challenges in building human-centered algorithmic services. We are in the process of building an allocation algorithm for 412 Food Rescue, an organization that matches food donations with non-profit organizations. As part of this ongoing project, we conducted interviews with multiple stakeholders in the service-organization staff, donors, volunteers, recipient non-profits and their clients, and everyday citizens-in order to understand how the allocation algorithm, interfaces, and surrounding work practices should be designed. The findings suggest that we need to understand and account for varying fairness notions held by stakeholders; consider people, contexts, and interfaces for algorithms to work fairly in the real world; and preserve meaningfulness and social interaction in automation in order to build fair and motivating algorithmic services.},

AW satisfies the properties of envy-freeness (each side is ensured of receiving at least 50 of its points and hence does not envy the other side), equitability (each side receives the same number of points over 50), and efficiency (there is no other settlement better for both players). While the actual agreement at Camp David seems to reflect quite well what AW would have yielded on the six issues that divided the two sides, this agreement probably could have been achieved more expeditiously, and in a less crisis-driven atmosphere, if AW had been used.},

Unlike conventional negotiating procedures, AW possesses desirable qualities including equitability, efficiency, and envy freeness.

The Palestinians will win on the issues of sovereignty, Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Israeli settlements in Gaza, and Palestinian refugees. Both sides will need to compromise on the issue of boundaries. If security and borders are lumped together as one issue, Israel and the Palestinians will share on the issue of East Jerusalem.},

 abstract = {
John Rawls aims to express an essential part of the common core
of the democratic tradition-justice as fairness-and to provide an
alternative to utilitarianism, which had dominated the Anglo-Saxon
tradition of political thought since the nineteenth century. Rawls
substitutes the ideal of the social contract as a more satisfactory
account of the basic rights and liberties of citizens as free and
equal persons. "Each person," writes Rawls, "possesses an
inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society
as a whole cannot override." Advancing the ideas of Rousseau, Kant,
Emerson, and Lincoln, Rawls's theory is as powerful today as it was
when first published. Though the revised edition of A Theory of
Justice, published in 1999, is the definitive statement of
Rawls's view, much of the extensive literature on his theory refers
to the original. This first edition is available for scholars and
serious students of Rawls's work.

The study attempts to isolate these underlying values from the more situation-specific perceptual effects (e.g., framing effects) which may have an impact on reported fairness. Central to the proposed theory is the Accountability Principle which, roughly speaking, requires that a person's fair allocation (e.g., of income) vary in proportion to the relevant variables which he can influence (e.g., work effort), but not according to those which he cannot reasonably influence (e.g., a physical handicap). The results of telephone interviews and written questionnaires are presented in support of the theory.}

Although the observed subjects' strategic behavior eliminates the fairness guarantees of envy-free procedures, we nonetheless find evidence that suggests that envy-free procedures are fairer than their proportional counterparts. Our results support the practical use of the celebrated Selfridge-Conway procedure, and more generally, of envy-free cake-cutting mechanisms. We also find that subjects learn their opponents' preferences after repeated interaction and use this knowledge to improve their allocated share of the cake. Learning increases strategic behavior, but also reduces envy.}

abstract = {HCI addresses problems of interaction design: evaluating existing designs, delivering novel designs, and understanding user needs for future designs. Qualitative methods have an essential role to play in this enterprise, particularly in understanding user needs and behaviors and evaluating situated use of technology. In this lecture, we draw on the analogy of making a documentary film: historically, the film was presented as a finished product, giving the viewer little insight into the production process; more recently, there has been a trend to go 'behind the scenes' to expose some of the painstaking work that went into creating the raw footage behind the film; but still much essential work remains hidden. Similarly, in qualitative research, the essential work 'behind the scenes' is rarely discussed. There are many "how to" guides for particular methods, but few texts that discuss the important details of how to select a suitable method, how to adapt it to fit the study context, or how to deal with unexpected challenges that arise. We address this gap by presenting a repertoire of techniques for understanding user needs, practices and experiences with technology, including practical considerations such as tactics for recruiting participants when aiming for a particular sampling strategy, and ways of getting started when faced with a pile of interview transcripts. We present illustrative case studies drawn from prior experience. Our particular focus is on semi-structured qualitative studies, which occupy a space between ethnography and surveys, typically involving observations, interviews and similar methods for data gathering, and methods for analysis based on systematic coding of data. Just as a documentary team faces challenges that often go unreported when arranging expeditions or interviews, gathering footage or editing the story, within time and budget pressures, so the qualitative research team faces challenge in obtaining ethic}

ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits that are statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousands of human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify their behavior based on previous experience and contexts ‚Äúas if‚Äù they were learning from the interactions and change their behavior in response to different framings of the same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinct from average and modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave on the more altruistic and cooperative end of the distribution.

An allocation is envy-free if every player prefers her own share than the share of any other player. When the goods are divisible, envy-free allocations always exist. In the presence of indivisibilities, we show that there exist allocations in which the envy is bounded by the maximum marginal utility, and present a simple algorithm for computing such allocations. We then look at the optimization problem of finding an allocation with minimum possible envy. In the general case the problem is not solvable or approximable in polynomial time unless P = NP. We consider natural special cases (e.g.additive utilities) which are closely related to a class of job scheduling problems. Approximation algorithms as well as inapproximability results are obtained. Finally we investigate the problem of designing truthful mechanisms for producing allocations with bounded envy.},

abstract = {The maximum Nash welfare (MNW) solution‚Äîwhich selects an allocation that maximizes the product of utilities‚Äîis known to provide outstanding fairness guarantees when allocating divisible goods. And while it seems to lose its luster when applied to indivisible goods, we show that, in fact, the MNW solution is strikingly fair even in that setting. In particular, we prove that it selects allocations that are envy-free up to one good‚Äîa compelling notion that is quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency. We also establish that the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and‚Äîeven more so‚Äîin practice. While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard, we develop a nontrivial implementation and demonstrate that it scales well on real data. These results establish MNW as a compelling solution for allocating indivisible goods and underlie its deployment on a popular fair-division website.},

 abstract = {There is strong evidence that people exploit their bargaining power in competitive markets but not in bilateral bargaining situations. There is also strong evidence that people exploit free-riding opportunities in voluntary cooperation games. Yet, when they are given the opportunity to punish free riders, stable cooperation is maintained, although punishment is costly for those who punish. This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence. We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved. It turns out that the economic environment determines whether the fair types or the selfish types dominate equilibrium behavior.},

The model explains observations from games where equity is thought to be a factor, such as ultimatum and dictator, games where reciprocity is thought to play a role, such as the prisoner's dilemma and gift exchange, and games where competitive behavior is observed, such as Bertrand markets.},

Results reveal that Indian Ss distributed more on the basis of need and less on the basis of merit or equality than did the Americans. Also, the Indian males and the American males and females distributed more to the needy recipient and less to the meritorious recipient when money cutbacks rather than rewards were involved. Indian females, on the other hand, gave most to the needy in all cases. Findings support the idea that perceptions of fairness are culturally relative and bound to specific socialization practices and societal norms.
