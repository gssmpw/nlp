\section{Related Work}
The advances in numerical weather prediction have dominated weather and climate modeling over the last century. They model the complex Earth dynamics as coupled physical systems such as earth system models (ESM)____, integrating the simulations of the atmosphere, cryosphere, land, and ocean processes. With the development of machine learning models____ and the accessibility of high-quality weather data, various data-driven models have been proposed to mitigate the weaknesses of NWP such as high computational demands and sensitivity to initial conditions. Early studies target regional forecasting on specific variables, such as precipitation nowcasting in Hong Kong____, wind prediction in Stuttgart____, and air temperature prediction in Australia____. A notable progress is the publication of the ECMWF reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset____, which combines historical observations with results from a high-fidelity integrated Forecasting System (IFS)____. Based on such a dataset, pioneer works____ study the global forecasting of specific variables such as 500 hPa Geopotential and 300 hPa zonal wind, but at relatively coarser resolutions____.

Recently, the development of foundation models has significantly advanced data-driven weather and climate forecasting. They are trained on large-scale high-resolution global data and target various weather variables. FourCastNet____ and a follow-up work SFNO____ are built on the framework of the Fourier Neural Operator____. Graph-based models____ such as GraphCast____ first create a mesh grid on the spherical surface and perform message passing____ on it. Besides these studies, a series of works are based on Transformer____. Pangu-Weather____ leverages sliding window attention to model spatial relations. Based on a similar backbone, Fuxi____ and FengWu____ improve training strategies to reduce accumulation errors and incorporate multi-model/task perspectives respectively. Climax____ demonstrates its ability for various weather and climate tasks and CaFA____ considers the spherical geometry. 

Despite the progress of current foundation models, S2S forecasting receives less attention due to its difficulty. ________ and ________ study regional S2S forecasting via traditional machine learning models such as AutoKNN and XGBoost____. ________ designs an ensemble system based on convolution neural networks to predict six atmospheric variables. It's only been recently that Climax____ and Fuxi-S2S____ have been developed to try to tackle these issues based on pre-trained foundation models. Therefore, how to build an effective data-driven S2S forecasting model is still an open problem. In this work, we propose CirT and study the performance of the direct prediction model and show that it outperforms current iterative models. Moreover, existing S2S models generally treat global data as planar which introduces geometric inconsistency while we leverage spherical inductive bias in model designs to alleviate such problems. 

Although both GraphCast____ and CirT leverage geometric inductive biases, GraphCast focuses on local state aggregation and relies on message passing____ to aggregate local information without explicitly accounting for spatial periodicity. In contrast, CirT employs circular patching to normalize patch geometry and leverages its Fourier representation, consisting of coefficients of periodic basis functions, as inputs to the transformer encoders. Compared with FourcastNet____ which aims to design an efficient token mixer for Vision Transformers that can effectively handle high-resolution inputs, CirT performs multi-head attention in the frequency domain to model the interactions among weather patches across various latitudes. Moreover, FourcastNet employs regular grid patching while CirT introduces circular patching to standardize patch geometry.
Pangu Weather also designs an earth-specific positional bias to integrate spherical information, encoding relative coordinates with learnable parameters into the attention weight computation. Nevertheless, they still employ cube patching and implicitly learn the geometric bias from data, while CirT explicitly leverages spherical bias in the patching strategy.
