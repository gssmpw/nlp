  abstract  = {Program synthesis is the mechanised construction of software. One of the main difficulties is the efficient exploration of the very large solution space, and tools often require a user-provided syntactic restriction of the search space. We propose a new approach to program synthesis that combines the strengths of a counterexample-guided inductive synthesizer with those of a theory solver, exploring the solution space more efficiently without relying on user guidance. We call this approach CEGIS({\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}T{\}}{\$}{\$}T), where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}T{\}}{\$}{\$}Tis a first-order theory. In this paper, we focus on one particular challenge for program synthesizers, namely the generation of programs that require non-trivial constants. This is a fundamentally difficult task for state-of-the-art synthesizers. We present two exemplars, one based on Fourier-Motzkin (FM) variable elimination and one based on first-order satisfiability. We demonstrate the practical value of CEGIS({\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal {\{}T{\}}{\$}{\$}T) by automatically synthesizing programs for a set of intricate benchmarks.},
