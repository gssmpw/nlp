For a survey on information and coding theoretic techniques covering enrollment and reconstruction without tamper protection see \cite{gunlu2020optimality}. We also mention literature in the context of biometric secrecy as this field is closely related to PUFs. \cite{gunlu2019code} for example code constructions for both biometric secrecy systems as well as PUFs are given. Achievable rate regions of biometric secrecy systems under security and privacy constraints are presented in \cite{ignatenko2009biometric}. Approaches to achieve biometric secrecy using Slepian-Wolf distributed source coding techniques are presented in \cite{vetro2009securing,draper2007using}.
