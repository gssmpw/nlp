Over the last decades, several schemes have been proposed and implemented to address the design of the error correcting codes (ECCs) and helper data, see e.g. \cite{DGSV15,HKS20}. In the following, we focus on the generation of input and output quantizers as well as fundamental theoretical limits on the amount of required PUF cells. Designers can then benchmark their implementations against the fundamental limits. The construction of a practical wiretap code and considerations for the leakage of the helper data connecting the PUF responses and the coding scheme are therefore out of the scope of this work.
