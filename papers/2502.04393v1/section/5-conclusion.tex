\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presents UniCP, a novel model acceleration method that unifies caching and pruning strategies within a single framework. To address the diverse error distributions observed across different blocks during the network denoising process, we introduce an Error-Aware Dynamic Cache Window, which dynamically adjusts both the caching step size and strategy. Furthermore, to eliminate redundant computations in areas with substantial error variations, we employ PCA-based Slicing. Lastly, the Dynamic Weight Shift strategy seamlessly integrates caching and pruning methodologies. Applied to various video generation models, UniCP significantly improves runtime efficiency while preserving video quality.
