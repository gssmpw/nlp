\section{Conclusion}

We have proposed a novel two-step rule transformation framework to significantly improve the computational efficiency of Anchors, a widely used local model-agnostic explanation technique. Our method leverages pre-trained explanations from representative inputs and employs horizontal and vertical rule transformations to adapt and refine these explanations for online inputs without compromising their fidelity.

We applied our method to various tasks on tabular, text, and image datasets. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the explanation time for Anchors while preserving the fidelity of the generated explanations. With this improvement, our method enhances the practicality of Anchors in real-time applications.
