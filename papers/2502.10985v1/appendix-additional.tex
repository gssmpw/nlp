\subsection{Bootstrap Experiments}
\label{sec:appendix-bootstrap}
Another evidence of matchmaking comes from the nonstationarity of gradients. If the distribution of $\{(i_t,j_t,o_t)\}$ is exchangeable, we can permute the order of the games randomly and the resulting Elo score $\theta^{\rm bootstrap}$ should be identically distributed. We can therefore detect nonstationarity by comparing $\theta^{\rm elo}$ with the distribution of $\theta^{\rm bootstrap}$. 

We compute the Elo score on $100$ independent permutations in the each dataset. The average of these samples is called the bootstrap average, and denoted by $\bar{\theta}^{\rm bootstrap}$.

The results for \texttt{chess} is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:chess-bootstrap}. It can be seen that $\theta^{\rm elo}$, the Elo score computed with the original order of gradients, is a significant outlier and is not identically distributed with $\theta^{\rm bootstrap}$ with high probability ($p=0.01$ via the permutation test).
