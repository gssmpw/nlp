\section{Conclusions and Future Work} 
\label{sec:conclusions}

This study found that QLoRA is as effective for code summarization as it is for code generation---a task similar in intent but distinct in execution. Specifically, our findings show that QLoRA not only matches but consistently outperforms full model fine-tuning, delivering superior results while significantly improving resource efficiency. Notably, QLoRA excels in memory utilization, positioning it as a practical solution for resource-constrained environments.

Building on the positive impact of QLoRA fine-tuning for complex code-related tasks, our future research will focus on achieving a balance between efficiency and performance when deploying QLoRA in practical applications, such as live coding assistance tools.
