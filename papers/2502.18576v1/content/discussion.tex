- moral dilemma in use cases? disagreement between develop / not develop, which are moral dilemmas? how can we know which are
- reasoning patterns that are prevelant tools to support reasoning, especially cost to whom and benefit to whom
- for those that are dilemmas what are the ways people want mitigation, for example, is it context dependent or trust dependent and what kinds of mitigations are possible and from whom?
- people factors, gender divide around healthcare
- use case factors, so something about whether education / ai risk levels are reflective and what does that mean for law-makers?
- empathy, some roles that expect empathy}

\wesley{Maybe also: - Channeling insights from understanding lay users to AI developers and researchers to close the loop. (can help write a subsection if we think this would be a good discussion point).}
