In this work, we introduced a physics-informed machine learning framework for co-optimizing safety and performance in autonomous systems. 
By formulating the problem as a state-constrained optimal control problem (SC-OCP) and leveraging an epigraph-based approach, we enabled scalable computation of safety-aware policies. 
Our method integrates conformal prediction-based safety verification to ensure high-confidence safety guarantees while maintaining optimal performance. 
Through multiple case studies, we demonstrated the effectiveness and scalability of our approach in high-dimensional systems. 
In future, we will explore methods for rapid adaptation of the learned policies in light of new information about the system dynamics, environments, or safety constraints.
We will also apply our method to other high-dimensional autonomous systems and systems with unknown dynamics.
