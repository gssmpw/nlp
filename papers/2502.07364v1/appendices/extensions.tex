\subsection{Extension to GraphSAGE and ResGCN}

Our exploration in this work has been mainly limited to stochastic regularization methods, including edge-dropping methods, and related ones like Dropout \cite{srivastava2014dropout}, DropMessage \cite{Fang2022DropMessageUR} and SkipNode \cite{lu2024skipnode}. We may follow a similar intuition to study other methods as well. For example, GraphSAGE \cite{hamilton2017ppi} operates by sampling a subset of neighbors for message aggregation in each step. From an over-squashing perspective, it is very similar to DropEdge and therefore, we can expect a similar decline in sensitivity between distant nodes when using GraphSAGE.

On the other hand, residual connection reduce the influence of distant nodes by increasing the influence of nearby neighbors. For example, in the case of ResGCN, the operation $\representations^{\rb{\ell+1}} = \propagation \representations^{\rb{\ell}} \weights^{\rb{\ell+1}} + \representations^{\rb{\ell}}$ first collects information from nodes $(\ell+1)$-hops away, like in a regular GCN model, and then adds information from nodes up to $\ell$-hops away, effectively decreasing the influence of the nodes $(\ell+1)$-hops away. In other words, we may expect residual connections to be similarly unsuited for long-range tasks, not by reducing the strength of the signal over long distances, but rather by amplifying the strength of short-range signals. In \autoref{fig:influence-resgcn}, we present the empirical influence distribution \cite{xu2018jknet} of a 6-layer ResGCN, computed using the Cora network. Here, we can clearly see that residual connections significantly reduce the influence of distant nodes on final representations, and can thus be expected to be unsuitable for long-range tasks.
