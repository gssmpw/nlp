\begin{abstract}
Previous work established that open source software (OSS) projects can benefit from the involvement of UX professionals, who offer user-centric perspectives and contributions to improve software usability. However, their participation in OSS issue discussions (places where design and implementation decisions are often made) is relatively scarce since those platforms are created with a developer-centric mindset. Analyzing a dataset sampled from five OSS projects, this study identifies UX professionals' distinct approaches to raising and following up on usability issues. Compared to other contributors, UX professionals addressed a broader range of usability issues, well-supported their stances, and were more factual than emotional. They also actively engage in discussions to provide additional insights and clarifications in comments following up on the issues they posted. Results from this study provide useful insights for increasing UX professionals' involvement in OSS communities to improve usability and end-user satisfaction.

\section{Results}
In our analysis, we found 105 issues reported by the four UX professionals in all the issues of VSCode, Atom, and Jupyter Lab (a total of 139,948 issues). A majority of the issues (93 out of 105, or 88.6\%) focused on usability, only one (0.9\%) discussed a bug and 11 (10.5\%) were related to reporting \textit{UX meetings} for the VSCode project.
