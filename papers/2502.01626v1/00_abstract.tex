The garment-to-person virtual try-on (VTON) task, which aims to generate fitting images of a person wearing a reference garment, has made significant strides. However, obtaining a standard garment is often more challenging than using the garment already worn by the person. To improve ease of use, we propose MFP-VTON, a Mask-Free framework for Person-to-Person VTON. Recognizing the scarcity of person-to-person data, we adapt a garment-to-person model and dataset to construct a specialized dataset for this task. Our approach builds upon a pretrained diffusion transformer, leveraging its strong generative capabilities. During mask-free model fine-tuning, we introduce a Focus Attention loss to emphasize the garment of the reference person and the details outside the garment of the target person. Experimental results demonstrate that our model excels in both person-to-person and garment-to-person VTON tasks, generating high-fidelity fitting images.
