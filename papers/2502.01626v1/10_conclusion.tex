\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce a mask-free framework for person-to-person Virtual Try-On (VTON) based on FLUX-Fill-dev. Given the absence of a dedicated dataset for person-to-person tasks, we construct a custom dataset by leveraging existing garment-to-person model and dataset. Additionally, we propose a Focus Attention loss to enhance attention-level learning, enabling the model to concentrate more effectively on the garment area of the reference person and the outside regions of the garment on target person. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates high-fidelity fitting outcomes for both garment-to-person and person-to-person tasks.
