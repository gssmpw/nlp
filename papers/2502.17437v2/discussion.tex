\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The effectiveness of our proposed fractal generative model, demonstrated through the challenging task of pixel-by-pixel generation, suggests new opportunities for designing generative models. It highlights the potential of dividing complex data distributions into manageable sub-problems and addressing them by abstracting existing generative models into modular units. We believe that fractal generative models are particularly well-suited for modeling data with intrinsic structures beyond one-dimensional sequential orders. We hope that the simplicity and effectiveness of our method will inspire the research community to explore novel designs and applications of fractal generative models.
