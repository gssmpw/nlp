\begin{abstract}
Knowledge-intensive conversations supported by large language models (LLMs) have become one of the most popular and helpful applications that can assist people in different aspects.
Many current knowledge-intensive applications are centered on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques.
While many open-source RAG frameworks facilitate the development of RAG-based applications, they often fall short in handling practical scenarios complicated by heterogeneous data in topics and formats,  conversational context management, and the requirement of low-latency response times. 
This technical report presents a configurable \underline{k}nowledge \underline{i}ntegrated \underline{m}ulti-\underline{a}gent \underline{s}ystem, \ours, to address these challenges.   
\ours features a flexible and configurable system for integrating diverse knowledge sources with 1) context management and query rewrite mechanisms to improve retrieval accuracy and multi-turn conversational coherency, 2) efficient knowledge routing and retrieval, 3) simple but effective filter and reference generation mechanisms, and 4) optimized parallelizable multi-agent pipeline execution.
Our work provides a scalable framework for advancing the deployment of LLMs in real-world settings.
To show how \ours can help developers build knowledge-intensive applications with different scales and emphases, we demonstrate how we configure the system to three applications already running in practice with reliable performance.\footnote{The source code is under review and will be available soon.}

\section{Conclusion}
In this technical report, we introduce \ours, our configurable knowledge-integrated multi-agent system for developers to build their knowledge-intensive QA system.
We present three use cases built on our system with different emphases to demonstrate that \ours can be configured to various applications.
While the current version of \ours focuses on knowledge-intensive QA tasks, future development can expand its capabilities to address a broader range of challenges, including code generation based on some specific local code base and interactive recommendation system for e-business.
