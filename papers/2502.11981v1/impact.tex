\section*{Impact statement}

This paper proposes that machine learning can and should be used to maximize social welfare. In principle, and by construction, the impact of our proposed framework on society aims to be positive. But our paper also points to the inherent difficulties of identifying, and making formal, what `good for society' is. We lean on the field of welfare economics, which has for decades contended with this challenge, for ideas on how the learning community can begin to approach this daunting task.
However, even if these ideas are conceptually appealing,
the path to practical welfare improvement presents many challenges---%
some expected, others unforseen.
% and will likely include many ups and downs.
For example, we may specify incorrect social welfare functions;
or we may specify them correctly but be unable to optimize them appropriately;
or we may be able to optimize but find that 
our assumptions are wrong, that theory differs from practice,
or that there were other considerations and complexities that we did not take into account.
For this we can look to other related fields---%
such as fairness, privacy, and alignment in machine learning---%
which have taken (and are still taking) similar journeys,
and learn from both their success and mistakes.
% and hope that ours will be similar.

Any discipline that seeks to affect policy should do so with much deliberation and care. Whereas welfare economics was designed with the explicit purpose of supporting (and influencing) policymakers,
machine learning has found itself in a similar position, but likely without any planned intent.
On the one hand, adjusting machine learning to support notions, such as social welfare,
that it was not designed to support initially can prove challenging.
However, and as we argue throughout, we believe that building on top of existing machinery is a more practical approach than to begin from scratch.
The necessity of confronting with welfare consideration can also
be an opportunity---as we can leverage these novel challenges
to make machine learning practice more informed, transparent, responsible, and socially aware.


% At the same time, the novelty of the challenges that welfare considerations present to the field make this an opportunity---%
% for chaning the role of machine learning in society for the better in a manner that is informed, transparent, and aware.
