    \caption{Overview of \textit{MotionCanvas}. Given an input image and high-level scene-space motion intent, MotionCanvas decomposes and translates the motion (camera and object motion with their timing) into screen space by leveraging the depth-based synthesis and hierarchical transformation with the Motion Signal Translation module. These screen-space motion signals are subsequently passed to a video generation model to produce the final cinematic shots.
