\section{Related Work}
Our work is related to three strands of prior work:

\paragraph{Policy Learning for Multi-Stage Decision-Making: } 
Policy learning for multi-stage decision-making has been widely explored in healthcare**Sutton, "Temporal Difference Methods"** and personalized medicine**Schulman, "High-Dimensional Continuous Control using Generalized Advantage Estimation"**
 to optimize treatment strategies over time. This approach has also been applied to dialogue systems**Bengio et al., "Deep Learning of Representations for Unsupervised and Transfer Learning"**, interactive machine translation**Koehn et al., "Monolingual Machine Translation"**, and extractive text summarization**Rush et al., "A Neural Attention Model for Question Answering"**. While these studies offer valuable insights into multi-stage decision-making, they typically deal with discrete actions and do not address scenarios involving high-dimensional text actions.

\paragraph{Reinforcement Learning for a Natural Language Action Space: }
He et al.**"Learning to Play the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks"** proposed an architecture for handling natural language action spaces in text-based games, using separate neural networks to embed state and action text before combining them to approximate the Q-function. Wang et al.**"Exploiting Pre-trained Convolutions for Sequence-to-Sequence Transfer Learning"** introduced a method that dynamically adapts the prior of a pre-trained language model using mutual information regularization to implicitly reduce the action space. Our setting differs from these approaches in that it deals with continuous rather than discrete action spaces, focuses on offline learning, and lacks explicit state transitions.

\paragraph{Causal Inference for Text: } 
Our work also relates to the emerging field of causal inference for language tasks. Veitch et al.**"Combining Causal Inference with Transfer Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation in High-Dimensional Text Data"** pioneered the use of language model embeddings and topic modeling to mitigate textual confounding in treatment effect estimation. This approach has been extended by researchers like Egami et al.**"Causal Representation Learning for Textual Confounders"**, Pryzant et al.**"Mitigating Confounding in Text: A Causal Inference Approach"**, and Imai and Nakamura**"Causal Effects in Text-Based Decision Making"**, who focus on leveraging latent representations of high-dimensional text as confounders or treatments. These studies highlight the importance of extracting low-dimensional latent representations to accurately estimate treatment effects in complex, high-dimensional textual data**Zhou et al., "Deep Learning for Causal Inference with Text Data"**.

Our work synthesizes elements from these areas, addressing the challenge of finding optimal treatments in a high-dimensional natural language space to maximize outcomes in sequential decision problems.
