    \caption{\small \textbf{Analysis of AutoCode Strategies. }\small We compare AutoCode performance against scenarios where models explicitly prompted to utilize code or CoT, and consider the union of solved queries as the bound for AutoCode performance. Existing models show inferior AutoCode performance than explicit instructed, with their AutoCode strategies close to random (50\%). Our approach consistently improves AutoCode performance, with AutoCode selection accuracy near 90\%.  }
