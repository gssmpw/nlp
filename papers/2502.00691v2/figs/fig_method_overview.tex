    \caption{\small \textbf{Method Overview.} \small (Left) shows an overview for the EM framework, which alternates between finding a reference strategy for guided exploration (E-step) and off-policy RL (M-step). (Right) shows the data curation for guided exploration. We generate \(K\) rollouts, estimate values of code-triggering decisions and subsample the initial data with sampling weights per Eq.~\ref{eq_sampling}.}
