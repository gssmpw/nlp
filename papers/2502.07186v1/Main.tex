\begin{abstract}
Zero-shot LLMs are now also used for textual classification tasks, e.g., sentiment/emotion detection of a given input as a sentence/article. 
However, their performance can be suboptimal in such data annotation tasks. We introduce a novel technique Perceived Confidence Scoring (PCS) that evaluates LLM's confidence for its classification of an input by leveraging Metamorphic Relations (MRs). The MRs generate semantically equivalent yet textually mutated versions of the input. Following the principles of Metamorphic Testing (MT), the mutated versions are expected to have annotation labels similar to the input. By analyzing the consistency of LLM responses across these variations, PCS computes a confidence score based on the frequency of predicted labels. PCS can be used both for single LLM and multiple LLM settings (e.g., majority voting). We introduce an algorithm Perceived Differential Evolution (PDE) that determines the optimal weights assigned to the MRs and the LLMs for a classification task. 
Empirical evaluation shows PCS significantly improves zero-shot accuracy for Llama-3-8B-Instruct (4.96\%) and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (10.52\%), with Gemma-2-9b-it showing a 9.39\% gain. When combining all three models, PCS significantly outperforms majority voting by 7.75\%.

% In NewsMediaBias-Plus, the Llama (Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct) model improves by 9.88\%, the Mistral (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3) model by 18.06\%, and the  Gemma (gemma-2-9b-it) model by 26.47\%. In Politifact, PCS matches the best zero-shot performance with the Gemma (gemma-2-9b-it) model and shows an 8.86\% improvement.

\section*{Impact Statement}

The Perceived Confidence Scoring (PCS) framework significantly enhances the reliability and accuracy of Large Language Model (LLM)-based classifications by systematically evaluating the confidence of model predictions. By generating semantically equivalent input variations through Metamorphic Relations (MRs) and analyzing the consistency of LLM responses, PCS computes robust confidence scores that improve decision-making transparency. This promotes greater trust in AI systems, making them more interpretable and accountable for users and stakeholders.

The impact of PCS extends across high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where accurate diagnosis and treatment recommendations are critical, and legal systems, where reliable evidence analysis and decision support are paramount. By reducing errors and increasing the robustness of LLM outputs, PCS contributes to safer and more ethical AI applications, ensuring that AI technologies align with societal needs and ethical standards.

Furthermore, this work advances the field of AI by introducing a novel, scalable approach to evaluating and improving LLM performance. It sets a foundation for future research into more resilient and trustworthy AI systems, fostering innovation while addressing real-world challenges. By bridging the gap between technical advancements and societal expectations, PCS not only pushes the boundaries of AI technology but also ensures its development remains responsible, ethical, and beneficial to humanity.
