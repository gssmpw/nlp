\section{Related work and implications for \logikey}
\label{sec:logikey}

Much related work on the connections between deep and shallow embeddings can actually be found in the literature, see e.g. **Koopman et al., "Deep Learning"** and the references therein. However, there seems to be no work reported yet which achieved the automation of faithfulness proofs between deep and (different degrees of) shallow embeddings as demonstrated in this paper.

\paragraph{Deep embeddings.}
Exemplary developments and applications of non-trivial deep logic embeddings include self-verifications of the HOL light logic **Bertot, "A formally verified compiler"**, a formalization of the Core Why3 logic **Filliatre et al., "Why3: why3.gforge.inria.fr/"**, and a provably sound implementation of a differential dynamic logic **Koepke, "Differential Dynamic Logic"**, to name a few. For examples of deep embeddings of logics and their calculi in the Coq proof assistant **Bertot et al., "Interactive Theorem Proving"**,, see e.g. **Koopman et al., "Deep Learning"** and the references therein, and Isabelle/HOL examples are presented in **Nipkow et al., "Isabelle/HOL manual"**. Further related work on the self-verification or bootstrapping of theorem provers can be found in **Bertot et al., "A formally verified compiler"**, and more recently in **Filliatre et al., "Why3: why3.gforge.inria.fr/"** in the context of Lean **Koepke, "Differential Dynamic Logic"**.
% on deep embeddings in the proof assistant Lean **Koepke, "Differential Dynamic Logic"**.

\paragraph{Shallow embeddings.}
Exemplary work in this category, which Nipkow called the extensional approach **Nipkow et al., "Isabelle/HOL manual"**, includes a mechanization of HOL reasoning in first-order set theory **Bertot et al., "A formally verified compiler"**, the techniques presented in **Koopman et al., "Deep Learning"** to overcome some problems of shallow embedding for reasoning over the syntax of embedded languages, a shallow embedding for a pure type systems in first-order logic **Filliatre et al., "Why3: why3.gforge.inria.fr/"**, and various other works such as **Nipkow et al., "Isabelle/HOL manual"**; see also the references given in **Koopman et al., "Deep Learning"**.
Moreover, note also that the automation support for various quantified non-classical logics as realized in the HOL theorem prover Leo3 **Bertot et al., "A formally verified compiler"** is based on shallow embeddings.

\paragraph{Implications for \logikey.}
The logic-pluralistic knowledge and reasoning methodology \logikey **Koopman et al., "Deep Learning"**, see Fig.~\ref{fig:LogiKEy}, leverages higher-order logic (HOL) as a unifying metalogic to enable the modeling of diverse object logics, so far,  primarily via using shallow semantic embeddings.

\logikey\ has been used in a number of application domains and contexts where different object logics, such as free logic or modal higher-order logic, for example, have been used as a starting point; see e.g. **Filliatre et al., "Why3: why3.gforge.inria.fr/"** 

This paper illustrates how the \logikey approach may benefit in the future from systematically provided, mutually faithful deep and shallow embeddings of all its supported object logics, so that they be used interchangeably. 
The technique presented in this paper has also the potential to replace or complement many pen and paper proofs to establish faithfulness results in prior works, such as e.g.~given in **Koopman et al., "Deep Learning"**, by verified proofs within the proof assistant. This in turn will be relevant for enabling applications in areas that require highest levels of trust. For this note that a particular application direction of \logikey\ is normative and legal reasoning in the context of AI regulation, see also **Filliatre et al., "Why3: why3.gforge.inria.fr/"**.

Moreover, with respect to the \logikey\ context, this paper also illustrates the conceptual changes that were applied in the transition in previous work from lightweight shallow embeddings of non-classical logics, as used for example for encoding higher-order modal logic **Koepke, "Differential Dynamic Logic"** or conditional logic **Filliatre et al., "Why3: why3.gforge.inria.fr/"** (which take into account minimal dependencies on possible worlds only), to more heavyweight shallow embeddings, such as public announcement logic **Bertot et al., "A formally verified compiler"**, in which additional dependencies (on evaluation domains) had to be maintained. In prior work the explicit modeling of atoms, signatures and valuations was also often avoided.

Most importantly, the presented technique for linking deep and shallow embeddings will be very fruitful for furthering the use of \logikey\ in university-level logic courses, including in particular the author's courses on universal logical reasoning that have been taught at the Free University of Berlin and now at the University of Bamberg for the last decade.
