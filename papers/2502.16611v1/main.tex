% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning and Audio Processing. This technology can potentially improve communication aids, hearing devices, and audio editing tools, making it easier for users to focus on desired voices in complex auditory scenes. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
