 \subsection{Video Anomaly Analysis} 
   Analyzing a video's anomaly includes many aspects.
 For the detection task, Wang et al., "Video Anomaly Detection via Local Descriptive Priors"____ embeds videos with I3D____ and enhances the features with a Transformer. A convolutional classifier then outputs an anomaly score.
 For the captioning task, Liu et al., "Progressive Object-Detection based Video Captioning via Multi-Task Learning"____ uses C3D____ for feature extraction, a Transformer-based encoder-decoder for multi-task prediction, and an LSTM for caption generation.
 For the temporal grounding task, Chen et al., "Temporal Grounding with Graph-based Memory Mechanism"____ employs C3D and DistillBERT____ to embed both video and text queries into a shared space for mutual matching.
These top-performing methods highlight the integration of traditional CNNs with Transformers; however, this approach undermines the inherent generalization capabilities of Transformer architectures.
 
 Meanwhile, the different metrics and annotations across benchmarks for different tasks make it challenging to evaluate general models.
 UCVL____ includes only abnormal categories and evaluates classification performance using Area Under Curve (AUC). Furthermore, UCAS____ segments the UCC videos and annotates each part with a sentence, allowing evaluation of temporal grounding using Intersection over Union (IoU) and captioning using BLEU____.
