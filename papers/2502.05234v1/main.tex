\begin{abstract} 
%Sampling-based inference strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are commonly employed in language models to improve accuracy on problem-solving tasks. While sampling temperature significantly influences the performance of these strategies, it is often set to a default value or tuned using an additional validation set without enough care. In this work, we demonstrate that the suitable temperature range can differ across various model architectures and tasks, and we observe a correlation between the optimal temperature and the similarity between models and tasks. Furthermore, we propose an entropy-based approach to automatically identify a suitable temperature without the need for any labeled data. Our method achieves a hit rate of xxx in recovering the true optimal temperature and beating down all fixed temperature settings. Finally, we employ a stochastic process model to provide interpretability for our approach.
Multi-sample aggregation strategies, such as majority voting and best-of-N sampling, are widely used in contemporary large language models (LLMs) to enhance predictive accuracy across various tasks. A key challenge in this process is temperature selection, which significantly impacts model performance. Existing approaches either rely on a fixed default temperature or require labeled validation data for tuning, which are often scarce and difficult to obtain. This paper addresses the challenge of automatically identifying the (near)-optimal temperature for different LLMs using multi-sample aggregation strategies, without relying on task-specific validation data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of temperatureâ€™s role in performance optimization, considering variations in model architectures, datasets, task types, model sizes, and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization, which consistently outperforms fixed-temperature baselines. Additionally, we incorporate a stochastic process model to enhance interpretability, offering deeper insights into the relationship between temperature and model performance.
\end{abstract}

% tl,dr: By analyzing the behavior of various LLMs across different temperatures and tasks, we propose an entropy-based metric for automated temperature optimization in multi-sample aggregation strategies, eliminating the need for labeled validation data.
