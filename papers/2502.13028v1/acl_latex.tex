\section{Limitations}

\paragraph{Limited Author History Size:} 
Table~\ref{tab:dataset-stats} (70\% of the Stories/Author column) shows that N.Magazine and New Yorker authors have an average of 3 stories in their profiling set, whereas Reddit and AO3 authors have around 10. A larger profiling set likely enables more accurate inference of an author's story-writing characteristics, leading to improved personalization. However, the cognitive demands of writing long stories result in fewer stories per author available online, thereby limiting the scalability of personalized story generation research. 

\paragraph{Author Writing Sheet Recall:} We validate the precision of our Author Writing Sheet through human evaluation, ensuring that the Claim-Evidence pairs accurately describe the author's story-writing style. However, we do not assess recall, i.e., whether \emph{all} of the author's story-writing characteristics are captured. Measuring recall is challenging due to the inherent subjectivity of the task, making it impractical to ask humans to independently construct Writing Sheets for comparison.

\paragraph{Multi-Agent Systems and Fine-Tuning LLMs:} Our work explores role-playing for personalized story generation by prompting an LLM with tailored persona descriptions and story rules. Future research can extend this by incorporating multi-agent systems, where specialized agents focus on different narrative categories to enhance personalization \citep{huot2024agents, bae-kim-2024-collective}. Additionally, fine-tuning LLMs to explicitly reason over author history could be investigated as a method for better aligning generated content with individual author preferences \citep{salemi2025reasoning, shashidhar-etal-2024-unsupervised, shaikh2024show}.

\paragraph{Automatic Evaluation Methods:} Evaluating long-form text remains challenging for LLMs, particularly for creative outputs that involve nuanced aspects like subtext, which are difficult to assess automatically and often require human evaluation \citep{subbiah-etal-2024-storysumm}.
 
\section{Ethical Considerations}
Both human evaluation tasks were approved by an institutional review board (IRB). All annotators, who are US-based and fluent in English, were informed of the nature of the research study, to which they provided informed consent, and were compensated at an hourly rate of \$17, meeting the minimum wage requirements in our state. All scientific artifacts, including models and datasets, were used in accordance with their intended purpose to ensure ethical and responsible research practices. 

All data used in this study were manually collected from publicly available sources\footnote{Permission was obtained from the authors of the Storium dataset for its inclusion in Mythos.}, adhering to the data usage and crawling policies of the respective websites. To comply with copyright constraints, we will release only the links to the stories used in this research, rather than the stories themselves, following the approach of \citep{chakrabarty2024art}.  

Fully anonymizing our dataset is not feasible\footnote{Storium authors already anonymize their dataset.} as the research involves mimicking specific authors’ writing behaviors. We note that even if the usernames are anonymized, it is still possible to infer an author's publicly available identity from the story link. Therefore, for each author for every source, we release their usernames along with corresponding writing prompts, and author-written stories in the profiling and generation set of our dataset. However, the dataset remains limited in scale, and no additional metadata, including demographic information, is included, thereby reducing potential risks. To further mitigate unforeseen harms, the dataset will be released under an **Educational or Academic Research, Non-Commercial Use** license, following \citep{akoury-etal-2020-storium}.

\section{Dataset}
\label{app:dataset}

In this section, we describe the details of the construction of our dataset which includes five distinct story-writing sources, Reddit\footnote{\url{https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/}}, AO3\footnote{\url{https://archiveofourown.org/}}, Storium\footnote{\url{https://storium.cs.umass.edu/}}, N.Magazine\footnote{\url{https://www.narrativemagazine.com/}}, and New Yorker\footnote{\url{https://www.newyorker.com/}}. 

\paragraph{Selection Constraints:}
To ensure high-quality and diverse content, we apply several constraints during dataset collection. Stories are limited to a length of 500 to 1500 words. To avoid contamination by LLM pretraining data, only recent stories published after November 2023 are included for Reddit and AO3 \citep{zhou2023don, magar-schwartz-2022-data}. Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) and explicit content is excluded using automatic tagging and manual verification. Additionally, we manually inspect all stories to remove elements that may reveal author identities, such as URLs and links to their public profiles on websites. 

\paragraph{Enrichment with Writing Prompts:}
While Reddit stories include author-provided prompts, other sources do not; therefore, we augment them with GPT-4o-generated writing prompts to standardize the format across sources. We manually review all generated prompts and refine them when necessary. The prompt for generating writing prompts for the stories in our dataset can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:writing-prompt-gen}.

\paragraph{Dataset Splitting:}
Following \citep{salemi-etal-2024-lamp}, we split each author's stories chronologically based on their submission timestamps. The first 70\% of an author’s stories form the \emph{profiling} set, representing their historical writing, while the remaining 30\% constitute the \emph{generation} set, used for evaluating personalization methods.

\paragraph{Statistics and Comparisons:}
The dataset contains 590 stories from 64 authors, with an average story length of 1500 tokens. Detailed statistics are provided in Table~\ref{tab:dataset-stats}. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:compare-datasets}, our dataset uniquely combines diverse story-writing settings and provides connections that link stories written by the same author, distinguishing it from existing story-writing datasets that either lack Author IDs or do not establish such links.

\paragraph{Themes:}
Figure~\ref{fig:wp_themes} shows the plots depicting the percentage-normalized frequency of the top 10 themes for each source. To derive these themes, we prompt GPT-4o with each writing prompt to generate up to five one-word themes. We then aggregate the themes across all writing prompts and compute the normalized frequency by dividing the count of each theme by the total number of themes for that source.


Overall, we observe that Reddit (Figure~\ref{fig:reddit_wp}), AO3 (Figure~\ref{fig:ao3_wp}), and Storium (Figure~\ref{fig:storium_wp}) contain a higher prevalence of ``conflict'' themes, whereas N.Magazine (Figure~\ref{fig:nmagazine_wp}) and New Yorker (Figure~\ref{fig:newyorker_wp}) focus more on family, loss, and identity. This distinction reflects the nature of story-writing settings across these sources: amateur stories tend to emphasize direct conflict resolution in their prompts, while expert-written stories explore deeper aspects of human relationships. 

Among Reddit, AO3, and Storium, Reddit exhibits a flatter distribution with greater thematic diversity, spanning identity, power, survival, humor, adventure, magic, and the supernatural. In contrast, AO3 has a sharper distribution, dominated by recurring themes of relationships, friendships, love, family, and secrets, reflecting a more domestic story-writing setting. Storium also shows a sharper distribution but favors themes such as space, danger, leadership, and war, highlighting a preference for war-centric narratives in collaborative storytelling.

\section{Author Writing Sheet}

Algorithm~\ref{alg:author_writing_sheet} describes the process for generating the Author Writing Sheet. 

\paragraph{Common Core Standards in English Language Arts:}  

The Author Writing Sheet is organized in the form of Claim-Evidence pairs describing an author's story-writing characteristics inspired by Common Core (CC) Standards\footnote{\url{https://corestandards.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ELA_Standards1.pdf}} \citep{national2010common}. Specifically, it aligns with \emph{RL-9-10.1}, which emphasizes citing strong textual evidence to support analysis, and \emph{RL-9-10.2}, which focuses on determining central themes and summarizing texts. Additionally, \emph{RL-9-10.4} highlights interpreting word choices and their impact on meaning and tone. In writing, \emph{W.9-10.2} pertains to producing clear and well-structured informative texts, while \emph{W.9-10.9} encourages drawing evidence from literary and informational texts to support analysis and research. These standards provide a structured framework for evaluating narrative elements such as plot, creativity, development, and language use within the Author Writing Sheet, ensuring a systematic and interpretable representation of an author’s unique storytelling style.

\subsection{Cost Analysis of Author Writing Sheet}
\label{app:cost-analysis}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/cost_analysis.pdf}
\caption{Cost analysis of generating the Author Writing Sheet and Summary using GPT-4o as a function of the profiling set size $|P|$ in an interactive writing setting where an author adds a new submission at each time step. For profiling set sizes where $|P| > 30$, generating the Author Writing Sheet is significantly more cost-effective than the Author Writing Summary.}
\label{fig:cost_analysis}
\end{figure}

In this section, we analyze the cost of generating the Author Writing Sheet (see Section~\ref{sec:author-writing-sheet}) and compare it with the cost of generating the Author Writing Summary (see \hyperlink{sec:writing-summary}{Writing Summary}) as a function of the profiling set size ($|P|$) using GPT-4o. We calculate the average cost per sample (a writing prompt and its corresponding story) as \textit{0.06\$} for the Author Writing Sheet and \textit{0.02\$} for the Author Writing Summary considering 2.50\$ per 1M tokens for input, and 10.00\$ per 1M tokens for output\footnote{\url{https://openai.com/api/pricing/}}. 

In an interactive writing setting, where an author adds a new submission at each time step, the total cost of generating the Author Writing Sheet is \textit{0.06\$ * $|P|$}, while the total cost of generating the Author Writing Summary is \textit{0.0015$|P|^2$ + 0.019$|P|$}. The cost of generating the Author Writing Summary scales quadratically with $|P|$, as the entire author history must be reprocessed at each step, leading to cumulative costs as the profiling set grows. In contrast, the cost of generating the Author Writing Sheet grows linearly, as each new submission incurs a fixed cost of \textit{0.06\$} by running the \textit{for} loop in Algorithm~\ref{alg:author_writing_sheet} once.

Figure~\ref{fig:cost_analysis} shows the cost analysis of generating the Author Writing Sheet and Summary using GPT-4o as a function of the profiling set size $|P|$ in an interactive writing setting. Up to $|P|=30$, the cost of generating both remains approximately the same at 1.16\$. However, as $|P|$ increases, the cost of generating the Author Writing Summary grows at a rate of \textit{0.025$|P|$ + 0.30} compared to the Author Writing Sheet which continues to scale linearly. Specifically, for $|P|=100$, the cost of generating the Author Writing Summary is 17\$, compared to 6\$ for the Author Writing Sheet. At $|P|=1000$, the cost of generating the Author Writing Summary escalates to 1520\$, while the cost of generating the Author Writing Sheet remains at 60\$. 

This analysis demonstrates that our approach for generating the Author Writing Sheet remains scalable as the profiling set size $|P|$ increases, making it well-suited for interactive writing assistants that support personalization \citep{yeh2024ghostwriter, yuan2022wordcraft}.


\subsection{Human Study for Validating Author Writing Sheets}
\label{app:human-author-sheets}

\paragraph{Experiment Design and Cost:}

\begin{figure*}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/labelstudio_sheet.pdf}
\caption{LabelStudio interface for validating Author Writing Sheets.}
\label{fig:labelstuido-sheet}
\end{figure*}


We recruited three annotators via Upwork, compensating them \$17/hour. The annotators provided consent by signing a Google form that outlined the instructions of the task including the purpose of the research study. Each annotator evaluated 22 stories (98 Claim-Evidence pairs), with 12 stories annotated by all three to asses agreement and 10 assigned exclusively per annotator \citep{song-etal-2024-veriscore} to increase the coverage of annotation. The annotation process took a total of 6 hours and 40 minutes per annotator, averaging 18 minutes per story. Each annotator received \$114, bringing the total annotation cost to \$342. The annotation was conducted using LabelStudio\footnote{\url{https://labelstud.io/}} (Figure~\ref{fig:labelstuido-sheet}), with a dedicated comments section for annotators to justify their choices. Annotators reported that the interface was easy to use.


\paragraph{Annotation Criteria:}
Annotators were provided with a writing prompt, an author-written story, and the Claim-Evidence pairs from the Author Writing Sheet for that story. They answered two questions per Claim-Evidence pair: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Claim Inference: Can the claim be reasonably inferred from the story? 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes – The claim aligns with the story’s content and can be reasonably inferred, even if there are minor inaccuracies or ambiguities.
        \item No – The claim is fundamentally inaccurate, with serious contradictions or inconsistencies when compared to the story.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Evidence Support: Does the evidence support the claim?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes – The evidence fully supports the claim, aligning with every part of it without significant discrepancies.
        \item Partially – The evidence supports some aspects of the claim, though it includes minor inaccuracies, ambiguities, or omissions.
        \item No – The evidence contradicts the claim outright or is logically inconsistent with the claim.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Pilot Studies:}

A pilot study with three graduate students helped refine our annotation criteria, leading to two options for Claim Inference (Yes/No) and three for Evidence Support (Yes/Partially/No) to ensure substantial agreement in the final annotations. For Claim Inference, we adopted a binary scale to filter out inaccurate or contradictory claims while accounting for annotator subjectivity. For Evidence Support, we included a "Partially" option to capture cases where the evidence somewhat supports the claim, allowing for potential refinement methods to improve weakly supported claims.


\paragraph{Results and Feedback:}

Annotators unanimously selected `Yes' for all claims in Claim Inference, indicating that no claims required filtering. For Evidence Support, all responses were either `Yes' or `Partially,' with no instances of `No,' confirming that all evidence fully or partially supported the claims. Krippendorff’s Alpha for Evidence Support was 0.57, reflecting moderate agreement despite task subjectivity. On average, 93\% of evidence fully supported claims, while 7\% were labeled `Partially,' often because annotators felt additional supporting evidence could be included. Annotators also noted cases where evidence merely repeated the claim without linking to the writing prompt. Using regex matching, we identified this issue in the Author Writing Sheets of seven authors, likely due to LLM hallucination. We regenerated these sheets and manually verified adherence to the specified format. Overall, annotators reported that the LabelStudio interface was user-friendly and praised the quality of the writing prompts and stories.

This Persona Prompt will assign an LLM the persona of the author, enabling it to emulate the author’s storytelling style across four key aspects.

The Persona Prompt must be well-structured, engaging, and organized into **Plot**, **Creativity**, **Development (Character and Setting)**, and **Language Use** while maintaining a natural, flowing narrative. It should concisely capture the author’s tendencies, preferences, and strengths without directly referencing the Author Writing Sheet.

\section*{User Prompt}  
Analyze the Author Writing Sheet to identify the author’s recurring patterns and narrative style. Summarize these insights into a Persona Prompt that reflects their storytelling approach in an engaging, second-person descriptive format.

\textbf{Input Format}: An **Author Writing Sheet** containing Claim-Evidence pairs structured into Plot, Creativity, Development (Character and Setting), and Language Use.

\textbf{Output Format}:
\begin{verbatim}
<thinking>
[Analyze the storytelling patterns, strengths, and techniques found in the 
Author Writing Sheet. Identify key aspects of the author’s narrative style.]
</thinking>

<persona_prompt>
[Generate a well-structured Persona Prompt capturing the author’s style 
across Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use.]
</persona_prompt>  
\end{verbatim}

Ensure the Persona Prompt is approximately 300 words, seamlessly integrates storytelling insights, and preserves the author's unique style.

\section*{System Prompt}  
You are an expert storytelling rule generator tasked with creating **Story Rules** tailored to a specific Writing Prompt. Your role is to analyze an **Author Writing Sheet**, which details an author's unique storytelling style through Claim-Evidence pairs, and use this analysis to construct actionable **Story Rules** that guide a language model in emulating the author's writing style while aligning with the given Writing Prompt.

The **Story Rules** must:  
- **Mimic the Author’s Writing Style** – Reflect distinctive storytelling techniques from the Author Writing Sheet, including plot structuring, creative blending of themes, character development, and specific language use.  
- **Incorporate Examples** – Use detailed examples inspired by the Evidence from the Author Writing Sheet, ensuring alignment with the Writing Prompt.  
- **Align with the Writing Prompt** – Integrate the Writing Prompt’s themes, tone, and narrative potential while preserving the author’s style.  
- **Be Actionable** – Provide direct second-person instructions for the language model, avoiding vague or comparative terms.  

\vspace{1em}
\section*{User Prompt}

            \item Structure the story around a humorous and light-hearted approach to the hero's journey of coping with their son's illness. For example, the hero’s attempts to use their powers for mundane tasks, like making breakfast, could result in comedic mishaps, such as accidentally creating a tornado of cereal.
            \item Develop the narrative around the hero’s personal transformation and empowerment. Show the hero learning to accept their son's condition and finding new ways to be a hero, such as advocating for genetic research or starting a support group for other super-powered families.
            \item Use a layered narrative structure by incorporating fictional news articles and memos. For instance, include a news article titled "World's Greatest Hero Faces Greatest Challenge Yet: Parenting."
            \item Introduce a humorous misunderstanding or temporal misalignment, such as the hero misinterpreting a cryptic message from their future self, leading to comedic attempts to "fix" the timeline, only to realize the message was trivial.

        \textbf{Creativity:}  
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
            \item Anthropomorphize the hero’s powers or gadgets to add a whimsical touch. For instance, the hero's cape could have a personality and offer sarcastic commentary, calling itself "The Cloak of Infinite Wisdom."

\paragraph{Story Generation:}  
Figure~\ref{fig:story_gen_prompt} shows the prompt for story generation. Source-specific constraints in the prompt (\texttt{<source-specific instruction>}) for each of the five sources are as follows:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Reddit:} \texttt{You are role-playing a specific author on the Reddit Writing Prompts (r/WritingPrompts) platform. Your task is to mimic this author's story writing style by responding to the provided writing prompt in a way that the author would respond.}
    \item \textbf{AO3:} \texttt{You are role-playing a specific author on the AO3 platform. Your task is to mimic this author's story writing style by writing a fanfiction narrative responding to the provided writing prompt in a way that the author would respond.}
    \item \textbf{Storium:} \texttt{You are role-playing a specific author on Storium, a collaborative story writing platform. Your task is to mimic this author's story writing style to create the opening Establishment turn by responding to the provided writing prompt in a way that the author would respond. The Establishment turn should set the stage for the narrative and provide a strong foundation while leaving space for other contributors to expand and build upon the narrative.}
    \item \textbf{N.Magazine:} \texttt{You are role-playing a specific experienced author on the Narrative Magazine platform. Your task is to mimic this author's story writing style by responding to the provided writing prompt in a way that the author would respond.}
    \item \textbf{New Yorker:} \texttt{You are role-playing an accomplished literary writer on the New Yorker website. Your task is to mimic this writer's story writing style by responding to the provided writing prompt in a way that the writer would respond.}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Average Author:}
Figure~\ref{fig:ao3_avg_prompt} shows the Average Author prompt for AO3, Figure~\ref{fig:reddit_avg_prompt} for Reddit, Figure~\ref{fig:storium_avg_prompt} for Storium, Figure~\ref{fig:nmagazine_avg_prompt} for Narrative Magazine, and Figure~\ref{fig:newyorker_avg_prompt} for The New Yorker.

Figure~\ref{fig:delta_story_rule_prompt} shows the prompt for generating story rules for a new writing prompt in the generation set using the story rules of the profiling set as few-shot demonstrations.  

\paragraph{Writing Sheet and Summary:}
Figure~\ref{fig:writing-summary} shows the prompt for generating the Author Writing Summary using all the stories in the author history. 

Figure~\ref{fig:persona_prompt_gen} shows the prompt for generating the persona description using the Author Writing Sheet. Figure~\ref{fig:story_rule_gen_writing_sheet} shows the prompt for generating personalized story rules tailored to a writing prompt based on the Author Writing Sheet. The same prompts are used for generating persona descriptions and personalized story rules for the Author Writing Summary.

\subsection{Sample Outputs}
Table~\ref{tab:persona_description_sample} and Table~\ref{tab:story_rules_sample} present the persona description and personalized story rules for a Reddit author, whose sample Author Writing Sheet is shown in Table~\ref{tab:author_writing_sheet_sample}. The persona description (Table~\ref{tab:persona_description_sample}) is structured into four paragraphs, each corresponding to a narrative category, and integrates the author's story-writing characteristics from their Author Writing Sheet into a narrative-driven persona prompt for the story-generation LLM. The example persona shown highlights a focus on humor and misunderstanding in plot construction, the blending of historical and fantastical elements in creative expression, humor-driven character development, and a playful, whimsical tone in language use, aligning with the author's documented writing tendencies. 

The personalized story rules (Table~\ref{tab:story_rules_sample}) for the given writing prompt—centered on the world's greatest hero coping with the impending loss of their child—demonstrate the incorporation of these characteristics into concrete stylistic guidelines to be used as user constraints in the prompt of the story-generation LLM. For instance, rather than a conventional tragic narrative, the rules emphasize a lighthearted approach to the hero’s coping process. Similarly, creative elements such as anthropomorphizing gadgets and employing a meta-satirical approach through fictional news headlines align with the author's noted preferences. Character development is structured around humorous dialogue and cultural misunderstandings, while language use maintains a playful and whimsical tone, ensuring consistency with the author’s established writing style.

\subsection{Traditional Metrics}
\label{app:trad-merics}

We complement GPT-4o-as-a-judge evaluations with traditional metrics \citep{ivey2024real, huot2024agents} across three criteria: (1) lexical overlap, measured using BLEU and ROUGE-L \citep{xie-etal-2023-next}; (2) story diversity, assessed via homogenization scores \citep{padmakumar2023does}; and (3) stylistic similarity, evaluated separately for the author history and the ground-truth author story using LUAR \citep{rivera-soto-etal-2021-learning}. Specifically, we compute two stylistic similarity scores: one measuring the cosine similarity between the LUAR embeddings of the generated story and the mean embeddings of the stories in the author’s profiling set (author history), and another comparing the generated story to the ground-truth author story. Additionally, we report generated story lengths in tokens.

Table~\ref{tab:oracle-faith} shows an example where the Oracle story deviates from the author's documented story-writing characteristics as described in the Author Writing Summary for a Storium author. The author's profiling set consists of three stories that consistently employ informal and colloquial language using humor and sarcasm, often conveyed through dialogue. However, for the new writing prompt in the generation set, the author's style shifts to a more serious and mystic tone, diverging from their previously established preferences. In contrast, the Average Author method partially aligns with the Author Writing Summary by incorporating dialogue, while the Writing Summary method exhibits stronger alignment by more accurately capturing the author's use of informal language and comedic tone. The Oracle story, however, fails to align with the author's established style. This phenomenon results in the Average Author story being preferred over Oracle, and the Writing Summary story being preferred over the Average Author story, explaining the lower win-rate of the Oracle method compared to the Writing Summary method in GPT-4o-as-a-judge evaluation for Faithfulness to Author History.

        \label{tab:persona_sim_comparison}
\end{table*}

Table~\ref{tab:persona_sim_comparison} highlights the importance of persona descriptions in achieving similarity to the \textit{Author Story} for a Reddit author. The \textit{Author Story} creatively blends military strategy and fantasy, exemplified by phrases like \textit{``the weapons and armors of the enemy shifted by his will.''} Similarly, the \textit{Writing Sheet} integrates both elements, as seen in \textit{``It was as if the castle was alive, an ally in his solitary defense.''} In contrast, the \textit{Average Author} and \textit{Writing Sheet nP} primarily focus on directly resolving the writing prompt through descriptions of battle. The \textit{Average Author} incorporates minor fantasy elements, such as \textit{``amplified by some unseen force,''} whereas the \textit{Writing Sheet nP} adheres strictly to conventional military tactics. As a result, the \textit{Writing Sheet} is preferred over the \textit{Average Author}, which in turn is preferred over the \textit{Writing Sheet nP}. This outcome demonstrates that following persona descriptions enhances alignment with the author's style, as the \textit{Writing Sheet} successfully captures their characteristic genre-blending approach of including elements of fantasy in the story. The broader thematic variety of Reddit, i.e., war-themed prompts, led to a more descriptive Author Writing Sheet capturing the author's style of combining fantasy with the writing prompt, which helped construct a useful persona to enable better personalization using the Writing Sheet method.

%Table~\ref{tab:category_comparison_column} shows the narrative category-wise win-rates of Delta, Writing Sheet, and Writing Summary for all sources. 

Table~\ref{tab:category_comparison_column} shows that Delta, Writing Summary, and Writing Sheet outperform Average Author in Creativity (23\% higher) and Language Use (15\% higher) \citep{huot2024agents}, but perform worse in Plot and slightly worse in Development \citep{tian-etal-2024-large-language, xu2024echoes}. Creativity and Language Use are less dependent on the writing prompt, making them easier to transfer across prompts, whereas Plot and Development are more closely tied to specific prompts, making generalization difficult, especially without thematic overlap.

To better understand narrative category-wise personalization performance, Figure~\ref{fig:win_rates_grid} shows the win-rates for sources - AO3, Storium, N.Magazine, and New Yorker similar to Figure~\ref{fig:reddit_win_rates} in the main paper. Overall, across all sources, we see that our proposed methods of Writing Sheet and Summary perform better than Delta across all four narrative categories. We see that Writing Summary generally performs better than Writing Sheet for sources like AO3 indicating that for the fanfiction domain explicitly contrasting the author-written story with the Average Story does not help much as the authors demonstrate limited stylistic variations among each other. In general, we observe that the win-rates of our personalization methods are higher than the Average Author for narrative categories of Creativity and Language Use as compared to Plot and Development confirming with prior results likely because Creativity and Language Use are less tied to the writing prompt than Plot and Development.

\end{table*}

Table~\ref{tab:traditional-metrics} reports results using traditional metrics (Section~\ref{app:trad-merics}). Lexical Overlap and Diversity metrics yield similar values, as all methods use the same generation model, leading to overlapping lexical distributions and limiting these metrics' ability to capture nuanced stylistic differences \citep{zheng2023judging, xie-etal-2023-next}. However, Writing Sheet nP consistently outperforms other methods, particularly in Style metrics for both similarity to Author History and Author Story, as measured by LUAR \citep{rivera-soto-etal-2021-learning}. This improvement likely results from the Writing Sheet explicitly summarizing an author's stylistic deviations from an Average Author, enhancing personalization. Homogenization scores are slightly worse than the Average Author, likely explained by the increased similarity among the generated stories for the same author.

Below, we discuss results using Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 70B \citep{dubey2024llama} as story generation models, conditioned on GPT-4o-generated story rules and persona descriptions. Each method is evaluated by GPT-4o against the Average Author story generated by the respective Llama model, not GPT-4o.  

\paragraph{Larger models improve instruction-following and personalization:}  
Tables~\ref{tab:faith-auth-history-llama8b} and \ref{tab:faith-auth-history-llama70b} show Faithfulness to Writing History for Llama 3.1 8B and 70B, while Tables~\ref{tab:sim-auth-story-llama8b} and \ref{tab:sim-auth-story-llama70b} report similarity to the author story. Across both criteria, Oracle achieves higher win-rates with Llama 3.1 70B, indicating that larger models enhance instruction-following and personalization \citep{chung2024scaling}.

\paragraph{Cross-Model Persona Descriptions Aid Smaller Models but Not Larger Ones for Faithfulness to Writing History:}  
For Llama 3.1 8B (Table~\ref{tab:faith-auth-history-llama8b}), Writing Sheet and Writing Summary achieve the highest scores (9\% higher than nP), demonstrating the benefit of persona descriptions. However, for Llama 3.1 70B (Table~\ref{tab:faith-auth-history-llama70b}), Writing Sheet nP and Writing Summary nP outperform their persona-based counterparts by approximately 9\%, suggesting that GPT-4o-generated personas provide no benefit to other models with stronger instruction-following capabilities \citep{mckenzie2023inverse}. This is likely because persona descriptions of an author's writing style are model-dependent and do not transfer well to other models with comparable performance \citep{shashidhar-etal-2024-unsupervised}.


\paragraph{Limited Cross-Model Generalization of the Author Writing Sheet Compared to the Author Writing Summary for Similarity to Author Story:}  
For both Llama 3.1 8B (Table~\ref{tab:sim-auth-story-llama8b}) and Llama 3.1 70B (Table~\ref{tab:sim-auth-story-llama70b}), Writing Summary outperforms Writing Sheet by 5\% and 9\%, respectively \citep{shashidhar-etal-2024-unsupervised}. This outcome likely stems from the construction process: the Author Writing Sheet contrasts an LLM-generated Average Story with the author-written story, making it more model-dependent. In contrast, the Author Writing Summary does not rely on the LLM-generated Average Author story, allowing for greater generalization across models.

\section{Human Evaluation}

\caption{LabelStudio interface for evaluating similarity to ground-truth author story.}
\label{fig:labelstuido-human-story}
\end{figure*}

We recruited three annotators via Upwork, compensating them at a rate of \$17 per hour. The annotators provided consent by signing a Google form that outlined the instructions of the task including the purpose of the research study. Each annotator evaluated 25 author stories and 75 story pairs, corresponding to the three personalization methods: Delta, Writing Sheet, and Writing Summary. Collectively, our annotators evaluated 45 unique author stories (135 story pairs), of which 15 author stories were annotated by all three annotators to assess inter-annotator agreement. The remaining 30 author stories were distributed uniquely, with each annotator evaluating 10 exclusive stories to increase annotation coverage \citep{song-etal-2024-veriscore}. The annotation process required a total of 12 hours and 30 minutes per annotator, averaging 30 minutes per author story. Each annotator received \$213 for their work, bringing the total annotation cost to \$639.

The annotation was conducted using LabelStudio (Figure~\ref{fig:labelstuido-human-story}). Each task presented the annotators with a writing prompt, its corresponding author story, and a pair of generated stories—Story A and Story B—one produced by the Average Author method and the other by a personalization method. Annotators were asked to select the story that more closely resembled the author story. Before making their final choice, annotators provided comments on the distinctive aspects of each story that contributed to its similarity to or divergence from the author story. These comments were structured according to the four narrative categories: Plot, Creativity, Development, and Language Use, with an additional ``Overall'' comment justifying their final selection. Additionally, annotators were allowed to highlight salient aspects of each story for their reference.

\end{table*}

Table~\ref{tab:annotator_story_comments_analysis} presents the analysis of annotator comments explaining the preference for our personalization methods over the Average Author method in terms of similarity to the ground truth author story, organized by narrative categories. Overall, our personalization methods exhibit stronger alignment with the author story through the use of deeper symbolism, thematic richness, layered narratives, and expressive language, setting them apart from the Average Author method.

For \textbf{Plot}, our personalization methods incorporate multilayered narratives with reflective themes, moral ambiguity, and unresolved conflicts, making the stories more immersive and thought-provoking. Additionally, they effectively balance personal introspection with broader societal or external challenges, adding narrative complexity.

For \textbf{Creativity}, annotators highlight the richness of world-building, integration of cultural influences, and seamless blending of genres. The use of metaphors and symbolic elements further enhances thematic depth, aligning closely with the author's storytelling approach.

For \textbf{Development}, our personalization methods exhibit greater emotional depth, nuanced character relationships, and collaborative growth. Characters evolve through introspection and meaningful interactions, making their arcs more dynamic and engaging.

For \textbf{Language Use}, annotators emphasize vivid imagery, figurative language, and expressive tone. The incorporation of symbolism and poetic elements enhances the narrative impact, while a balance of lighthearted and serious moments makes the writing more compelling.

Overall, the analysis demonstrates the reasoning provided by the annotators to justify why our personalization methods more effectively capture the author's story-writing style compared to the Average Author method.

“Isn't there something we can do?” My voice cracked, and I hated how weak it sounded.......Gently, I laid him down, wrapping him in his favorite blanket. The sky was painted in hues of orange and pink, a beautiful contrast to the sorrow in my heart.  
I sat there, watching the sun dip below the horizon, and for the first time, I felt truly mortal. I realized that even heroes are not immune to the pain of loss, the fragility of life.......And as the night embraced the world, I knew that Ethan’s spirit would live on, a beacon of hope and courage in the heart of the world’s greatest hero. \\

The Hero's Journey: A Tale of Capes and Cereal
In the heart of the mythical city of Avalon Heights, where ancient heroes once strode and the skies shimmered with the glow of enchanted skyscrapers, the world’s greatest hero faced their most daunting foe: the frailty of life itself. The hero, known to the world as Titania, Queen of the Elements, held her son, Max, in her arms as the doctor delivered the news......  
The following day, a fictional news article took center stage in \textit{The Avalon Gazette}: "World's Greatest Hero Faces Greatest Challenge Yet: Parenting." %The headline, bold and unapologetic, reflected the public's insatiable curiosity about Titania’s personal struggles, as well as a societal debate on the ethics of super genes.  
In the midst of this storm, Titania's attempts to find normalcy became legendary. One particularly memorable morning, she decided to make Max a simple breakfast. But as she reached for the cereal, her powers—perhaps expressing her inner turmoil—manifested with unintended flair.  
A tornado of cereal erupted, swirling through the kitchen like a sugar-coated cyclone. "Mom," Max said, giggling despite his illness, "I think you just invented the breakfast hurricane......  
In a final act of empowerment, Titania founded a support group for super-powered families, advocating for genetic research with the same fervor she once reserved for battling cosmic threats. Her growth from feeling helpless to becoming a beacon of hope for others was a transformation as magical as Avalon Heights itself.  
Max, with dreams and hopes as boundless as the sky, taught her that heroism wasn't defined by powers but by the courage to embrace life’s uncertainties.

If anyone—a kitchen boy, a maid, or, Eru forbid, even the housekeeper Wynhild—had wandered near the pantry in the quiet hour just before dawn, they would have heard a muffled exchange from the depths of the storeroom:
“Try shifting this bowl here…”  
“Easy, you’re on me.”  
“Oh, does that bother you, my lady?”  
“Get off me; I can’t pull it out!......Lothíriel watched her royal husband with a half-incredulous, half-amused smile, as he held the large salami with the pride of a merchant at the autumn fair......To Lothíriel, he looked like a great golden-haired squirrel with the morsel stuffed in one cheek. How he could be both a fierce warrior and a wise sovereign as well, was a mystery she had yet to solve. His voice came out muffled as he swallowed.  
“You’re right, but if it ever gets out, I’ll say the sweet Queen of the Mark was struck by an irresistible craving for spiced meat in the dead of night—and who would deny anything to the future mother of the next royal heir?”

Éomer, King of Rohan, tiptoed through the dimly lit corridors of Meduseld, holding his breath as he reached the door to the pantry. He glanced back at Lothíriel, his queen, who followed close behind, stifling a giggle. The flickering torchlight cast playful shadows on the stone walls, and Éomer couldn’t help but feel a rush of exhilaration.  
“We shouldn’t be doing this,” Lothíriel whispered, though her eyes sparkled with mischief.  
“Ah, but where’s the fun in being King and Queen if we can’t indulge in a little late-night adventure?.....  
“You’ve always had a knack for adventure. It’s one of the reasons I fell in love with you.”  
Lothíriel’s expression softened, and she leaned in to kiss him, the taste of venison still on her lips. “And I love you for indulging my whims, even when they lead us to pilfering from our own pantry.”.....  
Éomer took Lothíriel’s hand, and they slipped out of the pantry, leaving behind only the echo of their laughter and the memory of a stolen moment in the heart of Rohan.  
“Next time,” Éomer whispered as they crept back to their chambers, “we’ll try the cheese.” \\

The moon cast a silvery glow over Meduseld, its light filtering through the high windows to illuminate the grand halls of the Golden Hall.

“Are you sure this is wise, my love?”  
“Wise? No. Fun? Absolutely,” she replied, her laughter a soft ripple in the silence.  
Éomer shook his head, a reluctant smile tugging at his lips as he watched her nimble fingers work to untie the savory prize. He was a warrior, a king, yet here he was, caught in the delightful absurdity of this secretive adventure, his heart light with the thrill of it all.  
“Besides,” Lothíriel continued, handing him a piece of the cured venison with a flourish, “what’s the worst that could happen? A tale of the gallant King brought low by his own appetite?”  
Éomer took the offered morsel, his grin widening as he tasted the rich, smoky flavor. “Perhaps the bards will sing of our escapades instead of my battles,” he mused, the thought surprisingly pleasing.  
.....As they slipped back into the corridors, leaving the pantry and its shadows behind, Éomer realized that it was not the venison he would remember, but the adventure, the laughter, and the love that had made the night truly unforgettable. \\

\# Chapter 1: Danger Close
*La Makan, 12:54 standard time*
Wind whistled through the close streets of *La Makan*, stirring grains of sand with all the effect of a man attempting to blow salt through eternity. It whipped around the corners of the alleys, rustling banners hanging from balconies and glassless windows. It looked for something, a thing it would never find..... Either way wouldn't end well for them. Our contact gave us an area, but not an address. We have, he checked his watch, five minutes until the distraction starts. We need to find them and get them out. Problem is, we don’t know what they look like, only that their house is pink. He glanced over his shoulder at the multicolored buildings. Any one of the scoured pink buildings could've been their one.  
“Vic, you knew Xitor the best of any of us. I’m trusting you to get us there. Everyone else, let's keep our hats on, kay?" \\

The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the dusty streets of the desert town of Vespera.
Time was of the essence; you had five minutes to locate your mysterious contact before chaos erupted. Failure was not an option.  
“Stay sharp,” you whispered to your team, your voice barely audible over the din of the market. 
"But time is short. We must act quickly."  
The weight of the moment settled over you like a heavy mantle. The fate of Vespera rested on the success of this meeting. As the figure began to speak, outlining the plan that would either save or doom the town, you couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The real challenge was yet to come. \\

The sun beat down mercilessly, casting a harsh glare on the town's whitewashed walls. The narrow alleys were alive with whispers and hurried footsteps, each person a part of the unfolding drama. My team and I moved through the bustling streets, the oppressive presence of royal guards a constant reminder of the stakes. We had five minutes—no more, no less—to locate the contact in the elusive pink house before chaos erupted. 
The memory of a previous mission flickered in my mind: the sun setting behind the dunes, the sound of distant drums, and the rush of adrenaline as we narrowly escaped a similar fate. That mission had gone wrong, leaving scars that still haunted my dreams. Failure was not an option today...  
Outside, the tension remained, a silent storm waiting to break. But for now, we had succeeded. The town's frenetic energy continued, unaware of our brief triumph. The banners flapped, the guards watched, and the countdown to chaos continued, but we had found our mark. The mission was still on course, and the desert town held its breath, waiting for the next move. \\

"Hospice." 
Once the word is uttered aloud, there is a seismic shift. You will feel it.  
Like a (very short) thread through the eye of a needle, swiftly in and swiftly out.  
The air itself becomes thin, steely.  
At the periphery of your vision, an immediate dimming. The penumbra begins to shrink. In time, it will become a tunnel. Ever diminishing. Until the remaining light is small enough to be cupped in two hands. And then it will be extinguished.  
For when "hospice" is spoken, the fact is at last acknowledged: There is no hope.  
No hope. These words are obscene, unspeakable.... Well, I will try!  
When he is at home, possibly his appetite will return. When I am the one to prepare his food, his appetite will return, I am sure.  
Of course, family will come to visit. Adult children, grandchildren. Relatives, friends. Colleagues from the university. Neighbors. Old friends from grammar school he hasn’t seen in fifty years. Some surprises for him—I will negotiate with the imagination of a theatre director.  
Not merely hospice but our hospice. Not sad but joyous, a honeymoon.  
We will be happy there, in our own home. Both of us.  
For both of us, the "final days" will be a honeymoon. I vow.  
In fact, nothing remotely like this will happen. How could you have imagined it would!

"When the word 'hospice' is first spoken, it feels like the air itself changes, heavy with finality...It’s her mother, Marjorie, who the doctor is addressing, but the word reverberates through Clara’s own heart, a dull thud of inevitability."  
Marjorie stares at the doctor with a mix of resignation and defiance, her once-vibrant green eyes now clouded by the long battle with illness..... Her touch is light, almost ethereal, and Clara feels a sudden rush of tears she struggles to hold back.  
“Clara,” Marjorie says softly, her voice barely a whisper. “Do you remember the garden?”  
Clara nods, unable to speak. The garden had been Marjorie’s sanctuary, a riot of color and life where she had spent countless hours tending to roses, tulips, and wildflowers......  
Marjorie’s decline is gradual but inevitable, and Clara feels the weight of each passing day. She continues to read to her mother, to sit by her side, and to hold her hand through the long nights.
One crisp morning, as the first frost dusts the garden in a delicate shimmer, Marjorie slips away. Clara is by her side, her hand still entwined with her mother’s, and she feels a profound stillness settle over her..... \\

Every morning, Nurse Clara began her rounds at St. Mary's Hospice, a place where the word "hospice" hung in the air like a thick, unspoken truth. Her day started with the same cycle: a clipboard in hand, she moved from room to room, her steps echoing softly in the quiet corridors. Each door held a story, a life in its final chapters, and as she entered each room, she would ask the same question, "How are you feeling today?"  
The responses were as varied as the lives they represented. Some patients greeted her with a weary smile, others with a silent nod. But there was one patient, Mr. Thompson, who never failed to reply with a simple, "I'm just waiting."  
Clara had come to understand that "waiting" was an ambiguous term within these walls. It held a duality of meaning: waiting for relief, waiting for peace, waiting for the inevitable.....Clara knew that the work was not about erasing the pain or the grief, but about finding moments of grace within it. It was about guiding others, and herself, to a place where hope could be redefined—not as a denial of reality, but as an acceptance of it, and the peace that such acceptance could bring.  
With each cycle of her rounds, Clara realized that the light had always been there, waiting to be uncovered, and that she had the power to help others see it too. \\

\subsection{Qualitative Examples}  
We present qualitative examples from our human annotation process, covering various cases: instances where all annotators prefer Writing Sheet, all prefer Average Author, or select `Tie.' Additionally, we include an example where annotators disagree, choosing different winners, highlighting the challenging and subjective nature of the annotation task.

\paragraph{All annotators prefer Writing Sheet:}
Table~\ref{tab:exp-all-correct} shows an example where all three annotators prefer the Writing Sheet method over the Average Author for similarity to the author story of a Reddit author. The annotators highlight several key aspects that make the Writing Sheet story more aligned with the ground-truth author story: (1) The Writing Sheet method incorporates humor and satire, using phrases such as ``a tale of capes and cereal,'' ``invented breakfast hurricane,'' and ``World's Greatest Hero Faces Greatest Challenge Yet: Parenting,'' which mirror the lighthearted and satirical tone of the author story. (2) Unlike the Average Author story, which concludes with the son’s death, the Writing Sheet story reinterprets the prompt, portraying Titania as an advocate for families with special children. This aligns with the ground-truth author story’s approach, where the son engages with coding and the narrative avoids a sorrowful ending. (3) In terms of language style, the Writing Sheet story employs imaginative elements such as ``The Hero's Journey: A Tale of Capes and Cereal'' and ``The Avalon Gazette,'' which parallel the ground-truth author story's unconventional use of computer programming references, such as ``Syntax Error: Unexpected Power.''

\paragraph{All annotators prefer Average Author:}
Table~\ref{tab:exp-all-wrong} shows an example where all three annotators prefer the Average Author method over the Writing Sheet for similarity to the author story of an AO3 author. The primary reason cited by annotators is that the Writing Sheet method introduces a strong internal conflict for the king, portraying him as guilty or hesitant about sneaking into the kitchen for a late-night snack. His character is depicted as struggling with the decision, given his stature as a formidable ruler expected to lead battles. Additionally, the Writing Sheet creates a sharp contrast between the king and queen, with the queen depicted as joyful and mischievous, encouraging the king to abandon his guilt.  

In contrast, both the ground-truth Author Story and the Average Author story emphasize the playful banter and affectionate dynamic between the king and queen, focusing on the shared experience of sneaking into the kitchen rather than introducing introspection or internal conflict. This shift in focus stems from the Writing Sheet being influenced by the author's past writing history, where internal conflicts are a recurring theme. However, in this case, character development—being more writing-prompt-specific than broader categories like creativity or language use—did not transfer well. The author’s original story prioritizes external actions and lighthearted interactions rather than deep introspection, leading to a mismatch between the Writing Sheet’s personalized adaptation and the intended tone of the new prompt.

\paragraph{All Annotators Choose Tie:}  
Table~\ref{tab:exp-all-tie} shows an example where all three annotators select `Tie' for similarity to the author story of a Storium author. The primary reason is that both the Average Author story and the Writing Sheet story deviate significantly from the ground-truth author story in terms of plot. The ground-truth story adopts an open-ended approach to both character development and plot, where character relationships remain undefined, and the narrative focuses on anticipation rather than action.  

In contrast, the Average Author story follows a conventional narrative arc, featuring fast-paced dialogue and character interactions that build tension and lead to resolution. Similarly, the Writing Sheet story also resolves the narrative but differs from the Average Author method by emphasizing past missions and their consequences, aligning with the author’s tendency to reference character backstories. However, both methods fail to capture the open-ended nature of the original story. This misalignment in plot structure leads all three annotators to select `Tie' for this example.

\paragraph{All Annotators Disagree on the Winner:}  
Table~\ref{tab:exp-all-diff} shows an example where all annotators select different winners for similarity to the author story of a New Yorker author. The ground-truth author story depicts the protagonist’s husband in his final days, exploring familial bonds and the emotional depth of their relationship while infusing a deeper metaphorical meaning into the term “hospice.” The story is rich in subtext and exhibits several distinctive traits of the author, such as cyclic plot structures and the deliberate repetition of phrases like “Adult children, grandchildren. Relatives, friends. Colleagues...” and “Not merely hospice but our hospice. Not sad but joyous, a honeymoon.”

The annotator who selected Writing Sheet as the winner states, \texttt{``Although Average Author and the Author Story depict relationships between close family members, Writing Sheet is more similar to the Author Story in Plot, Creativity, and Development by exploring the meaning and emotional responses to the term hospice.''} This annotator highlights the presence of subtext in the Writing Sheet story and its attempts to mimic the author's cyclic style—“Each door held a story, a life in its final chapter... she would ask the same question...” and “Clara knew that work was not about erasing the pain or the grief, but about finding moments of grace within it...”.

The annotator who selected Average Author as the winner states, \texttt{``Average Author aligns more closely with the Author's Story in terms of Plot and Language Use. This is because both stories center on someone taking care of a family member in their own home, and growing from a lack of peace into a sense of peace, which is expressed through the choice of language. Writing Sheet also indicates a development from lack of peace to acceptance, but the familial tie is what pushes Average Author over the top.''}

The annotator who selected `Tie' states, \texttt{``I think it will be hard for one of these to resemble the Author Story since it was so unique. In all, the two AI stories were much more like each other than the Author Story.''}

Overall, this example highlights the subjective nature of annotator preferences and the inherent difficulty of our annotation task which also explains the poor inter-annotator agreement.
