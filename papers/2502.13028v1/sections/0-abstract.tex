\begin{abstract} 
Personalization has become essential for improving user experience in interactive writing and educational applications, yet its potential in story generation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline for \emph{personalized story generation}. Our approach first infers an author's implicit story-writing characteristics from their past work and organizes them into an Author Writing Sheet that is inspired by narrative theory. The second stage uses this sheet to simulate the authorâ€™s persona through tailored persona descriptions and personalized story writing rules. To enable and validate our approach, we construct \dataname, a dataset of 590 stories from 64 authors across 5 distinct sources that reflect diverse story-writing settings. A head-to-head comparison with a non-personalized baseline demonstrates our pipeline's effectiveness in generating high-quality personalized stories. Our personalized stories achieve a 75\% win rate (versus 14\% for the baseline and 11\% ties) in capturing authors' writing style based on their past works. Human evaluation highlights the high quality of our Author Writing Sheet and provides valuable insights into the personalized story generation task. Notable takeaways are that writings from certain sources, such as Reddit, are easier to personalize than others, like AO3, while narrative aspects, like Creativity and Language Use, are easier to personalize than others, like Plot.
