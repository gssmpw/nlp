We introduce the task of personalizing authors' story-writing styles across five sources with a two-stage approach that infers implicit characteristics as an Author Writing Sheet to guide LLMs via persona descriptions and story rules. Evaluations show that summarizing an authorâ€™s history via a Writing Sheet or Summary improves faithfulness to writing history and similarity to the ground truth. Personalization is more effective for sources with diverse writing prompts and distinctive author traits (e.g., Reddit, New Yorker) and for narrative categories like Creativity and Language Use, which are less writing prompt-dependent.
