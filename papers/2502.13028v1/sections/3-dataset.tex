\section{Dataset Collection and Description}

To facilitate our analysis of \emph{personalized} story generation, we ensemble \dataname, a novel dataset consisting of 590 stories written by 64 authors. To the best of our knowledge, \dataname~is the first dataset that identifies and connects multiple stories written by the same author. See Table~\ref{tab:compare-datasets} for comparison with existing datasets. 

\paragraph{Data Sources:} We include five diverse story-writing sources, namely
\textbf{(1) Reddit}, %\footnote{\url{https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/}} 
featuring stories from r/WritingPrompts, a widely-used resource for amateur story-writing research \citep{fan-etal-2018-hierarchical},   
\textbf{(2) AO3}, %\footnote{\url{https://archiveofourown.org/}} 
featuring fanfiction based on popular franchises such as \textit{Harry Potter} and \textit{Sherlock Holmes},   \textbf{(3) Storium}, %\footnote{\url{https://storium.cs.umass.edu/}} 
featuring collaborative stories \citep{akoury-etal-2020-storium}, 
\textbf{(4) N.Magazine}, %\footnote{\url{https://www.narrativemagazine.com/}} 
featuring professionally polished stories by authors such as Barry Gifford, and finally
\textbf{(5) New Yorker},  %\footnote{\url{https://www.newyorker.com/}} 
featuring expert-level storytelling from renowned authors such as Haruki Murakami.


\paragraph{Preprocessing:} To ensure high-quality and diverse content, we impose constraints on word length (ranging from 500 to 1500 words), limit publication dates to post-November 2023, and exclude explicit material. To standardize formatting, non-Reddit stories are supplemented with writing prompts generated by GPT-4o and manually reviewed for accuracy. Stories are split chronologically based on their submission timestamps, with 70\% used for \emph{profiling} writing characteristics and 30\% for \emph{generation} (see  Appendix~\ref{app:dataset} for details).

\paragraph{Dataset size:} Our dataset is limited  in size due to data crawling policies that restrict large-scale data collection for analysis\footnote{\url{https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/25888}}. We note that recent storywriting datasets such as TELL ME A STORY \citep{huot2024agents} and TTCW \citep{chakrabarty2024art} have conducted analyses on a comparable number of stories (Table~\ref{tab:compare-datasets}).

\caption{Comparison of our dataset with existing story-writing datasets. \ding{55} indicates no Author IDs associated with stories, and $\sim$ denotes having Author IDs but not having explicit links between them. Our dataset spans diverse settings and links stories by the same author, enabling research on personalized story generation.}
