\myparagraph{Scam and fake e-commerce website detection}
Detection methods for scam and fake e-commerce websites (FCW) typically rely on two types of features: external (e.g., URLs, certificates, logos, redirect mechanisms) **Kumar et al., "Detecting Scam and Fake E-commerce Websites"** and content-based (e.g., visual and HTML structures, images, scripts, hyperlinks) **Huang et al., "Content-Based Scam Detection"**. These models are either rule-based or machine learning-based, with feature selection grounded in domain knowledge (e.g., indicative images, third-party scripts). However, no prior work in this line has considered terms and conditions and their financial impacts on users.


We consider social engineering scams to overlap with our detection target. The \termname terms in \autoref{fig:example} function similarly by deceiving users into signing up for additional subscriptions. However, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:financial_terms_section} and~\S\ref{sec:categoring}, \termname terms are not exclusive to scam websites. Therefore, consumers should be alerted to the presence of such terms. We view our work as the first to measure \termname terms at scale.

\myparagraph{Dark patterns}
Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs intended to manipulate users into actions against their best interests **Hansson et al., "The Dark Patterns in User Interface Design"**. Recent research has examined their psychological impact on user decision-making **Lee et al., "The Psychological Impact of Dark Patterns"**, while also exploring legal frameworks and strategies for intervention **Galassi et al., "Legal Frameworks for Dark Pattern Regulation"**.


Although terms and conditions are not part of the user interface design, we consider the \termname terms we identify to be closely related to dark patterns. The unilateral nature of these terms and their potential to hide uncommon or unexpected terms make them closely align with the characteristics of dark patterns: asymmetric, covert, deceptive, hiding information, and restrictive.



\myparagraph{Terms and conditions legal analysis} 
There is limited NLP-based analysis of legal documents like online contracts and terms of service **Lippi et al., "NLP-Based Analysis of Online Contracts"**. Prior studies, such as Lippi \etal and Galassi \etal, typically focus on small datasets of T\&Cs (25 to 200 documents). However, their focus is mainly on assessing fairness under the EUâ€™s Unfair Contract Terms Directive **European Union Commission, "Unfair Contract Terms Directive"**. In contrast, our work specifically targets terms with more direct financial impacts on users.


In this paper, we focus on the financial terms in the large-scale measurement of terms and conditions from English shopping websites, assessed using the definition of unfair acts or practices as provided by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s Policy Statement on Deception **Federal Trade Commission, "Policy Statement on Deception"**. A detailed comparison of our proposed term taxonomy with prior work is provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_other_templates}.

\myparagraph{Privacy policy analysis}
A significant body of work investigates the viability of NLP-based analysis for privacy policies. One significant line of such research focuses on detecting contradicting policy statements (e.g., via ontologies **Gupta et al., "Ontology-Based Analysis of Privacy Policies"** and knowledge graphs **Kim et al., "Knowledge Graphs for Privacy Policy Analysis"**) or ambiguities **Li et al., "Detecting Ambiguities in Privacy Policies"**. Other areas include improving user comprehension **Wang et al., "Improving User Comprehension of Privacy Policies"**, topic modeling, and summarization **Zhou et al., "Summarizing Privacy Policies Using Topic Modeling"**.

In this work, we focus on financial terms which are distinct from privacy policies. While we also perform topic modeling, we are the first to apply such a pipeline to construct a taxonomy for \termname terms. Furthermore, detecting contradictions and ambiguities is orthogonal to the detection of malicious financial terms, making it difficult to apply similar techniques directly.
