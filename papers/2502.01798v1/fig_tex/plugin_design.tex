\Description[Diagram of \platform plugin workflow.]
 {This figure illustrates the design of the \platform plugin, which detects unfavorable financial terms on shopping websites. 
 (1) When a user activates the plugin, it sends the current page URL to the backend.
 (2) The backend crawls and extracts the terms and conditions associated with the page.
 (3) A pluggable LLM module processes the extracted data to detect potentially unfair financial terms.
 (4) If any unfavorable terms are identified, the plugin generates an alert and displays it on the front end to warn the user.}
