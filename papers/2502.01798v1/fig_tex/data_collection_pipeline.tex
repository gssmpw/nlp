 \caption{\textbf{\textit{TermMiner} (data collection and topic modeling pipeline)}---(1) Measurement module: collects shopping websites from the Tranco list and fake e-commerce website datasets, extracting English terms and conditions from shopping websites. (2) Term classification module: classifies the terms into binary categories based on a given prompt. (3) Topic modeling module: leverages t5-base Sentence Transformer and DBSCAN for clustering. Topics are derived from the clusters using a combination of manual inspection and GPT-4o, employing a snowball sampling method~\citep{goodman1961snowball} to iteratively develop a topic template of terms.}
 \Description[Pipeline for collecting and analyzing unfavorable financial terms.]
 {This figure presents the \textit{TermMiner} pipeline for collecting and analyzing unfavorable financial terms from shopping websites. 
 (1) The measurement module gathers websites from the Tranco list and known fake e-commerce datasets, extracting English terms and conditions from shopping sites.
 (2) The term classification module processes extracted terms, categorizing them into binary labels based on a predefined prompt.
 (3) The topic modeling module applies the T5-base Sentence Transformer and DBSCAN clustering to group terms into topics. These topics are refined through a combination of manual inspection and GPT-4o, using a snowball sampling approach to iteratively develop a comprehensive topic taxonomy.}
