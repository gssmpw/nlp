\section{\TermName Term Detection System}
\label{sec:detection_section}


\input{fig_tex/plugin_design}

In this section, we introduce \platform, a Chrome plugin designed to detect \termname terms on e-commerce websites. Built upon the insights gained from the \termname term template and topic modeling analysis, \platform enables efficient identification of potentially harmful financial terms, providing users with real-time protection against \termname terms.


\subsection{System Overview}



Our detection system is illustrated in \autoref{fig:plugin}. When a user activates \platform, the URL of the current page is sent to the backend. Upon receipt, the backend crawler collects the terms and conditions pages. These term pages, along with the HTML content of the current page (and a screenshot if paired with a multimodal LLM), are preprocessed and sent to the pluggable LLM module for further analysis. If the LLM module flags any terms as \termname terms, the alert generator sends the identified terms back to the frontend, where they are displayed to the user.








\myparagraph{Pluggable LLM Module} 
We parse the current page to determine if it is a payment page, improving alert accuracy by cross-checking terms with payment page details. For example, in \autoref{fig:example}, the term ``You will be charged \$6.85 for the shipping and handling of your free smartwatch'' aligns with the payment page, making it less concerning than the Immediate Automatic Subscription term, ``you will receive a subscription to the FitHabit Fitness App for only \$86,'' which is not shown on the payment page.

The Pluggable LLM Module, a key part of our system, analyzes both terms and conditions pages and the current webpage. By keeping the LLM decoupled from the backend, we allow flexibility in integrating different models. This enables multimodal models like GPT-4, GPT-4o~\citep{openai2023gpt4}, or LLaMA 3.2~\citep{llama3.2-90B-vision} to process screenshots and terms, or text-based models such as GPT-3.5~\citep{gpt35}, LLaMA~\citep{touvron2023llama}, Mistral~\citep{jiang2023mistral}, or Gemma~\citep{team2024gemma} to analyze HTML and terms.

\myparagraph{Backend Core Module}
The alert generator receives flagged \termname terms and checks if the user is on a payment page. If so, it only flags terms not displayed on that page. GPT-4o analyzes page screenshots to mimic the user's experience and guard against adversarial text-based evasion. When the page is not a payment page, all flagged financial terms are shown. Since returns and refunds are rarely disclosed on payment pages, our evaluation in~\S\ref{sec:eva} focuses on scenarios where the user is not on a payment page and seeks to assess financial risks in advance.
