\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:limitation}


We introduce \textit{TermMiner}, an open-source automated pipeline for collecting and modeling unfavorable financial terms in shopping websites with limited human involvement. Researchers can utilize our tools to examine various aspects of web-based text, such as readability or accessibility, and to conduct longitudinal studies. 
 


\platform assumes that the financial terms in question are not \textit{adversarially perturbed}. Recent studies have highlighted LLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak and prompt injection attacks~\citep{zou2023universal, liu2023autodan, greshake2023not}. These attacks can result in incorrect outputs. However, for T\&Cs, such adversarial perturbations are likely to be subjected to manual scrutiny, particularly in post-complaint scenarios, such as legal disputes~\citep{celsius}. We leave the exploration of adversarial robustness in LLM-based \termname term detection for future work.
