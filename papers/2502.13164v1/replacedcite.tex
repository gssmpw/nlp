Over the past few decades, natural language processing (NLP) has undergone significant evolution, with notable breakthroughs in data-driven and symbolic approaches to query resolution systems. The groundwork for early NLP research was established by symbolic approaches, which depend on rule-based systems and organized knowledge. Conversely, the introduction of deep learning and massive data processing has caused a shift in emphasis towards data-driven approaches that utilize machine learning and statistical models. The main advancements in data-driven and symbolic natural language processing (NLP) approaches are reviewed in this section, along with their advantages and disadvantages. The transition towards combining both paradigms for more reliable and effective query resolution systems is also discussed.

\subsection{Symbolic NLP Approaches}

Rule-based systems and symbolic reasoning are used in symbolic approaches to natural language processing (NLP) in order to generate and interpret human language. These approaches, which are distinguished by their reliance on predetermined rules and organized knowledge bases, have long been a mainstay of NLP research. 

ELIZA, created by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s, is one of the most renowned early systems in symbolic NLP. By employing pattern matching and substitution techniques, ELIZA was able to replicate human communication, showcasing the potential of rule-based systems to imitate social interaction ____. ELIZA established the foundation for more complex symbolic systems despite being simple by today's standards.

Symbolic natural language processing (NLP) was further enhanced in the 1970s and 1980s by systems such as SHRDLU and LUNAR. The potential of combining language understanding with a well-defined domain was demonstrated by Terry Winograd's SHRDLU, which could comprehend and carry out commands in a block world ____. William A. developed LUNAR. Woods showed how to use a structured database and natural language interface to provide answers to inquiries regarding the geological examination of moon rocks ____.

Machine learning techniques have recently been incorporated into symbolic natural language processing (NLP). Systems that understand and respond to complicated queries, like IBM Watson, use a combination of statistical techniques and symbolic reasoning. Watson's achievements demonstrated the efficiency of hybrid strategies that blend statistical models' flexibility with symbolic methods' accuracy ____.

Despite their successes, scalability and flexibility remain major challenges for symbolic approaches. Rule-based systems are inflexible by design, making it challenging to accommodate the enormous variety and ambiguity in natural language. NLP research has consequently moved toward more statistical and data-driven methodologies.

\subsection{Data-Driven NLP Approaches}

Deep learning has completely changed natural language processing (NLP) by making it possible to create models that can learn from massive datasets directly. Because of these data-driven approaches' superior performance on various tasks, symbolic methods have been largely replaced. 

Among the most important models in this paradigm change is the Transformer architecture, which Vaswani et al. introduced. ____. Unlike earlier architectures, the Transformer model processes input sequences using self-attention mechanisms, enabling it to capture contextual information and long-range dependencies better. The Transformer is now the foundation of many modern NLP models, such as GPT and BERT.

Developed by Devlin et al., BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a noteworthy development in pre-trained language models ____. BERT is incredibly useful for a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification ____ and question answering ____ because it is built to comprehend a word's context in both directions. Its broad adoption in academia and industry can be attributed to its ability to be tailored for particular tasks. 

Likewise, OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series has proven to be exceptionally proficient in language modeling and text generation ____. With only a small amount of task-specific training, GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, is capable of executing tasks like creative writing and code generation. Its outstanding performance highlights how large-scale pre-trained models can be generalized across a variety of NLP applications.

Other noteworthy contributions, besides BERT and GPT, are T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models). Peters et al. developed ELMo, by taking into account the complete sentence context, developed deep contextualized word representations that dramatically enhanced performance on a variety of NLP tasks ____. Raffel et al. introduced T5 and showed that a single strategy can produce state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks by framing all NLP tasks as text-to-text problems ____. 

Even with these models' success, there are still problems. There is still a lot of research and discussion going on regarding topics like model interpretability, data privacy, and the possibility of producing biased or harmful content. The pursuit of more resilient and moral AI systems has led to continuous endeavors to enhance the accountability and transparency of data-driven natural language processing models ____.

Furthermore, there's a growing interest in combining data-driven and symbolic approaches to take advantage of both paradigms' advantages. The goal of hybrid systems is to bring together the data-driven models' learning capabilities with the rule-based accuracy of symbolic methods. Hybrid techniques, for instance, have been applied to enhance neural networks' interpretability and reasoning powers, allowing them to function better on tasks requiring structured knowledge and logical inference ____.

Novel approaches for transforming natural language into data visualizations have been investigated in the context of recent developments in the NL2VIS field. To produce visualizations from natural language queries, Maddigan and Susnjak's Chat2VIS system makes use of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Codex, and GPT-3 ____. This method addresses the inherent ambiguities and underspecifications of natural language by uniquely using prompt engineering, providing a dependable end-to-end solution for creating visualizations. Traditional NL2VIS systems, which frequently rely on specially designed models and manually crafted grammar rules, are much more expensive and complex than Chat2VIS. 

Chat2VIS can interpret user queries and produce visualizations with high accuracy and efficiency thanks to the use of pre-trained LLMs. The system does have certain drawbacks, though. The non-deterministic nature of LLMs leads to variability in plot generation, and there is room for improvement in the consistency of plot aesthetics, such as background colors and grid lines.

\subsection{Multi-Agent AI Systems Overview} In multi-agent AI systems, several intelligent agents collaborate to accomplish challenging tasks. Each agent acts independently based on both local and collective information ____. These systems are essential in domains that call for decentralized decision-making and problem-solving. For example, distributed data is used by federated learning systems to facilitate collaborative learning without sacrificing privacy \mbox{____}. Agents in reinforcement learning multi-agent systems (RL-MAS) efficiently adapt to changing environments by learning the best course of action through trial and error \mbox{____}. By mimicking natural processes, swarm intelligence models—like particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization—solve optimization problems and exhibit strong problem-solving abilities by cooperatively exploring a variety of solutions \mbox{____}. For automated negotiation and resource allocation, negotiation-based models handle conflict resolution and agreement-making between agents with different goals \mbox{____}. By combining policy-based and value-based reinforcement learning techniques, actor-critic models stand out among these for complex query resolution tasks. In these models, the critic assesses the actions proposed by the actor, allowing for effective and flexible decision-making \mbox{____}. Because of its capacity to iteratively improve and optimize responses based on ongoing evaluative feedback, this architecture works especially well in complex query resolution tasks, offering a competitive edge in settings that require a high degree of accuracy and flexibility.

Our suggested framework incorporates a multi-agent actor-critic model that blends sophisticated deep learning techniques with symbolic reasoning, building on Chat2VIS's strengths. By addressing the shortcomings of both data-driven and symbolic approaches, this hybrid strategy seeks to offer a more reliable answer for data analysis and query resolution. In contrast to Chat2VIS, our system uses a Critic Generative AI to examine and improve the generated scripts, guaranteeing their accuracy and efficiency. The contextual analysis and thorough reports offered by the Expert Analysis Generative AI further enhance the overall practicality and usefulness of the visualizations. An analysis of the systems discussed is presented in a qualitative comparison in Table \ref{tab:comparison}.
