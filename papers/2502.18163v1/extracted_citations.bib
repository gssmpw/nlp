    abstract = {Truck overtaking maneuvers on freeways are inefficient, risky and promote high potential for conflict between road users. Collective perception based on V2X communication allow coordination with all parties to reduce the negative impact and could be installed in a timely manner compared to automation. However, the prerequisite for the success of this system is a human-machine interface that the driver can easily operate, trusts and accepts. In this approach, a user-centered conception and design of a human-machine interface for cooperative truck overtaking maneuver on freeways is presented. The development process is separated in two steps: After a prototype is build based on task analysis it is initially evaluated and improved iteratively with a heuristic evaluation by experts. The final prototype is tested in a simulator study with 30 truck drivers. The study provides initial feedback regarding the drivers' attitudes towards such a system and how it can be further improved.},

    abstract = {We present CoastMaster, a smartphone application that serves as an ambient speedometer and driving game display. Our work is motivated by the need to re-engage drivers in the driving task, e.g., in situations where manoeuvering the vehicle is straightforward and does not require high levels of engagement. CoastMaster supports drivers during speed limit changes by (a) re-engaging them in the driving task, and; (b) providing feedback on driving behaviour. In a simulator study (N=24), we compare a gamified and a non-gamified interface with regards to user experience, driving performance, and visual distraction. Our results indicate an increase in hedonic quality and driver engagement as well as a decrease in speed violations through the gamified condition. At the same time, the gamified version leads to longer glances towards the display suggesting visual distraction. Our study findings inform specific design recommendations for ambient interfaces and gamified driving.},

    abstract = {In the time of highly automated driving, the role of drivers is shifting from actual driving to being a passenger, supervisor, or a cooperative partner. In the case of cooperative driver-vehicle interaction, new interfaces have to be developed, for instance to approve maneuvers. We implemented two different interaction techniques (clicking and holding down a button) to approve an overtaking maneuver on rural roads. We conducted a driving simulator study to investigate the effects of the interaction techniques on a touchscreen regarding usability. Our results suggest that a simple click provides better usability. Finally, we highlight future research directions that should be considered for the design of such interfaces for cooperative driver-vehicle interaction.},

    abstract = {Automated vehicles will eventually operate safely without the need of human supervision and fallback, nevertheless, scenarios will remain that are managed more efficiently by a human driver. A common approach to overcome such weaknesses is to shift control to the driver. Control transitions are challenging due to human factor issues like post-automation behavior changes. We thus investigated cooperative overtaking wherein driver and vehicle complement each other: drivers support the vehicle to perceive the traffic scene and decide when to execute a maneuver whereas the system steers. We explored two maneuver approval and cancel techniques on touchscreens, and show that cooperative overtaking is feasible, both interaction techniques provide good usability and were preferred over manual maneuver execution. However, participants disregarded rear traffic in more complex situations. Consequently, system weaknesses can be overcome with cooperation, but drivers should be assisted by an adaptive system.},
