%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

    abstract = {Automated vehicles will eventually operate safely without the need of human supervision and fallback, nevertheless, scenarios will remain that are managed more efficiently by a human driver. A common approach to overcome such weaknesses is to shift control to the driver. Control transitions are challenging due to human factor issues like post-automation behavior changes. We thus investigated cooperative overtaking wherein driver and vehicle complement each other: drivers support the vehicle to perceive the traffic scene and decide when to execute a maneuver whereas the system steers. We explored two maneuver approval and cancel techniques on touchscreens, and show that cooperative overtaking is feasible, both interaction techniques provide good usability and were preferred over manual maneuver execution. However, participants disregarded rear traffic in more complex situations. Consequently, system weaknesses can be overcome with cooperation, but drivers should be assisted by an adaptive system.},

In the case of cooperative driver-vehicle interaction, new interfaces have to be developed, for instance to approve maneuvers. We implemented two different interaction techniques (clicking and holding down a button) to approve an overtaking maneuver on rural roads. We conducted a driving simulator study to investigate the effects of the interaction techniques on a touchscreen regarding usability. Our results suggest that a simple click provides better usability. Finally, we highlight future research directions that should be considered for the design of such interfaces for cooperative driver-vehicle interaction.},

A potentially higher added value to reduce road trauma may be hidden in utilising emerging technologies, such as headset-delivered virtual reality (VR). However, there is no study to analyse the application of such VR in road safety research systematically. Using the PRISMA protocol, our study identified 39 papers presented at conferences or published in scholarly journals. In those sources, we found evidence of VR's applicability in studies involving different road users (drivers, pedestrians, cyclists and passengers). A number of articles were concerned with providing evidence around the potential adverse effects of VR, such as simulator sickness. Other work compared VR with conventional simulators. VR was also contributing to the emerging field of autonomous vehicles. However, few studies leveraged the opportunities that VR presents to positively influence the involved road users' behaviour. Based on our findings, we identified pathways for future research.}

CoastMaster supports drivers during speed limit changes by (a) re-engaging them in the driving task, and; (b) providing feedback on driving behaviour. In a simulator study (N=24), we compare a gamified and a non-gamified interface with regards to user experience, driving performance, and visual distraction. Our results indicate an increase in hedonic quality and driver engagement as well as a decrease in speed violations through the gamified condition. At the same time, the gamified version leads to longer glances towards the display suggesting visual distraction. Our study findings inform specific design recommendations for ambient interfaces and gamified driving.},

Collective perception based on V2X communication allow coordination with all parties to reduce the negative impact and could be installed in a timely manner compared to automation. However, the prerequisite for the success of this system is a human-machine interface that the driver can easily operate, trusts and accepts. In this approach, a user-centered conception and design of a human-machine interface for cooperative truck overtaking maneuver on freeways is presented. The development process is separated in two steps: After a prototype is build based on task analysis it is initially evaluated and improved iteratively with a heuristic evaluation by experts. The final prototype is tested in a simulator study with 30 truck drivers. The study provides initial feedback regarding the drivers' attitudes towards such a system and how it can be further improved.},

Based on information about the traffic situation, the proposed system relies on a probabilistic model of driver's uncertainty to classify whether a driver is unsure or not and on a safety analysis based on driver's preferences to suggest appropriate overtaking actions, which together trigger corresponding advices on the Human Machine Interface. Different to existing lane change assistance systems using traffic light colors to encode criticality and warn accordingly, the proposed system uses colored abstract faces with emotional expressions encoding both criticality and driver's uncertainty to provide suggestions to either overtake or decelerate. The proposed system has been implemented in a driving simulator. The qualitative results of a not yet analyzed evaluation study with 20 participants show that the proposed system is more accepted and trusted than reference systems that do not consider driver's uncertainty.},
