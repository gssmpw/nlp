\section{Conclusion and Limitation}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduce a space rotation with basis transformation~(SOBA) method, designed to overcome the limitations of the training-free TTA paradigm in the feature space. By leveraging SOBA, we perform a rotation and reconstruction of the original feature space, thereby tackling the adaptation issues that arise from distribution changes during testing. Experimental results across various benchmarks have demonstrated that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches but is also easy to implement and highly efficient. Nonetheless, our method still requires refinement, as the effectiveness of the space reconstruction relies on pseudo-labels, and resolving this dependency is left for future work.
