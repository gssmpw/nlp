\section{Method \label{sec:method}}
% In this section, we present the key elements of our methodology. We first describe the BIOSCAN-5M dataset and its partitioning scheme. We then introduce our two proposed components: biologically-inspired pretext tasks that effectively capture the inherent characteristics of DNA barcode sequences, and a masked auto-encoding architecture that addresses the representational limitations of masking approaches in DNA foundation models.

In this section, we first describe the BIOSCAN-5M dataset and its partitioning scheme. Next, we introduce BarcodeMAE, our proposed model that adapts the masked auto-encoder architecture to address the representational limitations of masking approaches for DNA foundation models.
