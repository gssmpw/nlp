\section{Limitation}

One of the main limitations of \ours{}, like all token-dropping based method, does not support explicit logit outputs for all input tokens, and hence we focus on generative evaluation. Given that we have the full knowledge of the speculator, we advertise for more principled method to estimate token importance beyond attention scores. Finally, we believe that a robust algorithm that determines how many tokens are required for a given prompt will be of great use for \ours{}.
