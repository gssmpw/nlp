\section{Ablation Studies}
\label{sm:ablation}

Here, we perform ablation experiments on WCMHA in both Transformer and \emph{Powerformer}.
For both models, we examine the effects of different masks (\fpl, \fspl, and \fbwn) and various time decays $\alpha$.
We do not perform the same amount of experiments for each model and mask pairing due to poor performance.
In the remainder of this section, we provide detailed tables of the MSE and MAE scores, as well as plots of the attention scores and weights.
In the last subsection (\ref{sm:learnable_decay_times}), we investigate the effects of making $\alpha$ a learnable parameter.
