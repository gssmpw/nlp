    \caption{Results with Google's System 1 (Gemini-2.0-flash) and 2 (Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking) Models. We report the mean MSE and standard deviation over three repeated experiments. Reasoning strategies that outperform the direct System 1 are highlighted in \better{green}, while those that perform worse or have similar performance (due to higher computational cost) are marked in \worse{red}. In "Win System 1," we present the probability of each reasoning strategy outperforming System 1 across datasets. We again observe that \better{only the self-consistency strategy consistently works}, while \worse{the System 2 strategy consistently fails}.}
