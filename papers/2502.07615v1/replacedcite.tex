\textbf{Geometry Reconstruction Based on 3DGS}: 
To enhance the geometry of 3DGS representations, 
some studies____ 
focus on integrating mesh or SDF representations with 3DGS.
____ improve the splitting of 3DGS under the guidance of
mesh representation and deformation gradients. 
%
A hybrid representation that integrates 3DGS with mesh, 
allowing 3DGS to be modified as a mesh, is introduced in 
____.
%
Mani-GS____ binds Gaussian and shape-aware triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly.
%
3DGSR____ combines a signed distance field (SDF) 
network with 3DGS to enhance geometry quality, 
aligning the SDF networkâ€™s geometry with that of 3DGS.
%
NeuSG____ utilizes point clouds from 
3DGS to regulate NeuS, while its normals are also used 
to refine 3DGS. Additionally, NeuSG includes regularizers 
to ensure that 3DGS remains close to the surface.
%
Some work____ 
tends to extract geometry from 3DGS directly, benefiting from 
its fast training and rendering speed.

proposes an efficient mesh extraction method from 3DGS, aligned with
a regularization term during the training process and a refinement strategy.
%
2DGS____ proposed a 2D surface modeling and two regularization 
losses which can preserve perspective-correct splatting and enchance geometry 
reconstruction.
%
A ray-tracing-based volume rendering is introduced in 
GOF____,
allowing the extraction of geometry from 3DGS directly.
%
PGSR____ proposes unbiased depth rendering
and single\& multi-view regularization loss to preserve 
geometric consistency.
%
However, in low-texture and less frequently observed areas, 
such as indoor scenes, 3DGS still tends to overfit to 
the limited input views, necessitating regulation 
through additional prior cues.

\textbf{Prior Regulation for Rendering}:
Prior information is usually incoporated in ill-posed problems,
including sparse view novel view synthesis, dynamic scene reconstruction,
and mesh reconstruction.
For sparse novel view synthesis tasks, most works utilize the prior depth information____, semantic information____, and matching information____ 
to constrain the optimization process of 3DGS.
Dynamic scene reconstruction is another challenging
task which requires reconstructing the scene geometry and object motion at the same
time. 
Therefore, optical flow priors are crucial as
they can help distinguish between camera motion 
and object motion____ 
while providing motion priors between frames____.
For the mesh reconstruction task,
geometry quality is also
enhanced by depth priors  
____ 
or normal priors ____. 
%
However, using optical flow model priors to obtain metric depth priors 
to help geometric reconstruction, 
while leveraging unobserved regions to enhance the quality 
of limited view reconstruction, has not yet been explored.
