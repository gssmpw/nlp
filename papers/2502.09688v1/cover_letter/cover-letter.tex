% In addition, a cover letter needs to be written with the
% following:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item A 100 word or less summary indicating on scientific grounds
% why the paper should be considered for a wide-ranging journal like
% \textsl{Nature} instead of a more narrowly focused journal.
%  \item A 100 word or less summary aimed at a non-scientific audience,
% written at the level of a national newspaper.  It may be used for
% \textsl{Nature}'s press release or other general publicity.
%  \item The cover letter should state clearly what is included as the
% submission, including number of figures, supporting manuscripts
% and any Supplementary Information (specifying number of items and
% format).
%  \item The cover letter should also state the number of
% words of text in the paper; the number of figures and parts of
% figures (for example, 4 figures, comprising 16 separate panels in
% total); a rough estimate of the desired final size of figures in
% terms of number of pages; and a full current postal address,
% telephone and fax numbers, and current e-mail address.

I am pleased to submit our research article, ``Towards Virtual Clinical Trials of Radiology AI Through Conditional Generative Modeling'' for consideration in \emph{Nature}. It is undeniable that artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) is on the verge of transforming medicine. However, substantial evidence points toward the brittleness of AI/ML models when deployed outside controlled environments, a limitation that can lead to significant performance degradation, and in the healthcare context, adverse patient outcomes. This work addresses a pressing challenge in the adoption of AI/ML in healthcare: the ability to automatically anticipate performance degradations on unseen patient populations.

Our study introduces a first generative AI model for full-body CT image synthesis, designed to support virtual clinical trials (VCTs) in radiology-based precision medicine. By conditioning on patient attributes such as sex, age, height, and weight, this model for the first time enables the creation of realistic, anatomically accurate synthetic patient cohorts. These synthetic cohorts serve as a scalable solution for assessing model robustness and quantifying bias with respect to certain attributes, effectively replicating real-world degradation patterns observed in clinical deployments. Key contributions of our manuscript include:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A conditional generative AI model that synthesizes volumetric full-body CT images with high anatomical fidelity, incorporating latent diffusion techniques for memory-efficient representation.
  \item Controlled experiments demonstrating the modelâ€™s ability to detect and quantify AI/ML performance degradation on a par with real data tests, highlighting its utility in safeguarding patient care and ensuring equitable outcomes.
\end{enumerate}

We believe this work aligns with \emph{Nature}'s commitment to publish transformative research with broad impact. In recent years, generative AI has made enormous strides, with increasingly capable models for image generation, video editing, 3D modeling, and data augmentation. Our work adds a new category to this list: the ability to derive actionable information about the real-world performance of other AI models for precision medicine.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission to \emph{Nature}.
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments. I look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\vspace{10mm}
