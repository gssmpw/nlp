	abstract = {This paper will attempt to provide an encompassing Index of Vitality for urban centres. The Vitality Index’s© goal is to enable measurement of the general economic, social, physical, environmental, institutional and spatial performance of towns within a regional framework, ultimately reflecting the spatial importance of the urban centre. Towns have been measured in terms of numerous indicators, mostly in connection with social and economic conditions, over an extended period of time. The lack of suitable spatial indicators is identified as a significant shortcoming in the measurement of urban centres. This paper proposes the utilisation of a comprehensive index to measure the importance of an urban centre within a specific region. The Vitality Index© is consequently tested in a study area situated in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa. This study contributes in a number of ways to the measurement of urban centres, i.e. the shortcomings that are identified for the urban centres can be addressed by goal-specific policy initiatives, comprising a set of objectives and strategies to correct imbalances. The Vitality Index© also provides a basis for guiding national and regional growth policies, in the identification of urban centres with sustainable growth potential and vitality.},

The goal of this article is a review of current literature in the field of planning and AI. The aim of this review is to increase the understanding of how AI approaches urban and land dynamics modeling processes and how, as a result, researchers can structure that knowledge and choose the correct approaches to embed in their models. For this purpose, the authors review the applications of AI techniques in urban land dynamics domain as well as the emerging challenges they face. The authors discuss hybrid AI systems as a need resulting from the trend in planning policy to develop more holistic approaches. The authors conclude that, although challenges exist, AI-based approaches offer promising solutions for urban and land dynamics.},

	abstract = {Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are common tools employed by planners to constrain urban expansion in order to increase density of urban services and protect surrounding rural landscapes. Planners could use models that estimate future urban growth boundaries based on those factors that drive urban expansion. Unfortunately, few models have been developed that simulate the urban growth boundary. This paper presents an urban growth boundary model (UGBM) which utilizes artificial neural networks (ANN), geospatial information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to simulate the complex geometry of the urban boundary of Tehran, Iran. Raster-based predictive variables are used as inputs to the ANNs parameterized using vector routines. ANNs were used to train on seven predictor variables of urban boundary geometry for Tehran: roads, green spaces, slope, aspect, elevation, service stations, and built-area. We show that our UGBM can predict urban growth boundaries with urban area with 80–84\% accuracy. The model predicts urban boundaries in all cardinal directions equally well. We use the model to predict urban growth to the year 2012. We summarize the use of UGBs in planning around the world and describe how this model can be used to assist planners in developing future urban growth boundaries given the need to understand those factors that contribute toward urban expansion.},

	abstract = {A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical process, person, place, system or device. Digital twins were originally designed to improve manufacturing processes using simulations that have highly accurate models of individual components. However, with increasingly large and accurate building information models (BIM) combined with big data generated from IoT sensors in a smart city, it is now possible to create digital twin smart cities. An accurate 3D model of a city can be published online and walked around by the public to view proposed changes in urban planning and policy. This allows for easier dissemination and transparency to the public before putting these decisions into practice. This open and public model allows for an additional virtual feedback loop where citizens can interact and report feedback on planned changes in the city. Citizens can also interact with components to tag and report problems in their area. The digital twin also allows for additional experimentation where 3D data is necessary, such as flood evacuation planning. In this paper, we demonstrate a public and open digital twin of the Docklands area in Dublin, Ireland and show how this model can be used for urban planning of skylines and green space allowing users to interact and report feedback on planned changes.},

There is no standard method to do it, and it is even more complicated to do it retroactively in the last decades. Although, it is essential to evaluate and learn features of the past to predict a VI in the future. This paper proposes a method to evaluate such a VI, based on a k-mean clustering algorithm. The meta parameters of this unsupervised machine learning technique are optimized by a genetic algorithm method. Based on the resulting clusters and VI, a linear regression is applied to predict the VI of each district of a city. The weights of each feature used in the clustering are calculated using a random forest regressor algorithm. This method can be a powerful insight for urbanists and inspire the redaction of a city plan in the smart city context.},

	abstract = {Recently, the population density in cities has increased at a higher pace. According to the United Nations Population Fund, cities accommodated 3.3 billion people (54\%) of the global population in 2014. By 2050, around 5 billion people (68\%) will be residing in cities. In order to make lifestyles in cities more comfortable and cost-effective, the city must be smart and intelligent. It is mainly accomplished through an intelligent decision-making process using computational intelligence-based technologies. This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97\% of Scopus and 73\% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23\% impact), mobility (19\% impact), privacy and security (11\% impact), and energy sectors (10\% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60\%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.},

The proposed urban model takes into account the changes over time in population and building use patterns. A GIS is used for handling the spatial and temporal data, performing contingency analysis and mapping the results. Spatial entities with similar characteristics are grouped together in clusters by the use of a fuzzy c-means algorithm. Each cluster represents a specific level of urban growth and development. A two-layer feed-forward multilayer perceptron artificial neural network is then used to predict urban growth. The model, applied to the prefecture of Attica, Greece, delineates the current and future evolution trends of the Athens metropolitan area, which are illustrated by maps of the urban growth dynamics. The proposed methodology aims to assist planners and decision makers in gaining insight into the transition from rural to urban.},

	abstract = {Public schools are more than educational institutions; they are essential to creating liveable neighbourhoods. Despite their importance, public schools are being permanently closed across North America, and particularly in the Canadian province of Ontario. In 2015, one of Ontario's public school boards made the decision to permanently close the province's oldest public high school, located in the urban core of the historic midsized city of Kingston. While the school is not scheduled to close until late 2019, the established fate of this prominent public asset has important consequences for the liveability of Kingston's urban core. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to document residents’ perceived impacts of the decision to close to Kingston Collegiate Vocational Institute (KCVI) on liveability in the school's catchment area. We observed widespread dissatisfaction with the decision to close KCVI (85\%), with large proportions of respondents (above 40\%) anticipating KCVI's closure to negatively impact neighbourhood liveability in various ways in the future. Approximately one-quarter of respondents indicated that they have considered moving as a result of the decision, and among these, concerns about negative impacts to household-level well-being were particularly acute. Given the socio-demographic profile of respondents who have considered moving, these findings suggest that the closure of KCVI could have a destabilising effect on the neighbourhoods within the KCVI catchment area by driving families out of the city's urban core. Our findings suggest that policies to address concerns of under-enrolment are short-sighted and undermine efforts of other sectors to promote liveable communities.},

To better understand and evaluate it, we defined urban vitality from the perspective of the urban organism and proposed the “vital triangle” conceptual framework linked to the three aspects of growth, diversity, and mobility. We designed an evaluation index system that includes the six dimensions of population, economy, society, government, environment, and external links by integrating multiple sets of heterogeneous data, and applied it to cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The results show that Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou have the highest vitality levels but are weak regarding their eco-environments. Cities with high vitality are distributed on the Z-shaped key development belt of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration planning. Regional differences in external links and population vitality are significant, and these two dimensions pose weaknesses to many cities. The interregional differences linked to social vitality are the smallest. Vitality not only comes from within the urban system, but also greatly depends on the external environment. The concept “vital triangle” and relevant evaluation framework are intended to serve as a basis for future research, and the case study could provide some key decision-making support for urban planning and management.},

The decay of these pillars, Jacobs contends, is behind such ills as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor; their continued degradation could lead us into a new Dark Age, a period of cultural collapse in which all that keeps a society alive and vibrant is forgotten.But this is a hopeful book as well as a warning. Jacobs draws on her vast frame of reference -- from fifteenth-century Chinese shipbuilding to zoning regulations in Brampton, Ontario -- and in highly readable, invigorating prose offers proposals that could arrest the cycles of decay and turn them into beneficent ones. Wise, worldly, full of real-life examples and accessible concepts, this book is an essential read for perilous times.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised learning (UL) has a long and successful history in untangling the complexity of cities. As the counterpart of supervised learning, it discovers patterns from intrinsic data structures without crafted labels, which is believed to be the key to real AI-generated decisions. This paper provides a systematic review of the use of UL in urban studies based on 140 publications. Firstly, the topic, technique, application, data type, and evaluation method of each paper are recorded, deriving statistical insights into the evolution and trends. Clustering is the most prominent method, followed by topic modeling. With the strong momentum of deep learning, a growing application field of UL methods is representing the complex real-world urban systems at multiple scales through multi-source data integration. Subsequently, a detailed review discusses how UL is applied in a broad range of urban topics, which are concluded by four dominant themes: urbanization and regional studies, built environment, urban sustainability, and urban dynamics. Finally, the review addresses common limitations regarding data quality, subjective interpretation, and validation difficulty of the results, which increasingly require interdisciplinary knowledge. Research opportunities are found in the rapidly evolving technological landscape of UL and in certain domains where supervised learning dominates.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly complex. In fact, a sophisticated model (XGBoost boosting or deep learning) generally leads to more accurate predictions than a simple model (linear regression or decision tree). There is therefore a trade-off between the performance of a model and its interpretability: what a model gains in performance, it loses in interpretability (and vice versa), where interpretability is the ability for a human to understand the reasons for a model's decision. However, explaining the predictions made by machine learning models aims at computing and interpreting the importance of features. To achieve this, game theory has recently gained attention for better understanding the similarity between group members. In this paper, we use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), which is a method based on cooperative game theory, to analyze and evaluate the properties of each group. More importantly, we rely k-means PCA and Light gbm classifier to improve the data preparation before grouping the features into multiple clusters. The simulation results prove the importance of shapley value in creating an accurate and meaningful representation of each cluster.},

	abstract = {Clustering is one of the data mining methods that partition large-sized data into subgroups according to their similarities. K-means clustering algorithm works well in spherical or convex data distribution of large-sized data sets. Most of the algorithms based on K-means have generally been interested in an initial cluster centers selection or cluster distribution. However, these algorithms may not meet satisfy some requirements in practice. This paper presents the FC-Kmeans algorithm, which enables clustering by fixing some cluster centers considering real conditions. Thus, while some of the cluster centers are fixed, it is tried to obtain the most appropriate cluster centers for the others and the best distribution of the data to the clusters. The K-means clustering algorithm is compared with two different fixed-centered clustering algorithms which are FC-Kmeans and FC-Kmeans 2. The experimental results show that although the FC-Kmeans algorithm has more limitations than K-means, it converges the performance of K-means algorithm according to some performance indicators such as SSE, DB Index and Silhouette Index.},

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2{\textasciicircum}bquanta,b=1,2, {\textbackslash}cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

One popular strategy to bridge the gap between complex models and interpretable models is to explain complex models using local feature attributions where a single sample's prediction is attributed to each of its features. In this class of explanation methods, Shapley value feature attributions have recently caught on. Although the Shapley value is appealing for its nice properties, it is NP-hard to compute in general. Here, we describe several works centered around tractably estimating the two most common variants of Shapley value feature attributions: marginal and conditional Shapley values.},
