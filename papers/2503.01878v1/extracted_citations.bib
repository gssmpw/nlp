	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast–the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast łeq R łeq R{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast(2 –MR{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

There is no standard method to do it, and it is even more complicated to do it retroactively in the last decades. Although, it is essential to evaluate and learn features of the past to predict a VI in the future. This paper proposes a method to evaluate such a VI, based on a k-mean clustering algorithm. The meta parameters of this unsupervised machine learning technique are optimized by a genetic algorithm method. Based on the resulting clusters and VI, a linear regression is applied to predict the VI of each district of a city. The weights of each feature used in the clustering are calculated using a random forest regressor algorithm. This method can be a powerful insight for urbanists and inspire the redaction of a city plan in the smart city context.},

	abstract = {This paper will attempt to provide an encompassing Index of Vitality for urban centres. The Vitality Index’s© goal is to enable measurement of the general economic, social, physical, environmental, institutional and spatial performance of towns within a regional framework, ultimately reflecting the spatial importance of the urban centre. Towns have been measured in terms of numerous indicators, mostly in connection with social and economic conditions, over an extended period of time. The lack of suitable spatial indicators is identified as a significant shortcoming in the measurement of urban centres. This paper proposes the utilisation of a comprehensive index to measure the importance of an urban centre within a specific region. The Vitality Index© is consequently tested in a study area situated in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa. This study contributes in a number of ways to the measurement of urban centres, i.e. the shortcomings that are identified for the urban centres can be addressed by goal-specific policy initiatives, comprising a set of objectives and strategies to correct imbalances. The Vitality Index© also provides a basis for guiding national and regional growth policies, in the identification of urban centres with sustainable growth potential and vitality.},

	abstract = {Recently, the population density in cities has increased at a higher pace. According to the United Nations Population Fund, cities accommodated 3.3 billion people (54\%) of the global population in 2014. By 2050, around 5 billion people (68\%) will be residing in cities. In order to make lifestyles in cities more comfortable and cost-effective, the city must be smart and intelligent. It is mainly accomplished through an intelligent decision-making process using computational intelligence-based technologies. This paper explored how artificial intelligence (AI) is being used in the smart city concept. From 2014 to 2021, we examined 133 articles (97\% of Scopus and 73\% of WoS) in healthcare, education, environment and waste management, agriculture, mobility and smart transportation, risk management, and security. Moreover, we observed that the healthcare (23\% impact), mobility (19\% impact), privacy and security (11\% impact), and energy sectors (10\% impact) have a more significant influence on AI adoption in smart cities. Since the epidemic hit cities in 2019, the healthcare industry has intensified its AI-based advances by 60\%. According to the analysis, AI algorithms such as ANN, RNN/LSTM, CNN/R-CNN, DNN, and SVM/LS-SVM have a higher impact on the various smart city domains.},

This study uses multiple statistical methods with computation techniques and machine learning to fulfill factor analysis and clustering to classify major block types and their spatial distribution, and this study aims to precisely position the important continuous zone and fracture locations within the study area based on a geo-information system (GIS), effectively revealing the potential morphological order of different block types in the urban fabric. The study provides accurate basis and technical support for the optimization of urban construction.

	abstract = {Urban vitality is a driving force of urban sustainable development and influences the well-being of its residents. To better understand and evaluate it, we defined urban vitality from the perspective of the urban organism and proposed the “vital triangle” conceptual framework linked to the three aspects of growth, diversity, and mobility. We designed an evaluation index system that includes the six dimensions of population, economy, society, government, environment, and external links by integrating multiple sets of heterogeneous data, and applied it to cities in the Yangtze River Delta. The results show that Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou have the highest vitality levels but are weak regarding their eco-environments. Cities with high vitality are distributed on the Z-shaped key development belt of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration planning. Regional differences in external links and population vitality are significant, and these two dimensions pose weaknesses to many cities. The interregional differences linked to social vitality are the smallest. Vitality not only comes from within the urban system, but also greatly depends on the external environment. The concept “vital triangle” and relevant evaluation framework are intended to serve as a basis for future research, and the case study could provide some key decision-making support for urban planning and management.},

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for2{\textasciicircum}bquanta,b=1,2, {\textbackslash}cdots, 7, are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.},

As the counterpart of supervised learning, it discovers patterns from intrinsic data structures without crafted labels, which is believed to be the key to real AI-generated decisions. This paper provides a systematic review of the use of UL in urban studies based on 140 publications. Firstly, the topic, technique, application, data type, and evaluation method of each paper are recorded, deriving statistical insights into the evolution and trends. Clustering is the most prominent method, followed by topic modeling. With the strong momentum of deep learning, a growing application field of UL methods is representing the complex real-world urban systems at multiple scales through multi-source data integration. Subsequently, a detailed review discusses how UL is applied in a broad range of urban topics, which are concluded by four dominant themes: urbanization and regional studies, built environment, urban sustainability, and urban dynamics. Finally, the review addresses common limitations regarding data quality, subjective interpretation, and validation difficulty of the results, which increasingly require interdisciplinary knowledge. Research opportunities are found in the rapidly evolving technological landscape of UL and in certain domains where supervised learning dominates.},
