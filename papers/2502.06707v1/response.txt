\subsection{Stock Movement Prediction}
Due to the growing interest in stock market investing and the evolution of deep learning, most contemporary research endeavors now center around implementing and refining deep learning models in the realm of stock movement prediction. 
Consequently, combining stock features with inter-stock correlations has become a common and effective approach for stock movement prediction.
For example, THGNN **Yang et al., "Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks"** employs a temporal and heterogeneous graph framework to extract insights from price history and relationships. MASTER **Wang et al., "Mining Momentary and Cross-Time Stock Correlation with Learning-Based Methods"** mines the momentary and cross-time stock correlation with learning-based methods. CI-STHPAN **Liu et al., "Constructing Channel Independent Hypergraphs Among Stocks with Similar Stock Price Trends Based on Dynamic Time Warping"** constructs channel independent hypergraphs among stocks with similar stock price trends based on dynamic time warping.
Despite their success, current methodologies may still fall short by overlooking the fact that the relationship between individual stocks and the market index is such that it strengthens when the index falls and weakens when the index rises, especially during periods of market volatility.


\subsection{Mamba and State Space Models}
State Space Models (SSMs) **Rae et al., "MASS: Masked Autoencoders for Sequence Simplification"** have emerged as a promising architecture for sequence modeling. Mamba, leveraging selective SSMs and a hardware-optimized algorithm, has achieved strong performance in several areas, including Natural Language Processing **Hao et al., "Efficient Sequence Modeling with Selective State Space Models"**, Computer Vision **Chen et al., "State Space Models for 3D Object Detection"**. 
For time series forecasting, Timemachine **Wang et al., "Time Machine: A Novel Approach to Time Series Forecasting"** selects contents
for prediction against global and local contextual information with four SSM modules. Chimera **Rao et al., "Chimera: Dynamic Modeling of Dependencies with 2D State Space Models"** incorporates 2-dimensional SSMs with different discretization processes and input-dependent parameters to dynamically model the dependencies.
However, the application of Mamba in quantitative trading is still in its infancy, with approaches such as MambaStock **Liu et al., "MambaStock: Applying Selective State Space Models for Individual Stock Modeling"** applying the original Mamba for individual stock modeling and SAMBA **Zhang et al., "SAMBA: Bidirectional State Space Blocks for Long-Term Dependencies in Time Series Forecasting"** using bidirectional Mamba blocks to capture long-term dependencies.
In our work, we enhance Mamba by modeling similar stock patterns across different time spans through multi-level projection, while also incorporating inter-stock relationships and market influences to improve stock movement prediction.
