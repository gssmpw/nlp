%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract="This paper proposes automating swing trading using deep reinforcement learning. The deep deterministic policy gradient-based neural network model trains to choose an action to sell, buy, or hold the stocks to maximize the gain in asset value. The paper also acknowledges the need for a system that predicts the trend in stock value to work along with the reinforcement learning algorithm. We implement a sentiment analysis model using a recurrent convolutional neural network to predict the stock trend from the financial news. The objective of this paper is not to build a better trading bot, but to prove that reinforcement learning is capable of learning the tricks of stock trading.",

Existing studies rely on channel mixing methods, exacerbating the issue of distribution shift in financial time series. Additionally, complex model structures they build make it difficult to handle very long sequences. Furthermore, most of them are based on predefined stock relationships thus making it difficult to capture the dynamic and highly volatile stock markets. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose Channel-Independent based Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Pre-trained Attention Networks (CI-STHPAN), a two-stage framework for stock selection, involving Transformer and HGAT based stock time series self-supervised pre-training and stock-ranking based downstream task fine-tuning. We calculate the similarity of stock time series of different channel in dynamic intervals based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and further construct channel-independent stock dynamic hypergraph based on the similarity. Experiments with NASDAQ and NYSE markets data over five years show that our framework outperforms SOTA approaches in terms of investment return ratio (IRR) and Sharpe ratio (SR). Additionally, we find that even without introducing graph information, self-supervised learning based on the vanilla Transformer Encoder also surpasses SOTA results. Notable improvements are gained on the NYSE market. It is mainly attributed to the improvement of fine-tuning approach on Information Coefficient (IC) and Information Ratio based IC (ICIR), indicating that the fine-tuning method enhances the accuracy and stability of the model prediction.}, number={8}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Xia, Hongjie and Ao, Huijie and Li, Long and Liu, Yu and Liu, Sen and Ye, Guangnan and Chai, Hongfeng}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={9187-9195} }

Using a sample composed of nine international stock markets from January 4, 1999, to May 13, 2021, the empirical study reveals that: (1) EMD-Copula-CoVaR models can effectively measure the multiscale financial risk contagion, and the financial risk contagion is significant at all time scales; (2) The high-frequency component is the major contributor of financial risk contagion; meanwhile, the low-frequency component is the smallest among all time scale components; (3) The risk export of the US financial market to other markets, except the UK under the original and medium-frequency component, is higher than that it receives; and (4) Even though the magnitude of overall financial risk contagion is similar for the COVID-19 pandemic, Subprime Crises, 9/11 terrorist attack and other crises, the relative importance of different frequency components is heterogeneous. Therefore, the countermeasures of risk contagion should be designed according to its multiscale characteristics.}

abstract = {In current process of quantifying the dynamical properties of the complex phenomena in financial market system, the multivariate financial time series are widely concerned. In this work, considering the shortcomings and limitations of univariate multiscale entropy in analyzing the multivariate time series, the multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE), which can evaluate the complexity in multiple data channels over different timescales, is applied to quantify the complexity of financial markets. Its effectiveness and advantages have been detected with numerical simulations with two well-known synthetic noise signals. For the first time, the complexity of four generated trivariate return series for each stock trading hour in China stock markets is quantified thanks to the interdisciplinary application of this method. We find that the complexity of trivariate return series in each hour show a significant decreasing trend with the stock trading time progressing. Further, the shuffled multivariate return series and the absolute multivariate return series are also analyzed. As another new attempt, quantifying the complexity of global stock markets (Asia, Europe and America) is carried out by analyzing the multivariate returns from them. Finally we utilize the multivariate multiscale entropy to assess the relative complexity of normalized multivariate return volatility series with different degrees.}

The empirical evidence suggests that the distribution of the lead–lag times of the CSI 300 index futures relative to the cash index is right skewed with high kurtosis, and the index futures usually lead the cash index by 0–5 min but occasionally lag the cash index.}

We show that if a stock's price follows a stock specific random walk, market indices cannot be cointegrated. Indices are a mere combination of n different random walks which itself is non-stationary by construction. We substantiate the theoretical propositions using a sample of 28 stock indices as well as a simulation study. In the latter we simulate stock prices, construct indices and test whether these indices are cointegrated. We show that while heteroscedasticity misleads cointegration tests, it is not sufficient to explain the high correlation between stock market index returns. A common random walk component and correlated price innovations are necessary to reproduce this feature.}

abstract = {In order to make financial investment more stable and more profitable, convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep learning technology are used to quantify financial investment, so as to obtain more robust investment and returns. With the continuous development of in-depth learning technology, people are applying it more and more widely. Deep learning is put forward on the basis of neural network. It contains more hidden layers, shows more powerful learning ability, and can abstract data at a higher level, so as to obtain more accurate data. CNN is a multi-layer network structure which simulates the operation mechanism of biological vision system. Its special structure can obtain more useful feature descriptions from original data and is very effective in extracting data. Therefore, in this study, the two technologies are combined to quantify financial investment. The results show that the convolution neural network and deep learning algorithm can obtain relatively accurate investment strategies, thus ensuring investment returns and reducing investment risks.}
