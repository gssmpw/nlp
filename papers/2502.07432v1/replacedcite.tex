% Challenges in stream learning and why existing solutions are not sufficient
Machine learning for data streams presents unique challenges that distinguish it from traditional batch learning. Unlike static datasets, streaming data arrives continuously and must be processed incrementally without storing the entire dataset. 
% This requires models that are both \textbf{computationally efficient} and \textbf{adaptable} to changing data distributions. 
Two key challenges in such scenarios are \textbf{concept drift}, where the statistical properties of the data change over time, requiring models to adjust dynamically to maintain predictive performance, and \textbf{computational constraints}, as models must process each instance upon arrival while operating under strict memory and processing limitations. To effectively address these challenges, practitioners and researchers need specialized tools for evaluating, analyzing, and experimenting with various algorithms.

% Discussion of existing frameworks and their limitations
Several frameworks have been developed to address online learning~\footnote{The terms online learning and stream learning are often used interchangeably, but they are not strictly identical. Online learning generally refers to models that update incrementally, instance by instance, without storing past data. Stream learning further emphasizes the dynamic nature of data streams, including challenges such as concept drift and strict computational constraints. In this paper, we use the terms contextually depending on the focus of discussion.}, the most popular ones being MOA____, River____ and Scikit-Multiflow____.

\textbf{MOA} is a well-established Java-based framework with a large range of efficient implementations, but its Java-based code limits accessibility for new users that often prefer Python. \textbf{River} is a fully Python-based framework that focuses on usability and flexibility but sacrifices computational efficiency due to its pure Python implementation. \textbf{Scikit-Multiflow} was initially developed to provide Python implementations of MOA algorithms but has since been largely replaced by River. In summary, while MOA remains the most efficient choice for large-scale stream learning, it lacks the accessibility of a Python-native tool, whereas River prioritizes usability but struggles with performance, highlighting a trade-off between efficiency and accessibility in existing frameworks.
