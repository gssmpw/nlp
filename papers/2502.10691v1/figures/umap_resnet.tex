  \caption{\textbf{Visualization of Embedding (ResNet18).} In this UMAP, projector embeddings exhibit greater neural collapse ($\mathcal{NC}1=0.341$) than the encoder embeddings ($\mathcal{NC}1=1.762$) as indicated by the formation of tight clusters around class-means. For clarity, we highlight 10 ImageNet classes by distinct colors. The embeddings are extracted from ImageNet-100 pre-trained ResNet18.}
