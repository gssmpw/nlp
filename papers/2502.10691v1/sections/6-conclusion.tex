\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we established a concrete relationship between neural collapse and OOD detection and generalization. Motivated by this relationship, our method enhances OOD detection by strengthening NC while promoting OOD generalization by mitigating NC. We also provided a theoretical framework to mitigate NC via entropy regularization.
Our method demonstrated strong OOD detection and generalization abilities compared to baselines that did not control NC.
This work has implications for open-world problems where simultaneous OOD detection and generalization are critical.
% Our method demonstrated strong OOD detection and generalization abilities without auxiliary OOD data, closely aligning with our theoretical insights.
% This work has direct implications for open-world problems with numerous practical applications e.g., autonomous systems, healthcare, etc. 
%We hope our work inspires future research on outlier-exposure-free methods for addressing semantic distribution shifts.

%Our problem setup resembles a more challenging and realistic goal of detecting new semantics while improving transfer to newly encountered semantics. It has direct implications in open-world problems with numerous practical applications e.g., autonomous cars, smartphones, cloud computing, healthcare, and so on. We hope our work will inspire future work to build more effective methods to solve this problem.
