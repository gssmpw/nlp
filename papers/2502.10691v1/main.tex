%\ck{Point out that stuff like background class regularization and outlier exposure and similar techniques are bad for our use-case, since they would impair OOD generalization and require us to know the distribution of all OOD samples which is intractable. Specifically cite this paper among others pointing out that the approach doesn't make sense for us: \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17816}}
