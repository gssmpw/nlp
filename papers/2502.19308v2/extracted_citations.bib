	abstract = {The rapidly growing global population presents challenges and demands for efficient production of healthy fresh food. Autonomous greenhouse equipped with standard sensors and actuators (such as heating and lighting) which enables control of indoor climate for crop production, contributes to producing higher yields. However, it requires skilled and expensive labor, as well as a large amount of energy. An autonomous greenhouse control strategy, powered by AI algorithms by optimizing the yields and resource use simultaneously, offers an ideal solution to the dilemma. 
In this paper, we propose a two-stage planning framework to automatically optimize greenhouse control setpoints given specific outside weather conditions. Firstly, we take advantage of cumulative planting data and horticulture knowledge to build a multi-modular simulator using neural networks, to simulate climate change and crop growth in the greenhouse. Secondly, two AI algorithms (reinforcement learning and heuristic algorithm) as planning methods are applied to obtain optimal control strategies based on the simulator.
We evaluate our framework on a cherry-tomato planting dataset and demonstrate that the simulator is able to simulate greenhouse planting processes with high accuracy and fast speed. Moreover, the control strategies produced by the AI algorithms all obtain superhuman performance, in particular, significantly outperform all teams of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge” in terms of net profits.},

Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of United Nations addresses this need by providing a yield response to water simulation model (AquaCrop) with limited sophistication. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the AquaCrop model for its ability to simulate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance under full and deficit water conditions in a hot dry environment in south of Iran, to study the effect of different scenarios of irrigation (crop growth stages and depth of water applied) on wheat yield. The AquaCrop model was evaluated with experimental data collected during the three field experiments conducted in Ahvaz. The AquaCrop model was able to accurately simulate soil water content of root zone, crop biomass and grain yield, with normalized root mean square error (RMSE) less than 10\%. The analysis of irrigation scenarios showed that the highest grain yield could be obtained by applying four irrigations (200mm) at sowing, tillering, stem elongation and flowering or grain filing stages for wet years, four irrigations (200mm) at sowing, stem elongation and flowering stages for normal years and six irrigations (300mm) at sowing, emergence, tillering, stem elongation, flowering and grain filing stages for dry years. The least amount of irrigation water to provide enough water to response to evaporative demand of environment and to obtain high WUE for wet, normal and dry years were 100, 200 and 250mm, respectively.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models have been widely employed for the simulation of growth dynamics of annual crops, thereby performing yield prediction, but not for fruit tree species such as jujube tree (Zizyphus jujuba). The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential use of a modified WOFOST model for predicting jujube yield by introducing tree age as a key parameter. The model was established using data collected from dedicated field experiments performed in 2016–2018. Simulated growth dynamics of dry weights of leaves, stems, fruits, total biomass and leaf area index (LAI) agreed well with measured values, showing root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.143, 0.333, 0.366, 0.624 t ha−1 and 0.19, and R2 values of 0.947, 0.976, 0.985, 0.986 and 0.95, respectively. Simulated phenological development stages for emergence, anthesis and maturity were 2, 3 and 3 days earlier than the observed values, respectively. In addition, in order to predict the yields of trees with different ages, the weight of new organs (initial buds and roots) in each growing season was introduced as the initial total dry weight (TDWI), which was calculated as averaged, fitted and optimized values of trees with the same age. The results showed the evolution of the simulated LAI and yields profiled in response to the changes in TDWI. The modelling performance was significantly improved when it considered TDWI integrated with tree age, showing good global (R2≥0.856, RMSE≤0.68 t ha−1) and local accuracies (mean R2≥0.43, RMSE≤0.70 t ha−1). Furthermore, the optimized TDWI exhibited the highest precision, with globally validated R2 of 0.891 and RMSE of 0.591 t ha−1, and local mean R2 of 0.57 and RMSE of 0.66 t ha−1, respectively. The proposed model was not only verified with the confidence to accurately predict yields of jujube, but it can also provide a fundamental strategy for simulating the growth of other fruit trees.},

	abstract = {Management of complex crop rotations in southern France requires accurate assessment of the effects of irrigation, nitrogen fertilization, and the previous crop on crop growth and yield. The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) Cropping Systems model simulates the effects of weather, soil characteristics, tillage, fertilization, irrigation and other management practices on crops grown in complex rotations. The present study was conducted to evaluate EPIC's ability to simulate growth and yield of corn (Zea mays L.), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) when grown in rotations at three levels of management inputs, including three levels each of fertilizer, irrigation and tillage, over a 5-year period. After calibration, the root mean square error of simulated model grain yields ranged from 0.4 Mg ha−1 for sunflower to 1.6 Mg ha−1 for corn. Only in the case of winter wheat were mean simulated yields significantly different from mean measured yields. Simulations were more accurate for summer crops than for winter wheat, primarily because EPIC overestimated the effects of cool spring temperatures on wheat development in 1986. We conclude that EPIC can simulate yields of summer crops grown in complex rotations in southern France with accuracy acceptable for many applications. The model could be improved by more accurate simulation of disease effects, like those suffered by wheat in 1988, and by more accurate simulation of the effects of cool temperatures on winter wheat phenology.},

In this paper we provide an updated description of the model and reflect on the lessons learned over the last 25 years. The latter includes issues like system performance, model sensitivity, spatial model setup, parameterization and calibration approaches as well as software implementation and version management. Particularly for spatial model calibrations we provide experience and guidelines on how to execute calibrations and how to evaluate WOFOST model simulation results, particularly under conditions of limited field data availability. As an open source model WOFOST has been a success with at least 10 different implementations of the same concept. An overview is provided for those implementations which are managed by MARS or Wageningen groups. However, the proliferation of WOFOST implementations has also led to questions on the reproducibility of results from different implementations as is demonstrated with an example from MARS. In order to certify that the different WOFOST implementations and versions available can reproduce basic sets of inputs and outputs we make available a large set of test cases as appendix to this publication. Finally, new methodological extensions have been added to WOFOST in simulating the impact of nutrients limitations, extreme events and climate variability. Also, a difference is made in the operational and scientific versions of WOFOST with different licensing models and possible revenue generation. Capitalizing both on academic development as well as model testing in real-world situations will help to enable new applications of the WOFOST model in precision agriculture and smart farming.},

While best known for being the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) world’s best Go game player, RL has a vast range of potential applications. RL may help to address some of the criticisms leveled against crop management decision support systems (DSS): it is an interactive, geared towards action, contextual tool to evaluate series of crop operations faced with uncertainties. A review of RL use for crop management DSS reveals a limited number of contributions. We profile key prospects for a human-centered, real-world, interactive RL-based system to face tomorrow’s agricultural decisions, and theoretical and ongoing practical challenges that may explain its current low uptake. We argue that a joint research effort from the RL and agronomy communities is necessary to explore RL’s full potential.},

A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to assess the effect of changing parameters values on the yield simulated by the model (both EMS and MMS) for different crops (winter and durum wheat, winter barley, maize, sunflower) grown under a variety of conditions (including future climate realisations) in Europe. A two-step SA was performed using global techniques: the Morris screening method for qualitative ranking of parameters was first used, followed by the eFAST variance-based method, which attributes portions of variance in the model output to each parameter. The results showed that the parameters related to the partitioning of assimilates to storage organs (FOTB) and to the conversion efficiency of photosynthates into storage organs (CVO) generally affected considerably the simulated yield (also underlying tight correlation with this output), whereas the parameters involved with respiration rate (Q10) or specific leaf area (SLA) became influential in case of unfavourable weather conditions. Major differences between EMS and MMS (which includes a component simulating the impact of extreme weather events) emerged in extreme cases of crop failure triggered by markedly negative minimum temperatures. With few exceptions, the two SA methods revealed the same parameter ranking. We argue that the SA performed in this study can be useful in the design of crop modelling studies and in the implementation of crop yield forecasting systems in Europe.},

	abstract = {Agricultural systems science generates knowledge that allows researchers to consider complex problems or take informed agricultural decisions. The rich history of this science exemplifies the diversity of systems and scales over which they operate and have been studied. Modeling, an essential tool in agricultural systems science, has been accomplished by scientists from a wide range of disciplines, who have contributed concepts and tools over more than six decades. As agricultural scientists now consider the “next generation” models, data, and knowledge products needed to meet the increasingly complex systems problems faced by society, it is important to take stock of this history and its lessons to ensure that we avoid re-invention and strive to consider all dimensions of associated challenges. To this end, we summarize here the history of agricultural systems modeling and identify lessons learned that can help guide the design and development of next generation of agricultural system tools and methods. A number of past events combined with overall technological progress in other fields have strongly contributed to the evolution of agricultural system modeling, including development of process-based bio-physical models of crops and livestock, statistical models based on historical observations, and economic optimization and simulation models at household and regional to global scales. Characteristics of agricultural systems models have varied widely depending on the systems involved, their scales, and the wide range of purposes that motivated their development and use by researchers in different disciplines. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across disciplines, and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage is set for the major advances in agricultural systems science that are needed for the next generation of models, databases, knowledge products and decision support systems. The lessons from history should be considered to help avoid roadblocks and pitfalls as the community develops this next generation of agricultural systems models.},

	abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT–CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT–CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT–CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},

A key innovation is change from a core concept of a crop responding to resource supplies to that of a soil responding to weather, management and crops. While this achieves a sound logical structure for improved simulation of soil management and long-term change in the soil resource, it does so without loss of sensitivity in simulating crop yields. This concept is implemented using a program structure in which all modules (e.g. growth of specific crops, soil water, soil N, erosion) communicate with each other only by messages passed via a central ‘engine’. Using a standard interface design, this design enables easy removal, replacement, or exchange of modules without disruption to the operation of the system. Simulation of crop sequences and multiple crops are achieved by managing connection of crop growth modules to the engine. A shell of software tools has been developed within a WINDOWS environment which includes user-installed editor, linker, compiler, testbed generator, graphics, database and version control software. While the engine and modules are coded in FORTRAN, the Shell is in C++. The resulting product is one in which the functions are coded in the language most familiar to the developers of scientific modules but provides many of the features of object oriented programming. The Shell is written to be aware of UNIX operating systems and be capable of using the processor on UNIX workstations.},

	abstract = {Previous research about crop growth simulation and yield prediction mainly focused on annual crops with very few such studies relating to perennial fruit tree crops. In this study, field experiments were conducted in different growth periods of Lycium barbarum L. in Gansu province, China to determine and improve the initial WOFOST model parameters with combination of the time-series leaf area index (LAI) obtained from Sentinel-2 satellite and predict yields for L. barbarum shrubs at a field scale for summer fruit (SF) and autumn fruit (AF). The results showed that the performance of initial parameters established by previous research and partial measured data was relatively poor, with a relative error (RE) of 20.95\% for annual yield. The simulation after model parameter calibration significantly improved model prediction accuracy. The predicted SF was 2588 kg/ha and AF was 601 kg/ha with a RE of -5.51\%. This study provided a strategy to improve modelled yield for fruit tree crops through utilization of remote sensed and field measured data in model parameter calibration, which on the other hand provides useful information for regional development planning and crops marketing.},

	abstract = {In agriculture, water and nitrogen are two critical resources for growing a crop. However, their management cannot be analyzed independently of weather, soil characteristics, field hydrology, crop characteristics, crop rotation, and management factors. This paper describes the water, nitrogen, and crop growth components of CropSyst, a comprehensive cropping systems simulation model, and provides preliminary verification of these components. The water budget of the model properly describes crop water use. Predicted nitrogen contents throughout the soil profile did not exactly match the measured values from leaching experiments, but they did follow the general trends of the data. The agreement between simulated and observed biomass and yield of corn, winter wheat and spring wheat grown in two locations with a total of 77 data points was good as shown by several statistical indicators. Based on this preliminary validation, CropSyst appears promising as a tool to analyze management practices for water and nitrogen. Additional validation of model components, including a wide range of crops and conditions, should be conducted in the future.},

	abstract = {Crop management, including nitrogen (N) fertilization and irrigation management, has a significant impact on the crop yield, economic profit, and the environment. Although management guidelines exist, it is challenging to find the optimal management practices given a specific planting environment and a crop. Previous work used reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulators to solve the problem, but the trained policies either have limited performance or are not deployable in the real world. In this paper, we present an intelligent crop management system which optimizes the N fertilization and irrigation simultaneously via RL, imitation learning (IL), and crop simulations using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We first use deep RL, in particular, deep Q-network, to train management policies that require all state information from the simulator as observations (denoted as full observation). We then invoke IL to train management policies that only need a limited amount of state information that can be readily obtained in the real world (denoted as partial observation) by mimicking the actions of the previously RL-trained policies under full observation. We conduct experiments on a case study using maize in Florida and compare trained policies with a maize management guideline in simulations. Our trained policies under both full and partial observations achieve better outcomes, resulting in a higher profit or a similar profit with a smaller environmental impact. Moreover, the partial-observation management policies are directly deployable in the real world as they use readily available information.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The WOFOST simulation model is a tool for analysing the growth and production of field crops under a wide range of weather and soil conditions. Such an analysis is important first to assess to what extent crop production is limited by the factors of light, moisture and macro-nutrients, and second to estimate what improvements are possible. The theoretical concept of a production situation, as modelled by WOFOST, is explained, as is the hierarchy of potential production and water-limited and nutrient-limited production situations in the analysis. The organization of the computer files in the model, the structure of the FORTRAN source program and the available standard sets of data are described briefly.},
