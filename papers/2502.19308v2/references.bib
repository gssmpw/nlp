	abstract = {Computer software called WeedCast was developed to simulate weed seed dormancy, timing of seedling emergence, and seedling height growth in crop environments in real-time and using actual or forecasted weather data. Weather data include daily rainfall and minimum and maximum air temperatures. Air temperatures are converted to average daily soil temperature at 5-cm soil depth using a series of equations that are specific for soil type, tillage system and previous year's crop-residue type. Daily rainfall and soil temperature estimates are combined to determine soil water potential (in megapascals) at 5-cm depth. Daily estimated soil water potential or soil temperatures are matched to empirically-derived threshold values that induce secondary dormancy in seeds of certain species. Soil growing degree days (GDD), calculated from soil temperatures, are used to project maximum emergence rates of weed seedlings. Emergence ceases on days when soil water potential falls below threshold values specific to each species. GDD based on air temperatures are used to estimate post-emergence seedling height growth. All three types of simulation provide information that allows users to answer important weed management questions in real-time. These types of questions include but are not limited to the following: (1) Are soil-applied treatments necessary? (2) How late can pre-emergence herbicides be applied? (3) When should mechanical control be implemented? (4) When should field-scouting commence and end? (5) When should post-emergence herbicides be applied?},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and general framework for decision making and control, but its application in practice is often hindered by the need for extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.},

	abstract = {Optical sensors, coupled with mathematical algorithms, have proven effective at determining more accurate mid-season nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendations in winter wheat. One parameter required in making these recommendations is in-season grain yield potential at the time of sensing. Four algorithms, with different methods for determining grain yield potential, were evaluated for effectiveness to predict final grain yield and the agronomic optimum N rate (AONR) at 34 site-years. The current N fertilizer optimization algorithm (CNFOA) outperformed the other three algorithms at predicting yield potential with no added N and yield potential with added N (R2 = 0.46 and 0.25, respectively). However, no differences were observed in the amount of variability accounted for among all four algorithms in regards to predicting the AONR. Differences were observed in that the CNFOA and proposed N fertilizer optimization algorithm (PNFOA), under predicted the AONR at approximately 75 \% of the site-years; whereas, the generalized algorithm (GA) and modified generalized algorithm (MGA) recommended N rates under the AONR at about 50 \% of the site-years. The PNFOA was able to determine N rate recommendations within 20 kg N ha−1 of the AONR for half of the site-years; whereas, the other three algorithms were only able recommend within 20 kg N ha−1 of the AONR for about 40 \% of the site-years. Lastly, all four algorithms reported more accurate N rate recommendations compared to non-sensor based methodologies and can more precisely account for the year to year variability in grain yields due to environment.},

A wide range of agronomic and engineering solutions are currently being used by grain growers to reduce losses from waterlogging. In this scoping study, we reviewed the effects of waterlogging on plant growth, and advantages and disadvantages of various agronomic and engineering solutions which are used to mitigate waterlogging damage.

	abstract = {The reinforcement learning (RL) community has made great strides in designing algorithms capable of exceeding human performance on specific tasks. These algorithms are mostly trained one task at the time, each new task requiring to train a brand new agent instance. This means the learning algorithm is general, but each solution is not; each agent can only solve the one task it was trained on. In this work, we study the problem of learning to master not one but multiple sequentialdecision tasks at once. A general issue in multi-task learning is that a balance must be found between the needs of multiple tasks competing for the limited resources of a single learning system. Many learning algorithms can get distracted by certain tasks in the set of tasks to solve. Such tasks appear more salient to the learning process, for instance because of the density or magnitude of the in-task rewards. This causes the algorithm to focus on those salient tasks at the expense of generality. We propose to automatically adapt the contribution of each task to the agent’s updates, so that all tasks have a similar impact on the learning dynamics. This resulted in state of the art performance on learning to play all games in a set of 57 diverse Atari games. Excitingly, our method learned a single trained policy - with a single set of weights - that exceeds median human performance. To our knowledge, this was the first time a single agent surpassed human-level performance on this multi-task domain. The same approach also demonstrated state of the art performance on a set of 30 tasks in the 3D reinforcement learning platform DeepMind Lab.},

We propose Active Domain Randomization, a novel algorithm that learns a parameter sampling strategy. Our method looks for the most informative environment variations within the given randomization ranges by leveraging the discrepancies of policy rollouts in randomized and reference environment instances. We find that training more frequently on these instances leads to better overall agent generalization. Our experiments across various physics-based simulated and real-robot tasks show that this enhancement leads to more robust, consistent policies.},

We build upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to use demonstrations. Both demonstrations and actual interactions are used to fill a replay buffer and the sampling ratio between demonstrations and transitions is automatically tuned via a prioritized replay mechanism. Typically, carefully engineered shaping rewards are required to enable the agents to efficiently explore on high dimensional control problems such as robotics. They are also required for model-based acceleration methods relying on local solvers such as iLQG (e.g. Guided Policy Search and Normalized Advantage Function). The demonstrations replace the need for carefully engineered rewards, and reduce the exploration problem encountered by classical RL approaches in these domains. Demonstrations are collected by a robot kinesthetically force-controlled by a human demonstrator. Results on four simulated insertion tasks show that DDPG from demonstrations out-performs DDPG, and does not require engineered rewards. Finally, we demonstrate the method on a real robotics task consisting of inserting a clip (flexible object) into a rigid object.},

UAS can capture data more often and more cost-effectively than sending human scouts into the field. However, in large crop fields, flight time, and hence data collection, is limited by battery life. In a conventional UAS approach, human operators are required to exchange depleted batteries many times, which can be costly and time consuming. In this study, we developed a novel, fully autonomous aerial scouting approach that preserves battery life by sampling sections of a field for sensing and predicting crop health for the whole field. Our approach uses reinforcement learning (RL) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately and autonomously sample the field. To develop and test the approach, we ran flight simulations on an aerial image dataset collected from an 80-acre corn field. The excess green vegetation Index was used as a proxy for crop health condition. Compared to the conventional UAS scouting approach, the proposed scouting approach sampled 40\% of the field, predicted crop health with 89.8\% accuracy, reduced labor cost by 4.8× and increased agricultural profits by 1.36×.},

	abstract = {Warm-season grasses are economically important for cattle production in tropical regions and tools to aid in management and research on these forages would be highly beneficial both in research and the industry. This research was conducted to adapt the CROPGRO–Perennial Forage model to simulate growth of the tropical species guineagrass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. ‘Tanzânia’) and to describe model adaptation for this species. To develop the CROPGRO parameters for this species, we began with values and relationships reported in the literature. Some parameters and relationships were calibrated by comparison with observed growth, development, dry matter accumulation, and partitioning during a 17-mo experiment with Tanzânia guineagrass in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Compared with starting parameters for palisadegrass [Brachiaria brizantha (A. Rich.) Stapf. cv. ‘Xaraes’], dormancy effects of the perennial forage model had to be minimized, partitioning to storage tissue or root decreased, and partitioning to leaf and stem increased to provide for more leaf and stem growth and less root. Parameters affecting specific leaf area and senescence of plant tissues were improved. After these changes were made to the model, biomass accumulation was better simulated, mean predicted herbage yield was 6576 kg ha−1, averaged across 11 regrowth cycles of 35 (summer) or 63 d (winter), with a RMSE of 494 kg ha−1 (Willmott's index of agreement d = 0.985, simulated/observed ratio = 1.014). The model also gave good predictions against an independent data set, with similar RMSE, ratio, and d. The results of the adaptation suggest that the CROPGRO model is an efficient tool to integrate physiological aspects of guineagrass and can be used to simulate growth.},

	abstract = {Crop management, including nitrogen (N) fertilization and irrigation management, has a significant impact on the crop yield, economic profit, and the environment. Although management guidelines exist, it is challenging to find the optimal management practices given a specific planting environment and a crop. Previous work used reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulators to solve the problem, but the trained policies either have limited performance or are not deployable in the real world. In this paper, we present an intelligent crop management system which optimizes the N fertilization and irrigation simultaneously via RL, imitation learning (IL), and crop simulations using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We first use deep RL, in particular, deep Q-network, to train management policies that require all state information from the simulator as observations (denoted as full observation). We then invoke IL to train management policies that only need a limited amount of state information that can be readily obtained in the real world (denoted as partial observation) by mimicking the actions of the previously RL-trained policies under full observation. We conduct experiments on a case study using maize in Florida and compare trained policies with a maize management guideline in simulations. Our trained policies under both full and partial observations achieve better outcomes, resulting in a higher profit or a similar profit with a smaller environmental impact. Moreover, the partial-observation management policies are directly deployable in the real world as they use readily available information.},

In this paper, it is modeled as a multi-agent patrolling problem, where robots visit subregions that required immediate attention in the agricultural field. Furthermore, for area coverage / patrolling task in the agricultural plot, a centralized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Dual Deep Q-learning (DDQN) is proposed. A customized reward function is designed, which rewards worth-visiting idle regions, and punishes undesirable actions. A proposed algorithm has been compared with various algorithms including individual Q-learning (IRL), uniform coverage (UC), and Behavior-Based Robotics coverage (BBR) for different scenarios in the agricultural plots.},

However, the greenhouse industry encounters challenges to find automatic control policy. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful tool in solving the autonomous decision making problems. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for cucumber climate control. Although some machine learning methods have been proposed to address the dynamic climate control problem, these methods have two major issues. First, they only consider the current reward (e.g., the fruit weight of the cucumber). Second, previous study only considers one control variable. However, the growth of crops are impacted by multiple factors synchronously (e.g., CO2 and Temperature).To solve these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement learning based climate control method, which can model future reward explicitly. We further consider the fruit weight and the cost of the planting in order to improve the cumulative fruit weight and reduce the costs.Extensive experiments are conducted on the cucumber simulator environment have shown the superior performance of our methods.},

	abstract = {A new model for grapevines (Vitis vinifera) is the first perennial fruit crop model using the Agricultural Production System sIMulator (APSIM) Next Generation framework. Modules for phenology, light interception, carbohydrate allocation, yield formation and berry composition were adapted or added into APSIM Next Generation to represent the nature of fruit-bearing vines. The simulated grapevine phenological cycle starts with the dormancy phase triggered by a critical photoperiod in autumn, and then goes through the subsequent phenophases sequentially and finally returns to dormancy for a new cycle. The canopy microclimate module within APSIM Next Generation was extended to allow for row crop light interception. The carbohydrate arbitrator was enhanced to consider both sink strength and sink priority to reflect carbohydrate reserve as a concurrent competing sink. Weather conditions and source–sink ratio at critical developmental stages were used to determine potential grapevine yield components, e.g. bunch number, berry number and berry fresh weight. The model was calibrated and tested extensively using four detailed data sets. The model captured the variations in the timing of measured budburst, flowering and véraison over 15 seasons across New Zealand for five different varieties. The calculated seasonal dynamics of light interception by the row and alley were consistent with field observations. The model also reproduced the dynamics of dry matter and carbohydrate reserve of different organs, and the wide variation in yield components caused by seasonal weather conditions and pruning regimes. The modelling framework developed in this work can also be used for other perennial fruit crops.},

Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of United Nations addresses this need by providing a yield response to water simulation model (AquaCrop) with limited sophistication. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the AquaCrop model for its ability to simulate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance under full and deficit water conditions in a hot dry environment in south of Iran, to study the effect of different scenarios of irrigation (crop growth stages and depth of water applied) on wheat yield. The AquaCrop model was evaluated with experimental data collected during the three field experiments conducted in Ahvaz. The AquaCrop model was able to accurately simulate soil water content of root zone, crop biomass and grain yield, with normalized root mean square error (RMSE) less than 10\%. The analysis of irrigation scenarios showed that the highest grain yield could be obtained by applying four irrigations (200mm) at sowing, tillering, stem elongation and flowering or grain filing stages for wet years, four irrigations (200mm) at sowing, stem elongation and flowering stages for normal years and six irrigations (300mm) at sowing, emergence, tillering, stem elongation, flowering and grain filing stages for dry years. The least amount of irrigation water to provide enough water to response to evaporative demand of environment and to obtain high WUE for wet, normal and dry years were 100, 200 and 250mm, respectively.},

Dangerous HRI is an as-yet understudied area of the field. We define dangerous HRI as situations where humans experience some amount of risk of bodily harm while interacting with robots. This interaction could take many forms, such as a bystander (e.g. when an autonomous car waits at a crossing for a pedestrian), as a recipient of robotic assistance (rescue robots), or as a teammate (like an autonomous robot working with a SWAT team). To facilitate better study of this area, the Dangerous HRI workshop brings together researchers who perform experiments with some risk of bodily harm to participants and discuss strategies for mitigating this risk while still maintaining validity of the experiment. This workshop does not aim to tackle the general problem of human safety around robots, but instead focused on guidelines for and experience from experimenters.},

	abstract = {In the context of climate change, the agricultural sector offers a large number of mitigation possibilities through diverse practices, such as the reduction of pollutant inputs. However, most farmers do not adopt the mitigation practices recommended, including the reduction of nitrogen fertilization. At the same time, various uncertainties characterize agricultural production, so that the farmer’s risk and ambiguity preferences may be potential determinants to the adoption of mitigation practices. In this context, the objective of the article is to determine if the farmer’s risk and ambiguity preferences explain (or not) the fertilization decision. A questionnaire was submitted to French farmers to elicit risk and ambiguity preferences through lottery choices, and ask questions about fertilization. Two regressions were realized, the first to explain the total fertilization and the second to identify the determinants of the first fertilization application. The results reveal that respondents were mostly risk-averse and ambiguity-neutral. In addition, risk and ambiguity aversion impact fertilization practices through diverse drivers in opposite directions. Indeed, being risk-averse is associated with a lower level of total fertilization, whereas ambiguity aversion has a positive and significant impact on the level of fertilization at the first application. This last result highlights the need to reduce the uncertainty farmers face.},

Freshwater limitations in some irrigated regions (western United States; China; and West, South, and Central Asia) could necessitate the reversion of 20–60 Mha of cropland from irrigated to rainfed management by end-of-century, and a further loss of 600–2,900 Pcal of food production.

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

A difficult challenge for journal referees and editors is to make decisions on submitted manuscripts concerning their acceptability for journal publication. The discussion presented in this paper is intended to initiate a consideration of those traits expected of a manuscript describing a crop model. We suggest three criteria that should be met in a crop modeling paper to make it suitable for scientific publication: a clear statement of a scientific objective with a defined domain of relevance, a mechanistic framework, and an evaluation of the scientific innovation offered in the new model. We also discuss the use and abuse of three widely used modeling concepts: calibration, validation, and universality.},

Crop growth simulation models integrate crop physiology, weather parameters, soil parameters, and management practices to simulate growth and yield of crops. These models compute growth values on a day to day basis, using relationships among input such as nutrients, water, weather parameters, etc. to predict values of crop growth parameters. Crop-specific model design results in poor modularity and prevents model sharing. A generic model uses common crop physiological processes. Validating and fine tuning the crop model is an important step before using it for actual prediction tasks. A number of crop growth models have been developed since 1980s. Future crop models should rely on improving the mechanism of interaction with environment, breeding programs, and microscale studies on individual crop growth components such as nutrients dispersion, CO2 diffusion, etc. The models should be able to predict crop yields under site‐specific soils, input, and weather conditions.},

One way this is achieved is by calibration of simulation models, whether data-derived or physics-based, or a combination of both. Traditional manual calibration is not possible in this context; hence, new methods are required for continuous calibration. In this paper, a particle filter methodology for continuous calibration of the physics-based model element of a digital twin is presented and applied to an example of an underground farm. The methodology is applied to a synthetic problem with known calibration parameter values prior to being used in conjunction with monitored data. The proposed methodology is compared against static and sequential Bayesian calibration approaches and compares favourably in terms of determination of the distribution of parameter values and analysis run times, both essential requirements. The methodology is shown to be potentially useful as a means to ensure continuing model fidelity.},

Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

The extensions consisted of the simulation of crop and soil N processes, stress responses to N deficiencies, and the maximum gross CO2 assimilation rate being computed from the leaf N concentration. A new soil N module, abbreviated as SNOMIN (Soil Nitrogen for Organic and Mineral Nitrogen module) was developed. The model was calibrated and evaluated against field data. The model reproduced the measured grain dry matter in all treatments in both the calibration and evaluation data sets with a RMSE of 1.2 Mg ha−1 and the measured aboveground N uptake with a RMSE of 39 kg N ha−1. Subsequently, the model was applied in a scenario analysis exploring different pathways for sustainable N use on farmers' wheat fields in the Netherlands. Farmers' reported yield and N fertilization management practices were obtained for 141 fields in Flevoland between 2015 and 2017, representing the baseline. Actual N input and N output (amount of N in grains at harvest) were estimated for each field from these data. Water and N-limited yields and N outputs were simulated for these fields to estimate the maximum attainable yield and N output under the reported N management. The investigated scenarios included (1) closing efficiency yield gaps, (2) adjusting N input to the minimum level possible without incurring yield losses, and (3) achieving 90\% of the simulated water-limited yield. Scenarios 2 and 3 were devised to allow for soil N mining (2a and 3a) and to not allow for soil N mining (2b and 3b). The results of the scenario analysis show that the largest N surplus reductions without soil N mining, relative to the baseline, can be obtained in scenario 1, with an average of 75\%. Accepting negative N surpluses (while maintaining yield) would allow maximum N input reductions of 84 kg N ha−1 (39\%) on average (scenario 2a). However, the adjustment in N input for these pathways, and the resulting N surplus, varied strongly across fields, with some fields requiring greater N input than used by farmers.},

	abstract = {Understanding water and nutrient utilization in agricultural layered soil is very important for the improvement of agricultural management and protection of the environment. The objective of this paper is to determine the effect of layered soil profiles on crop yield and water and fertilizer nitrogen (N) utilization. Firstly a water and nitrogen management model (WNMM) was calibrated and validated under a wheat–maize cropping system in an alluvial plain using published data of two soil profiles (named A and B). The results showed that the model can be used to simulate the water movement and N transport, as well as crop growth in the study area. Then, another three very different soil profiles (named C, D and E) near to profiles A and B were studied. The profile C had a silt loam–clay profile; the profile D had a silty loam–clay–silt profile and the profile E had a clay–silty loam–silt profile. The soil hydraulic parameters of these profiles were obtained by pedo-transfer functions using measured soil properties. Given the same initial conditions and field management practices, the WNMM was then used to simulate water and Nitrogen balance and crop yield for the three profiles. Simulated results showed that the profiles (C, D and E) have similar water and fertilizer N use efficiencies (WUE, FNUE), while the crop yields of profiles C and D were higher than that of the profile E. Compared with profiles D and E, the profile C has least water drainage (127 mm) and total N loss (117 kg N ha−1). We concluded that layering of soil profiles has a strong effect on water and fertilizer N utilization and crop yield. Such an effect of layered property of soil profiles, therefore, needs to be taken into account in precision agriculture related research.},

	abstract = {This essay considers annuality and perenniality as quantitative traits and discusses the application of established and new genetic tools to the analysis of plant life histories. Annual/perennial status is a function of meristem determinacy in combination with the processes of cell death and disposal employed by plants to generate well‐adapted anatomies and morphologies. Creeping perennials, like clover or bracken, seem to move around in the environment. They do this by extending into unoccupied space while the oldest tissues behind the growing and mature regions senesce, die and decompose. Trees do essentially the same thing, except that they develop vertically and the old dead tissue does not disappear but instead persists as wood. A root system is a kind of upended vertical perennial. The balance between exploratory growth and the wave of tissue death that succeeds it is a major determinant of perenniality. So although perenniality and annuality may appear to be dramatically different traits, extremes of behaviour can arise by a relatively minor change in the relationship between growth and death. This conclusion is supported by evidence from genome dosage studies, from the practical experiences of breeding perennial‐type traits into annual backgrounds and from molecular cladistics. Applications of methods for the genetic analysis of quantitative characters are described, including the exploitation of introgression mapping in Lolium–Festuca and quantitative trait locus mapping in cereals and other species.},

	abstract = {Compared with our knowledge of senescence processes in annuals and biennials, relatively little is known about age-related changes in perennials. The study of aging in plants is very complex and there is no consensus in general concepts related to this topic. Furthermore, there is also a problem of scaling up, which makes us wonder whether cells, tissues/organs or whole organisms really age in plants. This is particularly interesting in the case of perennials, which have the ability to make new leaves every year and live for several years or even centuries or millennia. Recent studies indicate that physiological burdens, such as demands on water and nutrient supply, are responsible for reduced growth as plants age. Aside from the extrinsic factors, it is also possible that intrinsic changes in the shoot meristems could occur through repeated cell divisions and could be fixed during plant development, thereby affecting the physiology of leaves that originated from these cells. Additionally, the increased size associated with the aging of woody perennials (trees and shrubs) has also been proposed as a determining factor responsible for the age-related reductions in growth and photosynthetic rates in leaves. This review is aimed at compiling our current understanding of aging in perennials. After defining some fundamental questions and concepts, and introducing the model plants presently used in the study of aging in perennials, the major role meristems play in perenniality and how aging is manifested in the physiology of perennials (changes in phytohormones, water relations, photosynthesis and oxidative stress) are described. Finally, the causes underlying age-related changes in perennials are discussed in detail and a model based on plant plasticity to explain the aging phenomenon in perennials is presented.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has recently seen huge success across multiple areas in the robotics domain. Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-toreal gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios. Finally, we discuss the main opportunities and challenges of the different approaches and point to the most promising directions.},

	abstract = {Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, open-loop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closed-loop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird's eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

In most of the countries where the expansion of cropland is merely impossible, agriculture automation has become the only option and is the need of the hour. Internet of things and Artificial intelligence have already started capitalizing across all the industries including agriculture. Advancement in these digital technologies has made revolutionary changes in agriculture by providing smart systems that can monitor, control, and visualize various farm operations in real-time and with comparable intelligence of human experts. The potential applications of IoT and AI in the development of smart farm machinery, irrigation systems, weed and pest control, fertilizer application, greenhouse cultivation, storage structures, drones for plant protection, crop health monitoring, etc. are discussed in the paper. The main objective of the paper is to provide an overview of recent research in the area of digital technology-driven agriculture and identification of the most prominent applications in the field of agriculture engineering using artificial intelligence and internet of things. The research work done in the areas during the last 10 years has been reviewed from the scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. It has been observed that the digitization of agriculture using AI and IoT has matured from their nascent conceptual stage and reached the execution phase. The technical details of artificial intelligence, IoT, and challenges related to the adoption of these digital technologies are also discussed.

To cultivate healthier crops, manage pests, monitor soil and growing conditions, analyse data for farmers, and enhance other management activities of the food supply chain, the agriculture sector is turning to AI technology. It makes it challenging for farmers to choose the ideal time to plant seeds. AI helps farmers choose the optimum seed for a particular weather scenario. It also offers data on weather forecasts. AI-powered solutions will help farmers produce more with fewer resources, increase crop quality, and hasten product time to reach the market. AI aids in understanding soil qualities. AI helps farmers by suggesting the nutrients they should apply to increase the quality of the soil. AI can help farmers choose the optimal time to plant their seeds. Intelligent equipment can calculate the spacing between seeds and the maximum planting depth. An AI-powered system known as a health monitoring system provides farmers with information on the health of their crops and the nutrients that need to be given to enhance yield quality and quantity. This study identifies and analyses relevant articles on AI for Agriculture. Using AI, farmers can now access advanced data and analytics tools that will foster better farming, improve efficiencies, and reduce waste in biofuel and food production while minimising the negative environmental impacts. AI and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed various industries, and the AI wave has now reached the agriculture sector. Companies are developing several technologies to make monitoring farmers' crop and soil health easier. Hyperspectral imaging and 3D laser scanning are the leading AI-based technologies that can help ensure crop health. These AI-powered technologies collect precise data on the health of the crops in greater volume for analysis. This paper studied AI and its need in Agriculture.

This paper proposes an intelligent N management system using deep reinforcement learning (RL) and crop simulations with Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). We first formulate the N management problem as an RL problem. We then train management policies with deep Q-network and soft actor-critic algorithms, and the Gym-DSSAT interface that allows for daily interactions between the simulated crop environment and RL agents. According to the experiments on the maize crop in both Iowa and Florida in the US, our RL-trained policies outperform previous empirical methods by achieving higher or similar yield while using less fertilizers},

	abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely applied to many control tasks and substantially improved the performances compared to conventional control methods in many domains where the reward function is well defined. However, for many real-world problems, it is often more convenient to formulate optimization problems in terms of rewards and constraints simultaneously. Optimizing such constrained problems via reward shaping can be difficult as it requires tedious manual tuning of reward functions with several interacting terms. Recent formulations which include constraints mostly require a pre-training phase, which often needs human expertise to collect data or assumes having a sub-optimal policy readily available. We propose a new constrained RL method called CSAC-LB (Constrained Soft Actor-Critic with Log Barrier Function), which achieves competitive performance without any pre-training by applying a linear smoothed log barrier function to an additional safety critic. It implements an adaptive penalty for policy learning and alleviates the numerical issues that are known to complicate the application of the log barrier function method. As a result, we show that with CSAC-LB, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several constrained control tasks with different levels of difficulty and evaluate our methods in a locomotion task on a real quadruped robot platform.},

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

	abstract = {Cold temperatures during fall and spring have the potential to cause frost damage to grapevines and other fruit plants, which can significantly decrease harvest yields. To help prevent these losses, farmers deploy expensive frost mitigation measures, such as, sprinklers, heaters, and wind machines, when they judge that damage may occur. This judgment, however, is challenging because the cold hardiness of plants changes throughout the dormancy period and it is difficult to directly measure. This has led scientists to develop cold hardiness prediction models that can be tuned to different grape cultivars based on laborious field measurement data. In this paper, we study whether deep-learning models can improve cold hardiness prediction for grapes based on data that has been collected over a 30-year time period. A key challenge is that the amount of data per cultivar is highly variable, with some cultivars having only a small amount. For this purpose, we investigate the use of multi-task learning to leverage data across cultivars in order to improve prediction performance for individual cultivars. We evaluate a number of multi-task learning approaches and show that the highest performing approach is able to significantly improve over learning for single cultivars and outperforms the current state-of-the-art scientific model for most cultivars.},

Active learning has shown promise in jointly optimising exploration-exploitation with minimal human supervision. However, existing active learning methods either rely on heuristic multi-criteria weighting or are limited to batch processing. In this paper, we present a new unified framework for joint exploration-exploitation active learning in streams without any heuristic weighting.

	abstract = {Accurate crop yield estimation is essential for ensuring national food security and sustainable development. The crop growth model is one of the primary methods for estimating production and has been effectively applied in simulating crop growth and development, environmental factor effects and yield formation processes. However, many related studies have focused on Gramineae crops, such as wheat, rice and maize, while there has been little research on rape and soybean yield estimation. Non-foliar green organs such as rape siliques and soybean pods make vital contributions to plant photosynthesis and influence crop output. The parameter calibration method based on the leaf area index (LAI) cannot satisfy the existing demand for high-precision yield estimation for crops with active non-foliar green organs. Therefore, a new method for crop growth model calibration was proposed, which considers non-foliar green organs and plant photosynthetic succession processes and combines them with those of leaves to construct a photosynthetic area index (PAI). With wheat, rape and soybean as the research objects, their yields were simulated via the proposed crop growth model calibration method. The results showed that using the proposed calibration method to calibrate World Food Study (WOFOST) model parameters on the basis of the PAI improved the yield estimation accuracy over that of the crop model calibration method based on the LAI. The determination coefficient (R2) of the total dry weight of storage organs (TWSO) simulation value increased from 0.73 (using the LAI) to more than 0.90 (using the PAI). The R2 values of TWSO at the rape calibration and verification points were 0.910 and 0.922, respectively, and the R2 values of TWSO at the soybean calibration and verification points were 0.741 and 0.926, respectively. The above results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed calibration method. Consequently, the application of the crop model calibration method proposed in this paper is important for accurately estimating the crop yield of plants with active non-foliar green organs, promoting the expansion of general crop models for different types of crops and achieving high-precision crop yield estimations.},

Part of the sward was shaded for one week before measure ments commenced. Measurements of ‘dark’ respiration continued for 46 hand it was possible to distinguish two components which are designated ‘maintenance’ and ‘synthetic’‘Maintenance’ respiration was taken to be the mean rate of CO2 efflux after 40–46 h darkness. When calculated on a plant d. wt basis at 15°C it ranged between 6 to 32mg CO2 g-1 day-1 during reproductive growth and 10–14 mg CO2 g-1 day-1 during vegetative growth. During reproductive growth, sward protein content ranged between 7–23 per cent and when maintenance respiration was recalculated on the basis of protein content it changed relatively little throughout the growth period (90–140 mg CO2 g pro tein-1 day-1); the value for vegetative growth ranged between 70–100mg CO2 g protein-day-1.Total ‘synthetic’ CO2 flux was determined during reproductive growth and a rate of ‘synthetic’ CO2 flux was determined during both reproductive and vegetative growth. Between 15 and 35 per cent of the CO2 fixed in the previous photoperiod was lost in ‘synthetic’ respiration of above-ground material in reproductive swards. Previous shading increased the proportion of ‘synthetic’ CO2 loss from above ground. The rate of ‘synthetic’ CO2 output during the first hours of darkness increased with amount of CO2 fixed in the previous photoperiod, although it was not proportional to it. There is some evidence that assimilate is ‘carried-over’ from one photoperiod to the next.},

To overcome these challenges, smart agriculture has emerged as the key technology. Deep Learning model with Internet of Things (IoT), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and edge–fog–cloud architecture enabled smart agriculture as a key component for next agriculture revolution. In this work, we present two stage end-to-end DRL based smart agricultural system. In stage one, we proposed ACO enabled DQN (MACO-DQN) model to offload task including fire detection, pest detection, crop growth monitoring, irrigation scheduling, soil monitoring, climate monitoring, field monitoring etc. MACO-DQN model offload the task to either edge, fog or cloud networking devices based on latency, energy consumption and computing power. Once the task offloaded to computing devices (edge, fog or cloud), task of prediction and monitoring various agriculture activities is performed at stage two. In stage two, we proposed DRL based DQN (RL-DQN) model for prediction and monitoring agricultural task activities. Finally, we demonstrate experimental findings of our proposed model that represent a marked enhancement in terms of convergence speed, planning success rate, and path accuracy. To evaluate its performance, the method presented in this paper was compared to traditional deep Q-networks-based intensive learning method under consistent experimental conditions.

	abstract = {Predicting crop yield based on the environmental, soil, water and crop parameters has been a potential research topic. Deep-learning-based models are broadly used to extract significant crop features for prediction. Though these methods could resolve the yield prediction problem there exist the following inadequacies: Unable to create a direct non-linear or linear mapping between the raw data and crop yield values; and the performance of those models highly relies on the quality of the extracted features. Deep reinforcement learning provides direction and motivation for the aforementioned shortcomings. Combining the intelligence of reinforcement learning and deep learning, deep reinforcement learning builds a complete crop yield prediction framework that can map the raw data to the crop prediction values. The proposed work constructs a Deep Recurrent Q-Network model which is a Recurrent Neural Network deep learning algorithm over the Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm to forecast the crop yield. The sequentially stacked layers of Recurrent Neural network is fed by the data parameters. The Q- learning network constructs a crop yield prediction environment based on the input parameters. A linear layer maps the Recurrent Neural Network output values to the Q-values. The reinforcement learning agent incorporates a combination of parametric features with the threshold that assist in predicting crop yield. Finally, the agent receives an aggregate score for the actions performed by minimizing the error and maximizing the forecast accuracy. The proposed model efficiently predicts the crop yield outperforming existing models by preserving the original data distribution with an accuracy of 93.7\%.},

	abstract = {Cold injury is a key environmental challenge in many grape-producing regions, especially those at high latitudes. Although grapevines acclimate to cold temperatures in fall and deacclimate when warm temperatures return in spring, cold hardiness varies with species, cultivar, phenology, ambient weather, photoperiod, and plant organ, which hampers implementation of effective mitigation practices. Using long-term data sets of lethal temperatures and spring phenology for primary buds of Vitis vinifera and Vitis labruscana, we parameterized and evaluated a discrete-dynamic model that simulates cold hardiness from early fall through budbreak of 23 genotypes. The model uses mean daily temperature as the sole input variable to drive daily changes in hardiness. Genotype-specific parameters, such as initial and maximum hardiness, temperature thresholds, acclimation and deacclimation rates, and chilling and heating requirements, were optimized through an iterative process. The model predicted cold hardiness with 0.89 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.99, depending on genotype. Because it simulates hardiness at budbreak, the model can also be used to predict the time of budbreak. Optimized model parameters revealed a north/inland-south/coastal gradient for genotype origin in terms of initial and maximum cold hardiness, and time of budbreak. Budbreak occurred earlier in hardier genotypes, consistent with more rapid deacclimation of genotypes originating from colder climates, paradoxically making these genotypes more vulnerable to spring frost in warmer environments. The current model of grapevine bud cold hardiness has uses in both climate modeling and risk assessment.},

	abstract = {Climate change is posing new challenges to crop-related concerns including food insecurity, supply stability and economic planning. As one of the central challenges, crop yield prediction has become a pressing task in the machine learning field. Despite its importance, the prediction task is exceptionally complicated since crop yields depend on various factors such as weather, land surface, soil quality as well as their interactions. In recent years, machine learning models have been successfully applied in this domain. However, these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region, or only study over a single or few years, which makes them hard to generalize spatially and temporally. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, to incorporate both geographical and temporal knowledge in the model, and further boost predictive power. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts the crop yields at county level nationwide. We also laid a solid foundation for the comparison with other machine learning baselines by applying well-known linear models, tree-based models, deep learning methods and comparing their performance. Experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on various metrics, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information.},

	abstract = {When an operational artificial neural network (ANN) model is deployed, new input patterns are collected in order to make real-time forecasts. However, ANNs (like other empirical and statistical methods) are unable to reliably extrapolate beyond the calibration range. Consequently, when deployed in real-time operation there is a need to determine if new input patterns are representative of the data used in calibrating the model. To address this problem, a novel detection system for identifying uncharacteristic data patterns is presented. This approach combines a self-organizing map (SOM), to partition the data set, with nonparametric kernel density estimators to calculate local density estimates (LDE). The SOM-LDE method determines the degree to which a new input pattern can be considered to be contained within the domain of the calibration set. If a new pattern is found to be uncharacteristic, a warning can be issued with the forecast, and the ANN model retrained to include the new pattern. This approach of selectively retraining the model is compared to no retraining and the more computationally onerous case of retraining the model after each new sample. These three approaches are applied to forecast flow in the Kentucky River, USA, using multilayer perceptron (MLP) models. The results demonstrate that there is a significant advantage in retraining an ANN that has been deployed as a real-time, operational model, and that the SOM-LDE classifier is an effective approach for identifying the model's range of applicability and assessing the usefulness of the forecast.},

While this is a convenient way to side-step the principles applied to the development of other types of models, this comes at significant cost in terms of the usefulness of the resulting models.

	abstract = {Data-driven discovery of governing equations in computational science has emerged as a new paradigm for obtaining accurate physical models and as a possible alternative to theoretical derivations. The recently developed physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have also been employed to learn governing equations given data across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite the effectiveness of PINNs for discovering governing equations, the physical models encoded in PINNs may be misspecified in complex systems as some of the physical processes may not be fully understood, leading to the poor accuracy of PINN predictions. In this work, we present a general approach to correct the misspecified physical models in PINNs for discovering governing equations, given some sparse and/or noisy data. Specifically, we first encode the assumed physical models, which may be misspecified, then employ other deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the discrepancy between the imperfect models and the observational data. Due to the expressivity of DNNs, the proposed method is capable of reducing the computational errors caused by the model misspecification and thus enables the applications of PINNs in complex systems where the physical processes are not exactly known. Furthermore, we utilize the Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) and/or ensemble PINNs to quantify uncertainties arising from noisy and/or gappy data in the discovered governing equations. A series of numerical examples including non-Newtonian channel and cavity flows demonstrate that the added DNNs are capable of correcting the model misspecification in PINNs and thus reduce the discrepancy between the physical models and the observational data. We envision that the proposed approach will extend the applications of PINNs for discovering governing equations in problems where the physico-chemical or biological processes are not well understood.},

	abstract = {It has been more than 20 years that the ISO 11783 (commonly designated as ISOBUS) was formed and now it is the widely used standard in agricultural machinery communication. As over the last years the industry is actively promoting ISOBUS, a number of sensor and control system appeared that are ISOBUS-compatible. These systems are focused on two main areas: (i) decision-making, where the sensors are usually mounted on the tractor and aim at varying the applied dose rates (seeds, fertilizer, etc.), and (ii) process monitoring, where they are mounted on the implement and monitor (and in some cases control) the proper application of the recommended dose rates. The aim of this review was to investigate the offered sensor and control systems and categorize them based on the performed application in order to better contextualize their importance. The relevant benefits by using them, but also the potential technical constraints based on their measuring elements were identified. The academic advances could not be missing from this review as all these years many researchers conducted ISOBUS-related research. The related publications were initially identified and later categorized from an operation-based perspective into three main research areas: (a) guidance and control, (b) data acquisition and transfer, and (c) data management and analytics. The scientific advances that are described give an insight into what should be expected in the following years in terms of commercially available solutions. Identified gaps and future challenges related to ISOBUS conclude this review providing, thus, expected future technical innovations but also potential research directions.},

Technological advances over the last few years have greatly increased our ability to collect, collate and analyse our data on a per-tree basis at large orchard scales. We call this the Digital-Twin Orchard. A digital-twin is a virtual model of every tree and surroundings. The pairing of the virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data and continuous monitoring of orchards production systems to predict stress, disease and crop losses, and to develop new opportunities for end-to-end learning. Monitoring of orchards is not a new concept but the digital-twin is a continuously learning system that could be queried automatically to analyse specific outcomes under varying simulated environmental and orchard management parameters. Digital-twin enables improvement of production and dynamic prediction of disease, stress and yield gaps using an end-to-end AI platform. In this paper, we present AgScan3D+: our automated dynamic canopy monitoring system to generate a digital-twin of every tree on a large orchard scale. AgScan3D+ consists of a spinning 3D LiDAR plus cameras that can be retrofitted to a farm vehicle and provides real time on-farm decision support by monitoring the condition of every plant in 3D such as their health, structure, stress, fruit quality, and more. The proposed system has been trialled in mango, macadamia, avocado and grapevines orchards and generated a digital-twin of 15,000 trees. The results were used to model canopy structural characteristics such as foliage density and light penetration distribution.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion (Li-I) batteries have recently become pervasive and are used in many physical assets. For the effective management of the batteries, reliable predictions of the end-of-discharge (EOD) and end-of-life (EOL) are essential. Many detailed electrochemical models have been developed for the batteries. Their parameters are calibrated before they are taken into operation and are typically not re-calibrated during operation. However, the degradation of batteries increases the reality gap between the computational models and the physical systems and leads to inaccurate predictions of EOD/EOL. The current calibration approaches are either computationally expensive (model-based calibration) or require large amounts of ground truth data for degradation parameters (supervised data-driven calibration). This is often infeasible for many practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework for reliably inferring calibration parameters of battery models in real time. Most importantly, the proposed methodology does not need any labeled data samples of observations and the ground truth parameters. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework is capable of inferring the model parameters in real time with better accuracy compared to approaches based on unscented Kalman filters. Furthermore, our results show better generalizability than supervised learning approaches even though our methodology does not rely on ground truth information during training.},

	abstract = {We propose a modeling paradigm, termed field inversion and machine learning (FIML), that seeks to comprehensively harness data from sources such as high-fidelity simulations and experiments to aid the creation of improved closure models for computational physics applications. In contrast to inferring model parameters, this work uses inverse modeling to obtain corrective, spatially distributed functional terms, offering a route to directly address model-form errors. Once the inference has been performed over a number of problems that are representative of the deficient physics in the closure model, machine learning techniques are used to reconstruct the model corrections in terms of variables that appear in the closure model. These reconstructed functional forms are then used to augment the closure model in a predictive computational setting. As a first demonstrative example, a scalar ordinary differential equation is considered, wherein the model equation has missing and deficient terms. Following this, the methodology is extended to the prediction of turbulent channel flow. In both of these applications, the approach is demonstrated to be able to successfully reconstruct functional corrections and yield accurate predictive solutions while providing a measure of model form uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as an alternative way of numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) without the need of building elaborate grids, instead, using a straightforward implementation. In particular, in addition to the deep neural network (DNN) for the solution, an auxiliary DNN is considered that represents the residual of the PDE. The residual is then combined with the mismatch in the given data of the solution in order to formulate the loss function. This framework is effective but is lacking uncertainty quantification of the solution due to the inherent randomness in the data or due to the approximation limitations of the DNN architecture. Here, we propose a new method with the objective of endowing the DNN with uncertainty quantification for both sources of uncertainty, i.e., the parametric uncertainty and the approximation uncertainty. We first account for the parametric uncertainty when the parameter in the differential equation is represented as a stochastic process. Multiple DNNs are designed to learn the modal functions of the arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) expansion of its solution by using stochastic data from sparse sensors. We can then make predictions from new sensor measurements very efficiently with the trained DNNs. Moreover, we employ dropout to quantify the uncertainty of DNNs in approximating the modal functions. We then design an active learning strategy based on the dropout uncertainty to place new sensors in the domain in order to improve the predictions of DNNs. Several numerical tests are conducted for both the forward and the inverse problems to demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs combined with uncertainty quantification. This NN-aPC new paradigm of physics-informed deep learning with uncertainty quantification can be readily applied to other types of stochastic PDEs in multi-dimensions.},

The particular numerical method used for integration depends on the application. Unfortunately, when physics is not fully understood, the discrepancies between predictions and observed responses can be large and unacceptable. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses observed data to estimate the missing physics in the original model (i.e., model-form uncertainty). In our approach, we first design recurrent neural networks to perform numerical integration of the ordinary differential equations. Then, we implement the recurrent neural network as a directed graph. This way, the nodes in the graph represent the physics-informed kernels found in the ordinary differential equations. We quantify the missing physics by carefully introducing data-driven in the directed graph. This allows us to estimate the missing physics (discrepancy term) even for hidden nodes of the graph. We studied the performance of our proposed approach with the aid of three case studies (fatigue crack growth, corrosion-fatigue crack growth, and bearing fatigue) and state-of-the-art machine learning software packages. Our results demonstrate the ability to perform estimation of discrepancy, reducing gap between predictions and observations, at reasonable computational cost.},

	abstract = {Derivatives, mostly in the form of gradients and Hessians, are ubiquitous in machine learning. Automatic diﬀerentiation (AD), also called algorithmic diﬀerentiation or simply “autodiﬀ”, is a family of techniques similar to but more general than backpropagation for eﬃciently and accurately evaluating derivatives of numeric functions expressed as computer programs. AD is a small but established ﬁeld with applications in areas including computational ﬂuid dynamics, atmospheric sciences, and engineering design optimization. Until very recently, the ﬁelds of machine learning and AD have largely been unaware of each other and, in some cases, have independently discovered each other’s results. Despite its relevance, general-purpose AD has been missing from the machine learning toolbox, a situation slowly changing with its ongoing adoption under the names “dynamic computational graphs” and “diﬀerentiable programming”. We survey the intersection of AD and machine learning, cover applications where AD has direct relevance, and address the main implementation techniques. By precisely deﬁning the main diﬀerentiation techniques and their interrelationships, we aim to bring clarity to the usage of the terms “autodiﬀ”, “automatic diﬀerentiation”, and “symbolic diﬀerentiation” as these are encountered more and more in machine learning settings.},

A Bayesian decision theorybased method is developed for this purpose, using a likelihood ratio as the validation metric for model assessment. An expected risk or cost function is deﬁned as a function of the decision costs, and the likelihood and prior of each hypothesis. The risk is minimized through correctly assigning experimental data to two decision regions based on the comparison of the likelihood ratio with a decision threshold. A Bayesian validation metric is derived based on the risk minimization criterion. Two types of validation tests are considered: pass/fail tests and system response value measurement tests. The methodology is illustrated for the validation of reliability prediction models in a tension bar and an engine blade subjected to high cycle fatigue. The proposed method can effectively integrate optimal experimental design into model validation to simultaneously reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of reliability model assessment.},

Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of speci®c applications. However, in any speci®c application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the speci®c context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of ®tting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc ®tting, and after calibration the model is used, with the ®tted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the ®tted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-®tting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

	abstract = {This work presents an optimal model management strategy that exploits multifidelity surrogate models to accelerate the estimation of statistics of outputs of computationally expensive high-fidelity models. Existing acceleration methods typically exploit a multilevel hierarchy of surrogate models that follow a known rate of error decay and computational costs; however, a general collection of surrogate models, which may include projection-based reduced models, data-fit models, support vector machines, and simplified-physics models, does not necessarily give rise to such a hierarchy. Our multifidelity approach provides a framework to combine an arbitrary number of surrogate models of any type. Instead of relying on error and cost rates, an optimization problem balances the number of model evaluations across the high-fidelity and surrogate models with respect to error and costs. We show that a unique analytic solution of the model management optimization problem exists under mild conditions on the models. Our multifidelity method makes occasional recourse to the high-fidelity model; in doing so it provides an unbiased estimator of the statistics of the high-fidelity model, even in the absence of error bounds and error estimators for the surrogate models. Numerical experiments with linear and nonlinear examples show that speedups by orders of magnitude are obtained compared to Monte Carlo estimation that invokes a single model only.},

	abstract = {In the context of digital twins, it is essential that a model gives an accurate description of the (controlled) dynamic behavior of a physical system during the system’s entire operational life. Therefore, model updating techniques are required that enable real-time updating of physically interpretable parameter values and are applicable to a wide range of (nonlinear) dynamical systems. As traditional, iterative, parameter updating methods may be computationally too expensive for real-time updating, the inverse mapping parameter updating (IMPU) method is proposed as an alternative. For this method, first, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained offline using novel features of simulated transient response data. Then, in the online phase, this ANN maps, with little computational cost, a set of measured output response features to parameter estimates enabling real-time model updating. In this paper, various types of transient response features are introduced to update parameter values of nonlinear dynamical systems with increased computational efficiency and accuracy. To analyze the efficacy of these features, the IMPU method is applied to a (simulated) nonlinear multibody system. It is shown that a smart selection of features, based on, e.g., the frequency content of the transient response, can improve the accuracy of the estimated parameter values, leading to more accurate updated models. Furthermore, the generalization capabilities of the ANNs are analyzed for these feature types, by varying the number of training samples and assessing the effect of incomplete training data. It is shown that the IMPU method can predict parameter values that are not part of the training data with acceptable accuracy as well.},

Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, can explore the environment autonomously to learn robust behaviors but may require impractical amounts of unsafe real-world data collection. To learn performant, robust policies without the burden of unsafe real-world data collection or extensive human supervision, we propose RialTo, a system for robustifying real-world imitation learning policies via reinforcement learning in "digital twin" simulation environments constructed on the fly from small amounts of real-world data. To enable this real-to-sim-to-real pipeline, RialTo proposes an easy-to-use interface for quickly scanning and constructing digital twins of real-world environments. We also introduce a novel "inverse distillation" procedure for bringing real-world demonstrations into simulated environments for efficient fine-tuning, with minimal human intervention and engineering required. We evaluate RialTo across a variety of robotic manipulation problems in the real world, such as robustly stacking dishes on a rack, placing books on a shelf, and six other tasks.

	abstract = {Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising enabling technologies for realizing smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0. DTs are characterized by the seamless integration between the cyber and physical spaces. The importance of DTs is increasingly recognized by both academia and industry. It has been almost 15 years since the concept of the DT was initially proposed. To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry. This paper also outlines the current challenges and some possible directions for future work.},

	abstract = {Digital twins are being adopted by increasingly more industries, transforming them and bringing new opportunities. Digital twins provide previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies. Recently, agriculture has seen several technological advancements, but it is still unclear if this community is making an effort to adopt digital twins in its operations. In this work, we employ a mixed-method approach to investigate the added-value of digital twins for agriculture. We examine the extent of digital twin adoption in agriculture, shed light on the concept and the benefits it brings, and provide an application-based roadmap for a more extended adoption. We report a literature review of digital twins in agriculture, covering years 2017-2020. We identify 28 use cases, and compare them with use cases in other disciplines. We compare reported benefits, service categories, and technology readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture. We distill the digital twin characteristics that can provide added-value to agriculture from the examined digital twin applications in agriculture and in other disciplines. Then, inspired by digital twin applications in other disciplines, we propose a roadmap for digital twins in agriculture, consisting of examples of growing complexity. We conclude this paper by identifying the distinctive characteristics of agricultural digital twins.},

	abstract = {Weather conditions have a significant impact on crops, and temperature is one of the main factors that controls plant development. Thermal time models based on temperature have been applied to predict the development of many species. To implement these models, determination of an appropriate base temperature (Tb) is required to characterize the differences among developmental stages and cultivars. The goal of this study was to determine the unique Tb and degree-days (DD) to predict budbreak, bloom, and veraison for 17 cultivars. Tb’s were estimated with the minimum variance method using phenological data collected over 23 years in Prosser, WA. Tb increased throughout grapevine development and ranged from 6.1 to 8.4°C for budbreak, from 7.2 to 10.5°C for bloom, and from 9.4 to 12.8°C for veraison. Starting DD accumulation on 1 Jan and using the Tb’s estimated for each cultivar, the duration to budbreak ranged from 78 to 180 DD, from budbreak to bloom ranged from 240 to 372 DD, and from bloom to veraison ranged from 556 to 800 DD. Errors in prediction varied between 4.8 and 7.8 days to budbreak, between 1.9 and 5.5 days to bloom, and between 7.1 and 12.4 days to veraison. Based on the errors in prediction, models that used an estimated Tb specific for a phenological stage performed better than models that had a fixed Tb of 0 and 10°C. The estimated thermal time parameters provide a simple approach for characterizing differences among cultivars and assist growers and industry in implementing management practices through simple decision support tools based on thermal time models.},

	abstract = {Thermal time models have been used to predict the development of many different species, including grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.). These models normally assume that there is a linear relationship between temperature and plant development. The goal of this study was to estimate the base temperature and duration in terms of thermal time for predicting veraison for four grapevine cultivars. Historical phenological data for four cultivars that were collected in the Pacific Northwest were used to develop the thermal time model. Base temperatures (Tb) of 0 and 10 °C and the best estimated Tb using three different methods were evaluated for predicting veraison in grapevine. Thermal time requirements for each individual cultivar were evaluated through analysis of variance, and means were compared using the Fisher’s test. The methods that were applied to estimate Tb for the development of wine grapes included the least standard deviation in heat units, the regression coefficient, and the development rate method. The estimated Tb varied among methods and cultivars. The development rate method provided the lowest Tb values for all cultivars. For the three methods, Chardonnay had the lowest Tb ranging from 8.7 to 10.7 °C, while the highest Tb values were obtained for Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon with 11.8 and 12.8 °C, respectively. Thermal time also differed among cultivars, when either the fixed or estimated Tb was used. Predictions of the beginning of ripening with the estimated temperature resulted in the lowest variation in real days when compared with predictions using Tb = 0 or 10 °C, regardless of the method that was used to estimate the Tb.},

The objective of the present work was to provide a reliable agro-meteorological model for simulating grapevine budburst occurrence all over France. The study was conducted using data from ten cultivars of grapevine (Cabernet Sauvignon, Chasselas, Chardonnay, Grenache, Merlot, Pinot Noir, Riesling, Sauvignon, Syrah, Ugni Blanc) and five locations (Bordeaux, Colmar, Angers, Montpellier, Epernay). First, we tested two commonly used models that do not take into account dormancy: growing degree days with a base temperature of 10°C (GDD10), and Riou’s model (RIOU). The errors of predictions of these models ranged between 9 and 21 days. Second, a new model (BRIN) was studied relying on well-known formalisms for orchard trees and taking into account the dormancy period. The BRIN model showed better performance in predicting budburst date than previous grapevine models. Analysis of the components of BRIN formalisms (calculation of dormancy, use of hourly temperatures, base temperature) explained the better performances obtained with the BRIN model. Base temperature was the main driver, while dormancy period was not significant in simulating budburst date. For each cultivar, we provide the parameter estimates that showed the best performance for both the BRIN model and the GDD model with a base temperature of 5°C.},

Various statistical measures were used to assess the performance and predictions of the model at the varietal level: model efficiency, root mean squared error and confidence intervals. The methodology might be used to understand varietal differences for other species in future studies.

	abstract = {The growth of fleshy fruits is still poorly understood as a result of the complex integration of water and solute fluxes, cell structural properties, and the regulation of whole plant source–sink relationships. To unravel the contribution of these processes to berry growth, a biophysical grape (Vitis vinifera L.) berry growth module was developed and integrated with a whole-plant functional–structural model, and was calibrated on two varieties, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The model captured well the variations in growth and sugar accumulation caused by environmental conditions, changes in leaf-to-fruit ratio, plant water status, and varietal differences, with obvious future application in predicting yield and maturity under a variety of production contexts and regional climates. Our analyses illustrated that grapevines strive to maintain proper ripening by partially compensating for a reduced source–sink ratio, and that under drought an enhanced berry sucrose uptake capacity can reverse berry shrinkage. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of phloem hydraulic conductance, sugar uptake, and surface transpiration on growth, while suggesting that cell wall extensibility and the turgor threshold for cell expansion had minor effects. This study demonstrates that this integrated model is a useful tool in understanding the integration and relative importance of different processes in driving fleshy fruit growth.},

	abstract = {Present investigations aimed at developing a unified cumulative degree day based model approach allowing for (i) a precise simulation of grapevine phenological development of a broad range of cultivars and (ii) a classification of the cultivar specific relative precocity of different cultivars at different stages of grape development. Based on a long-term (7-year) data set of high-resolution phenological observations for 11 cool climate cultivars originating from Remich/Luxembourg, the unified phenological model (UniPhen) was developed using a cumulative degree day approach with three temperature thresholds (lower threshold: 10 °C; upper threshold: 20 °C; heat threshold: 30 °C). The average normalized standard deviation of UniPhen over all stages and cultivars was 5.26 corresponding to 5.26 days at 15 °C. In the cross-validated model, on average 53\% of the observations were located in a range of ± 3 days and 82\% in a range of ±7 days (assuming daily mean temperatures of 15 °C) around the predicted date. The sequence of the cultivar-specific relative precocity was not stable over the different stages of phenological development. The model approach (i) enables a precise simulation of all 31 BBCH stages between beginning of the bud swell (01) and berries being ripe for harvest (89) for 11 cultivars grown in the climatic conditions of the Luxembourgish grapegrowing region and (ii) is open to being extended to other grape cultivars and re-calibrated under deviant climatic conditions. Due to their instability, a classification of the cultivars’ relative precocity is only reasonable if it relates to a specific phenological stage. UniPhen represents a precise high-resolution phenological model approach and might be applied as a bioclimatic indicator describing the suitability of a location/region for the cultivation of specific cultivars.},

This study aims to (i) determine if a temperature-based model can predict the time to target sugar concentrations from 170 to 220 g/L for Vitis vinifera L., (ii) use the best model to characterise the time to the specified target sugar concentrations for a wide range of cultivars with statistical evaluation of each cultivar's parameterisation, and (iii) establish cultivar classifications based on these thermal times to the specified target sugar concentrations. The Day of the Year (DOY) to reach the specified target sugar concentrations (170, 180, 190, 200, 210 and 220 g/L) was determined from time series of sugar concentrations collected from research institutes, extension services and private companies. Models were fitted for the species Vitis vinifera L. The two best-fit models for the DOY to reach the target sugar concentrations were selected using the Akaike Criterion (AIC) (evaluates model complexity and goodness of fit within one criterion) and assessed for model efficiency (EF) and error of prediction (RMSE, root means squared error) followed by a sensitivity analysis and model validation. The models were then parameterised for individual cultivars. The best model across all target sugar concentrations was the non-linear best Sigmoid model "best SIG"’ model (parameters: start date (t0) = 86, d =−0.1294, e = 14.87). The best linear (Growing Degree Days) model was also selected which represents the model that required the least parameters and therefore the simplest in application for winegrowers. This model was termed the “Grapevine Sugar Ripeness” model (GSR) (parameters: base temperature (Tb) = 0 °C, start date (t0) = 91 or 1 April, Northern Hemisphere). Both models performed better than the Winkler and Huglin growing degree day models. Sixty-five cultivars were classified for the thermal time to one or more of the six sugar targets using these two models. Fifty percent of all combinations of cultivar and time to target sugar concentrations had EF values greater than 0.5 and RMSE values less than seven days. Confidence intervals were calculated for cultivars where there was sufficient data for the thermal time to target sugar concentrations. The classifications generated from both models provides the opportunity to implement either model to support cultivar choice in response to concerns of climate change and may provide cultivar solutions to issues of harvesting grapes at high sugar concentrations with resultant higher alcohol wines.},

	abstract = {Background and goals Climate change induces shifts in suitable areas for the cultivation and phenology of grapevines, which regulate both complex sunlight patterns within hedgerows and canopy photosynthetic gain (CPG). However, suitability assessments of such areas have focused on climate indices (e.g., growing season temperature) but have ignored canopy photosynthesis, despite its close connection to berry yield and wine quality. Here, we aimed to develop a model of theoretical maxima of grapevine canopy photosynthesis under the clear sky without water- and nutrient-limitations that integrated canopy light interception, leaf thermal balance, and photosynthetic processes.
Methods and key findings Maps of CPG during berry development were obtained by running this model with observed hourly meteorological data collected from various sites worldwide and those under future climate with elevated air temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations (+2 K warmer, 500 μmol/mol and +4 K warmer, 850 μmol/mol). In high-latitude regions expected to become newly suitable in response to the temperature rise, the CPGs were projected to be greater than those in lower latitudes mainly because of higher cumulative light absorption, irrespective of a difference in cultivar-dependent thermal requirements for berry maturation. The higher CO2 concentrations also increased canopy photosynthesis in these regions. By contrast, at some prestigious sites located at lower latitudes, the projected leaf temperatures exceeded the optimal range for photosynthesis, resulting in reduced gains despite the CO2 fertilization effect.
Conclusions and significance Our results clarify significant spatiotemporal variations in grapevine canopy photosynthesis, with particular emphasis on the north-south gradient, and support the decision-making of grapegrowing stakeholders.},

Such observations have been used to suggest climate change is reshaping biological processes, with major implications for forecasts of future change. Here, we show that these results may simply be the outcome of using linear models to estimate nonlinear temperature responses, specifically for events that occur after a cumulative thermal threshold is met—a common model for many biological events. Corrections for the nonlinearity of temperature responses consistently remove the apparent decline. Our results show that rising temperatures combined with linear estimates based on calendar time produce the observations of declining sensitivity—without any shift in the underlying biology. Current methods may thus undermine efforts to identify when and how warming will reshape biological processes.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture, including crop and livestock production, forestry and associated land use changes, are responsible for a significant fraction of anthropogenic emissions, up to 30\% according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Yet while emissions from fossil fuels are updated yearly and by multiple sources—including national-level statistics from the International Energy Agency (IEA)—no comparable efforts for reporting global statistics for agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) emissions exist: the latest complete assessment was the 2007 IPCC report, based on 2005 emission data. This gap is critical for several reasons. First, potentially large climate funding could be linked in coming decades to more precise estimates of emissions and mitigation potentials. For many developing countries, and especially the least developed ones, this requires improved assessments of AFOLU emissions. Second, growth in global emissions from fossil fuels has outpaced that from AFOLU during every decade of the period 1961–2010, so the relative contribution of the latter to total climate forcing has diminished over time, with a need for regular updates. We present results from a new GHG database developed at FAO, providing a complete and coherent time series of emission statistics over a reference period 1961–2010, at country level, based on FAOSTAT activity data and IPCC Tier 1 methodology. We discuss results at global and regional level, focusing on trends in the agriculture sector and net deforestation. Our results complement those available from the IPCC, extending trend analysis to a longer historical period and, critically, beyond 2005 to more recent years. In particular, from 2000 to 2010, we find that agricultural emissions increased by 1.1\% annually, reaching 4.6 Gt CO2 yr−1 in 2010 (up to 5.4–5.8 Gt CO2 yr−1 with emissions from biomass burning and organic soils included). Over the same decade 2000–2010, the ratio of agriculture to fossil fuel emissions has decreased, from 17.2\% to 13.7\%, and the decrease is even greater for the ratio of net deforestation to fossil fuel emissions: from 19.1\% to 10.1\%. In fact, in the year 2000, emissions from agriculture have been consistently larger—about 1.2 Gt CO2 yr−1 in 2010—than those from net deforestation.},

	abstract = {The human population is projected to reach more than 10 billion in the year 2100. Together with changing consumption pattern, population growth will lead to increasing food demand. The question arises whether or not the Earth is capable of fulfilling this demand. In this study, we approach this question by estimating the carrying capacity of current agricultural systems (KC), which does not measure the maximum number of people the Earth is likely to feed in the future, but rather allows for an indirect assessment of the increases in agricultural productivity required to meet demands. We project agricultural food production under progressing climate change using the state-of-the-art dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL, and input data of 3 climate models. For 1990 to 2100 the worldwide annual caloric yield of the most important 11 crop types is simulated. Model runs with and without elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations are performed in order to investigate CO2 fertilization effects. Country-specific per-capita caloric demands fixed at current levels and changing demands based on future GDP projections are considered to assess the role of future dietary shifts. Our results indicate that current population projections may considerably exceed the maximum number of people that can be fed globally if climate change is not accompanied by significant changes in land use, agricultural efficiencies and/or consumption pathways. We estimate the gap between projected population size and KC to reach 2 to 6.8 billion people by 2100. We also present possible caloric self-supply changes between 2000 and 2100 for all countries included in this study. The results show that predominantly developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions will experience vast decreases of self-supply. Therefore, this study is important for planning future large-scale agricultural management, as well as the critical assessment of population projections, which should take food-mediated climate change feedbacks into account.},

In this paper we provide an updated description of the model and reflect on the lessons learned over the last 25 years. The latter includes issues like system performance, model sensitivity, spatial model setup, parameterization and calibration approaches as well as software implementation and version management. Particularly for spatial model calibrations we provide experience and guidelines on how to execute calibrations and how to evaluate WOFOST model simulation results, particularly under conditions of limited field data availability. As an open source model WOFOST has been a success with at least 10 different implementations of the same concept. An overview is provided for those implementations which are managed by MARS or Wageningen groups. However, the proliferation of WOFOST implementations has also led to questions on the reproducibility of results from different implementations as is demonstrated with an example from MARS. In order to certify that the different WOFOST implementations and versions available can reproduce basic sets of inputs and outputs we make available a large set of test cases as appendix to this publication. Finally, new methodological extensions have been added to WOFOST in simulating the impact of nutrients limitations, extreme events and climate variability. Also, a difference is made in the operational and scientific versions of WOFOST with different licensing models and possible revenue generation. Capitalizing both on academic development as well as model testing in real-world situations will help to enable new applications of the WOFOST model in precision agriculture and smart farming.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) model in simulating jujube fruit tree growth under different irrigation treatments. The model was calibrated on data obtained from full irrigation treatments in 2016 and 2017. The model was validated on four deficit percentages (60\%, 70\%, 80\%, and 90\%) and one full irrigation treatment from 2016 to 2018. Calibrated R2 and RMSE values of simulated versus measured soil moisture content, excluding samples on the day of irrigation and first day after irrigation, reached 0.94 and 0.005 cm3 cm−3. The model reproduced growth dynamics of the total biomass and leaf area index, with a validated R2 = 0.967 and RMSE = 0.915 t ha−1, and R2 = 0.962 and RMSE = 0.160 m2 m−2, respectively. The model also showed good global performance, with R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.51 t ha−1, as well as good local agreement (R2      ≥   0.8    ) and prediction accuracy (RMSE     ≤   0.62     t ha−1) for each growth season. Furthermore, 90\% of full irrigation can be recommended to achieve a balance between jujube yields and water savings (average decline ratio of yield ≤ 3.8\%).},

In many problem domains, however, an agent suffers from limited sensing capabilities that preclude it from recovering a Markovian state signal from its perceptions. Extending the MDP framework, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) allow for principled decision making under conditions of uncertain sensing. In this chapter we present the POMDP model by focusing on the differences with fully observable MDPs, and we show how optimal policies for POMDPs can be represented. Next, we give a review of model-based techniques for policy computation, followed by an overview of the available model-free methods for POMDPs. We conclude by highlighting recent trends in POMDP reinforcement learning.},

While best known for being the core of the artificial intelligence (AI) world’s best Go game player, RL has a vast range of potential applications. RL may help to address some of the criticisms leveled against crop management decision support systems (DSS): it is an interactive, geared towards action, contextual tool to evaluate series of crop operations faced with uncertainties. A review of RL use for crop management DSS reveals a limited number of contributions. We profile key prospects for a human-centered, real-world, interactive RL-based system to face tomorrow’s agricultural decisions, and theoretical and ongoing practical challenges that may explain its current low uptake. We argue that a joint research effort from the RL and agronomy communities is necessary to explore RL’s full potential.},

	abstract = {The rapidly growing global population presents challenges and demands for efficient production of healthy fresh food. Autonomous greenhouse equipped with standard sensors and actuators (such as heating and lighting) which enables control of indoor climate for crop production, contributes to producing higher yields. However, it requires skilled and expensive labor, as well as a large amount of energy. An autonomous greenhouse control strategy, powered by AI algorithms by optimizing the yields and resource use simultaneously, offers an ideal solution to the dilemma. 
In this paper, we propose a two-stage planning framework to automatically optimize greenhouse control setpoints given specific outside weather conditions. Firstly, we take advantage of cumulative planting data and horticulture knowledge to build a multi-modular simulator using neural networks, to simulate climate change and crop growth in the greenhouse. Secondly, two AI algorithms (reinforcement learning and heuristic algorithm) as planning methods are applied to obtain optimal control strategies based on the simulator.
We evaluate our framework on a cherry-tomato planting dataset and demonstrate that the simulator is able to simulate greenhouse planting processes with high accuracy and fast speed. Moreover, the control strategies produced by the AI algorithms all obtain superhuman performance, in particular, significantly outperform all teams of the second “Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge” in terms of net profits.},

The objectives of this study were to investigate the potential use of a modified WOFOST model for predicting jujube yield by introducing tree age as a key parameter. The model was established using data collected from dedicated field experiments performed in 2016–2018. Simulated growth dynamics of dry weights of leaves, stems, fruits, total biomass and leaf area index (LAI) agreed well with measured values, showing root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.143, 0.333, 0.366, 0.624 t ha−1 and 0.19, and R2 values of 0.947, 0.976, 0.985, 0.986 and 0.95, respectively. Simulated phenological development stages for emergence, anthesis and maturity were 2, 3 and 3 days earlier than the observed values, respectively. In addition, in order to predict the yields of trees with different ages, the weight of new organs (initial buds and roots) in each growing season was introduced as the initial total dry weight (TDWI), which was calculated as averaged, fitted and optimized values of trees with the same age. The results showed the evolution of the simulated LAI and yields profiled in response to the changes in TDWI. The modelling performance was significantly improved when it considered TDWI integrated with tree age, showing good global (R2≥0.856, RMSE≤0.68 t ha−1) and local accuracies (mean R2≥0.43, RMSE≤0.70 t ha−1). Furthermore, the optimized TDWI exhibited the highest precision, with globally validated R2 of 0.891 and RMSE of 0.591 t ha−1, and local mean R2 of 0.57 and RMSE of 0.66 t ha−1, respectively. The proposed model was not only verified with the confidence to accurately predict yields of jujube, but it can also provide a fundamental strategy for simulating the growth of other fruit trees.},

The results showed that the performance of initial parameters established by previous research and partial measured data was relatively poor, with a relative error (RE) of 20.95\% for annual yield. The simulation after model parameter calibration significantly improved model prediction accuracy. The predicted SF was 2588 kg/ha and AF was 601 kg/ha with a RE of -5.51\%.

A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to assess the effect of changing parameters values on the yield simulated by the model (both EMS and MMS) for different crops (winter and durum wheat, winter barley, maize, sunflower) grown under a variety of conditions (including future climate realisations) in Europe. A two-step SA was performed using global techniques: the Morris screening method for qualitative ranking of parameters was first used, followed by the eFAST variance-based method, which attributes portions of variance in the model output to each parameter. The results showed that the parameters related to the partitioning of assimilates to storage organs (FOTB) and to the conversion efficiency of photosynthates into storage organs (CVO) generally affected considerably the simulated yield (also underlying tight correlation with this output), whereas the parameters involved with respiration rate (Q10) or specific leaf area (SLA) became influential in case of unfavourable weather conditions. Major differences between EMS and MMS (which includes a component simulating the impact of extreme weather events) emerged in extreme cases of crop failure triggered by markedly negative minimum temperatures. With few exceptions, the two SA methods revealed the same parameter ranking. We argue that the SA performed in this study can be useful in the design of crop modelling studies and in the implementation of crop yield forecasting systems in Europe.},

	abstract = {A new maize (Zea mays L.) simulation model, Hybrid-Maize, was developed by combining the strengths of two modeling approaches: the growth and development functions in maize-specific models represented by CERES-Maize, and the mechanistic formulation of photosynthesis and respiration in generic crop models such as INTERCOM and WOFOST. It features temperature-driven maize phenological development, vertical canopy integration of photosynthesis, organ-specific growth respiration, and temperature-sensitive maintenance respiration. The inclusion of gross assimilation, growth respiration and maintenance respiration makes the Hybrid-Maize model potentially more responsive to changes in environmental conditions than models such as CERES-Maize. Hybrid-Maize also requires fewer genotype-specific parameters without sacrificing prediction accuracy. A linear relationship between growing degree-days (GDD) from emergence to silking and GDD from emergence to physiological maturity was used for prediction of day of silking when the former is not available. The total GDD is readily available for most commercial maize hybrids. Preliminary field evaluations at two locations under high-yielding growth conditions indicated close agreement between simulated and measured values for leaf area, dry matter accumulation, final grain and stover yields, and harvest index (HI). Key areas for further model improvement include LAI prediction at high plant density, and biomass partitioning, carbohydrate translocation, and maintenance respiration in response to above-average temperature, especially during reproductive growth. The model has not been evaluated under conditions of water and/or nutrient stress, and efforts are currently in progress to develop and validate water and nitrogen balance components for the Hybrid-Maize model.},

	abstract = {Aim Intercomparison of mechanistic and empirical models is an important step towards improving projections of potential species distribution and abundance. We aim to compare suitability and productivity estimates for a well-understood crop species to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of mechanistic versus empirical modelling. Location South Africa. Methods We compared four habitat suitability models for dryland maize based on climate and soil predictors. Two were created using maximum entropy (MAXENT), the first based on national crop distribution points and the second based only on locations with high productivity. The third approach used a generalized additive model (GAM) trained with continuous productivity data derived from the satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The fourth model was a mechanistic crop growth model (DSSAT) made spatially explicit. We tested model accuracy by comparing the results with observed productivity derived from MODIS NDVI and with observed suitability based on the current spatial distribution of maize crop fields. Results The GAM and DSSAT results were linearly correlated to NDVI-measured yield (R2 = 0.75 and 0.37, respectively). MAXENT suitability values were not linearly related to yield (R2 = 0.08); however, a MAXENT model based on occurrences of high-productivity maize was linearly related to yield (R2 = 0.62). All models produced crop suitability maps of similarly good accuracy (Kappa = 0.73–75). Main conclusions These findings suggest that empirical models can achieve the same or better accuracy as mechanistic models for predicting both suitability (i.e. species range) and productivity (i.e. species abundance). While MAXENT could not predict productivity across the species range when trained on all occurrences, it could when trained with a high-productivity subset, suggesting that ecological niche models can be adjusted to better correlate with species abundance.},

	abstract = {We describe a new physics engine tailored to model-based control. Multi-joint dynamics are represented in generalized coordinates and computed via recursive algorithms. Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available.},

	abstract = {Simulations are attractive environments for training agents as they provide an abundant source of data and alleviate certain safety concerns during the training process. But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this "reality gap". By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics, including ones that differ significantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system. Our approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired location from random initial configurations. We explore the impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting policies are robust to significant calibration error.},

AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo’s own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo’s games.

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) holds the promise of automating the acquisition of complex controllers that can map sensory inputs directly to low-level actions. In the domain of robotic locomotion, deep RL could enable learning locomotion skills with minimal engineering and without an explicit model of the robot dynamics. Unfortunately, applying deep RL to real-world robotic tasks is exceptionally difficult, primarily due to poor sample complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. While hyperparameters can be easily tuned in simulated domains, tuning may be prohibitively expensive on physical systems, such as legged robots, that can be damaged through extensive trial-and-error learning. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient deep RL algorithm based on maximum entropy RL that requires minimal per-task tuning and only a modest number of trials to learn neural network policies. We apply this method to learning walking gaits on a real-world Minitaur robot. Our method can acquire a stable gait from scratch directly in the real world in about two hours, without relying on any model or simulation, and the resulting policy is robust to moderate variations in the environment. We further show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated benchmarks with a single set of hyperparameters.

	volume = {58},
	abstract = {Regional crop yield prediction is a significant component of national food security
assessment and food policy making. The crop growth model based on field scale is limited
when it is extrapolated to regional scale to estimate crop yield due to the uncertainty of the
input parameters. The data assimilation method which combines crop growth model and
remotely sensed data has been proven to be the most effective method in regional yield
estimation. The methods based on cost function are powerless with crop dynamic growth
simulation and state variable dynamic update. However, sequence assimilation method has
more advantages to overcome these problems, this paper presents a method of assimilation
of time series HJ-1 A/B Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) into the coupled
model (e.g. WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) crop growth model and A two layer Canopy
Reflectance Model (ACRM) radiative transfer mode) for winter wheat yield estimates using
Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) at the regional scale. The WOFOST model was selected as
the crop growth model and calibrated and validated by the field measured data in order
to accurately simulate the state variables and the growing process of winter wheat. The
theoretically optimal time series LAI profile was obtained with the EnKF algorithm to
reduce the errors which existed in both time series HJ-1 CCD NDVI and WOFOST–ACRM
model. Finally, the winter wheat yield at the county level was estimated based on the
optimized WOFOST model running on the wheat planting pixel. The experiment illustrates
that in the potential mode, the EnKF algorithm has significantly improved the regional
winter wheat yield estimates (R2 = 0.51, RMSE = 775 kg/ha) over the WOFOST simulation
without assimilation (R2 = 0.25, RMSE = 2168 kg/ha) at county level compared to the
official statistical yield data. Meanwhile, in the water-limited mode the results showed
a high correlation (R2 = 0.53, RMSE = 3005 kg/ha) with statistical data. In general,
our results indicate that EnKF is a reliable optimization method for assimilating remotely
sensed data into the crop growth model for predicting regional winter wheat yield.},

	abstract = {Calibration of crop model is standard practice, and it involves estimation of crop parameters based upon observed field data. It is the process of estimation of unknown parameters using practical observations. It is generally carried out manually by adjusting the parameters of the model. It consists of choosing the accurate numbers of coefficients that play a significant role in the adjustment of soil nitrogen, soil organic carbon, soil phosphorus, crop growth, phenological development, biomass accumulation, dry-matter partitioning, nutrients uptake, grain dry weight, grain numbers, grain yield, grain nitrogen (N) at maturity and protein content. A minimum data set (MDS) is required for the calibration of the model. A number of different steps could be used to calibrate the crop model. The initial step involves running of the model with default crop parameters and comparison of simulation outcomes with the observed data set. Afterwards, crop parameters are adjusted to have good agreement with observed and simulated data. It starts with phenology, then vegetative growth and biomass, afterwards yield components and finally yield. Optimization tools such as generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be used for the calibration. Finally, evaluation of models needs to be performed with independent data set. The quantification of calibration and evaluation goodness should be evaluated by different skill scores such as root-mean-squared error (RMSE)/root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), relative RMSE (RRMSE) or normalized objective function (NOF), root-mean-square deviation-systematic error (RMSDse), root-mean-square deviation-non-systematic error (RMSDnse), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (ME), coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe modelling efficiency (EF) test, maximum difference (MD) and D index (index of agreement).

	abstract = {CY-Bench: A comprehensive benchmark dataset for sub-national crop yield forecasting

Overview

CY-Bench is a dataset and benchmark for subnational crop yield forecasting, with coverage of major crop growing countries of the world for maize and wheat. By subnational, we mean the administrative level where yield statistics are published. When statistics are available for multiple levels, we pick the highest resolution. The dataset combines sub-national yield statistics with relevant predictors, such as growing-season weather indicators, remote sensing indicators, evapotranspiration, soil moisture indicators, and static soil properties. CY-Bench has been designed and curated by agricultural experts, climate scientists, and machine learning researchers from the AgML Community, with the aim of facilitating model intercomparison across the diverse agricultural systems around the globe in conditions as close as possible to real-world operationalization. Ultimately, by lowering the barrier to entry for ML researchers in this crucial application area, CY-Bench will facilitate the development of improved crop forecasting tools that can be used to support decision-makers in food security planning worldwide.

* Crops : Wheat \& Maize* Spatial Coverage : Wheat (29 countries), Maize (38).  See CY-Bench paper appendix for the list of countries.* Temporal Coverage : Varies. See country-specific data

It is an adapted version of LINTUL2 (that simulates potential and water-limited crop growth), including nitrogen limitation.

The effect of nitrogen stress on crop growth is tested in the model either through a reduction in LUE or leaf area (LA) or a combination of these two and further evaluated with independent datasets. However, water limitation is not considered in the present study as the crop is paddy rice. This paper describes the model for the case of rice, test the hypotheses of N stress on crop growth and details of model calibration and testing using independent data sets of nitrogen treatments (with fertilizer rates of 0–400kgNha−1) under varying environmental conditions in Asia. Results of calibration and testing are compared graphically, through Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), and by Average Absolute Deviation (AAD). Overall average absolute deviation values for calibration and testing of total aboveground biomass show less than 26\% mean deviation from the observations though the values for individual experiments show a higher deviation up to 41\%. In general, the model responded well to nitrogen stress in all the treatments without fertilizer application as observed, but between fertilized treatments the response was varying.},

	abstract = {Agricultural systems science generates knowledge that allows researchers to consider complex problems or take informed agricultural decisions. The rich history of this science exemplifies the diversity of systems and scales over which they operate and have been studied. Modeling, an essential tool in agricultural systems science, has been accomplished by scientists from a wide range of disciplines, who have contributed concepts and tools over more than six decades. As agricultural scientists now consider the “next generation” models, data, and knowledge products needed to meet the increasingly complex systems problems faced by society, it is important to take stock of this history and its lessons to ensure that we avoid re-invention and strive to consider all dimensions of associated challenges. To this end, we summarize here the history of agricultural systems modeling and identify lessons learned that can help guide the design and development of next generation of agricultural system tools and methods. A number of past events combined with overall technological progress in other fields have strongly contributed to the evolution of agricultural system modeling, including development of process-based bio-physical models of crops and livestock, statistical models based on historical observations, and economic optimization and simulation models at household and regional to global scales. Characteristics of agricultural systems models have varied widely depending on the systems involved, their scales, and the wide range of purposes that motivated their development and use by researchers in different disciplines. Recent trends in broader collaboration across institutions, across disciplines, and between the public and private sectors suggest that the stage is set for the major advances in agricultural systems science that are needed for the next generation of models, databases, knowledge products and decision support systems. The lessons from history should be considered to help avoid roadblocks and pitfalls as the community develops this next generation of agricultural systems models.},

This paper describes the water, nitrogen, and crop growth components of CropSyst, a comprehensive cropping systems simulation model, and provides preliminary verification of these components. The water budget of the model properly describes crop water use. Predicted nitrogen contents throughout the soil profile did not exactly match the measured values from leaching experiments, but they did follow the general trends of the data. The agreement between simulated and observed biomass and yield of corn, winter wheat and spring wheat grown in two locations with a total of 77 data points was good as shown by several statistical indicators. Based on this preliminary validation, CropSyst appears promising as a tool to analyze management practices for water and nitrogen. Additional validation of model components, including a wide range of crops and conditions, should be conducted in the future.},

A key innovation is change from a core concept of a crop responding to resource supplies to that of a soil responding to weather, management and crops. While this achieves a sound logical structure for improved simulation of soil management and long-term change in the soil resource, it does so without loss of sensitivity in simulating crop yields. This concept is implemented using a program structure in which all modules (e.g. growth of specific crops, soil water, soil N, erosion) communicate with each other only by messages passed via a central ‘engine’. Using a standard interface design, this design enables easy removal, replacement, or exchange of modules without disruption to the operation of the system. Simulation of crop sequences and multiple crops are achieved by managing connection of crop growth modules to the engine. A shell of software tools has been developed within a WINDOWS environment which includes user-installed editor, linker, compiler, testbed generator, graphics, database and version control software. While the engine and modules are coded in FORTRAN, the Shell is in C++. The resulting product is one in which the functions are coded in the language most familiar to the developers of scientific modules but provides many of the features of object oriented programming. The Shell is written to be aware of UNIX operating systems and be capable of using the processor on UNIX workstations.},

	abstract = {stics is a model that has been developed at INRA (France) since 1996. It simulates crop growth as well as soil water and nitrogen balances driven by daily climatic data. It calculates both agricultural variables (yield, input consumption) and environmental variables (water and nitrogen losses). From a conceptual point of view, stics relies essentially on well-known relationships or on simplifications of existing models. One of the key elements of stics is its adaptability to various crops. This is achieved by the use of generic parameters relevant for most crops and on options in the model formalisations concerning both physiology and management, that have to be chosen for each crop. All the users of the model form a group that participates in making the model and the software evolve, because stics is not a fixed model but rather an interactive modelling platform. This article presents version 5.0 by giving details on the model formalisations concerning shoot ecophysiology, soil functioning in interaction with roots, and relationships between crop management and the soil–crop system. The data required to run the model relate to climate, soil (water and nitrogen initial profiles and permanent soil features) and crop management. The species and varietal parameters are provided by the specialists of each species. The data required to validate the model relate to the agronomic or environmental outputs at the end of the cropping season. Some examples of validation and application are given, demonstrating the generality of the stics model and its ability to adapt to a wide range of agro-environmental issues. Finally, the conceptual limits of the model are discussed.},

The Erosion-Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) Cropping Systems model simulates the effects of weather, soil characteristics, tillage, fertilization, irrigation and other management practices on crops grown in complex rotations. The present study was conducted to evaluate EPIC's ability to simulate growth and yield of corn (Zea mays L.), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) when grown in rotations at three levels of management inputs, including three levels each of fertilizer, irrigation and tillage, over a 5-year period. After calibration, the root mean square error of simulated model grain yields ranged from 0.4 Mg ha−1 for sunflower to 1.6 Mg ha−1 for corn. Only in the case of winter wheat were mean simulated yields significantly different from mean measured yields. Simulations were more accurate for summer crops than for winter wheat, primarily because EPIC overestimated the effects of cool spring temperatures on wheat development in 1986. We conclude that EPIC can simulate yields of summer crops grown in complex rotations in southern France with accuracy acceptable for many applications. The model could be improved by more accurate simulation of disease effects, like those suffered by wheat in 1988, and by more accurate simulation of the effects of cool temperatures on winter wheat phenology.},

	abstract = {The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT–CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT–CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT–CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.},

In such a wide range of crop models, users should have the possibility to choose the most suitable, in terms of detail, scale and representativeness, to their objectives. However, even when an appropriate choice is made, model limitations should be clarified such that modelling studies are put in the proper perspective and robust applications are achieved. This work is an overview of available models to simulate crop growth and yield. A summary matrix with more than 70 crop models is provided, storing the main model characteristics that can help users to choose the proper tool according to their purposes. Overall, we found that two main aspects of models, despite their importance, are not always clear from the published references, i.e. the versatility of the models, in terms of reliable transferability to different conditions, and the degree of complexity. Hence, the developers of models should be encouraged to pay more attention to clarifying the model limitations and limits of applicability, and users should make an effort in proper model selection, to save time often devoted to iteration of tuning steps to force an inappropriate model to be adapted to their own purpose. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Few studies deal with the application of crop growth models to fruit trees. This research focuses on simulating the growth process, yield and soil moisture assessment of pear trees, considering pruning with a modiﬁed WOrld FOod Studies (WOFOST) model. Field trials (eight pruning treatments) were conducted in pear orchards in Alaer and Awat in Xinjiang, China and data were measured to calibrate and evaluate the modiﬁed model. In two pear orchards, the simulated total dry weight of storage organs (TWSO) and leaf area index (LAI) were in good agreement with the ﬁeld measurements of each pruning intensity treatment, indicating that the R2 values of TWSO ranged from 0.899 to 0.976, and the R2 values of LAI ranged from 0.849 to 0.924. The modiﬁed model also showed high accuracy, with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging from 12.19\% to 26.11\% for TWSO, and the NRMSE values for LAI were less than 10\%. The modiﬁed model also had a good simulation performance for the soil moisture (SM) under all eight pruning intensity treatments, showing good agreement (0.703 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.878) and low error (NRMSE ≤ 7.47\%). The measured and simulated results of different pruning intensities showed that the highest yield of pear trees was achieved when the pruning intensity was about 20\%, and the yield increased and then decreased with the increase in pruning intensity. In conclusion, the modiﬁed WOFOST model can better describe the effects of summer pruning on pear tree growth, yield and soil moisture than the unmodiﬁed model, providing a promising quantitative analysis method for the numerical simulation and soil moisture assessment of fruit tree growth.},

To simulate N runoff a simple approach was used, in which runoff is based on the N concentration in the soil solution and an extraction coefficient. Firstly, APSIM parameters that have the largest effect on runoff of water and N were determined for terrains with different slopes for a poorly drained silt loam. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to assess the effect of soil hydraulic properties and soil organic carbon content on runoff losses. Finally, APSIM was set up to simulate pasture production and water and N dynamics (including pasture N uptake, leaching and N runoff) for a farm on rolling hills in South Canterbury, New Zealand. Two different fertilisation approaches were used, either scheduled or based on the aboveground N concentration of the pasture. For the poorly drained silt loam, the rainfall intensity and the surface conductance had the highest effect on the amount of water lost by runoff. Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation and field capacity, as well as plant available water content also controlled runoff of water and N, while the organic carbon content of the topsoil had less effect on N runoff. Both the extraction coefficient and the depth considered to exchange N with the runoff water affected the amount of N lost via runoff. Using the aboveground pasture N concentration prior to fertilisation had positive effects on pasture yield and reduced N runoff losses.},

	abstract = {Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims at learning effective policies from historical data without extra environment interactions. During our experience of applying offline RL, we noticed that previous offline RL benchmarks commonly involve significant reality gaps, which we have identified include rich and overly exploratory datasets, degraded baseline, and missing policy validation. In many real-world situations, to ensure system safety, running an overly exploratory policy to collect various data is prohibited, thus only a narrow data distribution is available. The resulting policy is regarded as effective if it is better than the working behavior policy; the policy model can be deployed only if it has been well validated, rather than accomplished the training. In this paper, we present a Near real-world offline RL benchmark, named NeoRL, to reflect these properties. NeoRL datasets are collected with a more conservative strategy. Moreover, NeoRL contains the offline training and offline validation pipeline before the online test, corresponding to real-world situations. We then evaluate recent state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on NeoRL. The empirical results demonstrate that some offline RL algorithms are less competitive to the behavior cloning and the deterministic behavior policy, implying that they may be less effective in real-world tasks than in the previous benchmarks. We also disclose that current offline policy evaluation methods could hardly select the best policy. We hope this work will shed some light on future research and deploying RL in real-world systems.},

As a benchmark tailored for studying RL generalization, we introduce Avalon, a set of tasks in which embodied agents in highly diverse procedural 3D worlds must survive by navigating terrain, hunting or gathering food, and avoiding hazards. Avalon is unique among existing RL benchmarks in that the reward function, world dynamics, and action space are the same for every task, with tasks differentiated solely by altering the environment; its 20 tasks, ranging in complexity from eat and throw to hunt and navigate, each create worlds in which the agent must perform specific skills in order to survive. This setup enables investigations of generalization within tasks, between tasks, and to compositional tasks that require combining skills learned from previous tasks. Avalon includes a highly efficient simulator, a library of baselines, and a benchmark with scoring metrics evaluated against hundreds of hours of human performance, all of which are open-source and publicly available. We find that standard RL baselines make progress on most tasks but are still far from human performance, suggesting Avalon is challenging enough to advance the quest for generalizable RL.},

	abstract = {There has been significant progress in developing reinforcement learning (RL) training systems. Past works such as IMPALA, Apex, Seed RL, Sample Factory, and others, aim to improve the system’s overall throughput. In this paper, we aim to address a common bottleneck in the RL training system, i.e., parallel environment execution, which is often the slowest part of the whole system but receives little attention. With a curated design for paralleling RL environments, we have improved the RL environment simulation speed across different hardware setups, ranging from a laptop and a modest workstation, to a high-end machine such as NVIDIA DGX-A100. On a high-end machine, EnvPool achieves one million frames per second for the environment execution on Atari environments and three million frames per second on MuJoCo environments. When running EnvPool on a laptop, the speed is 2.8× that of the Python subprocess. Moreover, great compatibility with existing RL training libraries has been demonstrated in the open-sourced community, including CleanRL, rl\_games, DeepMind Acme, etc. Finally, EnvPool allows researchers to iterate their ideas at a much faster pace and has great potential to become the de facto RL environment execution engine. Example runs show that it only takes five minutes to train agents to play Atari Pong and MuJoCo Ant on a laptop. EnvPool is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/envpool.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing datasets pose a number of interesting challenges to machine learning researchers and practitioners, from domain shift (spatially, semantically and temporally) to highly imbalanced labels. In addition, the outputs of models trained on remote sensing datasets can contribute to positive societal impacts, for example in food security and climate change. However, there are many barriers that limit the accessibility of satellite data to the machine learning community, including a lack of large labeled datasets as well as an understanding of the range of satellite products available, how these products should be processed, and how to manage multi-dimensional geospatial data. To lower these barriers and facilitate the use of satellite datasets by the machine learning community, we present CropHarvest—a satellite dataset of more than 90,000 geographicallydiverse samples with agricultural class labels.

	abstract = {Many subﬁelds of machine learning share a common stumbling block: evaluation. Advances in machine learning often evaporate under closer scrutiny or turn out to be less widely applicable than originally hoped. We conduct a meta-review of 107 survey papers from computer vision, natural language processing, recommender systems, reinforcement learning, graph processing, metric learning, and more, organizing a wide range of surprisingly consistent critique into a concrete taxonomy of observed failure modes. Inspired by measurement and evaluation theory, we divide failure modes into two categories: internal and external validity. Internal validity pertains to evaluation on a learning problem in isolation, such as improper comparisons to baselines or overﬁtting from test set re-use. External validity relies on relationships between different learning problems, for instance, whether progress on a learning problem translates to progress on seemingly related tasks.},

	title = {B-{Pref}: {Benchmarking} {Preference}-{Based} {Reinforcement} {Learning}},
	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) requires access to a reward function that incentivizes the right behavior, but these are notoriously hard to specify for complex tasks. Preference-based RL provides an alternative: learning policies using a teacher’s preferences without pre-deﬁned rewards, thus overcoming concerns associated with reward engineering. However, it is difﬁcult to quantify the progress in preferencebased RL due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark. In this paper, we introduce B-Pref: a benchmark specially designed for preference-based RL. A key challenge with such a benchmark is providing the ability to evaluate candidate algorithms quickly, which makes relying on real human input for evaluation prohibitive. At the same time, simulating human input as giving perfect preferences for the ground truth reward function is unrealistic. B-Pref alleviates this by simulating teachers with a wide array of irrationalities, and proposes metrics not solely for performance but also for robustness to these potential irrationalities. We showcase the utility of B-Pref by using it to analyze algorithmic design choices, such as selecting informative queries, for state-of-the-art preferencebased RL algorithms. We hope that B-Pref can serve as a common starting point to study preference-based RL more systematically. Source code is available at https://github.com/rll-research/B-Pref.},

Importantly, the toolkit allows a firstof-its-kind comparison between state-of-the-art RL-based signal controllers while providing benchmarks for future comparisons. Consequently, we compare and report the relative performance of current RL algorithms. The experimental results suggest that previous algorithms are not robust to varying sensing assumptions and non-stylized intersection layouts. When more realistic signal layouts and advanced sensing capabilities are considered, a distributed deep Q-learning approach is shown to outperform previously reported state-of-the-art algorithms in many cases.},

Despite the focus on algorithms aimed at resolving visual generalization problems, we argue that the devil is in the existing benchmarks as they are restricted to isolated tasks and generalization categories, undermining a comprehensive evaluation of agents’ visual generalization capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce RL-ViGen: a novel Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Visual Generalization, which contains diverse tasks and a wide spectrum of generalization types, thereby facilitating the derivation of more reliable conclusions. Furthermore, RL-ViGen incorporates the latest generalization visual RL algorithms into a unified framework, under which the experiment results indicate that no single existing algorithm has prevailed universally across tasks. Our aspiration is that RL-ViGen will serve as a catalyst in this area, and lay a foundation for the future creation of universal visual generalization RL agents suitable for real-world scenarios.

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have recently found success in anomaly detection (AD) across various fields such as finance, medical services, and cloud computing. However, most of the current research tends to view deep AD algorithms as a whole, without dissecting the contributions of individual design choices like loss functions and network architectures. This view tends to diminish the value of preliminary steps like data preprocessing, as more attention is given to newly designed loss functions, network architectures, and learning paradigms. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by asking two key questions: (i) Which design choices in deep AD methods are crucial for detecting anomalies? (ii) How can we automatically select the optimal design choices for a given AD dataset, instead of relying on generic, preexisting solutions? To address these questions, we introduce ADGym, a platform specifically crafted for comprehensive evaluation and automatic selection of AD design elements in deep methods. Our extensive experiments reveal that relying solely on existing leading methods is not sufficient. In contrast, models developed using ADGym significantly surpass current state-of-the-art techniques.},

A consequence is inaccurate and imprecise predictions of critical processes such as storms. Hybrid methods that combine physics with machine learning (ML) have introduced a new generation of higher fidelity climate simulators that can sidestep Moore’s Law by outsourcing compute-hungry, short, high-resolution simulations to ML emulators. However, this hybrid ML-physics simulation approach requires domain-specific treatment and has been inaccessible to ML experts because of lack of training data and relevant, easy-to-use workflows. We present ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset designed for hybrid ML-physics research. It comprises multi-scale climate simulations, developed by a consortium of climate scientists and ML researchers. It consists of 5.7 billion pairs of multivariate input and output vectors that isolate the influence of locally-nested, high-resolution, high-fidelity physics on a host climate simulator’s macro-scale physical state. The dataset is global in coverage, spans multiple years at high sampling frequency, and is designed such that resulting emulators are compatible with downstream coupling into operational climate simulators. We implement a range of deterministic and stochastic regression baselines to highlight the ML challenges and their scoring. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEAP/ClimSim\_high-res2) and code (https://leap-stc.github.io/ClimSim) are released openly to support the development of hybrid ML-physics and high-fidelity climate simulations for the benefit of science and society.},

The machine learning (ML) community has taken an increased interest in supporting climate scientists’ efforts on various tasks such as climate model emulation, downscaling, and prediction tasks. Many of those tasks have been addressed on datasets created with single climate models. However, both the climate science and ML communities have suggested that to address those tasks at scale, we need large, consistent, and ML-ready climate model datasets. Here, we introduce ClimateSet, a dataset containing the inputs and outputs of 36 climate models from the Input4MIPs and CMIP6 archives. In addition, we provide a modular dataset pipeline for retrieving and preprocessing additional climate models and scenarios. We showcase the potential of our dataset by using it as a benchmark for ML-based climate model emulation. We gain new insights about the performance and generalization capabilities of the different ML models by analyzing their performance across different climate models. Furthermore, the dataset can be used to train an ML emulator on several climate models instead of just one. Such a “super-emulator” can quickly project new climate change scenarios, complementing existing scenarios already provided to policymakers. We believe ClimateSet will create the basis needed for the ML community to tackle climate-related tasks at scale.},

This study aimed to extend the WOFOST crop model with N limited production and use the model to explore options for sustainable N management for winter wheat production systems in the Netherlands. The extensions consisted of the simulation of N processes in the crop and in the soil, stress responses to N deficiencies, and the maximum gross CO2 assimilation rate being computed from the leaf N concentration. The model was calibrated and evaluated against field measurements and subsequently applied in a scenario analysis aiming to explore different pathways for sustainable N use for commercial wheat fields in the Netherlands. The scenarios included (1) closing efficiency yield gaps, (2) adjusting N input to the minimum level possible without incurring yield losses, and (3) achieving 90\% of the simulated water-limited yield. Scenarios 2 and 3 were devised to allow for soil N mining (2a and 3a) and to not allow for soil N mining (2b and 3b). The results show it is possible to reduce N surplus on average by 75\%, 54\%, and 49\% over a baseline of 41 kg N ha-1 for each pathway without soil mining (scenarios 1, 2b, 3b), respectively. These pathways allow average N input decreases of respectively nil, 22, and 3 kg N ha-1 compared to 213 kg N ha-1. However, the adjustment in N input for these pathways, and the resulting N surplus, varied strongly across fields, with various fields requiring greater N input than used by farmers. As soil N mining is not a large risk in the Netherlands, negative N surpluses may be accepted, allowing for average N input reductions of 84 kg N ha-1 (39\%; scenario 2a) or 54 kg N ha-1 (25\%; scenario 3a) while maintaining or even increasing yields.  We recommend further research to focus on 1) calibrating the model for simulating leaf N dynamics for other crops, 2) finding parameters to better link leaf N and net CO2 assimilation for C4 species, and 3) further test the use of soil map data to run WOFOST, and 4) evaluate WOFOST's capability to simulate N dynamics in crop rotations. This will allow to further evaluate sustainable N use in a cropping systems context and in the long-term.},
