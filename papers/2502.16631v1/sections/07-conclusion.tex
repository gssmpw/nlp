\section{Conclusion}
\sys is, to the best of our knowledge, the first mechanism offering unified and fully-transparent CPU-GPU snapshots. With \sys, we further build transparent GPU-accelerated container snapshots, allowing GPU-accelerated and containerized applications to easily benefit from checkpoint/restore. We benchmark our prototype implementation on a wide range of ML models and hardware configurations and show that it is capable of efficiently checkpointing and restoring CPU and GPU state even on large language models.
