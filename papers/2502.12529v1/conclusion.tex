\section{Conclusion and Open Problems}

In this work, following up on~\citet{cevher2024alternation} and addressing their main open question, we show that $\order(T^{1/3})$ alternating regret is possible for general Online Convex Optimization via simple algorithms.
The main open problem remains to be: what the minimax optimal alternating regret is for OLO/OCO?
This appears to be highly nontrivial even for very special cases --- for example, even for 1-dimensional OLO over $[-1,1]$ where $\order(\log T)$ alternating regret is achieved by~\citet{cevher2024alternation}, figuring out whether the optimal bound is $\Theta(\log T)$ or $\Theta(1)$ appears to require new techniques.
