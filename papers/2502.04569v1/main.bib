abstract = {Afferent information originating from mechanoreceptors located within perioral facial skin is considered to play an important role in the development and maintenance of fine motor skill associated with the production of speech. To date, little quantitative information is available on the frequency sensitivity of the face to controlled sinusoidal displacements, especially in areas of tissue that change shape during speech. The purpose was to determine the mechanical frequency detection thresholds of select skin sites in the face and hand using a psychophysical procedure. Mean frequency detection thresholds for all facial skin sites were significantly higher than thresholds for the forefinger. Further, pacinian-type frequency sensitivity, characteristic of the finger, was absent in the face. Finally, vibratory stimuli may be useful in the assessment of skin sense in patients with suspected involvement of the trigeminal system. A case study is presented to highlight the quantitative nature of this psychophysical procedure.}

Thirteen regions of the head and neck corresponding to major sensory innervation were examined bilaterally for static two-point discrimination with the Mackinnon-Dellon Disk-Criminator and for sensation of pressure with Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Perception of two-point discrimination improved from lateral and posterior areas (17 to 25 mm) to the midline toward the lips (3 to 7 mm). Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments proved inadequate in determining sensitivity to cutaneous pressure because of low thresholds in the face and neck. Static two-point discrimination is a reliably reproducible method for assessing sensation of the face and neck. (Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 93: 1141, 1994.)

abstract = {Does the perceived location of tactile stimuli presented on the torso depend on the orientation of our heads with respect to our bodies? An experiment is reported that was designed to assess whether the subjective perception of tactile stimuli on the torso changes as people turn their heads in different directions. Our participants used a scale presented on a computer monitor to indicate the perceived position of vibrotactile stimuli presented to one of eight different positions around the frontal side of their waist while they either looked straight ahead, turned their head to the left, or else turned their head to the right. The results showed that the perceived location of tactile stimuli was systematically influenced by head orientation. In particular, the perceived location of the tactile stimuli shifted away from their actual position in the direction opposite to the direction of the participant's head turn. Our results also revealed a systematic decline in the accuracy of tactile localization as a function of the physical distance of the tactile stimuli from the participant's navel. These results echo related findings in the auditory domain where it has been shown that changes in eye position affect auditory lateralization. Our results also have important implications for the design of tactile displays for presenting directional information in a variety of real-world applications.}

abstract = {Haptic interactions between human and machines are essential for information acquisition and object manipulation. In virtual reality (VR) system, the haptic sensing device can gather information to construct virtual elements, while the haptic feedback part can transfer feedbacks to human with virtual tactile sensation. Therefore, exploring high-performance haptic sensing and feedback interface imparts closed-loop haptic interaction to VR system. This review summarizes state-of-the-art VR-related haptic sensing and feedback techniques based on the hardware parts. For the haptic sensor, we focus on mechanism scope (piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, and triboelectric) and introduce force sensor, gesture translation, and touch identification in the functional view. In terms of the haptic feedbacks, methodologies including mechanical, electrical, and elastic actuators are surveyed. In addition, the interactive application of virtual control, immersive entertainment, and medical rehabilitation is also summarized. The challenges of virtual haptic interactions are given including the accuracy, durability, and technical conflicts of the sensing devices, bottlenecks of various feedbacks, as well as the closed-loop interaction system. Besides, the prospects are outlined in artificial intelligence of things, wise information technology of medicine, and multimedia VR areas.}

Facial haptic feedback may be a useful form of sensory substitution for manipulation in these settings because of the availability and sensitivity of skin of the face. However, existing devices for facial haptics are bulky and occluding, and designed to simulate sensations in virtual reality games rather than enable telepresence. We propose to apply a compact haptic device to the cheek and characterize its effectiveness for sensory substitution of force along a single axis, comparing force feedback, biofeedback, and no haptic feedback conditions in healthy participants.",
