abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are becoming increasingly widespread and exert a growing influence on society at large. The growing impact of these systems has also highlighted potential issues that may arise from their utilization, such as data privacy issues, resulting in calls for ethical AI systems. Yet, how to develop ethical AI systems remains an important question in the area. How should the principles and values be converted into requirements for these systems, and what should developers and the organizations developing these systems do? To further bridge this gap in the area, in this paper, we present a method for implementing AI ethics: ECCOLA. Following a cyclical action research approach, ECCOLA has been iteratively developed over the course of multiple years, in collaboration with both researchers and practitioners.}

abstract = {HCI and design studies have increasingly identified challenges for gig workers and advocated for designs centered around worker justice. However, there’s an existing research gap in understanding how platform designers approach gig worker issues in their practice. Our study engaged ten platform designers from food delivery and ride-hailing platforms to investigate this gap. Through semi-structured interviews, we uncovered their strategies, the extent of authority and responsibilities, and the range of obstacles they encounter in influencing decision-making that could affect gig workers’ experiences with the platforms. While platform designers were aware of gig worker issues, they confronted challenges from business goals, decision-making power, policies, and job security in promoting worker well-being. We discuss the jurisdiction of platform designers and propose that HCI research should further support them, who are deeply engaged in the gig economy and have the potential to participate in addressing social justice issues.},
