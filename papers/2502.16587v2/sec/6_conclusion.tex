\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a data collection pipeline for perfectly paired human-robot data and used it to create the H\&R dataset. Then we presented \system, a novel end-to-end diffusion framework that simultaneously predicted robot video and actions given a hand video. Next, we leveraged a KNN method to perform tasks without explicitly requiring human hand videos as input. \system not only achieved outstanding performance on four carefully selected tasks but also demonstrated its capabilities in five generalization ability tests.
