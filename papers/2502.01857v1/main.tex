Human-robot cooperative navigation is challenging in environments with incomplete information. We introduce \textit{CoNav-Maze}, a simulated robotics environment where a robot navigates using local perception while a human operator provides guidance based on an inaccurate map. The robot can share its camera views to improve the operator's understanding of the environment.
% We study this problem, referred to as CoNav-Maze, using an adapted maze simulator.
% We observe that a spectrum of existing human-in-the-loop approaches, from visual teleoperation to fully autonomous navigation, underperform in this task due to insufficient knowledge exchange.
To enable efficient human-robot cooperation, we propose \textit{Information Gain Monte Carlo Tree Search} (IG-MCTS), an online planning algorithm that balances autonomous movement and informative communication. Central to IG-MCTS is a neural human perception dynamics model that estimates how humans distill information from robot communications. 
% The model's fully convolutional architecture, combined with data augmentation leveraging maze symmetry properties, facilitates robust feature learning and generalization to unseen mazes.
We collect a dataset through a crowdsourced mapping task in CoNav-Maze and train this model using a fully convolutional architecture with data augmentation.
User studies show that IG-MCTS outperforms teleoperation and instruction-following baselines, achieving comparable task performance with significantly less communication and lower human cognitive load, as evidenced by eye-tracking metrics.
% Effective human-robot coordination is essential for achieving shared goals in environments under incomplete information. This paper tackles a cooperative navigation task in which a robot must reach a goal in a novel maze while integrating the guidance of a human operator with access to an initially inaccurate global map. The human and robot communication is multimodal: the robot can share ego-view snapshots and text to inform the human about the surrounding environment, whereas the human can send waypoints. We introduce a novel approach for the robot to optimize its camera angles to maximize the human’s information gain. By modeling the human operator’s evolving perception through learned belief dynamics and utilizing a Monte Carlo tree search-based planning algorithm, the robot strategically decides between autonomous movement and informative communication.
