We conducted a comprehensive analysis of GPU usage on Perlmutter. We
highlighted common patterns such as varying utilization, significant
spatial and temporal imbalances for some jobs, and differences in GPU
usage across job types and GPU cores. In the future, we plan to incorporate
the derived metrics introduced in this study into ML-based application
fingerprinting and anomaly detection. Additionally, we aim to
expand our analysis by evaluating other counters,
such as power consumption and energy usage.
