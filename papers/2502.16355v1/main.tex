\begin{abstract}
\ignore{Distribution testing has led to a plethora of results, but for most interesting properties, the query\xnote{Should this be sample complexity?} complexity
is polynomial in the domain size. For high-dimensional domains, such complexities are infeasible.
The subcube conditional model (Canonne-Ron-Servedio, SICOMP 2015 and Bhattacharyya-Chakraborty, TOCT 2018)
allows for sampling subcubes of the domain, often leading to queries polynomial in the \emph{dimension}.

We study the classic property of monotonicity of distributions over $\{0,1\}^n$, under the subcube conditional model.
Consider an unknown input distribution $p$ over $\{0,1\}^n$. A distribution is monotone if 
$p(x) \leq p(y)$ for any $x \preceq y$, where $\preceq$ denotes the standard coordinate-wise partial order over $\{0,1\}^n$.
The aim is to distinguish monotone $p$ from $p$ being $\eps$-far (in TV distance) from monotone.
Up to logarithmic factors, we resolve the query complexity to be $\Theta(n/\eps^2)$.

For the upper bound, we take inspiration from the literature of monotonicity testing of Boolean functions.
We run an ``edge tester" for testing distribution monotonicity. To bound the query complexity, we
rely on directed isoperimetric theorems that relate the "directed boundary" of functions
to their distance to monotonicity. We prove a real-valued analogue of the directed Talagrand theorem (Khot-Minzer-Safra, SICOMP 2018),
which is a key tool in our proof.
For the lower bound, we reduce to dealing with product distributions under the standard sampling model. 
We develop lower bounds for determining the bias of coordinates, which are then applied to distributional monotonicity testing.

Applying our methods, we also prove an $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n}/\eps^2)$ lower bound for uniformity testing
with subcube conditional queries, under the promise that the distribution is monotone. This matches the 
upper bound up to logarithmic factors, which holds for arbitrary distributions. Thus, it proves that monotonicity
does not help for uniformity testing with subcube conditional queries. }

We study monotonicity testing of high-dimensional distributions on $\{-1,1\}^n$ in the model of subcube conditioning, suggested and studied by Canonne, Ron, and Servedio~\cite{CRS15} and Bhattacharyya and Chakraborty~\cite{BC18}. Previous work shows that the \emph{sample complexity} 
of monotonicity testing must be exponential in $n$ %is at most $2^{n - \Omega_{\eps}(n^{1/5})}$ 
(Rubinfeld, Vasilian~\cite{RV20}, and %at least $2^{n(1 - O(\sqrt{\eps}-o(1))}$ (
Aliakbarpour, Gouleakis, Peebles, Rubinfeld, Yodpinyanee~\cite{AGPRY19}). We show that the subcube \emph{query complexity} is $\tilde{\Theta}(n/\eps^2)$,
by proving nearly matching upper and lower bounds. Our work is the first to use directed isoperimetric inequalities (developed for function monotonicity testing) for analyzing a distribution testing algorithm. Along the way, we generalize an inequality of Khot, Minzer, and Safra~\cite{KMS18} to real-valued functions on $\{-1,1\}^n$.

We also study uniformity testing of distributions that are promised to be monotone, a problem introduced by Rubinfeld, Servedio~\cite{RS09}%(Rubinfeld and Servedio, Rand. Struc. and Alg. 2009)
, using subcube conditioning. We show that the query complexity is $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{n}/\eps^2)$. Our work proves the lower bound, which matches (up to poly-logarithmic factors) the uniformity testing upper bound for general distributions (Canonne, Chen, Kamath, Levi, Waingarten~\cite{CCKLW21}).
Hence, we show that monotonicity does not help, beyond logarithmic factors, in testing uniformity of distributions with subcube conditional queries.
