This study, ethically approved by the European Union (funder), deliberately used automated bots to avoid personal data use. The main risk — supporting malicious websites through page views and ad revenue during bot training — was deemed minimal because the bots mainly visited general and news sites, and the scale of our visits was very small compared to the sites' total traffic. The scientific and social benefits of this research outweigh these concerns.


%This work deliberately used automated bots to avoid requesting personal data from the public. The study is part of a project that underwent ethical review and was approved. One general risk of this activity is the potential negative impact of visiting malicious web pages, and thus giving them page views and ad revenue, when training the bots to mimic a browsing history. We feel this risk is negligible compared to the scientific and social benefits of the work, given the small number of visits, and consequent monetization, compared to the overall traffic these sites get. Moreover, the sites visited in these audits were either general or news websites, not specifically non-credible ones.
