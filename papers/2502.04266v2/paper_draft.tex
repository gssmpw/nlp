\begin{abstract}

Search engines, often viewed as reliable gateways to information, tailor search results using customization algorithms based on user preferences, location, and more. While this can be useful for routine queries, it raises concerns when the topics are sensitive or contentious, possibly limiting exposure to diverse viewpoints and increasing polarization.

To examine the extent of this tailoring, we focused on the Israel-Palestine conflict and developed a privacy-protecting tool to audit the behavior of three search engines: DuckDuckGo, Google and Yahoo. Our study focused on two main questions: (1) How do search results for the same query about the conflict vary among different users? and (2) Are these results influenced by the user's location and browsing history?

Our findings revealed significant customization based on location and browsing preferences, unlike previous studies that found only mild personalization for general topics. Moreover, queries related to the conflict were more customized than unrelated queries, and the results were not neutral concerning the conflict's portrayal.

%Search engines have become integral tools in our daily lives, often recognized as reliable gateways to obtain the “truth”. However, it is well established that these algorithms apply personalization techniques to prioritize search results based on user preferences, location, and more. This tailored experience, whether useful in routine tasks, raises strong concerns regarding exposure to different viewpoints, particularly around contentious issues.

%Taking the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict as a case - study, we built a privacy protecting search-engine audit tool to address search engine levels of personalization.
%, for the first time for such a popular, sensitive and timely subject. Specifically, as the world sought answers using such algorithms, 
%Specifically, we questioned: (1) how do search engine results vary among users seeking identical information about the conflict? and (2) are these results personalized to the user's location and past browsing history?. 
%personalization levels different for broader/non-specific topics? 
%We found significant levels of customization due to location and browsing settings, contrasting with previous research that suggested milder customization for more general topics. Additionally, our results show generally stronger levels of customization for queries related with the conflict than non-related queries and these results were not neutral in terms of conflict leaning.
%This comprehensive analysis, coupled with the contemporaneous nature of the topic, is key to understand the scope and potential implications of search engine personalization.

\subsection{Data Description}
In the deployment of each bot's type the first page of results was collected for each combination of search engine, bot, and query. However, not every audit (i.e., the collection of results for a query) was successful. Failures were often due to IP issues or problems with the xpaths of certain search engine results. In the analysis, only successful audits were considered. A successful audit was defined as the collection of at least four URLs from at least three different IPs within the same location for the same search engine and query. Since the failure of some audits introduced imbalances in the search engine results database, we ensured that each analysis used the same number of specific and general queries per search engine, as well as the same number of ports per location.  

Table \ref{tab:number_queries_successful}  presents the number of successful queries in each category for every search engine and location pair considered in the analysis. It is important to note that while the number of successful queries per search engine may vary for the same experimental step, we ensured that the number of specific and general queries was consistent within each search engine analysis.

\begin{table}[hb]
    \centering
    \caption{Number of successful queries within each query category per search engine.}
    \label{tab:number_queries_successful}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2.5cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{} & \textbf{Search Engine} & \textbf{Number Queries}\\
    \hline
    \multirow{4}{*}{Type 1} & DuckDuckGo & 26 \\
    \cline{2-3}
    {} & Google & 27 \\
    \cline{2-3}
    {} & Yahoo & 27 \\

    {} & Yahoo & 10 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure \ref{number_successful_ports} shows the number of successful IPs for each location and search engine. 10 ports of Type 1 and Type 2 were deployed initially. However, of Type 3, only 8 different IPs were used per location. Of these 8 IPs, 3 were associated with visits to news articles about the studied conflict (labeled as "C" in Figure \ref{number_successful_ports}, Type 3), 3 had a profile of regular news browsing history (labeled as "G"), and 2 were stateless bots ("S").

Table \ref{tab:number_results} contains a small description of the total number of URLs collected in each step of the experiment. 

\newpage
Some results were present to all bots Types. In the Venn diagram of Figure \ref{venn_unique_urls} we show the intersection of raw URLs across the types of bots.  In the Veen diagram of Figure \ref{venn_unique_domains} the intersection of websites domains across bot types.

The gray bars represent the number of IPs successful in performing general queries, while the colored bars indicate those successful in specific queries.

\subsection{Additional metrics of results differences}

The $D = 1 - RBO$ measurement used in the paper calculates a value between $[0, 1]$ according to the similarity of two lists and the rank at which two elements of the list match. To complement this metric we also calculated: (1) the average number of URLs that were not present in both lists of results of the two bots being compared (top row in Figures \ref{fig:other_metrics_step_1},\ref{fig:other_metrics_step_2}, \ref{fig:other_metrics_step_3}); (2) average number of URLs that were present at both top 3 results for both lists of results being compared (middle row in Figures \ref{fig:other_metrics_step_1},\ref{fig:other_metrics_step_2}, \ref{fig:other_metrics_step_3}) and (3) the average edit distance (bottom row in Figures \ref{fig:other_metrics_step_1},\ref{fig:other_metrics_step_2}, \ref{fig:other_metrics_step_3}).

\subsection{Controlling for query size}

As shown in Table \ref{tab:queries_long_table} the  categories of queries have very different sizes. Therefore, we tested whether the higher values of $D = 1 - RBO$ for queries of the specific group was a consequence of a higher number of words (bigger dimension). Figure \ref{results_by_query_size} shows the value of $D = 1 - RBO$ as function of the number of words in the query for both queries of the general category (black circle) and specific category (gray triangle) across search engines. As the plot shows there is a tendency for the value of $D = 1 - RBO$ to be higher for specific queries than general ones even when comparing queries of the exact same size from both categories. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{Figures/plot_rbo_by_n_words_search_engine_step_1.png}
    \caption{Average value of $D = 1 - RBO$ (Type 1 bots) by query size in terms of number of words. In black plotted with circles we have the results for queries of the general category and in grey plotted with triangles the results of queries in the specific category.}
    \Description{}
    \label{results_by_query_size}
\end{figure}

Additionally, when we compare the value of $D = 1- RBO$ per location (different and same location) for an equal number of queries of both categories with comparable sizes (within 3 and 9 words) we observe (Figure \ref{rbo_queries_same_size} that the results continue to present the same pattern as in Figure \ref{fig:main_plot}. That is, higher values of $D = 1- RBO$ for specific queries than general queries and also higher values when comparing results of bots from different locations than the same location.

\subsection{Differences across categories of websites}

To control for the possibility that bots were retrieving the same content but in localized versions, leading to differences in URLs, we used ChatGPT-4o to classify the websites by category and type. The prompt was the one depicted in Figure \ref{prompt_domain_cat}.

All categories per query type are in Table \ref{tab:categories_category}. Figure \ref{categories_websites_general}, shows the most common categories across search engines and location, for different Type of bots for general queries.

After classifying all domains present in all experimental steps (Table \ref{tab:categories_category}) we studied how the results varied as function of the location and query type for all bots types. Additionally to the metric $D = 1 - RBO$ we also calculated (1) the average number of categories that were not present in both lists of results of the two bots being compared (top row in Figures \ref{fig:other_categories_step_1},\ref{fig:other_categories_step_2}, \ref{fig:other_categories_step_3}); (2) average number of URLs that were present at both top 3 results for both lists of results being compared (middle row in Figures \ref{fig:other_categories_step_1},\ref{fig:other_categories_step_2}, \ref{fig:other_categories_step_3})) and (3) the average edit distance (bottom row in Figures \ref{fig:other_categories_step_1},\ref{fig:other_categories_step_2}, \ref{fig:other_categories_step_3})). 

Additionally, we show in \ref{tab:p_values_adjusted_categories_step_1}, \ref{tab:p_values_adjusted_categories_step_2} and \ref{tab:p_values_adjusted_categories_step_3} more information about the statistical values plotted in \ref{fig:rbo_per_category_website}.

\subsection{Time control}

To measure the average variation of search engines results over time, we performed a control by deploying Type 2 webcrawlers in different moments in time (April, May and October). The goal was to understand the overtime variation of the page contents and consequent differences in results. Even if we observe some variation due to the small number of ports per location, smaller number of locations (US and SA) and smaller number of queries being compared (8 per category), we observe no specific trend, except for Yahoo where our differences were never really significant.
