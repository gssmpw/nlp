In this paper we introduce HS-DTE, a novel way of constructively embedding trees in hyperbolic space, which uses an optimization approach to effectively separate points on a hypersphere. Empirically, we show that HS-DTE outperforms existing methods, while maintaining the computational efficiency of the combinatorial approaches. We also introduce HypFPE, a framework for floating point expansion arithmetic on tensors, which is adapted to extend the effective radius of the Poincar√© ball. This framework can be used to increase the precision of computations, while benefiting from hardware acceleration, paving the way for highly accurate hyperbolic neural networks. It can be added on top of any of the combinatorial methods, leading to low-distortion \emph{and} GPU-compatible hyperbolic tree embeddings.
