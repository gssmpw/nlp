While often a coarse $\Omega$ %(\ie, a relatively-low $d$) 
suffices,
the expressiveness of $\Tcal$ can be increased
using a finer $\Omega$ at the cost of 
computation speed and a higher $d$~\cite{Freifeld:ICCV:2015:CPAB,Freifeld:PAMI:2017:CPAB}. In fact, 
at the limit of
an infinitely-fine $\Omega$, 
any diffeomorphism that is representable by integrating a Lipshitz-continuous stationary velocity field can be approximated by a CPAB diffeomorphism~\cite{Freifeld:ICCV:2015:CPAB,Freifeld:PAMI:2017:CPAB}.
Moreover, CPAB warps do not form a group under the composition operation~\cite{Freifeld:PAMI:2017:CPAB}
(even though they contain the identity warp and are closed under inversion); \ie,
the composition of CPAB warps is a diffeomorphism but usually not CPAB itself.
Thus, a way to increase expressiveness without refining $\Omega$ is by composing  CPAB warps~\cite{Freifeld:PAMI:2017:CPAB}.
Concatenating CPAB warps increases expressiveness beyond $\Tcal$ as it implies a non-stationary velocity field
which is CPA \wrt $\Omega$ and piecewise constant \wrt time.
Compositions increase dimensionality, but the overall cost of evaluating the composed warp scales better (in comparison with refinement of $\Omega$), and it is also easier to infer the $\btheta$'s. 
While this fact was not exploited in~\cite{Skafte:CVPR:2018:DDTN}, we leverage it here as follows.
We propose the Recurrent-DTAN (RDTAN), a net that recurrently applies nonlinear time warps, via diffeomorphic TT layers, to the input signal (\autoref{fig:fig_recurrent}). By sharing the learned parameters by all the TT layers, an RDTAN increases expressiveness without increasing the number of parameters. 
While this is similar to, and inspired by, how Lin \etal~\cite{Lin:CPVR:2017:inverse}
use a recurrent net with affine 2D warps, there is a key difference:
since in the affine case zero-boundary conditions imply degeneracies, they explained they had to propagate warp parameters instead of the warped image as they would have liked. In contrast, as CPAB warps support optional zero-boundary conditions, propagating a warped signal through an RDTAN is a non-issue.
