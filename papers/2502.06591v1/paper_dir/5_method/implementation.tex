We adapted, to the 1D case, the implementation from \texttt{libcpab}~\cite{Detlefsen:2018:libcpab}
of the CPAB transformer layer, CPAB gradient, and the PyTorch C++ API. The close-formed gradient proposed in~\cite{Martinez:ICML:2022:closed} is given by the \texttt{DIFW} package.
We have implemented the CPAB regularization term, objective functions, and DTAN variants in PyTorch.
