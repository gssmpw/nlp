To meet our goal, \ie, solving the JA problem while being able to generalize its solution to the alignment of new data, we propose a DL-based method that includes a TTN with diffeomorphic TT layers. Particularly, here we choose $\Tcal$ to be a family of 1D CPAB warps~\cite{Freifeld:ICCV:2015:CPAB,Freifeld:PAMI:2017:CPAB} and incorporate the latter within TT layers. 
Altogether, this lets us propose the first \emph{Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN)} for time-series joint alignment.
