\caption{Time-series averaging methods comparison on the ECG200 dataset (each row depicts a different class).
The Euclidean mean serves as baseline, showing how nonlinear misalignment of the data confounds its averaging.
Comparing with DTW-based methods, DTAN outperforms DBA on both train/test data. While the barycenter obtained by SoftDTW ($\gamma=1$) is comparable
to the one obtained by DTAN, it is (1) inapplicable to new signals; (2) computed on each class individually.
DTAN, however, was trained on both classes together and generalized to test data (rightmost panels).}
