ABSTRACT = {The evaluation of kidney biopsies performed by expert pathologists is a crucial process for assessing if a kidney is eligible for transplantation. In this evaluation process, an important step consists of the quantification of global glomerulosclerosis, which is the ratio between sclerotic glomeruli and the overall number of glomeruli. Since there is a shortage of organs available for transplantation, a quick and accurate assessment of global glomerulosclerosis is essential for retaining the largest number of eligible kidneys. In the present paper, the authors introduce a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to assess global glomerulosclerosis. The proposed tool is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In particular, the authors considered approaches based on Semantic Segmentation networks, such as SegNet and DeepLab v3+. The dataset has been provided by the Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantations (DETO) of Bari University Hospital, and it is composed of 26 kidney biopsies coming from 19 donors. The dataset contains 2344 non-sclerotic glomeruli and 428 sclerotic glomeruli. The proposed model consents to achieve promising results in the task of automatically detecting and classifying glomeruli, thus easing the burden of pathologists. We get high performance both at pixel-level, achieving mean F-score higher than 0.81, and Weighted Intersection over Union (IoU) higher than 0.97 for both SegNet and Deeplab v3+ approaches, and at object detection level, achieving 0.924 as best F-score for non-sclerotic glomeruli and 0.730 as best F-score for sclerotic glomeruli.},

abstract = {Reliable counting of glomeruli and evaluation of glomerulosclerosis in renal specimens are essential steps to assess morphological changes in kidney and identify individuals requiring treatment. Because microscopic identification of sclerosed glomeruli performed under the microscope is labor intensive, we developed a deep learning (DL) approach to identify and classify glomeruli as normal or sclerosed in digital whole slide images (WSIs). The segmentation and classification of glomeruli was performed by the U-Net model. Subsequently, glomerular classifications were refined based on glomerular histomorphometry. The U-Net model was trained using patches from Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stained WSIs (n=31) from the AIDPATH - a multi-center dataset, and then tested on an independent set of WSIs (n=20) including PAS (n=6), and hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained WSIs (n=14) from four other institutions. The training and test WSIs were obtained from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded blocks with of human kidney specimens each presenting various proportions of normal and sclerosed glomeruli. In the PAS stained WSIs, normal and sclerosed glomeruli were respectively classified with the F1-score of 97.5% and 68.8%. In the H\&E stained WSIs, the F1-scores of 90.8% and 78.1% were achieved. Regardless the tissue staining, the glomeruli in the test WSIs were classified with the F1-score of 94.5% (n=923, normal) and 76.8% for (n=261, sclerosed). These results demonstrate for the first time that a framework based on the U-Net model trained with glomerular patches from PAS stained WSIs can reliably segment and classify normal and sclerosed glomeruli in PAS and also H\&E stained WSIs. Our approach yielded higher accuracy of glomerular classifications than some of the recently published methods. Additionally, our test set of images with ground truth is publicly available.}

The availability of WSI in the recent years allowed the rapid development of various AI technologies to blossom. WSI-based digital pathology combined with neural networks can automate arduous and time-consuming tasks of slide evaluation. Machine Learning (ML)-based AI has been demonstrated to outperform pathologists by eliminating inter- and intra-observer subjectivity, obtaining quantitative data from slide images, and extracting hidden image patterns that are relevant to disease subtype and progression. In this review, we outline the functionality of different AI technologies such as neural networks and deep learning and discover how aspects of different diseases make them benefit from the implementation of AI. AI has proven to be valuable in many different organs, with this review focusing on the liver, kidney, and lungs. We also discuss how AI and image analysis not only can grade diseases objectively but also discover aspects of diseases that have prognostic value. In the end, we review the current status of the integration of AI in pathology and share our vision on the future of digital pathology.}

  abstract  = {In the specialized field of renal histology, precise segmentation of glomeruli in microscopic images is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and pathological analysis. Facing the challenge of discerning complex visual features, such as shape, texture, and size within these images, we introduce a novel segmentation model that innovatively combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the advanced TransXNet block, specifically tailored for glomerular segmentation. This innovative model is designed to capture the intricate details and broader contextual features within the images, ensuring a comprehensive and precise segmentation process. The model's architecture unfolds in two primary phases: the down-sampling phase, which utilizes CNNs structures within the TransXNet block for meticulous extraction of detailed features, and the up-sampling phase, which employs CNNs deconvolution techniques to restore spatial resolution and enhance macroscopic feature representation. A critical innovation in our model is the implementation of residual connections between these two phases, which facilitate the seamless integration of features and minimize loss of precision during image reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in our model’s performance compared to existing medical image segmentation methods. We report enhancements in mean Pixel Accuracy (mPA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), with increases of approximately 3–5% and 3–8%, respectively. Additionally, the segmented outputs exhibit higher subjective visual quality with fewer noise artifacts. These findings suggest that our model offers promising applications in the segmentation of medical microscopic images, marking a significant contribution to the domain.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Glomeruli identification, i.e., detection and characterization, is a key procedure in many nephropathology studies. In this paper, semantic segmentation based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed to detect glomeruli using Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) follows by a classification CNN to divide the glomeruli into normal and sclerosed. Methods: Comparison between U-Net and SegNet CNNs is performed for pixel-level segmentation considering both a two and three class problem, that is, a) non-glomerular and glomerular structures and b) non-glomerular normal glomerular and sclerotic structures. The two class semantic segmentation result is then used for a CNN classification where glomerular regions are divided into normal and global sclerosed glomeruli. Results: These methods were tested on a dataset composed of 47 WSIs belonging to human kidney sections stained with Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS). The best approach was the SegNet for two class segmentation follows by a fine-tuned AlexNet network to characterize the glomeruli. 98.16% of accuracy was obtained with this process of consecutive CNNs (SegNet-AlexNet) for segmentation and classification. Conclusion: The results obtained demonstrate that the sequential CNN segmentation-classification strategy achieves higher accuracy reducing misclassified cases and therefore being the methodology proposed for glomerulosclerosis detection.}

abstract = {Glomeruli instance segmentation from pathologic images is a fundamental step in the automatic analysis of renal biopsies. Glomerular histologic manifestations vary widely among diseases and cases, and several special staining methods are necessary for pathologic diagnosis. A robust model is needed to segment and classify glomeruli with different staining methods and apply in cases with various glomerular pathologic changes. Herein, pathologic images from renal biopsy slides stained with three basic special staining methods were used to build the data sets. The snapshot group included 1970 glomeruli from 516 patients, and the whole-slide image group included 8665 glomeruli from 148 patients. Cascade Mask region-based convolutional neural net architecture was trained to detect, classify, and segment glomeruli into three categories: i) GN, structural normal; ii) global sclerosis; and iii) glomerular with other lesions. In the snapshot group, total glomeruli, GN, global sclerosis, and glomerular with other lesions achieved an F1 score of 0.914, 0.896, 0.681, and 0.756, respectively, which were comparable with those in the whole-slide image group (0.940, 0.839, 0.806, and 0.753, respectively). Among the three categories, GN achieved the best instance segmentation effect in both groups, as determined by average precision, average recall, F1 score, and Mask mean Intersection over Union. The present model segments and classifies multistained glomeruli with efficiency and robustness. It can be applied as the first step for more detailed glomerular histologic analysis.}

Although AI can be used to analyze a wide variety of biopsy-related data, this review focuses on whole slide images traditionally used in nephropathology. AI applications in nephropathology have recently become available through several advancing technologies, including (i) widespread introduction of glass slide scanners, (ii) data servers in pathology departments worldwide, and (iii) through greatly improved computer hardware to enable AI training. In this review, we explain how AI can enhance the reproducibility of nephropathology results for certain parameters in the context of precision medicine using advanced architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, that are currently the state of the art in machine learning software for this task. Because AI applications in nephropathology are still in their infancy, we show the power and potential of AI applications mostly in the example of oncopathology. Moreover, we discuss the technological obstacles as well as the current stakeholder and regulatory concerns about developing AI applications in nephropathology from the perspective of nephropathologists and the wider nephrology community. We expect the gradual introduction of these technologies into routine diagnostics and research for selective tasks, suggesting that this technology will enhance the performance of nephropathologists rather than making them redundant.}
