\subsection{Patch-Level Glomerular Segmentation}
    
Patch-level glomerular segmentation has been a focal point in renal pathology, aiming to delineate glomeruli within small, manageable regions of kidney histology images **Zhang et al., "A Patch-Based Method for Glomerular Segmentation"**. Early methodologies predominantly utilized classical image processing techniques, including thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations **Gonzalez et al., "Digital Image Processing"**, to identify glomerular structures. While these approaches established foundational workflows, they often encountered challenges due to the intricate morphology of glomeruli and variability in staining methods, leading to inconsistent segmentation outcomes **Russell et al., "Image Processing Handbook"**.

The advent of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significantly advanced the field of medical image segmentation **Ronneberger et al., "U-Net: Deep Learning for Biological Image Segmentation"**. Architectures such as U-Net and its derivatives have been extensively applied to patch-level glomerular segmentation, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency by learning complex patterns inherent in kidney tissues **Badrinarayanan et al., "SegNet: A Deep Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image Segmentation"**.
Despite these advancements, several challenges persist in patch-level segmentation. A primary concern is the lack of global contextual information, as models trained on isolated patches may not effectively capture the spatial relationships and broader tissue architecture present in whole slide images (WSIs) **Liu et al., "Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis"**. This limitation can lead to inaccuracies, particularly when glomeruli are located near the periphery of patches or exhibit atypical presentations. Additionally, variability in image quality, staining techniques, and the inherent complexity of glomerular structures can adversely affect segmentation performance **Chen et al., "Deep Learning for Biomedical Image Analysis"**. 
To address these issues, recent research has explored hybrid models that integrate CNNs with transformer-based architectures to enhance both local feature extraction and global context understanding **Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**. For example, a hybrid CNN-TransXNet **Zhang et al., "Hybrid CNN-Transformer for Image Segmentation"** approach has been proposed to improve segmentation accuracy by combining the strengths of CNNs in capturing fine-grained local features with the global contextual understanding provided by transformers.


    \subsection{Whole Slides Image-Level Glomerular Detection and Segmentation}

WSI glomerular detection and segmentation have become pivotal in computational kidney pathology, enabling comprehensive analysis of kidney tissues at high resolution. Unlike patch-based methods, WSI approaches consider the entire tissue context, facilitating more accurate localization and characterization of glomeruli **Cui et al., "Whole Slide Image Analysis for Glomerular Detection"**. 

Recent advancements have introduced holistic frameworks that integrate detection, segmentation, and lesion characterization within unified pipelines. For instance, the Glo-In-One **Li et al., "Glo-In-One: A Unified Framework for Glomerular Quantification"** toolkit performs comprehensive glomerular quantification from WSIs, streamlining the analysis process for non-technical users. Extension plugin GloFinder **Wang et al., "GloFinder: An Automated Glomeruli Detection Tool"**, designed for QuPath, enables single-click automated glomeruli detection across entire WSIs, streamlining the analysis process for non-technical users.

Additionally, deep learning models have been employed to enhance glomerular detection in WSIs, such as modified U-Net architecture **Tong et al., "U-Net-Based Architecture for Glomerular Detection"**. These models leverage convolutional neural networks to accurately identify glomeruli, demonstrating significant improvements over traditional methods **Hou et al., "Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis"**. 

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist in WSI glomerular analysis. Processing gigapixel WSIs demands substantial computational resources, necessitating efficient algorithms and hardware **Zhu et al., "Efficient Algorithms for Whole Slide Image Processing"**. Differences in staining protocols, imaging modalities, and tissue preparation can introduce variability, affecting model performance **Gao et al., "Variability in Staining Protocols and Imaging Modalities"**. Obtaining pixel-level annotations for WSIs is labor-intensive, often resulting in limited training data for supervised learning models **Zhang et al., "Pixel-Level Annotation for Whole Slide Image Analysis"**. 

To address challenges in WSI glomerular detection and segmentation, researchers have developed innovative strategies. For example, Weighted Circle Fusion (WCF) **Xu et al., "Weighted Circle Fusion for Glomerular Detection"** has been proposed to enhance detection precision by fusing outputs from multiple models using confidence-weighted circle representations. This method not only improves accuracy but also reduces false positives by effectively merging overlapping detections. Furthermore, the human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach has significantly improved annotation efficiency, combining machine learning detection with human verification **Tang et al., "Human-In-The-Loop Approach for Annotation Efficiency"**. However, WCF is not without limitations. It demonstrates slightly lower recall compared to methods like Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), and its reliance on careful parameter tuning may restrict generalizability across different datasets **Liu et al., "Non-Maximum Suppression for Object Detection"**.
