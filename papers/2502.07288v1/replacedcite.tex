Patch-level glomerular segmentation has been a focal point in renal pathology, aiming to delineate glomeruli within small, manageable regions of kidney histology images ____. Early methodologies predominantly utilized classical image processing techniques, including thresholding, edge detection, and morphological operations ____, to identify glomerular structures. While these approaches established foundational workflows, they often encountered challenges due to the intricate morphology of glomeruli and variability in staining methods, leading to inconsistent segmentation outcomes ____.

The advent of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has significantly advanced the field of medical image segmentation ____. Architectures such as U-Net and its derivatives have been extensively applied to patch-level glomerular segmentation, demonstrating enhanced accuracy and efficiency by learning complex patterns inherent in kidney tissues ____.
Despite these advancements, several challenges persist in patch-level segmentation. A primary concern is the lack of global contextual information, as models trained on isolated patches may not effectively capture the spatial relationships and broader tissue architecture present in whole slide images (WSIs) ____. This limitation can lead to inaccuracies, particularly when glomeruli are located near the periphery of patches or exhibit atypical presentations. Additionally, variability in image quality, staining techniques, and the inherent complexity of glomerular structures can adversely affect segmentation performance ____. 
To address these issues, recent research has explored hybrid models that integrate CNNs with transformer-based architectures to enhance both local feature extraction and global context understanding ____. For example, a hybrid CNN-TransXNet ____ approach has been proposed to improve segmentation accuracy by combining the strengths of CNNs in capturing fine-grained local features with the global contextual understanding provided by transformers.
