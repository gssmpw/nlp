\section{Problem Definition}

In this section, we introduce the problem formulation of named entity recognition from long texts.

\begin{problem}
\textbf{Named Entity Recognition from Long Texts (Long NER).}
Given a long input text, 
the goal is to extract different types of named entities or entity blocks
that mark their start and end positions in the text.
\textnormal{Note that the input length can exceed $1{\small ,}000$ tokens and the entity length can exceed $100$ tokens in our problem.}
\end{problem}

Taking scholar profiling~\cite{schiaffino2009intelligent,gu2018profiling} as an example, ``birth place'' is a kind of entity,
while ``work experience'' often appears as an entity block
that involves multiple segments.
