\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper highlights the pressing need for advanced watermarking techniques to protect Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in the context of image generation. We present \tool{}, a novel approach that randomizes the watermark embedding process, ensuring that generated images maintain visual quality and insert stealthy watermarks. By addressing the vulnerabilities in current watermarking methods, our work contributes to safeguarding intellectual property and preventing unauthorized use of LDM-generated content. 
The proposed \tool offers a practical, plug-and-play approach for embedding stealthy watermarks into images without incurring additional management overhead. Our approach can be adopted by platforms such as \cite{tensorart,civitai} to protect the copyrights of model creators and encourage a more secure and collaborative AI art community. Beyond copyright protection, the method provides a means to track misuse and authenticate images, further promoting the integrity of digital content in an era where the authenticity of AI-generated images is increasingly critical.

% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
