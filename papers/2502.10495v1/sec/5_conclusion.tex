\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we address critical vulnerabilities in latent-based watermarking methods for Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) by exposing their susceptibility to detection through constant watermarks. We introduce a novel watermark presence attack that operates solely on generated images, setting a new standard in the field and highlighting the urgent need for enhanced watermarking strategies.
To counter these vulnerabilities, we present \tool, a plug-and-play component that enables the creation of stealthy, image-dependent watermarks without incurring additional management costs. 
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of \tool in improving watermark stealthiness without compromising other watermark metrics.
