In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the paradigm of artificial intelligence, achieving human-like performance in mathematics~\citep{liu2023mathematical,shao2024deepseekmath}, coding~\citep{luo2023wizardcoder,roziere2023code,guo2024deepseek,zhu2024deepseek}, embodied intelligence~\citep{wang2023voyager,liu2024aligning}, game intelligence~\citep{hu2024survey,feng2024survey}, and advanced reasoning~\citep{chu2023survey,xu2025towards}. 
The comprehensive enhancement of foundational capabilities in these models has opened new opportunities for the development of role-playing agents~\citep{chen2024persona}, resulting in a proliferation of such applications based on LLMs.
On one hand, this has catalyzed innovations in fields such as psychological counseling, anthropomorphic companionship, and game NPCs~\citep{tseng2024two}. 
On the other hand, it has provided fresh avenues for advancing social simulations~\citep{mou2024individual}. 
Concurrently, reasoning techniques in LLMs have flourished, with methods like chain-of-thought reasoning~\citep{wei2022chain}, tree-of-thought reasoning~\citep{yao2024tree}, and o1-style reasoning~\citep{jaech2024openai} progressively maximizing the potential of these models, particularly achieving remarkable outcomes in tasks involving mathematics and coding~\citep{guo2025deepseek,team2025kimi}.
While prior research has predominantly focused on role-playing applications and their evaluation, this study is positioned at the intersection of LLM-based role-playing agents and reasoning techniques. 
It seeks to address the scientific question of whether reasoning techniques enhance the role-playing capabilities of LLMs. 
By doing so, this work aims to provide guidance for developing more realistic and reliable role-playing agents powered by LLMs.
