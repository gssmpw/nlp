\section*{Limitations}
Although we have made every effort to comprehensively cover the most commonly used models and role-playing benchmarks, our selection may still be incomplete. 
Certain niche models or specialized benchmarks may not have been included, which could introduce potential biases in our findings. 
As a result, while our conclusions provide valuable insights into the role-playing capabilities of large language models, their robustness could be further enhanced through broader model coverage, additional benchmark evaluations, and more extensive experimental validations. 
Future studies should explore a wider range of datasets and model architectures to ensure greater generalizability and reliability of the findings.
