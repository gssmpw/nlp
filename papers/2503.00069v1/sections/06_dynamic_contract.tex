%Moreover,  relying on language alone to convey nuanced human expectations to AI systems is insufficient \citep{Bisconti2021}. Humans must be able to express these expectations unambiguously, which itself is a major challenge, and even if humans were able to, the AI system needs to interpret them correctly. This underscores the need for more robust and adaptable mechanisms for understanding and internalizing human intentions that move beyond linguistic specifications.


% Structure of Arugments:
% 1. AI (LLM) alignment is an incomplete contracting problem.
% 2. Three other fields have dealt with incomplete contracting problems: (i) Legal Theory; (ii) Economic Theory; and (iii) Social Theory.
% 3. For each field:
%    - Show how the incomplete contracting problem arises in {Legal, Economic, Social} theory.
%    - Describe how {Legal, Economic, Social} theory has dealt with the incomplete contracting problem.
%    - Describe what findings AI (LLM) alignment researchers should use from how {Legal, Economic, Social} theory dealt with incomplete contracting problems.
% 4. [Maybe not Applicable] Describe how, in general, the incomplete contracting problem has been dealt with in {Legal, Economic, Social} theory using a *dynamic* approach.
