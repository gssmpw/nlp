\begin{abstract}
Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on producing responses that meet human expectations and align with shared values\,---\,a process coined \textit{alignment}. 
However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the inherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow nature of the technological approaches designed to address them. 
Current alignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader issue of \textit{incomplete contracts}, the impracticality of specifying a contract between a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in LLM alignment. 
In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires incorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social, economic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from these domains. 
Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment frameworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment.
We end our discussion by offering an alternative view on LLM alignment, framing the under-specified nature of its objectives as an opportunity rather than perfect their specification. Beyond technical improvements in LLM alignment, we discuss the need for participatory alignment interface designs.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This paper highlights the importance of further research and collaboration among experts in law, economics, social sciences, and LLM developers.
We believe the approach proposed in this paper would result in systems that better align with societal values by incorporating diverse perspectives into their design and oversight. In this sense, it holds positive societal impacts. 
To underscore our position that LLM alignment decisions should not be made exclusively by system designers, we discuss in \Cref{sec:alternative} the necessity of examining who is responsible for these decisions and exploring approaches to create more participatory alignment frameworks.
