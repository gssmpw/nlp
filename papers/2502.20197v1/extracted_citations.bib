  abstract = {Rocket Chip is an open-source Sysem-on-Chip design generator that
	emits synthesizable RTL. It leverages the Chisel hardware construction
	language to compose a library of sophisticated generators for cores,
	caches, and interconnects into an integrated SoC. Rocket Chip generates
	general-purpose processor cores that use the open RISC-V ISA, and
	provides both an in-order core generator (Rocket) and an out-of-order
	core generator (BOOM). For SoC designers interested in utilizing
	heterogeneous specialization for added efficiency gains, Rocket Chip
	supports the integration of custom accelerators in the form of instruction
	set extensions, coprocessors, or fully independent novel cores. Rocket
	Chip has been taped out (manufactured) eleven times, and yielded
	functional silicon prototypes capable of booting Linux.},
