\caption{Two samples from MMLU-Pro (left) and its \wicds variant (right), where \textit{Hydrogen} and \textit{Centrifugal} were removed. Correct answers in bold. Llama-3.1 8B correctly answers both original questions but fails on the \wicds variant for the second question. The probability distribution of the model for each answer is also shown.}
