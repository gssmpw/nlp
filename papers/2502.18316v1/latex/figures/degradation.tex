\caption{Models' performances on the \wicd\space variant and the original benchmarks. Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3.1-70B models are the best performing on both variants. However, Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.514B models experience the largest degradation, raising concerns about whether their performances were overestimated.}
