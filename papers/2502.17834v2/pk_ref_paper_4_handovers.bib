Four databases were searched for articles presenting either a novel design of one of these personal care robotic system or trial results relating to these systems. Articles presenting nine different robotic personal care systems were examined, six of which had been developed after 2005. These six also all have publications relating to their trials. In the majority of trials, patient independence was improved with operation of the robotic device for a specific subset of ADL. A map of the current state of the field of personal care robotics is presented in this study. Areas requiring further research include improving feedback and awareness, as well as refining control methods and pre-programmed behaviors. Developing an affordable, easy to use system would help fill the current gap in the commercial market.}

Ten participants (eight males, two females; 26.0±5.0 years, 72.7±13.5kg, 1.73±0.8m) arranged in pairs (a giver and a receiver), passed an object from the giver to the receiver at a self-selected speed. A motion capture system quantified the giver and the receiver’s motion simultaneously. Three interpersonal distances and three object masses were chosen to study the handover. We hypothesized that (a) the handover occurs at half of the interpersonal distance between the giver and receiver and (b) the handover height depends on the objects’ mass. Taken together, our results show that the handover strongly depends on the interpersonal distance between the giver and receiver, while object mass related only to handover duration. }

abstract={From a motor control perspective, human-to-human object handovers can be described as coordinated joint-actions transferring the power over an object from a passer to a receiver. Although, human-to-human handovers are very reliable in terms of success, it is unclear how both actors plan and execute their actions independently while taking into account the partners behaviour. Here, we measured grip-forces of passer and receiver while handing over an object. In order to study mutual interaction in human-to-human handovers, we measured how changes in relevant features (sensory information available to the passer and receiver's reaching velocity) in one partner affect grip-force profiles not only at the manipulated side but also at the partner's side. The data reveals strong effects of sensory manipulations on time-related (duration and release delay) and dynamometric measures (force rates). Variation of reaching velocities had the largest impact on the receiver's force rates. Furthermore, there are first indications that the vertical object movement is used as an implicit cue to signal the start of the handover in situations where vision is restricted.},

abstract = {Object handover is a common human collaboration behavior that attracts attention from researchers in Robotics and Cognitive Science. Though visual perception plays an important role in the object handover task, the whole handover process has not been specifically explored. In this work, we propose a novel rich-annotated dataset, H2O, for visual analysis of human-human object handovers. The H2O, which contains 18K video clips involving 15 people who hand over 30 objects to each other, is a multi-purpose benchmark. It can support several vision-based tasks, from which, we specifically provide a baseline method, RGPNet, for a less-explored task named Receiver Grasp Prediction. Extensive experiments show that the RGPNet can produce plausible grasps based on the giver&amp;#x2019;s hand-object states in the pre-handover phase. Besides, we also report the hand and object pose errors with existing baselines and show that the dataset can serve as the video demonstrations for robot imitation learning on the handover task.},
