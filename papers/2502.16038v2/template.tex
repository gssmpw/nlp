\title{How Does Emotion Affect Information Communication}
\maketitle

%摘要
\begin{abstract}
In recent years, the pivotal role of emotions in information dissemination has attracted extensive attention. Research indicates that emotionally charged content significantly outperforms neutral content in dissemination speed and coverage due to its ability to evoke stronger emotional responses. Valence, arousal, and dominance are key factors influencing information retention, comprehension, and sharing. However, systematic analysis of the mechanisms by which emotions affect dissemination and the application of multidimensional emotional design remain limited. This study reviews 166 relevant articles, examining the role of emotions in understanding and sharing information, and proposes a multidimensional design framework based on text, visuals, sound, and interaction design. Incorporating the ``Four-System" model of emotion activation, it develops an emotion regulation framework to optimize the application of emotions in dissemination. This research offers theoretical support and practical guidance for emotion-driven dissemination, laying a foundation for advancing this field.

% \section*{Introduction}

% We recommend that you keep the introduction to 800 words maximum. The introduction should answer the following questions: what is the topic of the article? Why is this topic of importance? What recent developments make it timely to review this topic now? And how will this topic be reviewed? To answer the last question, we recommend adding a guiding paragraph at the end of your introduction that clearly states what will (and what won’t) be discussed in your Review, so readers and referees will know what to expect.
