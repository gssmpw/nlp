% Effective collaboration in real-world scenarios relies on a shared understanding of the workspace state, where collaborators---whether humans or AI agents---must stay on the same page in dynamic environments. 
\looseness=-1
Software engineering (SE) is increasingly collaborative, with developers working together on shared complex codebases.
% 
Effective collaboration in shared environments requires participants---whether humans or AI agents---to stay on the same page as their environment evolves.
% 
When a collaborator's understanding diverges from the current state---what we term the \textit{out-of-sync} challenge---the collaborator's actions may fail, leading to integration issues.
% This occurs frequently in SE when developers unknowingly work with outdated codebase versions, leading to integration issues.
% When collaborators lose synchronization with their environment -- what we term the \textit{out-of-}sync problem -- task performance suffers. 
% A critical challenge emerges when collaborators lose synchronization with changing environments, a challenge we term as the \textit{out-of-sync} problem that occurs when a collaborator's belief state diverges from reality during task execution, leading to degraded performance.
% 
In this work, we introduce \textbf{\textit{SyncMind}}, a framework that systematically defines the \textit{out-of-sync} problem faced by large language model (LLM) agents in collaborative software engineering (CSE).
% 
% we tackle this \textit{out-of-sync} challenge in the context of collaborative SE (CSE) by introducing:
% (1) \textbf{\textit{SyncMind}}, a framework that enables systematic evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents' \textit{out-of-sync} recovery;
% with novel metrics tailored for this task;
% targeted at assessing their recovery effectiveness and resource awareness; 
Based on \textit{SyncMind}, we create \textbf{\textit{SyncBench}}, a benchmark featuring 24,332 instances of agent \textit{out-of-sync} scenarios in real-world CSE derived from 21 popular \github repositories with executable verification tests.
Experiments on \textit{SyncBench} uncover critical insights into existing LLM agents' capabilities and limitations.
Besides substantial performance gaps among agents (from \textit{Llama-3.1} agents $\leq 3.33\%$ to \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} $\geq 28.18\%$), their consistently low collaboration willingness ($\le 4.86\%$) suggests fundamental limitations of existing LLM in CSE.
% Shedding light on LLM agents' future alignment with cooperative workflows,
% 
However, when collaboration occurs, it positively correlates with \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success.
% 
Minimal performance differences in agents' resource-aware \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries further reveal their significant lack of resource awareness and adaptability, shedding light on future resource-efficient collaborative systems.
Code and data are openly available.
% the stark limitation in their surprisingly low willingness to collaborate ($\leq 4.86\%$) emerges along with the positive correlation between collaborator assistance and recovery success.
% \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} with the highest collaboration willingness ($4.86\%$) gains $5.52\%$ performance boost from collaborator assistance, in contrast to other agents ($\leq 2.98\%$) obtaining less performance gains ($\leq$$4.00\%$).

% Our benchmark and findings serve as essential building blocks for developing more robust and resource-efficient collaborative systems in real-world dynamic software engineering environments.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This work aims to provide meaningful insights into advancing collaborative AI systems and their application in software engineering, with potential societal implications in several areas. The framework and findings serve to improve the reliability and efficiency of collaborative software engineering, potentially reducing costly errors and development delays.
However, there are important considerations valuable to take into account.
First, while enhanced collaboration capabilities of AI agents could improve software quality and developer productivity, they may also impact human developers' jobs and require careful integration into existing workflows.
Second, our resource-aware framework highlights the need to consider computational and environmental costs in deploying collaborative AI systems at scale.
Additionally, as AI agents become more capable of detecting and recovering from synchronization issues, it is of significance to ensure that human developers maintain meaningful oversight and understanding of system changes.
We believe these considerations should be actively discussed as the field moves toward more sophisticated collaborative AI systems in software engineering.
