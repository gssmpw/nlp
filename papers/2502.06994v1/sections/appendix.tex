\section{Discussions and Limitations}
\label{Appendix A: Discussions and Limitations}

The evolution of collaborative software engineering introduces complex challenges in maintaining synchronization among collaborators, whether humans or AI agents. Our investigation into the agent \textit{out-of-sync} challenge reveals fundamental insights into how collaborators detect, respond to, and recover from belief state divergence ($B_k \neq S_k$ at time $T_k$). This section elaborates on our key findings, discusses their broader implications, and acknowledges important limitations that suggest potential directions for future research. 

\paragraph{Key Findings and Implications.}

By introducing our evaluation framework (\textit{SyncMind} \Sref{Section: framework}) and benchmark (\textit{SyncBench} \Sref{Section: Benchmark}) built upon real-world \github repositories, our experiments (\Sref{Section: Experiments}) illuminate critical aspects of agent \textit{out-of-sync}:

(1) \textit{Technical Capabilities and Collaborative Effectiveness.}
% Provided with independent and collaborative recovery protocols, the low \textit{SR} and \textit{LA} observed across all tested LLM agents (\tref{tab:table 1 (performance summary)}) shed light on LLM agents' lack of synchronization maintenance and communication awareness that are highly essential for maintaining an effective collaboration.
Through either independent or collaborative recovery (\Sref{Section: Recovery Settings}), the stark performance variations among LLM agents (Tables \ref{tab:table 2 (caller vs callee)}-\ref{tab:table 1 (performance summary)} \& \ref{tab:table 1 + CSR (overall performance summary)}-\ref{tab:table 2 + CSR (caller vs callee)}) demonstrate that technical proficiency alone is insufficient for a successful \textit{out-of-sync} recovery (\Sref{Section: Agent Recovery Capabilities}-\ref{Section: Multifaceted Abilities for Effective Recoveries} \& \Sref{Appendix C1: Conditional Recovery Performance}).
Similar recovery trajectories of high-performance agents (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} with $SR$: \textit{Independent} $28.18\%$, \textit{Collaborative} $33.70\%$), especially with respect to early-stage exploration (\Sref{Appendix C2: Temporal Dynamics of Recovery Actions}) and proactive collaborative initiative (\Sref{Section: Beneficial Collaborator Influence Limited By Disadvantageous Agent Initiative}-\ref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}), suggest that both independent problem-solving and collaborative communication capabilities are crucial for maintaining synchronization in real-world dynamic collaborative environments.

% Our experiment results further demonstrate that a successful recovery from an \textit{out-of-sync} state demands more than just technical programming proficiency---it requires sophisticated collaboration and communication capabilities. 
% However, the positive influence of collaborator assistance is markedly restrained by the scarce willingness of LLM agents for collaborator involvement as well as their low-quality communications. 

(2) \textit{Collaboration Patterns and Communication Quality.}
Experiment results reveal the positive correlation between LLM agents' collaboration willingness and recovery success. Benefiting from proactive assistance seeking, the influence of collaborator assistance ($\Delta_\textit{collaborator} \in [0.33, 5.52] \%$) remains beneficial among different LLM agents.
However, its effectiveness varies significantly as affected by communication timing ($85.71\%-100.00\%$ \textit{early-stage assistance} among successful recoveries), question quality (rather than volume), and proactive collaboration initiative ($ASR \leq 4.86\%$) (\Sref{Section: Beneficial Collaborator Influence Limited By Disadvantageous Agent Initiative}-\ref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}). 
% On the other hand, while collaborator assistance noticeably enhances agents' performance, this potential remains largely unrealized due to agents' lack of collaboration willingness and high-quality assistance seeking. This communication gap proves particularly consequential in complex tasks where collaborative domain knowledge could provide crucial context for recovery success.
% Our investigation demonstrates that effective recoveries from \textit{out-of-sync} states require agents' strategic foresight in managing both the timing and sequencing of their interactions. Early information gathering through environmental exploration and collaborator assistance is critical for accurately localizing \textit{out-of-sync} functions in pursuit of re-synchronization success. This initial phase of information collection significantly improves the efficiency of subsequent recovery programming, highlighting the importance of allowing agents to autonomously plan and sequence their recovery actions.

(3) \textit{Task Complexity and Recovery Strategies.}
Agents' performance gaps between \textit{Caller} and \textit{Callee} tasks (\tref{tab:table 2 (caller vs callee)}) highlight how different types of \textit{out-of-sync} scenarios require distinct recovery strategies (\Sref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}).
While \textit{Callee} tasks requiring dependency tracing show wider performance variations ($0.67\%-38.67\%$) and degraded performance among most agents, complex tasks generally benefit more from collaborative assistance (\Sref{Section: Effects of Task Complexity}).
Leveraging the dissimilar complexity levels of different source repositories, our repository-wise analysis (\Sref{Appendix:C.7 (repo-wise comparison)}) lends further evidence to the negative correlation between increased task complexity and recovery success. 

(4) \textit{Resource Awareness and Efficiency.}
Our experiments with varying resource constraints (\Sref{Section: Resource Awareness} \& \ref{Appendix:C.5 (Resource Awareness)}) unveil critical insights with regard to LLM agents' resource awareness and adaptive resource utilization. While their underlying technical capabilities significantly affect their time resource utilization, LLM agents' recovery performance demonstrates their notably low awareness of both temporal and financial resources. As early-stage resource allocation proves crucial for attaining recovery success, strategic action planning and resource estimation are highlighted for high-performing and resource-efficient \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries. 



\paragraph{Broader Implications for Collaborative Systems.}
Our findings reveal meaningful implications for the future development of collaborative systems, especially in real-world scenarios with dynamic environments and intricate task contexts. 
From system design perspectives, the agent \textit{out-of-sync} challenge in real-world collaboration scenarios emphasizes the importance of state monitoring and divergence detection that are able to provide collaboration with effective recognition of the state mismatch $B_k \neq S_k$ taking place at time $T_k$ (\Sref{Section: Definition of Agent Out-of-Sync}).
The low $ASR$ ($\leq 4.86\%$) among all LLM agents also underscores the value of stronger collaboration initiative and communication capabilities for effective collaboration.
Our implementation of resource-aware \textit{out-of-sync} recovery demonstrates the necessity of intelligent resource allocation and estimation strategies, illuminating both the importance of early-stage investment in environmental understanding and the need for adaptive resource utilization based on task complexity and resource availability. In designing effective collaboration protocols, our work elaborates the benefits of collaborator assistance, meanwhile highlighting the value of quality-focused rather than quantity-focused communication. 

\paragraph{Limitations and Future Work.}
While our study provides meaningful insights, several limitations present potential directions for our future work:

(1) \textit{Benchmark Limitations.}
Although our benchmark construction method is applicable to diverse \github repositories and therefore can be further expanded to larger sizes to accommodate custom use (\textit{\textit{e.g.,}} large-scale training), our \textit{SyncBench} (\Sref{Section: Benchmark}) currently focuses primarily on \github \textit{Python} repositories with unit tests, which may limit its generalizability to broader software engineering scenarios with dissimilar programming languages and testing environments. 
% Having prerequisite environment setup files (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{.toml}, \textit{setup.py}), \textit{requirements.txt} is a plus
Additionally, our simulation of collaborative \textit{out-of-sync} scenarios based on real-world historical repository changes may not fully capture all complexities of live collaboration patterns, especially in large-scale collaborative software engineering with multiple collaborators involved.

(2) \textit{Evaluation Framework Constraints.}
Implementing resource-aware \textit{out-of-sync} recovery, our simplified resource modeling may not capture all real-world constraints involved in multifarious collaborative scenarios in reality. In our future work, we aim to include more diversified resource utilization with deeper exploration of collaborators' long-term collaborative relationships. We also endeavor to extend our technical scope to multi-agent systems with multiple collaborators working on the task, resulting in more complex \textit{out-of-sync} scenarios with multiple agents facing \textit{out-of-sync} states ($B_k \neq S_k$).

(3) \textit{Methodological Considerations.}
There are also limitations in our methodological design. Our simulation-based approach may not capture all nuances of real-world collaborations, and our investigation can be expanded to diverse communication protocols. To this end, our future work will also pay attention to the development of specialized training approaches to enhance agents' collaboration initiatives and communication capabilities, along with investigating more sophisticated resource management strategies that better mirror real-world development constraints. 




% Limitations and Future Improvements
% \paragraph{Limitations and Future Work.} 
% Our evaluation primarily focuses on Python repositories, and the generalizability to other programming languages and development environments remains to be explored.
% Additionally, our simulation of \textit{out-of-sync} scenarios, while based on real-world repositories, may not capture all complexities of live collaborative development environments.
% Further research could address these limitations by expanding the scope to multiple programming languages, investigating real-time collaborative scenarios, and examining longer-term collaborative relationships between humans and AI agents. Future work might also pay attention to the development of specialized training approaches to enhance agents' collaborative consciousness and communication capabilities, as well as investigating more sophisticated resource management strategies that better mirror real-world development constraints. We hope our work provides future research with meaningful implications and evaluation benchmark to help bridge the current gap between agents' technical capabilities and their collaborative effectiveness.

\subsection{Pilot for Configuration}
In determining the appropriate experiment settings, we conduct a series of preliminary tests (\tref{tab:table B1}) for basic interaction configurations. 

\textbf{Interaction Basics.} We first pilot \textit{out-of-sync} recovery on \textit{Llama-3.1-70B} and \textit{GPT-4o} with the maximum number of turns limited to $10$ interactive iterations across $66$ instances. For both agents, a large proportion of tasks consist of $10$ total turns of \textit{Env} exploration without any solution attempts, while the remaining $11$ tests have only one or two solution proposal attempts without success. Based on this result, we further expand the max-turn limitation to $20$ and $30$ turns, respectively. Drawing upon the observation that fewer turns leave insufficient time for agents to propose their solutions, we finalize $30$ turns of maximum interaction time to ensure the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency\footref{Footnote: Cost Constraints} of our experiments. 

\textbf{Resource Awareness.} To define the proper cost setting of recovery actions, we compare the pilot experiment results of different cost settings in terms of initial budget (\textit{i.e.,} \textit{the total amount of money each agent is given at the very beginning of each test}), solution-proposal cost (\textit{i.e.,} \textit{the cost of \textcolor{fig2_code}{proposing a solution} for execution validation}), and assistance-seeking cost (\textit{i.e.,} \textit{the cost of \textcolor{fig2_ask}{proactively asking for collaborator assistance}}). Setting the balanced cost of both solution-proposal and assistance-seeking as $\$100$, we encourage agents to take these two recovery actions by providing them with an initial budget of $\$300$, $\$1000$, and $\$3000$, respectively. Meanwhile, all experiments are conducted with the maximum time limit set to $30$ turns, as revealed by earlier pilot results. Comparing the performance between $\textit{Budget}=\$1000$ and $\textit{Budget}=\$3000$, deteriorated $SR$ scores are obtained as we provide agents with adequate budget that can cover all kinds of action selection patterns. This unfolds LLM agents' lack of cost awareness that makes a sufficient initial budget an obstacle towards recovery success. To this regard, we define an initial budget of $\$1000$ for our standard resource-aware \textit{out-of-sync} recovery experiments, allowing agents to allocate freely up to one-third of the maximum turns of interactions for solution-proposal and assistance-seeking actions.

We design our benchmark construction method \Sref{Section: Benchmark} with generalizability and adaptability to diverse \textit{Python} repositories that have Python as their primary programming language, meanwhile possessing unit tests for testing the functioning of various modules.
Including environment setup (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{pyproject.toml}, \textit{setup.py}) is a plus, while specifying necessary packages serves as an alternative way to enrich \textit{SyncBench} (\Sref{Section: Benchmark}).

In the current version, our agent \textit{out-of-sync} benchmark, \textbf{\textit{SyncBench}} (\Sref{Section: Benchmark}), is built upon 21 popular \github repositories (\tref{tab:table B2 (Benchmark)}), and can be further expanded or downsampled to proper dataset sizes suitable for different experiment conditions and evaluation purposes.

Our benchmark construction method complies with our definition of agent \textit{out-of-sync} (\Sref{Section: Definition of Agent Out-of-Sync}), where meeting at least one of three conditions can result in an agent's belief deviation, either directly leading to task failure or indirectly laying latent problems for future execution errors.
Although the latter outcome is not immediately visible, growing state divergences can be accumulated as underlying risks that lead to significant troubles in the near future as the collaboration proceeds.
To take all three conditions into account, our benchmark construction method supports both \textit{pass-to-fail} and \textit{pass-to-pass} samples, though we only consider \textit{pass-to-fail} in our current version of \textit{SyncBench} (\Sref{Section: Benchmark Construction}) to emphasize the importance of \textit{out-of-sync} recovery abilities in maintaining effective collaborations.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=2pt,partopsep=0pt,leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{\textit{Pass-to-fail} state divergence.} \textit{Out-of-sync} scenarios directly visible as \textit{pass-to-fail} state divergence ($B_2 \neq S_2$) are readily leveraged to construct \textit{out-of-sync} recovery tasks where: (1) collaborator updated repository ($S_1$) can successfully pass the execution test, and (2) agent revised repository with \textit{out-of-sync} function ($B_2$) fails the execution test.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Pass-to-pass} state divergence.} \textit{Out-of-sync} scenarios that are not manifested as immediate task failures are also taken into consideration to create \textit{out-of-sync} recovery tasks based on \textit{pass-to-pass} state divergence ($B_2 \neq S_2$) where: (1) collaborator updated repository ($S_1$) successfully passes the execution test, resulting in parsed test output denoted as $O_S$, (2) agent revised repository with \textit{out-of-sync} function ($B_2$) also successfully passes the execution test, resulting in parsed test output denoted as $O_B$, and (3) parsed test output results between $S_2$ and $B_2$ are different ($O_S \neq O_B$).
\end{itemize}

As our determination of recovery success depends on the success of both execution test and parsing validation (\Sref{Section: Evaluation Metrics}), both {pass-to-fail} and {pass-to-pass} \textit{out-of-sync} recovery tasks can be effectively evaluated.



In our experiments (\Sref{Section: Experiments}), we test on 300 downsampled instances\footref{Footnote: Cost Constraints} with evenly distributed \textit{Caller} and \textit{Callee} (\Sref{Section: Benchmark Datasets}) for computational efficiency and comparison effectiveness.

    """
    Specify a layer of the visualization in terms of mark and data transform(s).

    This is the main method for specifying how the data should be visualized.
    It can be called multiple times with different arguments to define
    a plot with multiple layers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mark : :class:`Mark`
        The visual representation of the data to use in this layer.
    transforms : :class:`Stat` or :class:`Move`
        Objects representing transforms to be applied before plotting the data.
        Currently, at most one :class:`Stat` can be used, and it
        must be passed first. This constraint will be relaxed in the future.
    orient : "x", "y", "v", or "h"
        The orientation of the mark, which also affects how transforms are computed.
        Typically corresponds to the axis that defines groups for aggregation.
        The "v" (vertical) and "h" (horizontal) options are synonyms for "x" / "y",
        but may be more intuitive with some marks. When not provided, an
        orientation will be inferred from characteristics of the data and scales.
    legend : bool
        Option to suppress the mark/mappings for this layer from the legend.
    label : str
        A label to use for the layer in the legend, independent of any mappings.
    data : DataFrame or dict
        Data source to override the global source provided in the constructor.
    variables : data vectors or identifiers
        Additional layer-specific variables, including variables that will be
        passed directly to the transforms without scaling.

    Examples
    --------
    .. include:: ../docstrings/objects.Plot.add.rst

\subsection{\textit{Out-of-Sync} Recovery on SyncBench}
\label{Appendix: Benchmark Construction}

% We summarize typical types of causes that render agent \textit{out-of-sync} during collaborations in \fref{fig:figure 8 (Typical Causes)}.

Employing our resource-aware \textit{out-of-sync} recovery framework (\textbf{\textit{SyncMind}} \Sref{Section: framework}), \fref{fig:figure B1 (benchmark example)} presents an agent \textit{out-of-sync} recovery example on our benchmark (\textbf{\textit{SyncBench}} \Sref{Section: Benchmark}).

    \caption{\textbf{\textit{Out-of-Sync} Recovery Example.} Starting from the initial \textit{out-of-sync} state at $T_2$, an LLM agent takes different recovery actions to approach synchronized state through multi-turn interactions, which involve \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textbf{interacting with \textit{Env}}} (\textit{green blocks}), \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textbf{proactively asking for collaborator assistance}} (\textit{blue block}), or \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textbf{proposing a solution}} to examine agent's recovery progress (\textit{orange blocks}). By incorporating resource awareness throughout the \textit{out-of-sync} recovery process, the agent pays extra heed to making rational use of available resources for gaining knowledge and validating solution at a cost. For better clarity, some details are omitted as […].}

\subsection{Conditional Recovery Performance}
\label{Appendix C1: Conditional Recovery Performance}

As a complement to our previous observations with regard to agents' huge performance gaps (\Sref{Section: Agent Recovery Capabilities}), we expand our exploration to agents' technical problem-solving capabilities conditioned on their localization success.
By calculating $CSR$ (\Sref{Section: Evaluation Metrics}), we extend our evaluation results (\tref{tab:table 1 (performance summary)}-\ref{tab:table 2 (caller vs callee)}) to include conditional recovery analysis on both agents' overall performance (\tref{tab:table 1 + CSR (overall performance summary)}) and their separate performance on \textit{Caller} and \textit{Callee} (\tref{tab:table 2 + CSR (caller vs callee)}).



\textbf{(1) Overall Performance.}
As summarized in \tref{tab:table 1 + CSR (overall performance summary)}, we integrate $CSR$ with the overall evaluation of all seven agents (\tref{tab:table 1 (performance summary)}), which not only affords evidence to different LLM agents' significant technical ability gaps (\Sref{Section: Agent Recovery Capabilities}), but further contributes to the finding that strong technical programming capabilities alone is insufficient for effectively maintaining synchronization in collaborative software engineering (\Sref{Section: Multifaceted Abilities for Effective Recoveries}).

%%%%%%%%%% (1.1) Huge Gap %%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Both tech & collaborator assistancce are important %%%%%
\textbf{Persistent Gaps In LLM Agents' Technical Problem-Solving Capabilities.}
As one of the high-performing agents, \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} showcases its robust problem-solving capacity in conditional recovery ($CSR_{file} \geq 43.97\%$, $CSR_{func} \geq 50.01\%$), with positive gains from collaborator assistance in both $CSR_{file}$ ($\Delta_{\textit{collaborator}}=+10.98\%$) and $CSR_{func}$ ($\Delta_{\textit{collaborator}}=+14.89\%$). This effectively substantiates the importance of both strong technical efficiency and effective collaboration in successful \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries.
%%%%% Ability gap also exists in tech %%%%%
On the other hand, \textit{Llama-3.1-8B} consistently exhibits limited technical recovery capacity at both \textit{file} ($CSR_{file} \leq 4.93\%$) and \textit{function} ($CSR_{func} \leq 7.07\%$) levels.
The huge technical recovery gaps in both $CSR_{file}$ and $CSR_{func}$ complement our prior observations on LLM agents' persistent ability gaps (\Sref{Section: Agent Recovery Capabilities}).



%%%%%%%%%% (1.2) Tech Is Insufficient %%%%%%%%%%
%%%%% Tech is insufficient -- multifaceted abilities required for recovery success %%%%%
\textbf{Technical Proficiency Alone Is Insufficient for Recovery Success.}
Our calculation of agents' $CSR$ scores (\tref{tab:table 1 + CSR (overall performance summary)}) also corroborates that strong technical SE capacity alone is insufficient for \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success.
For example, showcasing comparably high $CSR$ scores at both \textit{file} and \textit{function} levels, \textit{GPT-4o mini} and \textit{Llama-3.1-70B} obtain their success rates less than $5.32\%$ and $3.33\%$ (\tref{tab:table 1 (performance summary)}), respectively.
Their significant lack of willingness to collaborate (\textit{Llama-3.1-70B} with $ASR=1.37\%$, \textit{GPT-4o mini} with $ASR=1.69\%$) (\fref{fig:figure 7 (Time Allocation)}), combined with their low localization accuracy ($LA_{file} \leq 12.33\%$, $LA_{func} \leq 8.31\%$) (\tref{tab:table 1 (performance summary)}), further demonstrates the significance of multifaceted capabilities for obtaining \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success (\Sref{Section: Multifaceted Abilities for Effective Recoveries}).
% , providing insights into equipping agents with multifaceted abilities (\Sref{Section: Multifaceted Abilities for Effective Recoveries}) to effectively maintain collaborative synchronization.



\textbf{(2) \textit{Caller} versus \textit{Callee}.}
In assessing agents' conditional performance separately on \textit{Caller} and \textit{Callee}, we summarize \tref{tab:table 2 + CSR (caller vs callee)} by incorporating $CSR$ calculation into \tref{tab:table 2 (caller vs callee)}.

%%%%% (2.1) Huge Gap %%%%%
Expanding our prior analysis (\Sref{Section: Agent Recovery Capabilities}) to technical recovery capacity, agents' ability gaps remain huge in conditional recovery success at both \textit{file} (from \textit{Llama-3.1-8B} with $CSR_{file}=3.05\%$ to \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} with $CSR_{file}=66.67\%$) and \textit{function} (from \textit{Llama-3.1-8B} with $CSR_{func}=4.02\%$ to \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} with $CSR_{func}=74.30\%$) levels, with in general diminished performance on \textit{Callee}.
Nevertheless, \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} continues to excel in delivering superior conditioned technical recovery capabilities ($CSR_{file} \geq 40.00 \%$ and $CSR_{func} \geq 47.46\%$).

%%%%% (2.2) Tech Is Insufficient %%%%%
On the other hand, the comparable technical recovery capacities among \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet}, \textit{GPT-4o mini}, and \textit{GPT-4o mini}, as demonstrated by their recovery performance on both \textit{Caller} and \textit{Callee}, resonate strongly with their overall performance (\tref{tab:table 1 + CSR (overall performance summary)}), substantiating the insufficient role of technical proficiency in effective \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries (\Sref{Section: Multifaceted Abilities for Effective Recoveries}).

\end{figure}



\subsection{Temporal Dynamics of Recovery Actions}
\label{Appendix C2: Temporal Dynamics of Recovery Actions}

Our discussion on collaboration effectiveness (\Sref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}) uncovers the consistent patterns of advancing repository exploration for \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success (\fref{fig:figure C1 (first-half action distribution)}). The comparison on action distribution in the first half of recovery time between \textit{(a) success cases} and \textit{(b) failure cases} presents the positive correlation between effective communication and successful \textit{out-of-sync} recovery.
By extending their action distribution to concrete indexing, we visualize LLM agents' time allocation throughout their \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries (\fref{fig:figure C2 (recovery time allocation)}), which sheds light on the effective recovery strategies with regard to agents' action taking patterns and temporal dynamics. 



\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{small}
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{sections/figs/figure_C2.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Recovery Time Allocation.} Through \textit{(a) independent} or \textit{(b) collaborative} \textit{out-of-sync} recovery, agents distribute their recovery actions freely to different turns.
    As suggested by figure legends, actions of \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{proactively asking for collaborator assistance (AC)}} are denoted as arrowheads heading to the right ($\triangleright$), while actions of \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{proposing a recovery solution (PS)}} are represented as arrowheads heading towards the left ($\triangleleft$).
    For each agent, we also calculate the mean index of its $AC$ ($mAC$) and $PS$ ($mPS$), indicated as dotted lines
    (\protect\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{\protect\draw[dotted,line width=1pt] (0,0) -- (0.6,0);})
    and dashed lines
    (\protect\tikz[baseline=-0.5ex]{\protect\draw[dashed,line width=1pt] (0,0) -- (0.6,0);})
    , respectively.
    Employing the shade of colors to indicate the frequency distribution of actions taken at each turn, the more recovery actions a turn index is assigned, the deeper the color of the turn index is superimposed. }
    \label{fig:figure C2 (recovery time allocation)}
\vspace{0em}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\end{figure}



\textbf{Exploring earlier and solving later.}
Choices of actions across all recovery turns are arranged in \fref{fig:figure C2 (recovery time allocation)} according to their corresponding indices, where overlapped selections create a gradient of color depth to reveal the actual interaction allocation of each LLM agent in the course of recovering its belief state to the up-to-date world state. 
\fref{fig:figure C2 (recovery time allocation)} therefore elaborates the time allocation patterns of different agents under the standard $30$-turn \textit{out-of-sync} recovery setting through \textit{(a) independent} or \textit{(b) collaborative} recovery (\Sref{Section: Recovery Settings}).
Leveraging action indices, we calculate, for each LLM agent, the mean index of its \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{proposing a solution} ($mPS$)} or \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{proactively asking for collaborator assistance} ($mAC$)} actions. 
Comparing the performance of different LLM agents, both \textit{independent} and \textit{collaborative} recoveries showcase the positive correlation between later-turn solution proposal and high-performance recovery (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} and \textit{Llama-3.3-70B} with their $mPS \geq 15.28$ and $SR \geq 16.33\%$).
Comparing $mPS$ with $mAC$, \textit{collaborative} agents by and large seek collaborator assistance in markedly earlier turns ($mAC \in [3.35, 12.45]$) while deferring solution proposal to some later time ($mPS \in [8.49, 17.40]$), which resonates strongly with first-half action distribution patterns between successful and failed recovery cases (\fref{fig:figure C1 (first-half action distribution)}). 
Viewing \textit{(a) independent} and \textit{(b) collaborative} recovery collectively, agents with higher performance in general defer their solution proposal actions to some later turns ($mPS>14.87$) after exploring the codebase in the first half of time through \textcolor{fig2_env}{interacting with \textit{Env}} or \textcolor{fig2_ask}{proactively seeking collaborator assistance} (\fref{fig:figure C1 (first-half action distribution)}). Integrated with allocating a major proportion of interactions to \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textit{Env} exploration}, agents are able to better their performance through appropriately postponing their choices of solution proposal until obtaining sufficient contextual knowledge to establish synchronized mental models of updated states for an effective \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} attempt.



\subsection{Solution Proposal Dynamics}
\label{Appendix:C.3 (Solution Proposal Dynamics)}

Our experiments reveal a `\textit{Goldilocks zone}' for LLM agents' \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposals}---both excessive and insufficient proposal attempts correlate positively with reduced recovery success.

\textbf{Low solution proposal frequency is as adverse as frequent solution proposal attempts.}
%
%%%%% Low solution proposal frequency %%%%%
%
Possessing the least awareness of \textcolor{fig2_code}{proposing a solution} towards \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success, \textit{GPT-4o mini} (\fref{fig:figure 7 (Time Allocation)}) presents only $1.30\%$ time for \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} during its \textit{independent} recovery, which is on average $0.39$ turn out of the total $30$ turns allowed.
Similarly, collaborative \textit{GPT-4o mini} agent allocates merely $1.32\%$ recovery time to \textcolor{fig2_code}{propose a solution} in its $30$-turn recovery tasks. \textit{GPT-4o mini}'s low-frequency \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} patterns, which are only between $[0.39, 0.40]$ turns on average, results in its noticeably underperformed recoveries (\textit{Independent}: $SR=4.00\%$, \textit{Collaborative}: $SR=5.33\%$), especially compared with other LLM agents with their \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} attempts above $6.00\%$ recovery time.
%
%%%%% High solution proposal frequency %%%%%
%
On the other hand, excessive \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposals} introduce analogous negative influence on agents' recovery performance. \textit{Llama-3.1-8B} allocates $31.32\%$ recovery time in its \textit{independent} \textit{out-of-sync} recovery scenarios for \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} actions, while having $30.70\%$ of its total time for \textcolor{fig2_code}{proposing solutions} in its collaborative recovery tasks. Despite its frequent \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} attempts, limited solutions (\textit{Independent}: $SR=0.33\%$, \textit{Collaborative}: $SR=1.33\%$) are validated to be effective for achieving recovery success.
This impact stays applicable to other agents. For instance, \textit{Llama-3.1-70B} with $29.96\%$ and $29.09\%$ \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} in its \textit{independent} and \textit{collaborative} recoveries, respectively, achieves \textit{Independent}-$SR=2.67\%$ and \textit{Collaborative}-$SR=3.33\%$. Nevertheless, the timing of \textcolor{fig2_code}{solution proposal} attempts during later turns (\fref{fig:figure C2 (recovery time allocation)}) after gaining a better understanding of the codebase may supplement further advantages in fulfilling successful \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries.






\subsection{Effective Assistance Seeking}
\label{Appendix:C.4 (Effective Assistance Seeking)}
% - 2 classes of questions
% - answers



According to task completion successfulness, we categorize agents' proactive questions into \textit{high-quality} and \textit{low-quality} queries (\Sref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}).
By investigating the $<$\textit{query, response}$>$ pairs collected from collaborative interactions between agents and collaborators, we summarize typical characteristics of two query classes in \tref{tab:table C1 (Agent Query)}. 

% In light of assistance integration, high-performing agents (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} with $SR=33.70\%$, \textit{Llaa-3.3-70B} with $SR=19.00\%$) demonstrate clear usage of collaborator responses in subsequent actions, in contract to low-performing agents (\textit{e.g.,} \textit{Llama-3.1-8B} with $SR=1.33\%$, \textit{Llama-3.1-70B} with $SR=3.33\%$) that fail to effectively incorporate collaborator assistance in later solution generations.

\textbf{Communication-Performance Gap.} 
Viewing separately LLM agents' communication performance and recovery effectiveness (\Sref{Section: Beneficial Collaborator Influence Limited By Disadvantageous Agent Initiative}-\ref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}), our findings reveal a notable disparity between agents' programming performance and communication capabilities---An LLM agent can be a good programmer but a poor communicator.
This can be clearly substantiated by the fact that \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} showcases the best performance ($SR=33.70\%$) with $ASR=4.86\%$ while \textit{GPT-4o mini} achieves significantly superior upper-bound recovery performance ($SR=86.33\%$) with full collaborator support (\Sref{Section: Beneficial Collaborator Influence Limited By Disadvantageous Agent Initiative}), especially considering its markedly lower performance ($SR=5.32\%$) with $ASR=1.69\%$ in multi-turn recovery experiments. 

\textbf{Improvement Implications.}
%
\fref{fig:figure 6 (Time Allocation) (Question Quality)} unveils the significant advantage of high-quality assistance seeking, as revealed by high-performing LLM agents with a higher proportion of high-quality questions in both query categories (\textit{\textit{e.g.,}} \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet}: $SR=33.70\%$, with $21.35\%$ high-quality \textit{\textcolor{fig7_blue}{localization queries}} and $16.00\%$ high-quality \textit{\textcolor{fig7_salmon}{solution queries}}).
Nevertheless, arranged based on $ASR$ from low to high along the $X$-axis (\fref{fig:figure 6 (Time Allocation) (Question Quality)}), higher $ASR$ scores present no direct correlation with larger proportions of high-quality questions in either category. This further substantiates the importance of enhancing question quality, rather than increasing question volume, for LLM-based agents to achieve improved \textit{out-of-sync} recovery performance.
%
In pursuit of effective collaborator assistance (\S \ref{Section: Collaborative Effectiveness}), we conclude question quality indicators in three aspects (\tref{tab:table C1 (Agent Query)}): (1) \textit{Specificity}, where high-performing queries precisely identify ambiguous areas, (2) \textit{Timing}, where effective questions follow a logical progression from localization to solution refinement, and (3) \textit{Context Integration}, where superior queries raise task-specific confusions pivotal to \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success. 






Here are some assistance asking examples of different LLM agents during their journeys of \textit{out-of-sync} recovery.

Examples of \textit{low-quality} queries: 

(1) Vague queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 24 ==========
AGENT:
Can you please help confirm if the function `__init__` is out-of-sync?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $300 Left] I'm sorry that I'm not sure which `__init__` you are asking for confirmation.
\end{verbatim}

(2) Irrelevant queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 2 ==========
AGENT:
Can you provide more information about the doctest items that are expected to be collected in the test case `test_collect_module_two_doctest_no_modulelevel`? Specifically, what are the contents of the doctest items, and what is the expected behavior of the doctest?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $900 Left] The test case `test_collect_module_two_doctest_no_modulelevel` is creating a Python file with multiple functions, some of which contain string comments that represent doctests. The expected behavior is to collect these doctest items:
1. The string `\">>> magic = 42 \"` inside the `my_func` function, which is an incomplete doctest item.
2. The string `\">>> import os # this one does have a doctest\"` inside the `another` function, representing an actual doctest.
The test is expecting these doctests to be recognized and collected, thus expecting a total of two doctest items to be collected.
\end{verbatim}

(3) Redundant queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 2 ==========
AGENT:
Could you please help me locate the Python repository `test_repo` and provide its absolute path? It seems I cannot find it in the current working directory.
HUMAN:
[Balance: $900 Left] /workspace/test_repo
\end{verbatim}

(4) Repetitive queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 1 ==========
AGENT:
Where is the file containing the responsible code, and which function is out-of-sync? Specifically, can you please help provide the relative path of the responsible code?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $900 Left] The relative path is `./tests/utils/test_play.py`.
The out-of-sync function is `_get_video_size`.
========== TURN 4 ==========
AGENT:
What is the absolute path of the file containing the `_get_video_size` method? Please provide the necessary information so I can proceed with the task.
HUMAN:
[Balance: $800 Left] The absolute path of the file containing the `_get_video_size` method is `/workspace/test_repo/tests/utils/test_play.py`.

(5) Over-specific queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 6 ==========
AGENT:
Could you please help me locate the source code files in the test_repo? I need to find where the requests module implementation is located, particularly the file that handles URL preparation and request handling.
HUMAN:
[Balance: $800 Left] The requests module implementation is located in the `test_repo` directory under the path `/workspace/test_repo/src/requests/adapters.py`, where URL preparation and request handling are addressed.
\end{verbatim}

(6) Speculative queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 13 ==========
AGENT:
I think adding the key `by_msg` to `self.stats` can be a solution to recover the function `any_fail_on_issues`. Can you please help confirm whether this may be a potential solution?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $700 Left] Yes, it is a possible solution.
\end{verbatim}


Examples of \textit{high-quality} queries: 

(1) Explicit queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 4 ==========
AGENT:
Looking at the error trace and code, I see that the error occurs in `_register_options_provider` method when trying to add arguments to the parser. Could you confirm if the `options` attribute of the provider (which should be a BaseChecker instance) is expected to be a list/tuple of (opt, optdict) pairs? This would help me understand if the error is due to incorrect data structure or missing arguments.
HUMAN:
Yes, the `options` attribute of the provider is expected to be a list or tuple of (opt, optdict) pairs.
\end{verbatim}

(2) Targeted queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 3 ==========
AGENT:
Looking at the test file, I see that the tests are failing with AttributeError. Could you please share the specific AttributeError message from one of the failing tests? The error logs you provided only show \"AttributeError: type obj...\" but are truncated. The complete error message would help me identify which attribute is missing.
HUMAN:
[Balance: $900 Left] AttributeError: type object 'VNode' has no attribute 'append'
\end{verbatim}

(3) Constructive queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 18 ==========
AGENT:
In the failing test case `test_disable_all_enable_invalid`, what is the exact value and type of `node.root().file` when the error occurs? Can you show me the value of the tuple or provide more details about its structure?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $500 Left] `node.root().file` is expected to be a string, but when the error occurs, it is actually a tuple. The exact structure of the tuple might not be fully visible in the error message, but it likely contains multiple elements that should have been a single file path string.
\end{verbatim}

(4) Action-oriented queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 17 ==========
AGENT:
Could you help me locate the `get_data_path` function in the spaCy codebase? And could you please help confirm if I need to import dependencies for this function?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $700 Left] The `get_data_path` function is located in the `spacy.util` module. But you don't need to import other dependencies. You only need to accommodate the new imports from `spacy.util`.
\end{verbatim}

(5) Instruction-oriented queries:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
========== TURN 2 ==========
AGENT:
Based on the error messages showing \"TypeError: Lookups.get...\" in NER-related tests, could you tell me if there's a specific Lookups class or method that's being called in these failing tests, and what is the expected behavior of this Lookups functionality that I should aim to implement?
HUMAN:
[Balance: $800 Left] There is a specific `get_table` method in the Lookups class that's being called in these failing tests. The expected implementation of this method is to retrieve a table by its name and potentially use a default value if the table doesn't exist.

Endowing agents with the awareness of resource constraints and the ability for adaptive resource deployment is crucial for real-world collaborations.
Implementing resource-aware agent \textit{out-of-sync} recovery (\Sref{Section: Resource Awareness}), our investigation reveals significant limitations in agents' resource management capabilities across multiple dimensions, suggesting future improvement directions for resource-efficient collaborations.

% We focus on the resources of \textit{Time Management} and \textit{Cost Efficiency} to unveil implications towards resource-efficient \textit{out-of-sync} recovery.

\textbf{Time Awareness.} Comparing agents' time allocation (\fref{fig:figure C3 (time awareness - allocation)}) and overall performance (\fref{fig:figure C4 (time awareness - performance)}) between the maximum $30$ and $50$ available turns discloses complex patterns in agents' temporal resource utilization. Contrary to intuitive expectations, extending available recovery time provides no guarantee for performance enhancement (\tref{tab:table C2 (Time Awareness)}), as increasing the maximum time limit from $30$ to $50$ turns shows diminishing returns on \textit{Llama-3.1-8B}'s success rates (\textit{Independent}: $-0.33\%$, \textit{Collaborative}: $-1.00\%$) while significant improvements on \textit{Llama-3.1-70B}'s $SR$ scores (\textit{Independent}: $+3.67\%$, \textit{Collaborative}: $+4.67\%$). The effectiveness of \textit{out-of-sync} recovery appears more dependent on LLM agents' technical capabilities and strategic time allocation than total available time. This can be substantiated by agents like \textit{Llama-3.1-70B} (\textit{Independent}: $88.68\%$ \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textit{Env interaction}}; \textit{Collaborative}: $100.00\%$ \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{assistance asking}} and $94.64\%$ \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textit{Env interaction}}) that strategically concentrate exploration in early stages (the first half of time) while postponing their \textcolor{fig2_ask}{solution proposal} to later phases.
\textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet} ($SR=33.70\%$) also supports this observation through allocating $93.62\%$ \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{assistance seeking}} turns in its first half of recovery time among its success cases. This emphasis on early-stage exploration proves more critical than the mere extension of available time.
In light of time allocation for different actions, extended recovery time notably encourages agents' \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textit{Env interaction}} choices with reduced \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{proactive assistance seeking}} and \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{solution proposal}} (\fref{fig:figure C3 (time awareness - allocation)}).
The negligible performance impact of this shift highlights both the importance of adaptive action distribution and agents' limitations in optimizing extended time usage for knowledge acquisition and recovery planning. 
% This counter-intuitive result suggests fundamental limitations in agents' ability to properly plan resource utilization and knowledge acquisition over extended timeframes, maintain and improve recovery performance with increased resources, as well as optimize action sequences for longer interaction periods.
The consistent impairing effects of increased time availability on advantageous collaborator assistance further underlines the significance of adaptive and strategic action planning in extended recovery journeys.

\textbf{Cost Sensitivity.} 
Our investigation of \textit{budget-cost} financial awareness reveals surprisingly low cost sensitivity among agents. Varying initial budgets between $\$1000$ and $\$3000$ (\tref{tab:table C3 (Budget Awareness)} \& \fref{fig:figure C5 (cost awareness - performance)}), where $\$3000$ enables limitless action taking across $30$ turns of recovery, produces minimal performance differences ($\leq +1.67\%$ on $SR$), suggesting agents' scarce sensitivity to effective financial management.
Similarly, halving or doubling the cost of \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{proactively seeking collaborator assistance}} ($\$50$, $\$100$, $\$200$) results in trivial changes to both \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{assistance-seeking}} behaviors (\textit{time allocation difference}$\leq 0.26\%$, \fref{fig:figure C7 (cost awareness - allocation)}) and overall recovery performance ($\leq 2.00\%$ on $SR$, \tref{tab:table C4 (Cost Awareness)} and \fref{fig:figure C5 (cost awareness - performance)}). This consistent cost insensitivity among LLM agents indicates fundamental limitations in their abilities to strategically estimate and adaptively plan resource utilization.

% As shown in  Figures \ref{fig:figure C5 (cost awareness - performance)}-\ref{fig:figure C7 (cost awareness - allocation)}, not only do budget variations (from $\$1000$ to $\$3000$) produce minimal strategy adjustments and performance changes ($-\Delta_{\textit{\text{collaborator}}}<1.33\%$), but halving or doubling assistance costs (from $\$100$ to $\$50$ and $\$200$) also yields negligible behavioral changes (\Sref{Section: Resource Awareness}).



\textbf{Strategic Action Planning and Resource Efficiency.}
The sequence and timing of recovery actions significantly influence recovery progress (\Sref{Appendix C2: Temporal Dynamics of Recovery Actions}-\ref{Appendix:C.4 (Effective Assistance Seeking)}). While high-performing agents typically allocate $75\%-95\%$ of their time to codebase exploration and context understanding through \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textit{Env interaction}} and \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{proactive assistance seeking}} (\fref{fig:figure 7 (Time Allocation)}), successful recoveries prioritize early-stage codebase exploration (\fref{fig:figure C2 (recovery time allocation)}) that helps establish essential contextual understanding before attempting to \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{propose a solution}}. However, existing LLM agents' limited temporal and financial resource awareness (\fref{fig:figure C3 (time awareness - allocation)}, \fref{fig:figure C6 (budget awareness - allocation)}, \fref{fig:figure C7 (cost awareness - allocation)}) leave substantial room for future improvements in strategic action planning and resource-efficient collaborations.

These findings reveal that current LLM agents lack meaningful resource awareness (\Sref{Section: Resource Awareness}), with their performance primarily determined by underlying capabilities without strategic resource management. These limitations present significant opportunities for enhancing agents' resource-aware planning and decision-making in collaborative systems.



\subsection{Recovery Efficiency}
\label{Appendix: Recovery Efficiency}

Based on our efficiency evaluation metric (\eqref{Eq: Evaluation Metric 5 (Efficiency)}), we evaluate the recovery efficiency of different LLM agents in \tref{tab:table C1 (Appendix: Recovery Efficiency)} (under the standard experiment setting: $30$-turn maximum, with an initial budget of $\$1000$, along with the same $\$100$ action cost for both \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{solution proposal}} and \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{assistance seeking}}), where (1) \textit{time efficiency}, denoted as $Eff_{time} (\%)$, is calculated as the average percentage of time taken in all \textit{out-of-sync} tasks to the total $30$-turn available time, and (2) \textit{expense efficiency}, calculated as $Eff_{expense} (\%)$, is the percentage of the average financial expenditure among all recovery tasks.
As spending less time and costs leads to high-efficiency \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries, the actual recovery efficiency at both temporal and financial dimensions are \textbf{inversely} proportional to the calculated $Eff_{time}$ and $Eff_{expense}$ scores, respectively.

Our analysis of agents' \textit{out-of-sync} recovery efficiency also supports our previous observations and discussions (\Sref{Section: Resource Awareness} \& \Sref{Appendix:C.5 (Resource Awareness)}), providing insights for future development of resource-efficient collaborative systems.

\section{Interaction Examples}
\label{Appendix D: Interaction Examples}

\subsection{Instructions on \textit{Out-of-Sync} Recovery}
% (1) Independent
% (2) Collaborative

In both \textit{independent} and \textit{collaborative} recoveries, we instruct agents to complete the task by acknowledging the primary task objectives and interactive constraints.
For \textit{independent} agents, we emphasize in prompts the two available recovery actions: \textcolor{fig2_env}{\textit{Env exploration}} and \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{solution proposal}}.
As to \textit{collaborative} agents, the additional action of \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{proactively seeking collaborator assistance}} is further provided to support their recovery completion. 



% Basic instruction
\paragraph{Instruction Base.} The basic instruction prompt illuminates the primary task objectives and interactive constraints. 

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
SYSTEM: 
You are a helpful assistant.
**Task:** You are generating Python code for the Python repository `test_repo` at `{self.container_workspace}` to fix the initial execution error of `test_repo` given by the USER. Propose your solution to USER through message when you are ready, and the USER will evaluate both your textual solution answer and your revised `test_repo` to give you feedback. If the USER responses that your revised `test_repo` still failed USER's evaluation, you will continue to revise `test_repo` and provide your solution answer through message.
**Notice:**
Your task is to revise `test_repo` to fix the initial execution error, and you MUST complete this task on your own without asking for human help. To generate the correct code, you can ONLY interact with the interactive Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment using "<execute_ipython>" tag, and any other tools cannot be used.

...

**Important Rules:**
You CANNOT exit this task until the USER confirm that your revised `test_repo` have passed USER's evaluation.
You CANNOT evaluate your revised `test_repo` on your own and state that `test_repo` passes USER's evaluation and exit this task. Evaluation of your revised `test_repo` MUST be conducted by the USER after you choose "Option (b)" and provide your answer to the USER through message.
Please noted that it is very unwise to run all unit tests on your side even just for testing or ckecking because other code files in `test_repo` that are irrelevant to the error log provided by the USER may currently be under USER's revision and therefore cause unit test errors. However, your task is to fix ONLY the error given by the USER.
The Python virtual environment for this task has already been set up for you and you can find the virtual environment at `/workspace/test_venv`. To use this virtual environment, run `source /workspace/test_venv/bin/activate`.
Noted that the Python environment is well-prepared with all necessary dependencies installed, and therefore you CANNOT install any additional Python packages to assist your code revision.
ONLY when the user confirmed that your revised Python repository `test_repo` has successfully passed USER's evaluation can you end this task and run the following command to exit: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.
\end{verbatim}



% Independent
\paragraph{Independent Recovery.} Recovery instruction prompt for \textit{independent} agents explains in detail the foundational recovery action choices and functioning constraints as follows:

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
At each turn, you have two options (a) and (b):
    (a) Interact with the Python programming environment and receive corresponding output to assist your code revision.
    (b) Propose your solution, including (1) directly revising the responsible Python code of `test_repo` inside this Python repository at {self.container_workspace}, and (2) providing your textual solution answer that incorporates both the absoluate path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method by sending your answer to USER through message that adheres to the required format.
If you choose "Option (a) Interaction with the Python programming environment", you should provide your textual explanation and analysis of your interaction through message, including your textual explanation of both your execution command and the environment output, which should be enclosed using "<env>" tag, for example: <env> I used the command "ls" to locate the responsible Python code. </env>.
On the other hand, if you choose "Option (b) Provide your solution", you should:
    (1) Revise the responsible Python code of `test_repo` with proper indentation, which should be directly implemented inside the Python repository at `{self.container_workspace}`.
    (2) Provide the absolute path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method as your solution by sending your solution answer to USER through message, which MUST contain ONLY one line of the absolute path followed by another line of the function/method name without any other texts and be enclosed using "<text>" tag, for example: 
        <text> 
        /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
        inference_prepare
        </text>
    If you revised a method code, MUST provide ONLY the name of your revised method and MUST NOT provide the name of the Python class containing your revised method (\textit{e.g.,} `inference_prepare` is the name of your revised method, but NOT the Python class). If you modified more than one files or functions/methods, MUST write one line of the absolute Python file path followed by one function/method name for each two lines of your answer, for example:
        <text>
        /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
        inference_prepare
        /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
        inference_util
        </text>
Either you choose to `(a) Interact with the Python environment` or `(b) Propose your solution`, you MUST send a message to the USER to evaluate your solution and provide feedback.

...

In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing a solution` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` turns as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 turns to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 balance or reach the maximum 30-turn limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely.
\end{verbatim}



% Collaborative
\paragraph{Collaborative Recovery.} Recovery instruction prompt for \textit{collaborative} agents includes recovery choices for both \textit{independent} actions and \textit{collaborative} interactions. 

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
At each turn, you have three options (a), (b), and (c):
    (a) Interact with the Python programming environment and receive corresponding output to assist your code revision.
    (b) Propose your solution, including (1) directly revising the responsible Python code of `test_repo` inside this Python repository at {self.container_workspace}, and (2) providing your textual solution answer that incorporates both the absoluate path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method by sending your answer to USER through message that adheres to the required format.
    (c) Ask human a question and receive the corresponding answer to assist your code revision.
If you choose "Option (a) Interaction with the Python programming environment", you should provide your textual explanation and analysis of your interaction through message, including your textual explanation of both your execution command and the environment output, which should be enclosed using "<env>" tag, for example: <env> I used the command "ls" to locate the responsible Python code. </env>
If you choose "Option (b) Propose your solution", you should:
    (1) Revise the responsible Python code of `test_repo` with proper indentation, which should be directly implemented inside the Python repository at `{self.container_workspace}`.
    (2) Provide the absolute path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method as your solution by sending your solution answer to USER through message, which MUST contain ONLY one line of the absolute path followed by another line of the function/method name without any other texts and be enclosed using "<text>" tag, for example: 
        <text> 
        /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
        inference_prepare
        </text>
    If you revised a method code, MUST provide ONLY the name of your revised method and MUST NOT provide the name of the Python class containing your revised method (\textit{e.g.,} `inference_prepare` is the name of your revised method, but NOT the Python class). If you modified more than one files or functions/methods, MUST write one line of the absolute Python file path followed by one function/method name for each two lines of your answer, for example: 
        <text>
        /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
        inference_prepare
        /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
        inference_util
        </text>
If you choose "Option (c) Ask for human assistance", you should provide your question through message, which should be enclosed using "<question>" tag and started with "[QUESTION]", for example: <question> [QUESTION] What programming languages are used in `test_repo`? </question>.
No matter which option you choose among (a) (b) and (c), you MUST send a message to the USER to evaluate your response and provide feedback.

...

In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing a solution` attempts costs $100, while each of your `(c) Asking for human's assistance` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` attempts as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 attempts to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 budget or reach the maximum 30-attempt limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely.
**Tips** Try `(c) Ask for human assistance` at any turns! This can definitely help accelerate your progress of proposing a correct solution and complete your task!
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{Resource Awareness}

To notify agents their resource consumption and conditions, we incorporate \textit{resource awareness} into our task instructions and collaborator responses to help establish agents' awareness of resources.

For task instruction, we emphasize at the very end the resource constrains for current \textit{out-of-sync} recovery task:

For \textit{independent} agents:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing a solution` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` turns as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 turns to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 balance or reach the maximum 30-turn limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely.
\end{verbatim}

For \textit{collaborative} agents:
\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing a solution` attempts costs $100, while each of your `(c) Asking for human's assistance` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` attempts as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 attempts to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 budget or reach the maximum 30-attempt limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely.
\end{verbatim}

In collaborators' responses, the remaining balance of current task is specifically displayed at the very beginning to remind agents of their resource consumption.
For example, after two \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{solution proposal}} attempts without success, an \textit{independent} agent would receive:

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
[Balance: $800 Left] Your revised `test_repo` still failed USER's evaluation test.
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{USER Prompt}
User inputs provide agents with important task-specific information, including initial budget and codebase execution error.
The relevant locations and names of potential responsible functions are also implied in the provided error log, while the exact \textit{out-of-sync} function of the current task requires the agent's exploration to effectively identify the root causes and accurately localize its relative path.

Here is a user prompt example for the \textit{out-of-sync} recovery task on \textit{Callee - psf / requests} dataset:

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]

\subsection{Reasoning for \textit{Out-of-Sync} Recovery}
% - agent thoughts
% - agent solutions

Agents' successful recoveries from their \textit{out-of-sync} states depend heavily on their reasoning effectiveness, particularly how efficiently they gather information and how well they understand and utilize it.
By examining both their thought patterns and solution implementations throughout their \textit{out-of-sync} recovery journeys, we analyze their reasoning process in detail.
It is evident in two key areas: (1) their \textbf{\textit{exploratory thinking}} while interacting with the \textit{Env} or collaborators, showing how they plan interactions and analyze problems; and (2) their \textbf{\textit{reflective thinking}} about failed solutions, demonstrating their progressive reasoning toward recovery success.

The following example showcases an agent's thoughts on \textit{out-of-sync} causes, reasoning through \textcolor{fig2_ask}{\textit{seeking collaborator assistance}} and \textcolor{fig2_code}{\textit{developing recovery solutions}}, while its misinterpretation of collaborator responses (\textit{e.g.,} collaborator suggests no missing imports) leads to its ultimate recovery failure.

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
...
========== TURN 17 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
I've found the `test_applycli_docbin` test starting at line 797. Let me check the test implementation and the imports at the top of the file. The error message indicates that `get_data_path` is missing from the imports. This function is likely needed for the test cases.
Let me ask a question to get more information: ...
========== TURN 18 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
...
Thank you for the information. Now I can fix the missing import. I'll add `get_data_path` to the imports from `spacy.util`
...
========== TURN 19 ==========
Now that I've added the missing import, I should propose my solution since I've fixed the import error:
<text>
/workspace/test_repo/spacy/tests/test_cli.py
test_applycli_docbin
</text>
==========
...
\end{verbatim}

The following reasoning thoughts are extracted from a successful \textit{out-of-sync} recovery, which illuminates coherent reasoning process through combining high-quality queries and \textit{Env} exploration to gather information of significance and reasoning about potential solutions towards \textit{out-of-sync} recovery success:

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
...
========== TURN 1 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
Let me start by examining the test file that's showing errors.
========== TURN 2 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
Let me scroll down to find the relevant test case that's failing.
========== TURN 3 ==========
...
========== TURN 10 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
Let me continue scrolling to find the failing test case about certificate bundles.
========== TURN 11 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
I found the failing test case `test_env_cert_bundles`. Let me ask a question to better understand the issue.
...
========== TURN 12 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
I understand the issue now. The test is failing because it's trying to use a pytest fixture `mocker` but it's not properly set up. Let me check the test file to see where this fixture should be defined.
========== TURN 13 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
...
I see the issue. The test is using pytest's `mocker` fixture but it's not installed. Let me check if pytest-mock is installed.
========== TURN 14 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
...
I see that pytest-mock is not installed. Let me modify the test file to use a different approach without relying on the mocker fixture.
========== TURN 15 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
...
Let me fix the syntax error in my edit.
========== TURN 16 ==========
AGENT THOUGHTS:
I've modified the test to use direct environment variable manipulation instead of mocking. Now let me propose this as the solution:
<text>
/workspace/test_repo/tests/test_requests.py
test_env_cert_bundles
</text>
==========

\subsection{LLMs as Know-Everything Collaborators}
\label{Appendix D: LLM-simulated Human Answerer}
% - Prompts with restrictions
% - Prompt examples

Leveraging LLMs as know-everything collaborators (\Sref{Section: LLM-simulated Collaborators}) to assist agents' \textit{out-of-sync} recoveries, we provide them with complete task-specific knowledge to establish the know-everything answerer for each \textit{out-of-sync} task.
As shown in the following prompting example, not only do we incorporate all necessary contextual information and ground-truth solution into the prompts, but we also define concrete restrictions on their response formation. 

\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
SYSTEM:
You are a helpful assistant. You are helping the USER to provide question answering assistance to USER's students.
**Grading Context:**
In the Python repository `test_repo` locating at `/workspace/test_repo`, there is an out-of-sync function `assert_format` (denoted as `original_code`) in the Python file `util.py` locating at `/workspace/test_repo/tests/util.py`.
This out-of-sync `original_code` of the function `assert_format` is as follows: `original_code`=
```
def assert_format(
    source: str,
    expected: str,
    mode: black.Mode = DEFAULT_MODE,
    *,
    fast: bool = False,
    minimum_version: Optional[Tuple[int, int]] = None,
) -> None:
    """Convenience function to check that Black formats as expected.
    
    You can pass @minimum_version if you're passing code with newer syntax to guard safety guards so they don't just crash with a SyntaxError. Please note this is separate from TargetVerson Mode configuration.
    """
    actual = black.format_str(source, mode=mode)
    _assert_format_equal(expected, actual)
    # It's not useful to run safety checks if we're expecting no changes anyway. The
    # assertion right above will raise if reality does actually make changes. This just
    # avoids wasted CPU cycles.
    if not fast and source != expected:
    # Unfortunately the AST equivalence check relies on the built-in ast module
    # being able to parse the code being formatted. This doesn't always work out
    # when checking modern code on older versions.
    if minimum_version is None or sys.version_info >= minimum_version:
        black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)
        black.assert_stable(source, actual, mode=mode)
```
This `original_code` is out-of-sync because the Python repository `test_repo` has been updated except the function `assert_format` still remains as the old-version `original_code`. Therefore, running unit test on the updated `test_repo` that contains this out-of-sync `original_code` reports the following error (denoted as `initial_execution_error`): `initial_execution_error`=

**Two Questions for Students:** Running unit test on the Python repository `test_repo` (here the updated `test_repo` that contains the out-of-sync `original_code` is provided to students) reports the following error (here `initial_execution_error` is provided to students). Students are asked to: (1) localize the responsible function/method code that caused this error, and provide your answer of both the Python file path of the responsible function/method code and the name of the responsible function/method code, and (2) revise the responsible function/method code you just localized to fix `initial_execution_error`.

**Question Answering Assistance:** To help students better answer these two questions, each student is allowed to ask you a question. However, your answer to each student's question has following restrictions:
(1) You CAN ONLY answer the specific piece of information asked by the student, and CANNOT include any other information NOT asked by the student.
(2) You CANNOT provide any misleading information if you are unsure of its correctness.

**TO DO:** Please answer each student's question provided by the user.

**Important: ** MUST give ONLY your answer as your response. MUST NOT give any other things like rhetorical questions, question analysis, enclosure symbols, etc.

\section{\textit{Out-of-Sync} Recovery Examples}

\subsection{Success Cases}

\textbf{(1) \textit{Independent} Recovery Success}

Here is an interaction example of a successful \textit{independent} \textit{out-of-sync} recovery completion on \textit{explosion/spaCy}, performed by \textit{Claude-3.5-Sonnet}:

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
SYSTEM:
You are a helpful assistant.
**Task:** You are generating Python code for the Python repository `test_repo` at `/workspace/test_repo` to fix the initial execution error of `test_repo` given by the USER. Propose your solution to USER through message when you are ready, and the USER will evaluate both your textual solution answer and your revised `test_repo` to give you feedback. If the USER responses that your revised `test_repo` still failed USER's evaluation, you will continue to revise `test_repo` and provide your solution answer through message.
**Notice:**
Your task is to revise `test_repo` to fix the initial execution error, and you MUST complete this task on your own without asking for human help. To generate the correct code, you can ONLY interact with the interactive Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment using "<execute_ipython>" tag, and any other tools cannot be used. 
At each turn, you have two options (a) and (b):
    (a) Interact with the Python programming environment and receive corresponding output to assist your code revision.
    (b) Propose your solution, including (1) directly revising the responsible Python code of `test_repo` inside this Python repository at /workspace/test_repo, and (2) providing your textual solution answer that incorporates both the absoluate path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method by sending your answer to USER through message that adheres to the required format.
If you choose "Option (a) Interaction with the Python programming environment", you should provide your textual explanation and analysis of your interaction through message, including your textual explanation of both your execution command and the environment output, which should be enclosed using "<env>" tag, for example: <env> I used the command "ls" to locate the responsible Python code. </env>
On the other hand, if you choose "Option (b) Provide your solution", you should:
    (1) Revise the responsible Python code of `test_repo` with proper indentation, which should be directly implemented inside the Python repository at `/workspace/test_repo`.
    (2) Provide the absolute path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method as your solution by sending your solution answer to USER through message, which MUST contain ONLY one line of the absolute path followed by another line of the function/method name without any other texts and be enclosed using "<text>" tag, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare </text>. If you revised a method code, MUST provide ONLY the name of your revised method and MUST NOT provide the name of the Python class containing your revised method (\textit{e.g.,} `inference_prepare` is the name of your revised method, but NOT the Python class). If you modified more than one files or functions/methods, MUST write one line of the absolute Python file path followed by one function/method name for each two lines of your answer, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare
/workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_util </text>.
Either you choose to `(a) Interact with the Python environment` or `(b) Propose your solution`, you MUST send a message to the USER to evaluate your solution and provide feedback.
**Important Rules** 
You CANNOT exit this task until the USER confirm that your revised `test_repo` have passed USER's evaluation.
You CANNOT evaluate your revised `test_repo` on your own and state that `test_repo` passes USER's evaluation and exit this task. Evaluation of your revised `test_repo` MUST be conducted by the USER after you choose "Option (b)" and provide your answer to the USER through message.
Please noted that it is very unwise to run all unit tests on your side even just for testing or ckecking because other code files in `test_repo` that are irrelevant to the error log provided by the USER may currently be under USER's revision and therefore cause unit test errors. However, your task is to fix ONLY the error given by the USER.
Python virtual environment for this task has already been set up for you and you can find the virtual environment at `/workspace/test_venv`. To use this virtual environment, run `source /workspace/test_venv/bin/activate`.
Noted that the Python environment is well-prepared with all necessary dependencies installed, and therefore you CANNOT install any additional Python packages to assist your code revision.
ONLY when the user confirmed that your revised Python repository `test_repo` has successfully passed USER's evaluation can you end this task and run the following command to exit: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.
**Important Notice** In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing solution` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` attempts as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 attempts to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 budget or reach the maximum 30-attempt limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely.

[Thought]
I found the issue. In the `ensure_path` function in `/workspace/test_repo/spacy/util.py`, there's a reference to `basestring_` which is not defined. This variable should be defined before being used. Let me fix this by adding the definition of `basestring_` at the beginning of the file.

========== TURN 5 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[MessageAction]
I have fixed the issue by adding the definition of `basestring_` as a string type for Python 3 compatibility. Here's my solution:

<text>
/workspace/test_repo/spacy/util.py
ensure_path
</text>

The fix adds the line `basestring_ = str` at the beginning of the file to define the missing `basestring_` variable that was causing the ImportError. This is a common Python 2 to Python 3 compatibility fix, as `basestring` was removed in Python 3 and we now use `str` instead.

ASSISTANT:
[MessageAction]
Let me check the full error message again to make sure we're addressing the right issue. Since we've modified the `ensure_path` function to handle both `str` and `bytes` types, and there are no other references to `basestring_` in the codebase, let me propose my solution:

<text>
/workspace/test_repo/spacy/util.py
ensure_path
</text>

I have modified the `ensure_path` function to use Python 3's type checking with `isinstance(path, (str, bytes))` instead of the Python 2 `basestring_`. This change maintains compatibility with both string and bytes objects while using modern Python type checking. The function now properly handles path-like objects, strings, and bytes objects.

\textbf{(2) \textbf{Collaborative} Recovery Success}

Here is an interaction example of a successful \textit{collaborative} \textit{out-of-sync} recovery completion on \textit{scrapy/scrapy}, performed by \textit{GPT-4o}:

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
SYSTEM:
You are a helpful assistant.
**Task:** You are generating Python code for the Python repository `test_repo` at `/workspace/test_repo` to fix the initial execution error of `test_repo` given by the USER. Propose your solution to USER through message when you are ready, and the USER will evaluate both your textual solution answer and your revised `test_repo` to give you feedback. If the USER responses that your revised `test_repo` still failed USER's evaluation, you will continue to revise `test_repo` and provide your solution answer through message.
**Notice:**
Your task is to revise `test_repo` to fix the initial execution error, and you may ask for human help. To generate the correct code, you can ONLY interact with the interactive Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment using "<execute_ipython>" tag, and any other tools cannot be used. 
At each turn, you have two options (a) and (b):
    (a) Interact with the Python programming environment and receive corresponding output to assist your code revision.
    (b) Propose your solution, including (1) directly revising the responsible Python code of `test_repo` inside this Python repository at /workspace/test_repo, and (2) providing your textual solution answer that incorporates both the absoluate path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method by sending your answer to USER through message that adheres to the required format.
    (c) Ask human a question and receive the corresponding answer to assist your code revision.
If you choose "Option (a) Interaction with the Python programming environment", you should provide your textual explanation and analysis of your interaction through message, including your textual explanation of both your execution command and the environment output, which should be enclosed using "<env>" tag, for example: <env> I used the command "ls" to locate the responsible Python code. </env>
If you choose "Option (b) Propose your solution", you should:
    (1) Revise the responsible Python code of `test_repo` with proper indentation, which should be directly implemented inside the Python repository at `/workspace/test_repo`.
    (2) Provide the absolute path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method as your solution by sending your solution answer to USER through message, which MUST contain ONLY one line of the absolute path followed by another line of the function/method name without any other texts and be enclosed using "<text>" tag, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py

If you revised a method code, MUST provide ONLY the name of your revised method and MUST NOT provide the name of the Python class containing your revised method (\textit{e.g.,} `inference_prepare` is the name of your revised method, but NOT the Python class). If you modified more than one files or functions/methods, MUST write one line of the absolute Python file path followed by one function/method name for each two lines of your answer, for example: 
<text>
/workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare
/workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_util
</text>.
If you choose "Option (c) Ask for human assistance", you should provide your question through message, which should be enclosed using "<question>" tag and started with "[QUESTION]", for example: <question> [QUESTION] Which function or method is responsible for the initial execution error, and what is its absolute path? </question>.
No matter which option you choose among (a) (b) and (c), you MUST send a message to the USER to evaluate your response and provide feedback.
**Important Rules** 
You CANNOT exit this task until the USER confirm that your revised `test_repo` have passed USER's evaluation.
You CANNOT evaluate your revised `test_repo` on your own and state that `test_repo` passes USER's evaluation and exit this task. Evaluation of your revised `test_repo` MUST be conducted by the USER after you choose "Option (b)" and provide your answer to the USER through message.

**Important Notice** In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing solution` attempts costs $100, while each of your `(c) Asking for human assistance` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` attempts as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 attempts to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 budget or reach the maximum 30-attempt limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely. 
**Tips** Try `(c) Ask for human assistance` at any turns! This can definitely help accelerate your progress of proposing a correct solution and complete your task!

Let's start by searching for the `urlparse_cached` function in the `test_repo` directory to determine if it is defined elsewhere or if it needs to be defined. This will help us understand where the function should be located or if it needs to be implemented.

========== TURN 3 ==========

The `urlparse_cached` function is defined in the file `/workspace/test_repo/scrapy/utils/httpobj.py` at line 18. It is also imported and used in various other files within the `test_repo` directory. The error in the initial execution log indicates that the function is not recognized in the file `/workspace/test_repo/scrapy/spidermiddlewares/referer.py`, which suggests that it might not have been imported there.
</env>

I will now check the file `/workspace/test_repo/scrapy/spidermiddlewares/referer.py` to see if the `urlparse_cached` function is imported. If it is not, I will add the necessary import statement. Let's open the file and inspect the imports.

========== TURN 10 ==========
ASSISTANCE:
[MessageAction]
<env>
The `potentially_trustworthy` method uses the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the URL. The import statement for `urlparse_cached` has been added, so the `NameError` should be resolved. However, the method also calls `self.tls_protected(r)`, which uses `urlparse` instead of `urlparse_cached`. This could be inconsistent if `urlparse_cached` is intended to be used throughout. I will update the `tls_protected` method to use `urlparse_cached` for consistency.

I will now update the `tls_protected` method to use `urlparse_cached` instead of `urlparse`. Let's proceed with this change.

I will open the file and review the implementation of `urlparse_cached`.

========== TURN 15 ==========

<env>
The `urlparse_cached` function is implemented to cache the result of `urlparse` for `Request` or `Response` objects. It uses a `WeakKeyDictionary` to store the parsed results, which allows the cache to be automatically cleaned up when the objects are no longer in use. The function appears to be implemented correctly for its intended purpose.
</env>

Given that the `urlparse_cached` function is implemented correctly, the issue might be related to how it is used or the objects being passed to it. Let's check the usage of `urlparse_cached` in the `potentially_trustworthy` method to ensure that the correct type of object is being passed. I will review the context around the `potentially_trustworthy` method to verify this.

If you choose "Option (a) Interaction with the Python programming environment", you should provide your textual explanation and analysis of your interaction through message, including your textual explanation of both your execution command and the environment output, which should be enclosed using "<env>" tag, for example: <env> I used the command "ls" to locate the responsible Python code. </env>
On the other hand, if you choose "Option (b) Provide your solution", you should:
    (1) Revise the responsible Python code of `test_repo` with proper indentation, which should be directly implemented inside the Python repository at `/workspace/test_repo`.
    (2) Provide the absolute path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method as your solution by sending your solution answer to USER through message, which MUST contain ONLY one line of the absolute path followed by another line of the function/method name without any other texts and be enclosed using "<text>" tag, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare </text>. If you revised a method code, MUST provide ONLY the name of your revised method and MUST NOT provide the name of the Python class containing your revised method (\textit{e.g.,} `inference_prepare` is the name of your revised method, but NOT the Python class). If you modified more than one files or functions/methods, MUST write one line of the absolute Python file path followed by one function/method name for each two lines of your answer, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare
/workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_util </text>.
Either you choose to `(a) Interact with the Python environment` or `(b) Propose your solution`, you MUST send a message to the USER to evaluate your solution and provide feedback.
**Important Rules** 
You CANNOT exit this task until the USER confirm that your revised `test_repo` have passed USER's evaluation.
You CANNOT evaluate your revised `test_repo` on your own and state that `test_repo` passes USER's evaluation and exit this task. Evaluation of your revised `test_repo` MUST be conducted by the USER after you choose "Option (b)" and provide your answer to the USER through message.
Please noted that it is very unwise to run all unit tests on your side even just for testing or ckecking because other code files in `test_repo` that are irrelevant to the error log provided by the USER may currently be under USER's revision and therefore cause unit test errors. However, your task is to fix ONLY the error given by the USER.
Python virtual environment for this task has already been set up for you and you can find the virtual environment at `/workspace/test_venv`. To use this virtual environment, run `source /workspace/test_venv/bin/activate`.
Noted that the Python environment is well-prepared with all necessary dependencies installed, and therefore you CANNOT install any additional Python packages to assist your code revision.
ONLY when the user confirmed that your revised Python repository `test_repo` has successfully passed USER's evaluation can you end this task and run the following command to exit: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.
**Important Notice** In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing solution` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` attempts as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 attempts to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 budget or reach the maximum 30-attempt limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely.

open_file('/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/writer.py', 1, 60)
[Thought]
Let me analyze the issue. The test failures are related to file generation in different formats (dot, puml, mmd, html). Looking at the error log and code, I notice that:

1. The test expects output files to be generated in the current directory
2. The test compares generated files with reference files in `/workspace/test_repo/tests/pyreverse/data/`
3. The DiagramWriter class is responsible for file generation

Let me check if there's an issue with the output directory configuration:

========== TURN 17 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[IPythonCode]
edit_file_by_replace(
    '/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/writer.py',

                file_name = os.path.join(self.config.output_directory, file_name)""",
    new_content="""            if self.config.output_directory:
                os.makedirs(self.config.output_directory, exist_ok=True)
                file_name = os.path.join(self.config.output_directory, file_name)"""
)
[Thought]
I found the issue. In the DiagramWriter class, there's a condition that only joins the output directory path if it exists:

```python
if os.path.exists(self.config.output_directory):
    file_name = os.path.join(self.config.output_directory, file_name)
```

This means if the output directory doesn't exist, it won't be created. Let me fix this by modifying the code to create the output directory if it doesn't exist:

========== TURN 18 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[MessageAction]
Now I'll provide my solution to fix the initial execution error. The issue was in the DiagramWriter class where it only used the output directory if it existed, but didn't create it if it didn't exist. I've modified the code to create the output directory if specified, which should fix the file generation issues in the tests.

Let me check if there's an issue with the dot command availability since the tests use graphviz.

========== TURN 20 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[IPythonCode]
open_file('/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/dot_printer.py')
[Thought]
Let me check if we need to handle the case when graphviz is not available. I'll look at the DotPrinter implementation again.

            os.rename(dot_sourcepath, outputfile)"""
)
[Thought]
I see the issue. The DotPrinter's generate method tries to run the `dot` command for non-dot/gv files, but we should only do that for image formats. Let me modify the code to fix this:

========== TURN 23 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[IPythonCode]
open_file('/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/printer_factory.py')
[Thought]
Let me check if we need to handle the file generation differently for different formats. Let me look at the printer factory again.

        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported output format: {filetype}")
    return filetype_to_printer[filetype]"""
)
[Thought]
I see the issue now. The DotPrinter is being used as a fallback for all formats, but it shouldn't be. Each format should have its own printer. Let me modify the printer factory:

========== TURN 25 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[IPythonCode]
open_file('/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/plantuml_printer.py')
[Thought]
Let me check the PlantUML printer implementation since we're having issues with puml files.

========== TURN 26 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[IPythonCode]
open_file('/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/printer.py')
[Thought]
I see the issue now. The PlantUML printer is missing the generate method, which means it's inheriting the generate method from DotPrinter through the Printer base class. Let me check the base Printer class.

========== TURN 27 ==========
ASSISTANT:
[IPythonCode]
edit_file_by_replace(
    '/workspace/test_repo/pylint/pyreverse/printer.py',

    new_content="""    @abstractmethod
    def generate(self, outputfile: str) -> None:
        """Generate and save the final outputfile.""""""
)
[Thought]
I see the issue now. The DotPrinter is overriding the base Printer's generate method with its own implementation that tries to use graphviz, but other printers like PlantUML, MermaidJS, and HTML are inheriting the base Printer's generate method. Let me fix this by making generate an abstract method and implementing it properly in each printer.

========== TURN 28 ==========

[IPythonCode]

    new_content='    @abstractmethod\n    def generate(self, outputfile: str) -> None:\n        """Generate and save the final outputfile."""'

[Thought]
Now that I've made generate an abstract method, I need to implement it in each printer class. Let me add the generate method to the PlantUML printer:

\textbf{(2) \textit{Collaborative} Recovery Failure}

Here is an interaction example of a failed \textit{collaborative} \textit{out-of-sync} recovery completion on \textit{mlflow/mlflow}, performed by \textit{DeepSeek}:

\begin{verbatim}[fontsize=\small, breaklines=true, breakanywhere=true]
SYSTEM:
You are a helpful assistant.
**Task:** You are generating Python code for the Python repository `test_repo` at `/workspace/test_repo` to fix the initial execution error of `test_repo` given by the USER. Propose your solution to USER through message when you are ready, and the USER will evaluate both your textual solution answer and your revised `test_repo` to give you feedback. If the USER responses that your revised `test_repo` still failed USER's evaluation, you will continue to revise `test_repo` and provide your solution answer through message.
**Notice:**
Your task is to revise `test_repo` to fix the initial execution error, and you may ask for human help. To generate the correct code, you can ONLY interact with the interactive Python (Jupyter Notebook) environment using "<execute_ipython>" tag, and any other tools cannot be used. 
At each turn, you have two options (a) and (b):
    (a) Interact with the Python programming environment and receive corresponding output to assist your code revision.
    (b) Propose your solution, including (1) directly revising the responsible Python code of `test_repo` inside this Python repository at /workspace/test_repo, and (2) providing your textual solution answer that incorporates both the absoluate path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method by sending your answer to USER through message that adheres to the required format.
    (c) Ask for human assistance and receive the corresponding answer to assist your code revision.
If you choose "Option (a) Interaction with the Python programming environment", you should provide your textual explanation and analysis of your interaction through message, including your textual explanation of both your execution command and the environment output, which should be enclosed using "<env>" tag, for example: <env> I used the command "ls" to locate the responsible Python code. </env>
If you choose "Option (b) Propose your solution", you should:
    (1) Revise the responsible Python code of `test_repo` with proper indentation, which should be directly implemented inside the Python repository at `/workspace/test_repo`.
    (2) Provide the absolute path of your revised Python file and the name of your revised function/method as your solution by sending your solution answer to USER through message, which MUST contain ONLY one line of the absolute path followed by another line of the function/method name without any other texts and be enclosed using "<text>" tag, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare </text>. If you revised a method code, MUST provide ONLY the name of your revised method and MUST NOT provide the name of the Python class containing your revised method (\textit{e.g.,} `inference_prepare` is the name of your revised method, but NOT the Python class). If you modified more than one files or functions/methods, MUST write one line of the absolute Python file path followed by one function/method name for each two lines of your answer, for example: <text> /workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_prepare
/workspace/test_repo/src/run_inference.py
inference_util </text>.
If you choose "Option (c) Ask for human assistance", you should provide your question through message, which should be enclosed using "<question>" tag and started with "[QUESTION]", for example: <question> [QUESTION] Which function or method is responsible for the initial execution error, and what is its absolute path? </question>.
No matter which option you choose among (a) (b) and (c), you MUST send a message to the USER to evaluate your response and provide feedback.
**Important Rules** 
You CANNOT exit this task until the USER confirm that your revised `test_repo` have passed USER's evaluation.
You CANNOT evaluate your revised `test_repo` on your own and state that `test_repo` passes USER's evaluation and exit this task. Evaluation of your revised `test_repo` MUST be conducted by the USER after you choose "Option (b)" and provide your answer to the USER through message.
Please noted that it is very unwise to run all unit tests on your side even just for testing or ckecking because other code files in `test_repo` that are irrelevant to the error log provided by the USER may currently be under USER's revision and therefore cause unit test errors. However, your task is to fix ONLY the error given by the USER.
Python virtual environment for this task has already been set up for you and you can find the virtual environment at `/workspace/test_venv`. To use this virtual environment, run `source /workspace/test_venv/bin/activate`.
Noted that the Python environment is well-prepared with all necessary dependencies installed, and therefore you CANNOT install any additional Python packages to assist your code revision.
ONLY when the user confirmed that your revised Python repository `test_repo` has successfully passed USER's evaluation can you end this task and run the following command to exit: <execute_bash> exit </execute_bash>.
**Important Notice** In the beginning, you have an initial budget of $1000. Before correctly propose a solution, each of your `(b) Proposing solution` attempts costs $100, while each of your `(c) Asking for human assistance` attempts costs $100. Meanwhile, although you may make as many `(a) Python environment interaction` attempts as you want at no cost, you have in total 30 attempts to complete this task. You will fail this task if you use up all your $1000 budget or reach the maximum 30-attempt limit without generating a correct `(b) Proposing a solution` response. Therefore, please arrange each of your actions wisely. 
**Tips** Try `(c) Ask for human assistance` at any turns! This can definitely help accelerate your progress of proposing a correct solution and complete your task!

Let's start by analyzing the error log provided by the USER. The error indicates that the test `test_update_mlflow_versions` is failing because the expected version string `"2.16.2"` does not match the actual version string `"2.16.2.dev0"`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the version string in the file `mlflow/version.py` is correctly formatted according to the expected version.

Let's first locate the file `mlflow/version.py` and check its content:

)
[Thought]
The file `mlflow/version.py` contains the version string `"2.16.1.dev0"`. The test expects this version to be updated to `"2.16.2"` without the `.dev0` suffix.

To fix this, we need to modify the `VERSION` string in `mlflow/version.py` to match the expected version `"2.16.2"`.

Let's update the file:

Given that the previous update to `mlflow/version.py` did not resolve the issue, let's investigate further. The error log indicates that the test `test_update_mlflow_versions` is failing for multiple cases, including `replace_js` and `replace_python`.

Let's check the content of the test file `tests/dev/test_update_mlflow_versions.py` to understand how the version strings are being updated and tested:

The test file `tests/dev/test_update_mlflow_versions.py` contains multiple test cases that check the version update functionality for different file types (Java, Java XML, JavaScript, Python, PyProject TOML, and R). The test cases use parametrized fixtures to ensure that the version strings are updated correctly.

The error log indicates that the version strings in the JavaScript and Python files are not being updated correctly. Specifically, the expected version `"2.16.2"` does not match the actual version `"2.16.2.dev0"`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the version update functions (`replace_js` and `replace_python`) correctly handle the version strings without adding the `.dev0` suffix.

Let's check the implementation of the `replace_python` function in the file `dev/update_mlflow_versions.py`:

[Thought]
The `replace_python` and `replace_js` functions in `dev/update_mlflow_versions.py` are responsible for updating the version strings in Python and JavaScript files, respectively. The issue seems to be that these functions are not correctly handling the version strings, leading to the `.dev0` suffix being added.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the `replace_python` and `replace_js` functions correctly update the version strings without adding the `.dev0` suffix.

Let's modify the `replace_python` and `replace_js` functions to handle the version strings correctly:

[Thought]
Given that the previous updates to the `replace_python` and `replace_js` functions did not resolve the issue, let's take a closer look at the `replace_dev_or_rc_suffix_with` function, which is used to handle the version suffixes.

The `replace_dev_or_rc_suffix_with` function currently removes the `.dev0` suffix if it exists. However, the test expects the version to be updated to `"2.16.2"` without any suffix.

Let's modify the `replace_dev_or_rc_suffix_with` function to ensure that it correctly handles the version strings without adding any suffix:
