\begin{abstract}
Model-based clustering techniques have been widely applied to various application areas, while most studies focus on canonical mixtures with unique component distribution form. However, this strict assumption is often hard to satisfy. In this paper, we consider the more flexible Copula-Based Mixture Models (CBMMs) for clustering, which allow heterogeneous component distributions composed by flexible choices of marginal and copula forms. \blueC{More specifically, we propose an adaptation of the Generalized Iterative Conditional Estimation (GICE) algorithm to identify the CBMMs in an unsupervised manner, where the marginal and copula forms and their parameters are estimated iteratively.}

GICE is adapted from its original version developed for switching Markov model identification with the choice of realization time. Our CBMM-GICE clustering method is then tested on synthetic \blueC{two-cluster} data \blueCN{(N=2000 samples)} with discussion of the factors impacting its convergence. Finally, \blueC{it is compared to the Expectation Maximization identified mixture models with unique component form \blueCN{on the entire} MNIST database \greenC{(N=70000)}, and on real cardiac \blueCN{magnetic resonance} data \blueCN{(N=276)} to illustrate its \blueCN{value for imaging applications}.}

Nothing to disclose.

\paragraph{Code and data availability}

The code and a demo on synthetic data corresponding to the experiments in Section \ref{sec:Experimentation on synthetic data} will be made publicly available upon acceptance.
The experiments in Section \ref{subsec:MNIST} were based on data from the public MNIST database \cite{Lecun:1998}.
The experiments in Section \ref{subsec:Application to subgroup clustering for myocardial infarct} were based on real data from the private HIBISCUS-STEMI study (ClinicalTrials ID: NCT03070496), and cannot be directly shared. However, infarct segmentations are part of the ``M1'' and ``M12'' images of the MYOSAIQ segmentation challenge dataset\footnote{\url{https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/myosaiq/}}, whose access may be provided upon request and agreement from the challenge organizers.
