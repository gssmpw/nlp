\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduced the Dual-Pathway Adapter (DP-Adapter), a module that improves both identity preservation and text consistency in personalized human image generation. By separating the visual and textual influences into different pathways, the DP-Adapter reduces the interference that often affects existing methods. Through extensive experiments and diverse applications, we demonstrated that DP-Adapter not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quality and consistency but also provides a versatile and robust tool for personalized human image generation. The DP-Adapter faces limitations in handling corner cases where textual prompts require certain artistic styles. Future work will focus on extending the approach to general subject-driven synthesis and handling a broader range of challenging scenarios.
