\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduced APIKS, a modular platform based on a service-oriented architecture for early-stage automated driving systems development and testing. Utilizing the ROS2 middleware, APIKS integrates key functions in sensing, perception, planning, and control, enabling rapid prototyping and allowing developers to iterate quickly without the complexity of full-scale systems. Its modular design and software-defined features provide flexibility, making it advantageous over existing simulation and SDK platforms. APIKS adheres to industry standards like ISO/TR 4804 and was demonstrated in a construction zone assist scenario, highlighting its capability to manage complex, dynamic environments. Future work will expand its operational domain, incorporate other automated functionalities, and add driver monitoring capabilities by integrating the driver into the system, further supporting the development of safe and reliable automated driving systems.
