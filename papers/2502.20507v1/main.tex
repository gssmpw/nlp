\begin{abstract}
%Autonomous vehicles (AVs), central to software-defined vehicles, could revolutionize transportation, but developing software that handles complex real-world environments is challenging. Comprehensive testing and validation are essential, yet existing simulation tools often lack integrated, end-to-end testing capabilities for rapid prototyping, focusing instead on specific functions. Platforms like Apollo and Autoware are robust but too complex for quick early-stage iteration. To address these challenges, we introduce the Automotive Platform at IKS (APIKS), a modular ROS2-based framework for efficient testing and validation of AV software within software-defined vehicles. APIKS provides a simplified architecture for small proofs of concept, enabling rapid prototyping without the overhead of comprehensive platforms. Its modular, software-centric design lets developers focus on specific components, streamlining testing. APIKS accelerates development and bridges the gap between specialized simulators and comprehensive platforms, offering a versatile testing framework for autonomous vehicle research and development.

Automated driving technologies promise substantial improvements in transportation safety, efficiency, and accessibility. However, ensuring the reliability and safety of Autonomous Vehicles in complex, real-world environments remains a significant challenge, particularly during the early stages of software development. Existing software development environments and simulation platforms often either focus narrowly on specific functions or are too complex, hindering the rapid prototyping of small proofs of concept. To address this challenge, we have developed the APIKS automotive platform, a modular framework based on ROS2. APIKS is designed for the efficient testing and validation of autonomous vehicle software within software-defined vehicles. It offers a simplified, standards-based architecture designed specifically for small-scale proofs of concept. This enables rapid prototyping without the overhead associated with comprehensive platforms. We demonstrate the capabilities of APIKS through an exemplary use case involving a Construction Zone Assist system, illustrating its effectiveness in facilitating the development and testing of autonomous vehicle functionalities.

%In this paper, we introduce the Automotive Platform at IKS (APIKS), a modular framework based on ROS2 middleware, designed to facilitate efficient testing and validation of AV software. APIKS offers a simplified architecture tailored for rapid prototyping without the overhead associated with full-scale deployment platforms. By aligning with industry standards, including the ISO/TR 4804 safety guidelines, APIKS ensures adherence to best practices in safety and reliability. We demonstrate the capabilities of APIKS through applications such as Construction Zone Assist, illustrating its effectiveness in enabling safe and effective autonomous vehicle operations in complex environments. Our contributions include presenting APIKS, demonstrating its alignment with industry safety standards, and showcasing its potential in practical applications. APIKS provides a reliable and standardized foundation for AV development, streamlining the development process and enabling faster iteration of new ideas.
