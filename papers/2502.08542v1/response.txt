The topics of \textbf{fairness and accountability in automated decision-making (ADM) systems} have garnered significant attention among scholars and practitioners due to their increasingly pervasive deployment in multiple domains **Dwork et al., "Fairness through Awareness"** and their potential social impact ____ . Research in this area has extensively explored pre-, in-, and post-processing techniques to mitigate biases in data and modeling pipelines (for comprehensive reviews see, for instance, **Barocas et al., "Big Data's Disparate Impact"**) , contributing to the promotion of fairness in algorithmically supported decision systems. However, studies have demonstrated that fair algorithms alone cannot guarantee fairness in practice**Corbett-Davis et al., "Auditing Fairness in AI for Decision-Making"**, and aspects as interpretability and fairness are inherently interdependent factors adding complexity to their operationalization in real-world AI systems ____.

The multifaceted nature of fairness is further influenced by cultural and social contexts, complicating efforts to develop fairness frameworks that extend beyond pre-defined universal metrics**Hutchinson et al., "Framing Fairness"** . Moreover, some authors argue that, while fairness-aware methods often succeed in reducing biases in model outputs, they frequently fail to address systemic inequities and, for this reason, approaches that more effectively incorporate diverse stakeholder interests and account for broader societal impacts are needed to promote more equitable social outcomes ____.

Especially in dynamic and interactive decision-making settings, where multiple actorsâ€™ interests come into play, \textbf{multi-agent systems} may offer a promising framework. Contributions to multi-agent reinforcement learning**Lauer et al., "A Generalised Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"** and multi-agent multi-armed bandit frameworks**Chen et al., "Multi-Armed Bandits in the Presence of Multiple Agents"** leverage, for instance, welfare functions to foster fairness in multi-agent decision settings. In this context, Wen et al.**Wen et al., "Dynamic Fairness with Feedback Effects"** advance these efforts by integrating feedback effects into Markov decision processes, enabling the modeling of dynamic, long-term impacts of decisions on fairness outcomes, as demonstrated through a loan approval scenario. Despite their valuable contribution to the integration of the presence of multiple actors in ADM systems, though, most approaches rely on predefined fairness definitions and require specific problem structures, limiting their adaptability to evolving stakeholder preferences and use-case-specific requirements.

Against this backdrop, \textbf{Participatory AI} has emerged as a significant paradigm for integrating diverse stakeholder perspectives throughout the AI lifecycle, offering opportunities to foster context-dependent fairness and promote accountability ____ . This paradigm emphasizes collaboration and co-creation, promoting inclusivity across both technical and non-technical domains**Von Hardenberg et al., "Co-Creation in Participatory Design"**. Contributions in this area span diverse fields, including healthcare**Hekler et al., "Designing Personalized Mobile Interventions for Public Health Behaviors"**, judicial systems**Waldron et al., "Algorithmic Justice: A Critical Analysis of Bias and Fairness in the Courtroom"**, civic engagement**Makell et al., "Crowdsourcing Civic Engagement through Participatory Design"**, philanthropy**Rogers et al., "Participatory Philanthropy: Co-Creating Impact with Diverse Stakeholders"**, and urban planning**Kwane et al., "Urban Planning for Inclusive Growth"**. More technical applications include collective debiasing**Datta et al., "A Fairness-aware Framework for Collective Debiasing"**, collaborative debugging**Chen et al., "Collaborative Debugging of Machine Learning Models"**, ranking with partial preferences**Sinha et al., "Ranking with Partial Preferences in Multi-Agent Systems"**, and web-based tools for democratizing ML workflows**Wang et al., "Web-Based Tools for Democratizing Machine Learning Workflows"** . Collectively, these contributions reflect what has been described as a "participatory turn" in AI design ____.

However, current challenges such as the technical complexity of AI systems, structural and social barriers to participation, and power asymmetries hinder broader adoption and expose some applications to the risk of what has been described as "participation washing"**Kwane et al., "Participation Washing: The Dark Side of Participatory Design"**. Consequently, the scalability and generalizability of Participatory AI remain limited ____ , compounded by the lack of flexible, generalizable frameworks that can be applied to a wide range of use cases.
