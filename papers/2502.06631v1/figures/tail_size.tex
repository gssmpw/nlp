    \caption{We show quantiles for three levels (0.9, 0.95 and 0.975) of the test samples conformal sets sizes distributions as a function of the temperature used to generate soft labels. The value of the quantile corresponding to the temperature estimated following the approach illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:temp_selection} is shown with a red dot, while the value obtained from testing samples is shown with a green dot. When they overlap, only the estimate is shown.}
