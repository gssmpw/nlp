    \caption{We show that results obtained with other architectures (ViT-L/14, ViT-B/32, ResNet101 and ResNet50) are coherent with the details provided for ViT-B/16. The tuned temperature is obtained according to the rule illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:temp_selection}, for $\alpha = 0.03$. The highest $10\%$ of set sizes are shown with the filled area.}
