\caption{We show the distribution of conformal sets sizes on three datasets (Kinetics400 with 400 classes, UCF101 with 101 classes and HMDB51 with 51 classes), averaged over 40 folds. The first row shows the distribution of sizes with the baseline, non-tuned temperature parameter. Although the number of classes can be greatly reduced, the distributions are typically long tailed. Comparatively, the second row depicts the results obtained with our temperature tuning strategy. For both rows, the 10\% highest set sizes are shown in the solid color area.}
