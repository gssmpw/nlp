\section{Related Work}
Kazakhstan is a multilingual and multiethnic country in Central Asia. %, with a population of approximately 19.8 million people as of 2025.
Kazakh is the state language, while Russian serves as the language of interethnic communication and is widely used in business, government, and education for historical and practical reasons.
As a result of this bilingual environment, code-switching between Kazakh and Russian is common. 
% , reflecting the dynamic interaction between the two languages. 
This unique linguistic landscape demands that LLMs must effectively and safely operate monolingually for Kazakh and Russian, but also multilingually over code-mixed content.
% where Kazakh continues to gain prominence despite the functional dominance of the Russian language, provides a compelling context for 


\paragraph{Monolingual and Multilingual LLM Safety Evaluation}
Previous research has focused primarily on safety within a single language, with most of the attention being on English. For example, the Do-Not-Answer dataset \cite{wang2023not} introduces a detailed risk taxonomy and evaluates LLMs exclusively in English. Expanding on this work, \citet{wang2024chinesedatasetevaluatingsafeguards} and \citet{ashraf2024arabicdatasetllmsafeguard} developed datasets tailored for Chinese and Arabic, respectively. % , while also conducting specific safety evaluations for these languages. 
% This research highlighted the importance of region-specific datasets and evaluations, as 
They highlight that risks and sensitivities vary across languages and cultures, motivating the need for localized safety benchmarks.
   
There have also been efforts to develop multilingual benchmarks. The XSafety dataset~\cite{wang2023all} contains prompts in 10 languages across 14 categories, and % The findings reveal a marked disparity: 
reveals that models consistently produce more unsafe responses for non-English queries than English ones. This underscores the critical need for building more robust safeguards for languages beyond English. %, ensuring safety alignment across diverse languages.
Despite its comprehensiveness, XSafety consists of relatively-short prompts that are not fully localized, potentially limiting its effectiveness in evaluating safety mechanism in region- and culture-specific contexts. This is particularly pronounced in languages with significant cultural nuances, such as Russian and Kazakh. 
\citeauthor{song2024multilingualblendingllmsafety} demonstrated that safety mechanism bypass rates increase dramatically when multilingual prompts are used compared to monlingual inputs, further emphasizing the challenges of ensuring safety in multilingual settings.

Our work focuses on creating prompts specifically tailored for Kazakhstan, to evaluate LLM safety in Russian and Kazakh. 
% By incorporating culturally and regionally relevant content, our approach aims to provide a more nuanced and accurate assessment of model vulnerabilities in these languages. 
Region-specific localization enables us to better capture the risks and sensitivities inherent to Kazakhstan. %, ensuring a more robust evaluation of LLM safety in multilingual and culturally diverse contexts.


% \paragraph{Kaz and Ru Benchmarks}
\paragraph{Kazakh and Russian Benchmarks}
While there has been significant progress in developing datasets for Russian, the NLP landscape for Kazakh is sparse. For Russian, projects like MERA~\cite{MERA} have expanded the evaluation of LLMs by introducing datasets for ethical diagnostics and assessment of honesty, helpfulness, and harmfulness. GEST dataset \cite{ruGender} provides Russian translations for English prompts, offering a resource for evaluating bias and fairness, but without region-specific sensitization.

For Kazakh, the development of safety evaluation tools and datasets is under-explored. 
KazSAnDRA \cite{yeshpanov-varol-2024-kazsandra} focuses on sentiment analysis, and OMSystem \cite{article} collects Kazakhstan media sources for sentiment classification. %  provide valuable resources for analyzing language-specific challenges. 
\cite{maxutov-etal-2024-llms} includes diverse evaluation tasks, like question answering, causal reasoning, and machine translation, but lacks safety evaluation.

Our work builds on these efforts by introducing an public-domain dataset covering a broader range of safety risks. We also provide a nuanced and holistic evaluation framework for assessing LLM safety in Kazakh and Russian, filling a critical gap. % in existing benchmarks.
