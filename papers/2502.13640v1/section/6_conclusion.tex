\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce a new safety evaluation dataset for bilingual Kazakhstan with Russian and Kazakh languages, with over 8K prompts covering both general and region-specific safety risks. The dataset incorporates three question types (direct attacks, indirect attacks, and over-sensitivity assessments) and includes a novel code-switching subset reflecting Kazakhstan's bilingual context. We collect over 94K responses from 12 LLMs and evaluate their safety based on our fine-grained evaluation framework. Experiments show that while proprietary models generally outperform open-source alternatives, all models struggle significantly with region-specific content.
