\section*{Ethical Considerations}

We are aware that the data can be used as seeds for prompt attacks, and the prompts with region-specific sensitivity might be used for political propaganda. However, our prompt dataset and risk evaluation strategies are created to evaluate and improve the safety of LLMs and help LLMs develop immunity to similar attacks as included in this dataset. Therefore, we believe the value of dataset to the research and industrial community when utilized appropriately outweighs the potential for harm through misuse.
