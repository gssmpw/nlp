\section{Region-specific Sensitivity Analysis}
\tabref{tab:dist-safety-VI-risktype-qtype} shows the number of harmful responses for risk type VI region-specific sensitivity across three question types. The number of harmful question by indirect attack is the largest, followed by direct attack, and then the general questions with sensitive words, showing the same trend with \figref{fig:question-type} which presents the overall distribution for all risk types.

\section{Human Evaluation Analysis}
\tabref{tab:human-eval-question-type} shows the distribution of 366 human-evaluated responses over 17 harm types for three types of questions.
\figref{fig:human-eval-cm} shows GPT-4 evaluation confusion matrix for binary harmfulness detection and responding pattern distinction (six-class classification). 
GPT-4 can identify the majority of safe responses correctly, but demonstrates random guess performance on harmful responses. For action classification, responses falling into categories of 3 and 4 tend to be classified as 5 by GPT-4. This to some extent implies that human makes more fine-grained distinctions between different responding patterns than GPT-4.
