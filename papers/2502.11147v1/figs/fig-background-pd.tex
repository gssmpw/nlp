\caption{The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of token lengths for the prefill (P, in dotted lines) and decode (D, in solid lines) phases for (a) five datasets from LongBench~\cite{yushi2024longbench} and (b) three math datasets running on the reasoning-enabled Marco-O1 model. (c) The breakdown of prefill and decode time during the inference of fixed 32k tokens using vLLM 0.6.1 with the LLaMA 3.1 8B model in FP16 precision. As the number of decode tokens increases (with the number of prefill tokens being 32k minus the decode tokens), the decode time (orange bars) rises significantly faster than the prefill time (blue bars).}
