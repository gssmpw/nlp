\caption{Comparison of sparsity-based algorithms. $N$ indicates the sequence length while $L$ indicates the cache budget where $L\ll N$. H2O's time and memory complexity are theoretical, as indicated by the asterisks. \algo\ addresses the ``impossible trinity'' by achieving $O(L)$ complexity for both time and memory, with accuracy comparable to Dense on reasoning tasks.}
