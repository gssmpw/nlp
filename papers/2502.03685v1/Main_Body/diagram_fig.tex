    \caption{Visualization of the proposed decoding algorithm, DAB. DAB alternates between sampling the response $Y$ and the bias $B$. To sample $B$ given $Y$, we use gradient-based discrete sampling on the constraint function $f$. To sample $Y$ given $B$, we compute a bias vector that penalizes words based on their distance to $B$ and then use this bias to guide the auto-regressive generation.
