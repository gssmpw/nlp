In this section, we introduce DAB: \textbf{D}iscrete \textbf{A}uto-regressive \textbf{B}iasing. 
First, we present the formulation of the target distribution as a joint distribution and explain the motivation behind this approach. Next, we describe how our algorithm samples from the joint distribution by alternating between biased auto-regressive generation and discrete gradient-based sampling. We finally demonstrate that gradient-based discrete sampling enables our algorithm to have more thorough, stable, and efficient sampling when compared to continuous methods.
