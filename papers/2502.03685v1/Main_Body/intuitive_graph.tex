    \caption{Visualization of our proposed controlled decoding algorithm, Discrete Auto-Regressive Biasing (DAB). Given an initial response that fails to satisfy some external constraint, DAB steers auto-regressive generation towards satisfactory generations using discrete bias tokens obtained via gradient-based discrete sampling from the constraint function.
