\textbf{Experiment Design} Similar to the sentiment control experiment, we use an internal classifier to guide generation towards less toxic models. 
We use a RoBERTa classifier fine-tuned on the Jigsaw toxic comment dataset, following \citet{kumar2022gradient, liu2023bolt}. 


\textbf{External Constraint} We represent the external constraint by a RoBERTa model with GPT-2 large embeddings that was fine-tuned on the Jigsaw dataset, following the same training protocol as used in \citet{liu2023bolt}. The final classifier achieves an accuracy of $94\%$ on the hold-out dataset.  

\paragraph{Examples} In Table \ref{appendix:tab:detox-gens} we show examples of generations for the various samplers we examine.
