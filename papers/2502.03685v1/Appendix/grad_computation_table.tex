\caption{Comparison between the operations involved in backpropogation for both BOLT and DAB. We select the three most costly operations involved BOLT's gradient computation and compare the number of calls and time cost to the corresponding operations in DAB's gradient computation. As visible, BOLT's gradient computation involves many more repeated operations than DABs, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed DAB algorithm.}
