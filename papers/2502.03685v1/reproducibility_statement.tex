In order to ensure the reproducibility of our work, we include the details necessary to replicate both the core algorithms and the experiments. 
We include the psuedo-code for our algorithm in \ref{alg:text-gen}; information on hyper-parameter settings in Appendix \ref{appndx:ablation}l and further details on each experiment in Appendix \ref{appndx:senti-details}, \ref{appndx:toxicity-details}, \ref{appndx:keywords-details}. Additionally, we include the code-base used to produce our results at the following repository: \url{https://github.com/patrickpynadath1/dab}.
