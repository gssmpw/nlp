\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce DataMan, a comprehensive data manager capable of quality rating and domain recognition, developed to facilitate the pre-training data selection and mixing. 
By using DataMan to annotate pre-training datasets and sampling data based on quality ratings while balancing domain diversity, our trained models demonstrate significant improvements in language modeling, task generalization, and instruction following. Through extensive experiments, we provide valuable insights for the community studying the relationship between data and large language models.
