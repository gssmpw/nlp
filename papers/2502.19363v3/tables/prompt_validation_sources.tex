For each quality criterion, we collected a set of documents initially rated by an independent panel and divided them into two sets of ten documents each—high-rated and low-rated—to
ensure a distinct quality gap. We used this data for prompt tuning and to validate the agreement between the prompt uses and human preferences. This table describes the sources of the documents.
