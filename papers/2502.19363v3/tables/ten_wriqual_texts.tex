1 & \texttt{Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait, except the stray inexpressible few, that made him worth while. His father, an ineffectual, inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica, grew wealthy at thirty through the death of two elder brothers, successful Chicago brokers, and in the first flush of feeling that the world was his, went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O'Hara. In consequence, Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height of ...} & accuracy: 5 coherence: 4 language\_consistency: 5 semantic\_density: 4 knowledge\_novelty: 2 topic\_focus: 5 creativity: 4 professionalism: 3 style\_consistency: 5 grammatical\_diversity: 4 structural\_standardization: 3 originality: 5 sensitivity: 5 overall\_score: 4 domain: culture \\

2 & \texttt{Technologies for making and manipulating DNA have enabled advances in biology ever since the discovery of the DNA double helix. But introducing site-specific modifications in the genomes of cells and organisms remained elusive. Early approaches relied on the principle of site-specific recognition of DNA sequences by oligonucleotides, small molecules, or self-splicing introns. More recently, the site-directed zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) using the principle of site-specific ...} & accuracy: 5 coherence: 5 language\_consistency: 5 semantic\_density: 5 knowledge\_novelty: 4 topic\_focus: 5 creativity: 3 professionalism: 5 style\_consistency: 5 grammatical\_diversity: 5 structural\_standardization: 4 originality: 5 sensitivity: 5 overall\_score: 5 domain: technology \\

3 & \texttt{The winter of 1906-07 was the coldest in Alberta's history and was exacerbated by a shortage of coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907, the Canada West Coal and Coke Company locked out the miners from its mine near Taber. The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the Crow's Nest Pass, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread until by April ...}  & accuracy: 5 coherence: 5 language\_consistency: 5 semantic\_density: 5 knowledge\_novelty: 3 topic\_focus: 5 creativity: 3 professionalism: 4 style\_consistency: 5 grammatical\_diversity: 4 structural\_standardization: 4 originality: 5 sensitivity: 5 overall\_score: 4 domain: other \\

In my opinion it gets all the attention it gets for being one of, or the best movies ever. One of the best things The Godfather does is its incredible casting and its iconic performances from each and every one of its characters. The actors are so convincing that it won the movie several academy awards. It also jumpstarted several actors, acting careers, and gave an ...}  & accuracy: 4 coherence: 4 language\_consistency: 5 semantic\_density: 4 knowledge\_novelty: 3 topic\_focus: 5 creativity: 4 professionalism: 3 style\_consistency: 4 grammatical\_diversity: 4 structural\_standardization: 3 originality: 5 sensitivity: 5 overall\_score: 4 domain: entertainment \\

For example, we ordered some maki and nigiri and while it was good, it wasn't that much better than our fave sushi places.   Instead, come here for their signature dishes and you'll probably be happier. We really enjoyed some of their signature dishes.
