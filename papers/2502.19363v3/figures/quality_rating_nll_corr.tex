    \caption{Correlations of quality ratings and negative log-likelihood scores by Llama-2-7B \citep{touvron2023llama2} over 30B tokens training documents. The negative log-likelihoods are averaged over the number of tokens, and are the logarithm of the perplexity score of a single sequence. We observe that perplexity scores are not good approximations for any quality criteria.}
