    \caption{We plot the relationship between perplexity and in-context learning (ICL) performance for all models across 10 downstream tasks, as shown in Tables \ref{tab:val_ppl_results} and \ref{tab:icl_results}, along with the Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. The misalignment between perplexity and ICL is most pronounced in the LogiQA and MMLU tasks, we guess, possibly due to domain mismatch and ICL task complexity.}
