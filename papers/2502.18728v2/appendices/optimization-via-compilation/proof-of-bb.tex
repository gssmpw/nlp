\subsection{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:soundness of bb}}
\label{appendix:soundness of bb proof}

For MEU, we first prove a Lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:soundness helper}
  Let $(\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w)$ be a BBIR for MEU,
  and let $P$ be a partial policy over $A$. Then 
  let $(a,b) = ub((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w), \varphi \land \gamma, P)$,
  $\ell = lb((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w), \gamma, P)_{\Pr}$, and
  $u = ub((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w), \gamma, P)_{\Pr}$.
  Then if $\ell, u \neq 0$, for all total extensions $T \supsetneq P$ 
  we have
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{\AMC(\varphi\land \gamma|_T, w)}{\AMC(\gamma|_T, w)_{\Pr}}
    \sqsubseteq \paren{\frac a \ell, \frac b \ell}\sqcup \paren{\frac a u, \frac b u}.
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The proof follows from applications of
  Theorem~\ref{thm:ub correctness} and its dual for $lb$.
  Let $(u,v) = \AMC(\varphi\land \gamma|_T, w)$ and $k=\AMC(\gamma|_T, w)_{\Pr}$.
  We have that 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:lemma soundness eq 1}
    (u,v) = \AMC((\varphi\land \gamma)|_T, w) \sqsubseteq
    ub((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w), \varphi \land \gamma, P)
  \end{equation}
  and 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:lemma soundness eq 2}
    lb((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w), \gamma, P)
    \sqsubseteq (k, \_) = \AMC(\gamma|_T, w)
    \sqsubseteq ub((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w), \gamma, P).
  \end{equation}
  From Equation~\ref{eq:lemma soundness eq 2}
  we know that $\ell \leq \AMC(\gamma|_T, w)_{\Pr} \leq u$.
  We know that $\ell$ and $u$ are within $(0,1]$ as they are 
  computing probabilities~\citep{darwiche2002knowledge}.

  We want to show that $u/k \leq \max(a/\ell, a/u)$ and 
  $v/k \leq \max(b/\ell, b/u)$. The former follows from
  Equation~\ref{eq:lemma soundness eq 2}. The latter requires casework on $b$:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item If $b$ is nonnegative, then $v/k \leq b/\ell$ and we are done,
    \item if $b$ is negative, then $k \leq u$. Then  $1/k \geq 1/u$
    and thus $b/k \leq b/u$. Then since $v \leq b$ by Equation~\ref{eq:lemma soundness eq 1}
    we have $v/k \leq b/u$ as desired.
  \end{itemize}

\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:soundness of bb}]
  It suffices to prove that the optimal policy is never pruned. 
  That is, let $T_{\MEU}$ be the total model witnessing 
  $\mathrm{MEU}((\{\varphi, \gamma\}, A, w))$. 
  We claim that $T_{\MEU} = P_{curr}$ at some recursive call of $bb$. 

  Suppose $T_{\MEU}$ is pruned on Line~\ref{line:prune}. Then, 
  there exists a partial policy $P' \subset T_{MSP}$ 
  such that 
  the join $m$ as calculated on Line~\ref{line:join} has
  $m \sqsubseteq b$ for some $b$. 

  By Lemma~\ref{lemma:ub on total policy is amc},
  $b = \AMC(\varphi|_T,w)$ for some total model $T$. 
  Then we have that:
  \begin{align*}
    \AMC( \varphi|_{T_{MSP}},w) 
      &\sqsubseteq m & \text{(by Lemma~\ref{lemma:soundness helper})} \\ 
      & \sqsubseteq \AMC( \varphi|_T , w) & \text{by assumption}.
  \end{align*}
  By compatibility we have that
  \begin{equation*}
    \AMC(\varphi|_{T_{MSP}}) \leq \AMC( \varphi|_T,w).
  \end{equation*}
  If the two sides are equal that means that 
  $MSP(\varphi)$ has multiple witnesses, 
  thus the branch was never pruned. 
  Otherwise, $b > MSP(\varphi)$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}

For MMAP, we defer the proof of correctness to~\citet{huang2006solving}.
