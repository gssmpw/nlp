____ also studied the non-strongly observable feedback graph case.

The cross-learning bandit problem was proposed by ____ to solve bidding-in-auctions problem. ____ inspired a line of work to study different settings of the bidding-in-auctions problem____. In all these scenarios, the cross learning structure is an essential component of the analysis. ____ solved a particularly technically challenging case. ____ considered the case with adversarial losses and stochastic contexts and proved that the minimax regret in this case is $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{KT})$. ____ extended the result of ____ to the high probability case.

The cross-Learning contextual bandits with graphical feedback problem was proposed by____. ____ showed that for adversarial contexts it is impossible to achieve $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\alpha T})$ regret. ____ also gave a $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\min(\alpha MT,KT)})$ regret bound for stochastic losses and stochastic contexts. Later, ____ further studied this problem for stochastic losses and adversarial contexts and gave a more precise characterization of the regret shape.
