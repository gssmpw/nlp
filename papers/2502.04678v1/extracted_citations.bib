  abstract = 	 {We study high-probability regret bounds for adversarial $K$-armed bandits with time-varying feedback graphs over $T$ rounds. For general strongly observable graphs, we develop an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}((\sum_{t=1}^T\alpha_t)^{\frac{1}{2}}+\max_{t\in[T]}\alpha_t)$ with high probability, where $\alpha_t$ is the independence number of the feedback graph at round $t$. Compared to the best existing result (Neu, 15) which only considers graphs with self-loops for all nodes, our result not only holds more generally, but importantly also removes any $\text{poly}(K)$ dependence that can be prohibitively large for applications such as contextual bandits. Furthermore, we also develop the first algorithm that achieves the optimal high-probability regret bound for weakly observable graphs, which even improves the best expected regret bound of (Alon et al., 2015) by removing the $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{KT})$ term with a refined analysis. Our algorithms are based on the online mirror descent framework, but importantly with an innovative combination of several techniques. Notably, while earlier works use optimistic biased loss estimators for achieving high-probability bounds, we find it important to use a pessimistic one for nodes without self-loop in a strongly observable graph.}

  abstract = 	 {We study the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with the graph-based feedback structure introduced by Mannor and Shamir. We analyze the performance of the two most prominent stochastic bandit algorithms, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), in the graph-based feedback setting. We show that these algorithms achieve  regret guarantees that combine the graph structure and the gaps between the means of the arm distributions. Surprisingly this holds despite the fact that these algorithms do not explicitly use the graph structure to select arms; they observe the additional feedback but do not explore based on it. Towards this result we introduce a <em>layering technique</em> highlighting the commonalities in the two algorithms.}
