\begin{abstract}
    Jailbreak attacks, where harmful prompts bypass generative models’ built-in safety, raise serious concerns about model vulnerability. While many defense methods have been proposed, the trade-offs between safety and helpfulness, and their application to  Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), are not well understood. This paper systematically examines jailbreak defenses by reframing the standard generation task as a binary classification problem to assess model refusal tendencies for both harmful and benign queries. We identify two key defense mechanisms: \textit{safety shift}, which increases refusal rates across all queries, and \textit{harmfulness discrimination}, which improves the model’s ability to differentiate between harmful and benign inputs. Using these mechanisms, we develop two ensemble defense strategies—inter-mechanism and intra-mechanism ensembles—to balance safety and helpfulness. Experiments on the MM-SafetyBench and MOSSBench datasets with LLaVA-1.5 models show that these strategies effectively improve model safety or optimize the trade-off between safety and helpfulness.
