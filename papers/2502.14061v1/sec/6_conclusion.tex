\section{Conclusion}
We presented a fast and scalable pose estimator, dynamically adjusting to custom needs of estimation quality versus inference times trade-offs.
To that end, we proposed 40 candidate architectures which aim to otimize the trade-off between inference time and 6D object pose estimation accuracy based on GDRNPP, which were curated by choosing promising backbones and identifying beneficial architectural changes to the Geo Head part of the GDRNPP architecture.
Additionally, we proposed the AMIS algorithm, a tool designed to quantitatively identify model architectures that represent sweet spots which effectively address the challenges posed by the diverse scales of precision and time across various datasets. 
In our comparison with GDRNPP, we demonstrate the candidates selected by the AMIS algorithm exhibit an outstanding inference time and progressively enhancing model accuracy for a wide variety of inference time budgets.\\
Future directions might include temporal trajectory composition of different frequencies for long-horizon tasks, policy composition methods on large-scale datasets, and policy distillation from composed policies.
For further research, there are some potential areas of improvement: adopting end-to-end methods that integrate detection or segmentation and exploring other lightweight methods like teacher-student models.
