\section{APPENDIX: INTERVIEW SCRIPTS FOR FORMATIVE STUDY}
\label{sec:appendixa}
We begin with a brief introduction of our research and study procedure.

\textbf{Background}

(1) Could you please tell me your years of practice, department, and specialization? 

(2) How many patients do you see each year? How many of them have mental health symptoms? How do you handle them (maybe they don’t need to refer)?

\textbf{A Recent Experience}

(1) Can you think of a recent time when you had a young concussion patient (11-17 years old) and thought they might have mental health issues? How did you find out?

\textbf{Information Collection and Monitoring}

(1) (If not mentioned in the previous question) For that patient in your story, before the final referral, what symptom-related information makes you think it might be a mental health issue? How did you deal with it?

(2) (If they mention any at-home symptoms) What kind of symptom-related information do you find helpful when patients are resting at home (smartwatch and smart speaker)? (If not mentioned) Do you need any at-home symptoms? (e.g.,  patients' mental status or sleep patterns at home ) 

(3) (If not mentioned) How do their parents get involved in this process? 

\textbf{Challenges and Workaround Strategies}

(1) What challenges do you have when it comes to collecting symptom-related information from patients, managing that information, or making mental health decisions (e.g., further mental health testing or referring to a mental health expert)?

\textbf{Technology (Expectations and Concerns)}

(1) Do you use any existing tools or features in EHR (e.g., EPIC) in the youth patients' mental health decision-making? If so, what are they, and how do you like them?

\section{APPENDIX: INTERVIEW SCRIPTS FOR EVALUATION STUDY}
\label{sec:appendixb}

(1) This section (Fig.1) shows the probability of mental health sequelae within the next 15 days with a range from 0\% to 100\%, where the higher probability score signifies a higher probability of experiencing mental health sequelae. Feature importance scores show the contributing factors to the probability. The risk score chart below shows the risk scores for the past ten days, today, and the next 15 days. We’d love your comments. What do you think about it? What other information or visualization would you like to see?

(2) (Less familiar, need extra emphasis) In this section, we will use a smart speaker to have conversations with patients. The conversation history is shown on the right. On the left is the symptom overview section. If patient-reported symptoms toward a particular category, the dot for that category will change from green to red as a highlight for your review. You can click on the category name or use the search bar to type in keywords,  then the corresponding conversation content will be shown on the right. What do you think about it? What other information or visualization would you like to see?

(3) (More familiar, need less time) The data in this section is collected from patients' smartwatches. You can click on other data buttons to view corresponding recorded data in detail. What do you think about it? What other information or visualization would you like to see?

(4) Above these three sections, what other information would you need to help make mental health decisions?

\textbf{Closing Question}
(1) Is there anything else you’d like to share or a final question to ask us? Let us know or reach out via follow-up email.
