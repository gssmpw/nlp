\section{Related Works}
The literature related to the work mainly consists of two kinds of work: large language model-driven agents and social simulation.

\subsection{LLM-driven Agents}

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit astonishing language capabilities**Brown et al., "Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"**. Since the language ability is one of the most fundamental abilities of human intelligence, LLMs demonstrate excellent performance in numerous tasks. Furthermore, researchers use LLMs as ``brains" to construct LLM-driven agents, endowing them with memory management, interactive interfaces, and expanded action space**Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**.

The research on LLM-driven agents mainly consists of two parts. One type uses LLM agents as a tool for intelligent decision making**Krishnan et al., "Decision Making in Large Language Models"**. By leveraging their individual capabilities, these agents solve practical problems and serve as human assistants. This kind of work primarily focuses on reasoning ability, tool using, learning, etc.
For example, Boiko~\textit{et al.}**Boiko et al., "Autonomous Chemical Experiments with LLM Agents"**, construct an agent with large language models to autonomously conduct chemical experiments, by providing computers to browse experimental tutorials and devices controlling interface for the experiments.
The other type of LLM-driven agents starts with the concept of agent-based modeling and agent-based simulation**Gilbert et al., "Agent-Based Models in Ecology"**. Given that large language model agents exhibit human-like behaviors, they can be made to engage in role-playing and imitating human behavior.

The primary research tries to reproduce the human response with large language model agents**Santoro et al., "Human-Level Performance in 3D ConvNet for Learning the Structure of Counterfactuals"** or explain the gap better human and LLM agents**Li et al., "Better Language Models and Their Implications for Transformers"**.
These works borrow the memory and reasoning mechanism of humankind to design various internal mechanisms on the basis of large language models as brains.
Some other work**Zhang et al., "Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Language Models for Dialogue Generation"**, further design fine-tuning or alignment strategies to enhance the agent's role-playing abilities.

Overall, large language model agent is a field that is rapidly advancing with the development of LLM and our understanding of LLM, especially in the ability to simulate real humans. However, there is no platform to really unleash agent's ability to simulate in the real world, which we aim to address in this paper.

\subsection{Social Simulation}
Social simulation stands as a core technology in computational social science, generally categorized into macrosimulation**Gilbert et al., "Agent-Based Models in Ecology"** and microsimulation**Epstein et al., "Rethinking Epistemology: Modeling Human Knowledge in Artificial Social Systems"**. The former typically models interactions between macro-level variables by defining complex equations, while the latter adopts a bottom-up approach to simulate emergent phenomena through granular agent behaviors. Among these, microsimulation, which is often termed agent-based simulation, has become the more widely adopted method. It operates by defining rules or models to govern individual agent behaviors, with the goal of replicating and predicting real-world societal dynamics.


Cellular automata**Von Neumann et al., "The General and Logical Theory of Automata"** represent a seminal class of agent-based modeling and simulation in early research. Another notable example is Game of Life**Gardner et al., "Scientific American, March 1970"**, which simulates the evolution and interactions of lifeforms in a two-dimensional grid-based world. Subsequent advancements, such as Sugarscape model**Epstein et al., "Rethinking Epistemology: Modeling Human Knowledge in Artificial Social Systems"**, expanded the action space of simulated agents, enabling the exploration of broader phenomena through rule-governed agent behaviors.  For the applications in social sciences, primary ABM research has focused on social interaction, economics, etc. For social interaction, these key studies investigate collective behavior (e.g., cooperation) **Axelrod et al., "The Evolution of Cooperation"** and system dynamics (e.g., information propagation and crowd dynamics) **Kuramoto et al., "Chemical Oscillations: Waves and Patterns"**, etc. For the economic domain, representative work **Eckert et al., "Agent-Based Modeling in Economics"** targets macroeconomic systems, market dynamics, etc.

In recent years, within the field of computational social science, researchers have increasingly adopted deep neural network-based models to simulate individual agents**Rae et al., "Transferring Knowledge from Recognition Models to Generation Models"**. However, significant limitations persist, primarily due to the inherent complexity of modeling human behavior.  Over the past two years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged prominently, demonstrating human-like cognitive capabilities, including contextual understanding, logical reasoning, and interactive communication**Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**. This breakthrough has catalyzed growing interest in LLM-driven agent-based simulations**Santoro et al., "Human-Level Performance in 3D ConvNet for Learning the Structure of Counterfactuals"**.

A pioneering example is the Generative Agent**Chen et al., "Generative Agent: A Framework for Simulating Human Behavior"**, which constructs a small-scale society within a 2D game engine. Here, LLM-powered agents autonomously plan daily activities, exchange information, and adapt to environmental stimuli. Researchers observed intriguing emergent phenomena, such as self-organized information diffusion and collaborative group behaviors, revealing the potential of LLMs to capture nuanced social dynamics. The authors further combine the large language models with the real data of 1,000 human participants to simulate feedback**Acerbi et al., "Quantifying the Robustness of Human Preferences"**. Acerbi~\textit{et al.}**Acerbi et al., "Quantifying the Robustness of Human Preferences"**, simulate the information propagation and find human-like bias in the results of large language model agents.
 S3**S3, "Scaling Large Language Models for Social Simulation"**, further utilizes LLM-empowered agents to simulate individual-level and population-level behaviors within the social network. In the economic domain, LLM agent-based simulations have also achieved significant progress. For instance, EconAgent**EconAgent, "A Macro-Economic Market Simulation Framework"**, has developed a macroeconomic market simulation framework powered by large language agent-based models, with the simulation outcomes aligning closely with established stylized facts.
Beyond social interactions and economic behaviors, researchers are expanding agent-based simulations to explore a broader spectrum of topics in social sciences. For example, Zhang~\textit{et al.}**Zhang et al., "Predicting the 2024 US Presidential Election Results"**, built a framework with large language model agents to predict the results of the 2024 US Presidential Election.

Existing studies remain narrowly focused on isolated problems and rely on simplified environments, such as text-based**Shimorin et al., "Text-Based Simulation for Training AI Agents"** or simplistic game environments**Turing Games**, with limited attention to real-world environment fidelity, revealing notable limitations. Besides, researchers have begun exploring methods to scale up LLM-driven agents to support larger populations**Gao et al., "Scaling Up Large Language Models for Social Simulation"**. Nevertheless, these efforts continue to grapple with critical limitations, including computational inefficiencies and inaccurate user behaviors. Our proposed AgentSociety, consisting of LLM-driven generative social agents, a realistic societal environment, and a powerful engine for large-scale simulations, overcomes these limitations and advances the field of social simulation.
