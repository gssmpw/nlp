    \caption{Performance on ``near OOD'', ``far OOD'', and in-distribution classification as a function of the feature dimension. We projected the 768-dimensional ViT-B-16 features into lower dimensions using PCA, then projected into the eigenspace of the average within-class covariance. We compared the tied model (with full covariance) to the hierarchical model with full, diagonal, and coupled diagonal covariance and measured performance by area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC).}
