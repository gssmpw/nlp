    \caption{\textbf{A:} Diagonal of empirical covariance matrices,~$\mathrm{diag}(\hat{\Sigma}_k)$ for five randomly chosen clusters (colored lines) over dimensions. Compared to the diagonal of the average covariance matrix,~$\mathrm{diag}(\hat{\Sigma})$, individual clusters tend to have systematically larger or smaller variances than average.
    \textbf{B:} The correlation between dimensions of the deviation from the mean, $\hat{\Sigma}_k - \hat{\Sigma}$, of the diagonal components. The strong positive correlations between all but the first few dimensions indicates that the relationship observed in \textbf{A} is consistent across all clusters.}
