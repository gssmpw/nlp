    \caption{Synthetic experiments panel. Example sampled 2D dataset from DPMM with params $\nu_0=4$ (\textbf{A}) and $16$ (\textbf{B}). Each data set has $K=10$ clusters with $N_k=20$ training data points each (colored dots). We evaluate performance on classifying outliers (gray dots) drawn from the prior predictive distribution. \textbf{C:} Performance of DPMM models vs. RMDS when sweeping over $\nu_0$ with $N_k=20$ shows that DPMMs outperform when $\nu_0$ is small and there is greater variation in the $\Sigma_k$'s. \textbf{D:} Independent RMDS performance vs. DPMMs as a function of $N_k$ with $\nu_0=4$. Independent RMDS only performs well when there are adequate numbers of samples per class.}
