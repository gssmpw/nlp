\section{Conclusions and Limitations}
\label{sec.conclusion}
In this paper, we observed that different regions within an image require varying levels of refinement during the diffusion process, and that adjacent sampling steps exhibit significant continuity in the distribution of focused areas. Based on these observations, we proposed \ourmethod{}, a novel diffusion sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts sampling rates according to regional attention, thereby allocating computational resources more efficiently to areas of greater importance while reusing noise predictions for less critical regions. Our approach effectively reduces computational costs while preserving high image quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that \ourmethod{} achieves substantial speed-ups with minimal degradation in quality, outperforming uniform sampling baselines and paving the way for more efficient and adaptive diffusion models.
