\section{RELATED WORK}
\label{sec:relatedwork}
In this section, we describe the previous works related to our proposal, which are divided into two parts. In Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork_exoplanet}, we present a review of approaches based on machine learning techniques for the detection of planetary transit signals. Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork_attention} provides an account of the approaches based on attention mechanisms applied in Astronomy.\par

\subsection{Exoplanet detection}
\label{sec:relatedwork_exoplanet}
Machine learning methods have achieved great performance for the automatic selection of exoplanet transit signals. One of the earliest applications of machine learning is a model named Autovetter ____, which is a random forest (RF) model based on characteristics derived from Kepler pipeline statistics to classify exoplanet and false positive signals. Then, other studies emerged that also used supervised learning. ____ also used a RF, but unlike the work by ____, they used simulated light curves and a box least square ____-based periodogram to search for transiting exoplanets. ____ proposed a k-nearest neighbors model for Kepler data to determine if a given signal has similarity to known transits. Unsupervised learning techniques were also applied, such as self-organizing maps (SOM), proposed ____; which implements an architecture to segment similar light curves. In the same way, ____ developed a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, including RF and SOM models. In general, these approaches require a previous phase of feature engineering for each light curve. \par

%DL is a modern data-driven technology that automatically extracts characteristics, and that has been successful in classification problems from a variety of application domains. The architecture relies on several layers of NNs of simple interconnected units and uses layers to build increasingly complex and useful features by means of linear and non-linear transformation. This family of models is capable of generating increasingly high-level representations ____.

The application of DL for exoplanetary signal detection has evolved rapidly in recent years and has become very popular in planetary science.  ____ and ____ developed CNN-based algorithms that learn from synthetic data to search for exoplanets. Perhaps one of the most successful applications of the DL models in transit detection was that of ____; who, in collaboration with Google, proposed a CNN named AstroNet that recognizes exoplanet signals in real data from Kepler. AstroNet uses the training set of labelled TCEs from the Autovetter planet candidate catalog of Q1â€“Q17 data release 24 (DR24) of the Kepler mission ____. AstroNet analyses the data in two views: a ``global view'', and ``local view'' ____. \par


% The global view shows the characteristics of the light curve over an orbital period, and a local view shows the moment at occurring the transit in detail

%different = space-based

Based on AstroNet, researchers have modified the original AstroNet model to rank candidates from different surveys, specifically for Kepler and TESS missions. ____ developed a CNN trained on Kepler data, and included for the first time the information on the centroids, showing that the model improves performance considerably. Then, ____ and ____ also included the centroids information, but in addition, ____ included information of the stellar and transit parameters. Finally, ____ proposed a pipeline that includes a new ``half-phase'' view of the transit signal. This half-phase view represents a transit view with a different time and phase. The purpose of this view is to recover any possible secondary eclipse (the object hiding behind the disk of the primary star).


%last pipeline applies a procedure after the prediction of the model to obtain new candidates, this process is carried out through a series of steps that include the evaluation with Discovery and Validation of Exoplanets (DAVE) ____ that was adapted for the TESS telescope.\par

\subsection{Attention mechanisms in astronomy}
\label{sec:relatedwork_attention}
Despite the remarkable success of attention mechanisms in sequential data, few papers have exploited their advantages in astronomy. In particular, there are no models based on attention mechanisms for detecting planets. Below we present a summary of the main applications of this modeling approach to astronomy, based on two points of view; performance and interpretability of the model.\par
%Attention mechanisms have not yet been explored in all sub-areas of astronomy. However, recent works show a successful application of the mechanism.
%performance

The application of attention mechanisms has shown improvements in the performance of some regression and classification tasks compared to previous approaches. One of the first implementations of the attention mechanism was to find gravitational lenses proposed by ____. They designed 21 self-attention-based encoder models, where each model was trained separately with 18,000 simulated images, demonstrating that the model based on the Transformer has a better performance and uses fewer trainable parameters compared to CNN. A novel application was proposed by ____ for the morphological classification of galaxies, who used an architecture derived from the Transformer, named Vision Transformer (VIT) ____. ____ demonstrated competitive results compared to CNNs. Another application with successful results was proposed by ____; which first proposed a transformer-based framework for learning unsupervised representations of multivariate time series. Their methodology takes advantage of unlabeled data to train an encoder and extract dense vector representations of time series. Subsequently, they evaluate the model for regression and classification tasks, demonstrating better performance than other state-of-the-art supervised methods, even with data sets with limited samples.

%interpretation
Regarding the interpretability of the model, a recent contribution that analyses the attention maps was presented by ____, which explored the use of group-equivariant self-attention for radio astronomy classification. Compared to other approaches, this model analysed the attention maps of the predictions and showed that the mechanism extracts the brightest spots and jets of the radio source more clearly. This indicates that attention maps for prediction interpretation could help experts see patterns that the human eye often misses. \par

In the field of variable stars, ____ employed the mechanism for classifying multivariate time series in variable stars. And additionally, ____ showed that the activation weights are accommodated according to the variation in brightness of the star, achieving a more interpretable model. And finally, related to the TESS telescope, ____ proposed a model that removes the noise from the light curves through the distribution of attention weights. ____ showed that the use of the attention mechanism is excellent for removing noise and outliers in time series datasets compared with other approaches. In addition, the use of attention maps allowed them to show the representations learned from the model. \par

Recent attention mechanism approaches in astronomy demonstrate comparable results with earlier approaches, such as CNNs. At the same time, they offer interpretability of their results, which allows a post-prediction analysis. \par
