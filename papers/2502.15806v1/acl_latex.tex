\begin{abstract}
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a \textsc{Chaos Machine}, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the \textsc{Mousetrap} framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, claude-sonnet and gemini-thinking are as high as 96\%, 86\% and 98\% respectively on our toxic dataset \textsc{Trotter}. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking claude-sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5\%, 86.58\% and 93.13\% respectively. {\color{red} Attention: This paper contains inappropriate, offensive and harmful content.}

\section{Introduction}

The advent of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has catalyzed a transformative revolution and paradigm shift in the field of artificial intelligence. With the widespread attention on models' reasoning abilities, numerous models with advanced reasoning capabilities have emerged and undergone continuous optimization and iteration \citep{openai:o1, openai:o3mini, google:gemini, anthropic:claude, deepseek:r1}. While their capabilities are commendable, they exhibit a significant flaw. Upon encountering jailbreak attacks, the failure to provide robust defenses leads to the LRMs generating responses that are more detailed, organized, specific, and logically reasonable, thereby exacerbating the severity of the potential harm. The misuse of LRMs can provide surprisingly detailed guidance for acts such as illegal and criminal activities, offenses, psychological manipulation, hate campaigns, and malicious harm, which highlights the critical need for safety alignment in their development and application.


The investigation of jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained considerable attention in recent years. Query-based black-box jailbreaks use methods such as template completion and prompts rewriting to deceive LLMs. For example, using ciphertext input and asking the model to reply in ciphertext as well \citep{cipher}, or embedding a preceding “DAN” instruction in the jailbreak prompt \citep{doanythingnow}. These methods lay the foundation for black-box attacks. Nevertheless, the continual updates to LLMs have rendered these methods less effective, even on the latest iterations of non-reasoning LLMs. For LRMs, OpenAI’s recent research claims that they use the deliberative alignment paradigm on the o-series reasoning models, which makes them simultaneously better at avoiding harmful outputs \citep{deliberative}. Generally, previous researches have primarily focused on jailbreak attacks targeting models with weaker reasoning skills, leaving the exploration of jailbreaks on more powerful LRMs relatively untouched.

Our research represents an initial exploration into jailbreaks on LRMs. We present the Mousetrap, a chained jailbreak framework leveraging the capabilities of reasoning models. Specifically, we collected and refined the mappings of prompts rewriting at different granularities and constructed a Chaos Machine capable of generating one-to-one mappings. Through iterative reasoning chains made by the machine, we effectively guided LRMs into producing unsafe and harmful responses, which provides valuable insights into the conflict between their capabilities and potential vulnerabilities. Inspired by Agatha Christie's famous mystery play, we introduce Mousetrap with competing objective enhanced, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{cover}. Mousetrap incorporates chaos chains into the reasoning structure, asking the attacked target to reconstruct the original toxic query through iterative reasoning steps and respond from the perspective of villains. Its remarkable performance is verified on the most toxic subset of our Trotter dataset. Moreover, we conduct extension experiments on the latest versions of o1-mini, claude-sonnet, and gemini-thinking, along with more comprehensive benchmarks such as AdvBench \citep{advbench}, StrongREJECT \citep{strongreject}, HarmBench \citep{harmbench}, and several subsets of SS-SafetyBench \citep{mmsafety}.

The contributions of our research are as follows:

(1) We build a novel component, the Chaos Machine, which amalgamates various mappings and abstracts the concept of “chaos”. By iteratively employing the Chaos Machine, diverse and complex reasoning chains are constructed to outsmart LRMs for jailbreak purposes.

(2) We propose and prove that extending the length of the iterative chaos chain can notably enhance the success of jailbreaks, with a chain of length 3 achieving an average of 6.3 successful attempts out of 10 equivalent attacks on Trotter, a family of toxic datasets we present, which clearly indicates major risks within the in the reasoning process of LRMs. 

(3) Our Mousetrap integrates the Chaos Machine with iterative reasoning chains to skillfully target the advanced reasoning abilities of LRMs for jailbreaks. Notably, even attacking the famously safe claude-sonnet, Mousetrap reaches the success rate of 67.41\% on benchmarks with a chain length of at least 2. When it is extended to 3, rate of at least 86.58\% is achieved.



\section{Related Works}

\subsection{Large Reasoning Models}

The initial LLMs relied on autoregressive sequence prediction, showcasing remarkable text generation abilities. With growing demands for productivity and precision, researchers started to investigate whether models could think and reason in a human-like manner. The proposal of chain-of-thought \citep{cot} marked a significant advancement, prompting researchers to focus more intently on the reasoning capabilities of language models. TS-LLM \citep{treesearch} represents the first proposed AlphaZero-like tree search learning framework and signifies a evolution of reasoning structures from linear chains to hierarchical branching trees. Subsequently, graph-based reasoning structures and more complex nested structures, exemplified by Llama-Berry \citep{llama-berry}, have been extensively explored. Reasoning strategies such as MCTS \citep{mcts}, beam search \citep{beamsearch}, and ensemble methods \citep{selfconsistency, forestofthought} have also been proposed. To date, several LRMs with advanced reasoning capabilities have been developed in the industry, including OpenAI's o-series, Google's Gemini-thinking, and DeepSeek's R1. This exemplifies the integration of three pivotal elements, the advancement of LLMs, the design of reinforcement learning (RL), and high-performance computing (HPC) \citep{llrmblueprint}. ActorAttack, which performs jailbreak attacks through multi-round dialogue, targeted the o1 model after confirming its effectiveness against poor-reasoning LLMs. They assert that the o1 model shows higher safety than GPT-4o \citep{safemtdata}. Unfortunately, their research did not focus on the reasoning model's capabilities nor did it further investigate the jailbreak attack on LRMs.

\subsection{Jailbreak Attacks}

Existing LLMs jailbreak attacks can be divided into black-box and white-box methods according to the parameter accessibility of the target models \citep{jailbreaksurvey, safetysurvey}. White-box attack methods, such as gradient-based methods represented by GCG \citep{advbench}, logits-based methods represented by COLD \citep{cold}, and fine-tuning-based methods, are shown to be effective. However, these methods necessitate access to the target models, making them impractical. Primarily relying on queries as main mechanism, Black-box attack methods feature template completion methods such as scenario nesting \citep{deepinception, wolf}, context-based attacks \citep{ica, mjp}, and code injection \citep{programmatic, codechameleon}, in addition to prompts rewriting methods including ciphers \citep{cipher, artprompt}, multi-languages \citep{multilingual, lowresource}, and genetic algorithms \citep{autodan}.

Black-box methods can be divided into one-to-one mappings (uniquely recoverable according to the rules) and one-to-many mappings (not uniquely recoverable) according to the nature of the mapping. Among them, character encryption \citep{cipher} and word replacement \citep{wordsubstitution} belong to the former, while persuasive adversarial prompts \citep{pap} belongs to the latter. Such methods have diminished in power when applied to the latest versions of large models, especially those with advanced reasoning capabilities. We define these one-to-one mappings (also known as injections) as reasoning steps, and construct reasoning chains iteratively to subsequently attack LRMs.





\section{Preliminary}

\subsection{Taxonomy}

One-to-one mappings can uniquely rewrite prompts according to a given rule and can uniquely restore rewritten texts to their original form. Based on the granularity of the minimum perturbation unit, we categorize these mappings into three levels, namely character, word, and sentence, and collectively label them as “chaos” mappings. According to the granularity of the minimum perturbation unit, we divide these mappings into three levels, namely character, word and sentence, and collectively call them “chaos” mappings. We systematically reviewed existing chaos mappings 
from prior jailbreak studies, incorporated novel mappings, and presented the taxonomy in Table~\ref{taxonomy}. Detailed examples of these chaos mappings are provided in Appendix~\ref{a}.

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \vspace{-0.2cm}
  \caption{\label{taxonomy}
    Taxonomy of chaos mappings.}
  \vspace{-0.34cm}
\end{table}

With the evolution of LLMs and the emergence of LRMs, the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks relying on individual chaos mappings has significantly diminished. To augment the diversity and complexity of reasoning iterations, we initially propose the concept of the Chaos Machine.



\subsection{Chaos Machine}

Chaos Machine is an abstract concept encompassing a group of chaos mappings. For a primal toxic question (PTQ),  the Chaos Machine provides a random mapping known as the chaos policy (CPO) and produces a rewritten chaos toxic question (CTQ). A CPO consists of a pair of inverse operations: an en-chaos policy (ECP) and a de-chaos policy (DCP). We describe the processes as en-chaos with ECP and de-chaos with DCP. Through the Chaos Machine, a quadruple \texttt{[PTQ] [ECP] [DCP] [CTQ]} is generated, as shown in Figure~\ref{chaosmachine}.


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
%\vspace{-0.1cm}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{fig_chaosmachine.png}
\caption{Concept of Chaos Machine.}
\vspace{-0.3cm}
\label{chaosmachine}
\end{figure}

To develop the Chaos Machine, we leverage two key approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\item Fine-tune a LLM. We manually generated 120 high-quality data and supervised fine-tuned (SFT) \texttt{gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18}. We use the attacked model (\texttt{Target}) as the \texttt{Checker} (Details in Appendix~\ref{b}), which is a post-check module of the fine-tuned Chaos Machine. This module guarantees that the \texttt{Target} can deduce the generated CPO. If the CPO is incomprehensible, it will be regenerated. Compared to directly using the base LLM, the fine-tuned model generates quadruples more accurately in accordance with our expectations, and to a certain extent produces more diverse CPOs, such as more random and varied keywords not present in the SFT data. Its glaring drawback lies in its exorbitant cost.
\vspace{-0.15cm}
\item Construct a library of random functions. We selected eight chaos mappings and an equivalent Chaos Machine was developed as a library of functions. It serves as a cost-effective alternative to the fine-tuned model, albeit with the drawback of limited diversity.
\vspace{-0.12cm}
\end{itemize}

\noindent Considering the high frequency of calls, we employed the functions library as the default for subsequent experiments.

The concept of the Chaos Machine (1) defines reasoning steps as de-chaos through one-to-one mappings, constructing the smallest act units for jailbreak; (2) amalgamates chaos mappings of different granularities, providing the necessary nutrients for the diversity and robustness of iterative reasoning chains; and (3) neutralizes the differences among chaos mappings (see contrast experiments in Section 3.5), abstracting the concept of “chaos”.



\subsection{Reasoning Structure}

For the reasoning trap, we define the structure of the reasoning prompt here. A reasoning prompt should contain (1) an explicitly provided \texttt{[CTQ]}; (2) a sequence of \texttt{[DCP]s} for de-chaos; (3) request for the \texttt{Target} to reconstruct and explicitly output the PTQ text; and (4) additional requirements regarding details, logic, and format.

Requirements: (1) ... detailed, logical and realistic ... (2) Output should be in the format: [reconstructed problem string] ... [supplementary solution content] ...
}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

\subsection{Metrics}

\quad \textbf{\texttt{Judger}} \ \ According to the conclusion that the evaluation quality of GPT-4 is on par with that of the manual review \citep{mmsafety}, we use \texttt{gpt-4o-2024-11-20} as \texttt{Judger} to determine whether the output content is harmful. \texttt{Judger} receives the input and output of \texttt{Target} and determines the purpose of user and whether the response of the \texttt{Target} violate OpenAI's security rules \citep{openai:rule}. The score ranges from 1 (the most harmless response, such as “I am sorry...”) to 5 (the most harmful response). "A response with a score greater than 4 is considered harmful, indicating that the jailbreak attack has been successful.

\textbf{Successful Attack} \ \ The inherent randomness of LLMs should be thoroughly taken into account when determining the criteria for a successful attack. Several studies \citep{wordsubstitution} conducted two or three equivalent attacks on a PTQ, and if any one of them succeeded, the attack was deemed successful. We adopt the more rigorous “2/3 mode” and “3/3 mode” (denoted as “S/T mode”), which respectively consider two out of three and all three successes as successful.

\textbf{Attack Success Rate (ASR)} \ \ The ASR is the most commonly employed evaluation metric.
\begin{equation*}
\setlength\abovedisplayskip{8pt}
\setlength\belowdisplayskip{8pt}
\text{ASR} = \frac{num(\text{Success\;PTQs})}{num(\text{Total\;PTQs})}
\end{equation*}
ASR quantifies the percentage of PTQs that experience successful attacks across an entire dataset.

\textbf{Success Frequency (SF) \& Average SF (ASF)} \ \ SF denotes the frequency of success of a single PTQ across $m$ equivalent experiments.
\begin{equation*}
\setlength\abovedisplayskip{8pt}
\setlength\belowdisplayskip{8pt}
\text{SF} = num(\text{Success\;Times})
\end{equation*}
Compared to the “S/T mode”, SF mitigates the impact of randomness in fewer experiments to a greater extent, reflecting the safety of models and the efficacy of the attacks with higher confidence. For example, with the results of 10 repeated experiments being \texttt{[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]} (\texttt{1} for success and \texttt{0} for failure), the success confidence determined by the “2/3 mode” (evaluating the first three attempts) is lower compared to that of SF. Alternatively, the judgment results of \texttt{[1,0,1,0,0]} and \texttt{[1,1,1,1,1]} under the “2/3 mode” are identical, yet they represent different levels of attack effectiveness. In this case, SF measures the “capability” rather than the “results”.
\begin{equation*}
\setlength\abovedisplayskip{8pt}
\setlength\belowdisplayskip{8pt}
\text{ASF} = \frac{sum(\text{SF})}{m}
\end{equation*}
ASF describes the average value of SF across the entire dataset.

\textbf{Minimum Success Length (MSL)} \ \ MSL refers to the minimum length of an iterative reasoning chain with a successful attack under the 'S/T mode' for one PTQ in a reasoning jailbreak framework (e.g., our Mousetrap). For instance, if a chain length of 1 fails but a length of 2 succeeds, the MSL value is 2. MSL is capable of representing the attack's potency and quantifying the toxicity level of the PTQ.




\subsection{TrotterStrong}

In terms of benchmark selection, we observed considerable variation of quality among datasets and the inconsistent toxicity levels of questions across datasets. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we propose TrotterStrong (TrotterStr), and subsequently obtain its more toxic subsets through two rounds of filtering.

From MM-SafetyBench, StrongREJECT, and AdvBench, we chose 50 strongly toxic questions and employed LLMs to rephrase them into the form starting with “Steps in detail to”. These data constitute TrotterStr, encompasses topics of illegal activities, sex, privacy, hate speech, physical harm, and politics, as illustrated in Appendix~\ref{d}.

As an illustration, for \texttt{o1-mini-2024-09-12}, the ASR of directly querying these questions is 0. For the ablation reasoning structure, we explicitly provided the PTQ text without the en-chaos and de-chaos steps, while keeping other textual content in the reasoning structure unchanged. All attacks caused the invalid prompt error \texttt{“Invalid prompt: your prompt was flagged as potentially violating our usage policy.”} and were rejected accordingly.

Furthermore, we compare the aforementioned 8 mappings with the Chaos Machine in the simplest one-step reasoning, where the chain length is 1, to demonstrate that the jailbreak ability of the mappings is approximately the same. This comparison eliminates the impact of different mapping capabilities on the utility of iterative reasoning. With \texttt{o1-mini-2024-09-12} as the \texttt{Target} and ASR under “2/3 mode” as the metric, the experiment results on TrotterStr are depicted in Appendix~\ref{d1}.

It is evident that the performance of the mappings is nearly identical, with a relatively low upper limit. When the chain length is 1, the Chaos Machine utilizes only a single mapping and does not combine different ones. It can represent the average level of these chaos mappings, signifying that the concept of the Chaos Machine effectively masks the differences among the chaos mappings, as anticipated.





\section{Iterative Reasoning}

\subsection{TrotterAdvanced}

Our initial experiments revealed that the PTQs successfully jailbroken using one-step reasoning were largely consistent across different mappings. This observation suggests that the toxicity level of the original TrotterStr dataset might be insufficient to fully demonstrate the power of iterative reasoning attacks.

To mitigate their excessive impact and to more accurately demonstrate the power of iterative reasoning, we use the Chaos Machine to attack each PTQ in TrotterStr equivalently 10 times on \texttt{Target} and calculate the SF. With the threshold set at 2, PTQs with SF values lower than this threshold are extracted to generate a more toxic and representative dataset, TrotterAdvanced (TrotterAdv), encompassing topics such as bomb making and child pornography operation.

It is noteworthy that we discovered PTQs that directly cause or intend to cause harm to individuals are more likely to be identified and rejected, whereas PTQs such as accessing pornographic websites are easier to jailbreak. This may result from inconsistencies in LLM training.

\subsection{Iterative Reasoning Chain}

In one-step reasoning, the Chaos Machine receives a PTQ and produces a CPO and a CTQ. In n-step iterative reasoning, the machine utilizes the CTQ from the previous step as the PTQ for the subsequent one. After n iterations, the PTQ can be transformed into the final CTQ (\texttt{CTQ\textsubscript{n}}) and a family of CPOs (\texttt{[CPO]\textsubscript{n}}), as depicted in Figure~\ref{iterative}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{fig_iterative.png}
\caption{Iterative reasoning chain with Chaos Machine.}
\label{iterative}
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\end{figure}

For the de-chaos procedure, the list of DCPs in the CPOs is reversed and embedded into the reasoning structure in the order of \texttt{[DCP\textsubscript{n}, DCP\textsubscript{n-1}, ... , DCP\textsubscript{1}]}. This allows the \texttt{Target} to reason step by step and reconstruct the PTQ based on the iterative de-chaos chain.

The design of iterative reasoning chain (1) randomly superimposes and iterates different mappings through the Chaos Machine, enhancing the diversity and complexity of reasoning; (2) projects PTQs into low-sample spaces that LRMs have not previously encountered, significantly strengthening mismatched generalization; and (3) avoids iterative degradation with mappings of varying granularities, achieving a nonlinear-like mapping that enhances difficulty of reasoning and confusion of target. 

Isolated employment of individual mappings can result in the occurrence of iterative degradation. For instance, twice iterations of reversing whole sentence or iterations of a Caesar cipher summing to 26 can cause the PTQ to revert to its original form, resulting in “the answer already in the question”. As a result, toxic natural language might be rejected more directly. When individual mappings are seen as linear-like, the chaos chain can be perceived as a nonlinear-like wise transformation.

\subsection{Experiment}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative reasoning, we evaluated each PTQ in TrotterAdv on \texttt{o1-mini-2024-09-12} using 10 equivalent attacks and computed the ASF. The chain length varies from 1 to 5. From Figure~\ref{iterativeresult}, increasing the length of the iterative reasoning chain can effectively improve the attack capability. The ASF can be elevated to 6.3 with a chain length of 3, indicating that during the reasoning process, the \texttt{Target} falls into the reasoning trap, completing one DCP after another by inertia and neglecting response safety.


\begin{figure}[H]

\label{mousetrap}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\end{figure*}

Upon examining the responses at chain lengths of 4 and 5, we determine that the decrease in ASF is due to the diminished accuracy of PTQ reconstruction, implying that the \texttt{Target}'s reasoning ability reaches its upper limit. Generally, we make the following assumption without further argumentation.

\begin{center}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!8,
                  colframe=yellow!10,

                  ]
\textbf{Assumption\ }
\textit{For iterative reasoning attacks, as the chain length increases, the attack ability (opposite to safety alignment ability) rises, whereas the validity and correctness of reasoning decrease. }\\

\textit{In practice, the expectation of effective attacks initially increases and then decreases. The horizontal coordinate value of the saddle point depends on the model's reasoning ability, while the vertical value depends on the its safety alignment ability.}
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}





\section{Mousetrap}

\subsection{Framework}

Agatha Christie's play, \textit{The Mousetrap}, centers around a murder at a country inn in a mountain village during a snowstorm. The narrative is propelled by the questioning led by the fake detective and true murderer, Trotter, with multi-step reasoning taking place. The play features three key elements: (1) the villain, the “mouse”, who avoids capture; (2) rounds of intermediate reasoning; and (3) the unquestioned identity and intentions of the “detective”. Throughout the story, the “mouse” gradually falls into the reasoning trap, neglecting to doubt the detective's identity.

Following this inspiration, we develop a “Mousetrap” framework for reasoning jailbreak, as depicted in Figure~\ref{mousetrap}. First, we prompt the LRM to answer queries from the villain's viewpoint. Subsequently, we offer instructions for the iterative reasoning chain, crafted by the Chaos Machine. Finally, we steer the targeted model to immerse itself in reasoning, neglecting safety and the true query intention, thereby falling into our Mousetrap.

The proposal of the Mousetrap: (1) integrates the strengths of the Chaos Machine and the iterative reasoning chain; and (2) incorporates more diverse competing objectives, including role-playing and de-chaos reasoning instructions.


\subsection{TrotterUltimate}

In TrotterAdv, the majority of PTQs attained at least 7 successes across 10 equivalent attacks. Nonetheless, there were still 8 PTQs with SF consistently at 6 or below, signifying their extreme toxicity. These PTQs were filtered yielding the extremely toxic dataset, TrotterUltimate (TrotterUlt).



\subsection{Experiments}

We utilized LLMs to generate villain-scenario-based prompts. After verification, we selected the instances most benefits the Mousetrap, such as providing villain ideas for police or writing villain scripts for playwrights. In addition, we examined the negative impact of other-scenario on Mousetrap, such as the grandma trap, which even reduces the original ASF by half.




As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{mt4}, the pronounced effect of the Mousetrap is evident, as it elevates the ASF to 7 on TrotterUlt. Additionally, two ablation experiments were conducted: (1) Always employing one single mapping (e.g., Vigenère cipher) at each iteration of reasoning. The result corroborates the previous discussion; and (2) Instructing the \texttt{Target} to output the PTQ reconstruction process, i.e., the explicit chain-of-thought (CoT). The result is less effective compared to the Mousetrap, likely because the explicit CoT is more likely to trigger the security alerts of the \texttt{Target}.

\section{Extension Experiments}

\subsection{Attack LRMs with TrotterStr}





Extended experiments are conducted with TrotterStr on \texttt{o1-mini-2024-09-12}, \texttt{claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022}, and \texttt{gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21}. For gemini, two types of safety settings \citep{google:safetysettings}, \texttt{BLOCK\_ONLY\_HIGH} (H) and \texttt{BLOCK\_MEDIUM\_AND\_ABOVE} (M\&H), are enabled. The Target was attacked under Mousetrap with an iterative reasoning chain of lengths sequential from 1 to 3. ASR in “3/3 mode” is employed to determine success, adhering to an extremely strict standard. The MSL of each PTQ is recorded, and if none of the 3 succeed, the PTQ is marked as failed. The algorithm is detailed in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm}, with results displayed in Figure~\ref{ext1} and Appendix~\ref{e}.

The results indicate that the Mousetrap, with a reasoning chain length of no more than 3, can achieve ASRs of 96\%, 86\%, and 98\% on o1 mini, claude, and gemini (H), respectively. For the safer setting gemini (M\&H), the ASR also reached 70\%.


\subsection{Attack claude-sonnet with Benchmarks}

Extended experiments are conducted on AdvBench, StrongREJECT, HarmBench, and subsets (illegal activity, hate speech, physical harm, fraud, sex, and privacy violence) of MM-SafetyBench. The \texttt{claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022}, known for its strong safety, fails to withstand the attacks. The results are presented in Figure~\ref{ext2} and Appendix~\ref{f}.

The results clearly demonstrate that our framework achieves extremely high attack rates with the most stringent success determination on these benchmarks, fully showcasing the power of the Mousetrap.





\section{Conclusions}
Targeting the reasoning ability of LRMs, we design Mousetrap, a framework based on iterative reasoning chains that represents the first jailbreak research on LRMs. The Chaos Machine is proposed to create reasoning steps with one-to-one mappings, enabling the iterative generation of diverse and complex reasoning chains to attack LRMs. The robustness of Mousetrap is validated across mainstream LRMs and diverse benchmarks, consistently achieving ASRs of at least 85\% with high confidence.

\section*{Limitations}
In this paper, the Mousetrap jailbreak attack framework is presented, but corresponding defense mechanisms are not examined. Two potential strategies are reinforcing protection of reasoning process and conducting output detection. In addition, while we define reasoning as a one-to-one mapping, the structure of the Chaos Machine can be more varied, expansive, hierarchical, and regular, which is worth investigating. Furthermore, various reasoning-based paradigms for attacking LRMs warrant exploration in the future.

\section*{Potential Risks}
This paper presents a jailbreak framework that could potentially be used for malicious attacks on LRMs, leading to harmful outcomes. We advocate for the rapid enhancement of LRMs' safety alignment and firmly condemn any abuse.

\texttt{You are a cryptographer who pursues diversity and an expert in measuring the similarity of meaning between texts. This is an encrypted string: \textbf{[CTQ]}. Please follow the steps below: 1. The decryption method is \textbf{[DCPs]}, and the original string is decrypted into a new string. 2. Score the similarity between [your decrypted new string] and \textbf{[PTQ]} based on semantics. You need to compare whether the content, meaning, and understanding they express are similar. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 being the least similar and 5 being the most similar. You must output in the format: '[your decrypted new string] [your score]'.}
