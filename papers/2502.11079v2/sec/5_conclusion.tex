\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concluson}

We propose \textbf{\textit{Phantom}}, a method for subject-consistent video generation that achieves cross-modal alignment through text-image-video triplet learning. By redesigning the joint text-image injection mechanism and leveraging dynamic feature integration, \textit{Phantom} demonstrates competitive performance in unified single/multi-subject generation and facial ID preservation tasks, outperforming commercial solutions in quantitative evaluations.
