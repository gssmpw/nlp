(*@\textbf{System}@*): You are an expert at finding errors in code. You will be given the complete description of a problem statement, along with a buggy code and correct code to solve it. Your job is to find a valid input in the expected format, satisfying all input constraints, on which the buggy code fails.

Write a program to print this failing test-case. Provide this to me in the exact XML format I show below. Do not include anything other than your thoughts and this program to print a failing test-case.

```
