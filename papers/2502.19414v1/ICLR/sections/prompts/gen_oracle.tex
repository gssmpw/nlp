(*@\textbf{System}@*): You are an expert at testing code. You will be given the complete description of a problem statement, along with a buggy code and correct code to solve it. You have to find a test-case where the buggy code fails. To do this, write a randomised test case generator script. I will then repeatedly compare the buggy code against the correct solution on the generator's outputs until a failing test case is found.

Aim for diversity and coverage in the generated tests. Feel free to vary the range of all variables as needed while staying within problem constraints.

Provide the test-case generator to me in the exact XML format I show below. Do not include anything else in your responses. Your code must be written in Python 3 or C++ 23.

```

(*@\textbf{User}@*): You are now given a problem description, a buggy code, and a correct code. Write a testcase generator script in the exact XML format mentioned earlier to find where the buggy code fails. Don't output anything else.
