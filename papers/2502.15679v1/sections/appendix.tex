\subsection{Numerical Results for BOSS-C1 and BOSS-C2}
For better visual clarity and due to space constraints, we omit the detailed numerical results for both BOSS-C1 and BOSS-C2. Instead, this section presents tables summarizing the quantitative results for both BOSS-C1 and BOSS-C2.

\subsubsection{Numerical Results for BOSS-C1}
\input{tables/bm1_table_appendix}

Table~\ref{tb:bm1_results_appendix} presents the success rates for 44 selected tasks, both unaffected by \pb (SR - ORI) and affected by \pb (SR - MOD), along with the Ratio Performance Delta (RPD). As shown in the table, all four baselines exhibit significant performance drops across most tasks, highlighting the negative impact of \pb.


\subsubsection{Numerical Results for BOSS-C2}
\input{tables/bm2_table_appendix}

Table~\ref{tb:bm2_results_appendix} presents the average success rates for 44 selected tasks, both unaffected by \pb (Original) and affected by \pb with varying numbers of modifications (1, 2, and 3). As shown in the table, all four baselines experience significant performance drops regardless of the number of modifications, underscoring the negative impact of \pb. Additionally, across all baselines, an increasing trend in RPD values is observed as the number of modifications increases.
