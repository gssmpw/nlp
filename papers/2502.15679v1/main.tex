% Gedas's feedback:
% 1. switch lines in fig1, change bg color
% 2. use better examples for fig2, explain colors
% 3. modify fig5 largely
% 4. delete table 1 & 2
% 5. avoid the statement to challenge some reviews



% Discussion with Dan
% 1. Any more improvements on Fig 2?
% bottom figures, ch-2 as example, it's still successful - transparent + put some signs
% 2. Fig 4 is overwhelming, how to improve - simplify?
% dont make fig 3 and fig 4 next to each other - moving away. split it? or maybe delete the scatter plot.
% 3. Do we really hope to delete the whole section of VI if we could cut many parts by \vspace / simplify expressions? Will this make the contribution not enough?

\begin{abstract}
% For general robot, it's desirable to let robot complete unseen complex long horizon tasks. Hirerachical IL where the robot is required to perform long horizon task companied with pre-trained skill set has proven to be a promising framework.

% However, even for the simplest long horizon task, which is a skill chain, the current skill policies cannot complete it well due to a problem identified by us as observation space modification (\pb).

% To verify the \pb problem, we evaluate on several popular and representative imitation learning algorithms on our benchmark sets \bm, containinig 3 benchmarks with increasing difficulties. Furthermore, we conduct experiments to obatain useful insights, which helps understand the problem better. To solve the challenging problem, we generate data in a scalable way and propose a simple baseline method, which provides much insights on how to solve this problem in the future. 


Robotics has long sought to develop visual-servoing robots capable of completing previously unseen long-horizon tasks. Hierarchical approaches offer a pathway for achieving this goal by executing skill combinations arranged by a task planner, with each visuomotor skill pre-trained using a specific imitation learning (IL) algorithm. However, even in simple long-horizon tasks like skill chaining, hierarchical approaches often struggle due to a problem we identify as \textbf{Observation Space Shift} (\pb), where the sequential execution of preceding skills causes shifts in the observation space, disrupting the performance of subsequent individually trained skill policies. To validate \pb and evaluate its impact on long-horizon tasks, we introduce \bm (a \underline{B}enchmark for \underline{O}bservation \underline{S}pace \underline{S}hift). \bm comprises three distinct challenges: ``Single Predicate Shift'', ``Accumulated Predicate Shift'', and ``Skill Chaining'', each designed to assess a different aspect of \pb's negative effect. We evaluated several recent popular IL algorithms on \bm, including three Behavioral Cloning methods and the Visual Language Action model OpenVLA. Even on the simplest challenge, we observed average performance drops of 67\%, 35\%, 34\%, and 54\%, respectively, when comparing skill performance with and without \pb. 
% Additionally, we explore two potential factors that may influence \pb: task difficulty and the magnitude of visual modifications. 
Additionally, we investigate a potential solution to \pb that scales up the training data for each skill with a larger and more visually diverse set of demonstrations, with our results showing it is not sufficient to resolve \pb.
%. %While this approach contributes to a large, diverse dataset and offers guidance for future research,

% We evaluated state-of-the-art IL algorithms in this suite, \gb{Maybe you can emphasize that even the recent VLA-based large-scale methods struggle with this issue to make this more impactful/relevant} showing the negative impact of \pb on long-horizon task performance\gb{This is pretty vague. Would be good to cite specific numbers of how much the performance drops}. Additionally, we perform two sets of experiments to gain deeper insight into the problem.\gb{This sentence doesn't provide any useful information}. To address this challenging problem, we propose a scalable demonstration generation method and introduce a simple baseline based on the dataset generated via the proposed method\gb{too vague. Unclear at all what your method does}, offering valuable guidance for future research. \gb{Overall, the abstract is very vague and general. As a result the contribution seems limited and unclear. Would be good to rewrite to include more details + also somehow make it seem more exciting/impactful}
