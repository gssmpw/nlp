In this paper, we proposed Alpha-SQL, a zero-shot Text-to-SQL framework that frames SQL generation as a structured search problem. By combining Monte Carlo Tree Search with LLM-as-Action-Model, Alpha-SQL explores the SQL query space efficiently without fine-tuning the LLMs. Experiments show competitive performance, with 69.7\% on the BIRD development set. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our reasoning actions, and performance improves with more MCTS rollouts.

% In this work, we proposed Alpha-SQL, a novel zero-shot Text-to-SQL framework that formulates SQL generation as a structured search problem. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search and integrating LLM-as-Action-Model, Alpha-SQL efficiently explores the vast space of potential SQL queries without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. \rev{Extensive experiments demonstrate Alpha-SQL's competitive performance, achieving 69.7\% execution accuracy on Spider and 87.0\% on BIRD development sets.
% Through ablation studies on the action space, we validate the effectiveness of our defined reasoning actions for Text-to-SQL tasks.
% Moreover, Alpha-SQL's performance increases with more MCTS rollouts, enabling flexible adaptation to varying computational resources.
