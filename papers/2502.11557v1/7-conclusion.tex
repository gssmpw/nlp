\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a new backtracking algorithm \texttt{RRSplit} for finding the largest common subgraph.
%
\texttt{RRSplit} is based on our newly-designed reduction rules for reducing the redundant computations and achieves the state-of-the-art worst-case time complexity.
%
Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely-used graph collections, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our method. In the future, we will adapt our proposed algorithm to solve {\chengE the maximum common subgraph search problem on} other types of graphs, including vertex-labeled and edge-labeled graphs.
