This paper introduces reﬁned methods to represent and analyze the creativity and ﬁxation eﬀects of inspiration sources on designs. Based on a critical review of existing design research methods, we develop an extension of linkography and a distance graph to investigate design patterns among designers of diﬀerent expertise levels and exposure to diﬀerent inspiration sources prior to design. In our explorative experiment, novices and experts were given ﬁve types of external stimulidkeyword, diagram, plan, sketch rendering, and precedent photodas inspiration sources for the same design task. Our extended linkography represents and measures the creativity and ﬁxation propensities of diﬀerent inspiration sources at the micro-level of design processes. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we test the popular but unevenly supported hypothesis that conceptually distant sources of inspiration provide the best insights for creative production. Through text analysis of hundreds of design concepts across a dozen diﬀerent design challenges on a Web-based innovation platform that tracks connections to sources of inspiration, we ﬁnd that citing sources is associated with greater creativity of ideas, but conceptually closer rather than farther sources appear more beneﬁcial. This inverse relationship between conceptual distance and design creativity is robust across diﬀerent design problems on the platform. In light of these ﬁndings, we revisit theories of design inspiration and creative cognition. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Citation practices are fundamental to teaching scholarly writing. With the emergence of generative Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) technologies, students need a structured way to cite when and how these technologies are used.
Objective: This paper introduces an instructor resource, an AI Contribution Statement, which provides students with an ethical and explicit framework for reporting on AI use during idea generation and writing in research methods.
Method: Students were guided to create an AI Contribution Statement that reports when an AI technology was used for a research paper, what prompts were given and text generated, and how the information was incorporated into a ﬁnal written product.
Results: Sixty-four percent of students reported using AI assistive technologies. Of those, 33.12\% reported using it more than twice, suggesting that, when allowed in a course, students’ use is relatively low.
Conclusion: Training students in best citation practices regarding ethical and transparent use of AI technologies is important, yet additional research is needed to understand how students are using it and how instructors can leverage this tool to foster equity. Teaching Implications: An AI Contribution Statement is an important addition to research methods teaching to create equality in technology use and student success.},

Fixation was thought to be encouraged and discouraged by a wide range of factors related to the project, the client, the design team, the organisational culture and the design activities employed. The experiences that designers accumulate during their professional lives were associated with ﬁxation in diﬀerent ways. The experience of prior design failures was thought to encourage ﬁxation whilst the experience of varied solutions was thought to discourage ﬁxation. Recognising ﬁxation episodes and reﬂecting on them was described as the means by which designers could guard against such episodes in the future and thus be more creative. Ó 2015 The Author.

This paper examines the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in higher education, and discusses the potential risks and rewards of these tools. The paper also considers the difficulties of detecting and preventing academic dishonesty, and suggests strategies that universities can adopt to ensure ethical and responsible use of these tools. These strategies include developing policies and procedures, providing training and support, and using various methods to detect and prevent cheat­ ing. The paper concludes that while the use of AI in higher educa­ tion presents both opportunities and challenges, universities can effectively address these concerns by taking a proactive and ethical approach to the use of these tools.},

	abstract = {Working with data is an increasingly powerful way of making knowledge claims about the world. There is, however, a growing gap between
          those who can work effectively with data and those who cannot. Because it is state and corporate actors who possess the resources to
          collect, store and analyze data, individuals (e.g., citizens, community members, professionals) are more likely to be the subjects of data
          than to use data for civic purposes. There is a strong case to be made for cultivating data literacy for people in non-technical fields as
          one way of bridging this gap. Literacy, following the model of popular education proposed by Paulo Freire, requires not only the acquisition
          of technical skills but also the emancipation achieved through the literacy process. This article proposes the term creative data literacy
          to refer to the fact that non-technical learners may need pathways towards data which do not come from technical fields. Here I offer five
          tactics to cultivate creative data literacy for empowerment. They are grounded in my experience as a data literacy researcher, educator and
          software developer. Each tactic is explained and introduced with examples. I assert that working towards creative data literacy is not only
          the work of educators but also of data creators, data publishers, tool developers, tool and visualization designers, tutorial authors,
          government, community organizers and artists.},

This paper describes how sources of inspiration are used in commercial knitwear design. Knitwear designers actively search for sources of inspiration, which they use both to define the space of designs that will meet their purposes and tune their tacit perceptions of what is appropriate, and in the development of individual designs. They employ active strategies for guiding their idea generation actions to produce the ideas the situation requires. Knitwear designers routinely use a very broad range of sources of inspiration, and are explicitly aware and open about how they use them. Identifying a good source is often the key creative step in knitwear design, and being able to do this well is a vital skill for a designer. The paper makes some provisional generalisations about the structure of design processes driven by thinking with sources of inspiration, to provoke and facilitate comparisons with other industries.},

Both disciplines also share an emphasis on temporal consistency and have a 50-year history, and yet no quantitative review of the literature on the creative personality has been conducted. The 3 major goals of this article are to present the results of the first meta-analytic review of the literature on personality and creative achievement, to present a conceptual integration of underlying potential psychological mechanisms that personality and creativity have in common, and to show how the topic of creativity has been important to personality psychologists and can be to social psychologists. A common system of personality description was obtained by classifying trait terms or scales onto one of the Five-Factor Model (or Big Five) dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Effect size was measured using Cohen 's d (Cohen, 1988). Comparisons on personality traits were made on 3 sets of samples: scientists versus nonscientists, more creative versus less creative scientists, and artists versus nonartists. In general, creative people are more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive. Out of these, the largest effect sizes were on openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity. Further, there appears to be temporal stability of these distinguishing personality dimensions of creative people. Dispositions important to creative behavior are parsed into social, cognitive, motivational, and affective dimensions. Creativity, like most complex behaviors requires an intra- as well as interdisciplinary view and thereby mitigates the historically disciplinocentric attitudes of personality and social psychologists.},

Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a small permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers' reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked.},

A survey, undertaken by 393 undergraduate and postgraduate students from a variety of disciplines, investigated their perceptions of diverse AI-giarism scenarios. The findings portray a complex landscape of understanding with clear disapproval for direct AI content generation and ambivalent attitudes towards subtler uses of AI. The study introduces a novel instrument to explore conceptualisation of AI-giarism, offering a significant tool for educators and policy-makers. This scale facilitates understanding and discussions around AIrelated academic misconduct, contributing to pedagogical design and assessment in an era of AI integration.

Sketching partakes in design reasoning and it does so through a special kind of visual imagery. A pattern of pictorial reasoning isrevealed which displays regular shifts between two modalities of arguments, pertaining to both figural and nonfigural aspects of candidate forms at the time they are being generated, as part of the design search. The dialectics of sketching is the oscillation ofarguments which brings about gradual transformation of images, ending when the designer judges that sufficient coherence has been achieved.},

	abstract = {A design is said to be as successful as the leading idea that drives it is. Mature designers make frequent use of ‘stock ideas’ accumulated over time and stored in memory and personal archives. Novices do not yet possess developed collections of sources that can be tapped. In this study it was hypothesized that stimuli in the form of texts presented to student-designers along with a design problem, would improve the quality of their design solution. Results show that text-stimuli yield designs that receive higher originality grades compared to a no-stimulus condition, but practicality is not affected. We propose that textual stimuli may be useful as part of the design process and as a pedagogical tool in the design studio.},

This paper investigates designers’ approaches when selecting inspirational stimuli during the initial phases of a design process. We conducted a think-aloud protocol study and interviews with 31 design Masters students while generating ideas for a design problem. The results indicate that searching for and selecting stimuli require diﬀerent levels of cognitive eﬀort, depending on whether there is unlimited or limited access to stimuli. Furthermore, three important stages of the inspiration process were identified: keyword definition, stimuli search and stimuli selection. For each of these stages, we elaborate on how designers define keywords, which search approaches they use and what drives their selection of stimuli. This paper contributes to an understanding of how designers can be supported in their inspiration process in a more detailed manner.},

The process gives rise to novel designs and design metaphors including data sculpting. It suggests: that the deliberate use of creativity techniques with data stakeholders is likely to contribute to successful, novel and effective solutions; that being explicit about creativity may contribute to designers developing creative solutions; that using creativity techniques early in the design process may result in a creative approach persisting throughout the process. The work constitutes the first systematic visualization design for a data rich source that will be increasingly important to energy suppliers and consumers as Smart Meter technology is widely deployed.

In this paper we describe, VizItCards, a card-driven workshop developed for our graduate infovis class. The workshop is intended to provide practice with good design techniques and to simultaneously reinforce key concepts. VizItCards relies on principles of collaborative-learning and research on parallel design to generate positive collaborations and high-quality designs. From our experience of simulating a realistic design scenario in a classroom setting, we find that our students were able to meet key learning objectives and their design performance improved during the class. We describe variants of the workshop, discussing which techniques we think match to which learning goals.},

Collaborative sketching and 6-3-5 method were combined to use drawings as the main form of communication during the ideation task. This was followed by a post-experimental questionnaire aimed at learning about the participants’ views on the ideation task. Our results suggest that briefs with specific numerical requirements helped students score well in appropriateness, while those including physical stimuli led to higher Usability scores but lower Novelty scores. Outcomes from the survey showed that although the presence of a visual prompt led students to believe that they were enhancing the Novelty of their designs, their final scores reflected the opposite. Because of that, educators should consider addressing students’ misconceptions about how examples affect the creativity of their design solutions.},

Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to their predeﬁned entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative models. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identiﬁed from empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative models combined with an interactive interface for visualization design.},

The framework includes four overlapping activities that characterize the design process, with each activity explicating outcomes related to the nested model. Additionally, we describe and characterize a list of exemplar methods and how they overlap among these activities. The design activity framework is the result of reflective discussions from a collaboration on a visualization redesign project, the details of which we describe to ground the framework in a real-world design process.

We propose modeling visualization design knowledge as a collection of constraints, in conjunction with a method to learn weights for soft constraints from experimental data. Using constraints, we can take theoretical design knowledge and express it in a concrete, extensible, and testable form: the resulting models can recommend visualization designs and can easily be augmented with additional constraints or updated weights. We implement our approach in Draco, a constraint-based system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP).

Computing education has historically sought to teach and evaluate abstract knowledge (e.g., theories, principles, guidelines, design patterns) and the application of such knowledge to given problems. However, situations faced in professional practice are often messy, dynamic, and uncertain, and do not lend themselves well to the clear and direct application of such knowledge. This leaves a gap between the knowledge learned in the classroom and what is required for skillful practice in professional settings. In this paper, I discuss some historical reasons for this dominant pedagogical perspective, some of the core features of professional practice that are not typically taught in classrooms, and ways in which data visualization design can be taught to be more resonant with the experience of professional practice.},

	abstract = {Sketching designs has been shown to be a useful way of planning and considering alternative solutions. The use of lo-fidelity prototyping, especially paper-based sketching, can save time, money and converge to better solutions more quickly. However, this design process is often viewed to be too informal. Consequently users do not know how to manage their thoughts and ideas (to first think divergently, to then finally converge on a suitable solution). We present the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology. The methodology enables users to create information visualization interfaces through lo-fidelity methods. Users sketch and plan their ideas, helping them express different possibilities, think through these ideas to consider their potential effectiveness as solutions to the task (sheet 1); they create three principle designs (sheets 2,3 and 4); before converging on a final realization design that can then be implemented (sheet 5). In this article, we present (i) a review of the use of sketching as a planning method for visualization and the benefits of sketching, (ii) a detailed description of the Five Design Sheet (FdS) methodology, and (iii) an evaluation of the FdS using the System Usability Scale, along with a case-study of its use in industry and experience of its use in teaching.},

	abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of data visualizations were created to inform the public about the rapidly evolving crisis. Data dashboards, a form of information dissemination used during the pandemic, have facilitated this process by visualizing statistics regarding the number of COVID-19 cases over time. Prior work on COVID-19 visualizations has primarily focused on the design and evaluation of specific visualization systems from technology-centered perspectives. However, little is known about what occurs behind the scenes during the visualization creation processes, given the complex sociotechnical contexts in which they are embedded. Yet, such ecological knowledge is necessary to help characterize the nuances and trajectories of visualization design practices in the wild, as well as generate insights into how creators come to understand and approach visualization design on their own terms and for their own situated purposes. In this research, we conducted a qualitative interview study among dashboard creators from federal agencies, state health departments, mainstream news media outlets, and other organizations that created (often widely-used) COVID-19 dashboards to answer the following questions: how did visualization creators engage in COVID-19 dashboard design, and what tensions, conflicts, and challenges arose during this process? Our findings detail the trajectory of design practices—from creation to expansion, maintenance, and termination—that are shaped by the complex interplay between design goals, tools and technologies, labor, emerging crisis contexts, and public engagement. We particularly examined the tensions between designers and the general public involved in these processes. These conflicts, which often materialized due to a divergence between public demands and standing policies, centered around the type and amount of information to be visualized, how public perceptions shape and are shaped by visualization design, and the strategies utilized to deal with (potential) misinterpretations and misuse of visualizations. Our findings and lessons learned shed light on new ways of thinking in visualization design, focusing on the bundled activities that are invariably involved in human and nonhuman participation throughout the entire trajectory of design practice.},

To explore this, our work presents Vistylist, a design support tool that disentangles the visual style of a source pictorial visualization from its content and transfers the visual style to one or more intended pictorial visualizations. We evaluated Vistylist through a survey of example pictorial visualizations, a controlled user study, and a series of expert interviews. The results of our evaluation indicated that Vistylist is useful for creating expressive and faithful pictorial visualizations.},

	abstract = {In this article, we discuss ethical issues related to using and disclosing artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and other systems based on large language models (LLMs), to write or edit scholarly manuscripts. Some journals, such as Science, have banned the use of LLMs because of the ethical problems they raise concerning responsible authorship. We argue that this is not a reasonable response to the moral conundrums created by the use of LLMs because bans are unenforceable and would encourage undisclosed use of LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs can be useful in writing, reviewing and editing text, and promote equity in science. Others have argued that LLMs should be mentioned in the acknowledgments since they do not meet all the authorship criteria. We argue that naming LLMs as authors or mentioning them in the acknowledgments are both inappropriate forms of recognition because LLMs do not have free will and therefore cannot be held morally or legally responsible for what they do. Tools in general, and software in particular, are usually cited in-text, followed by being mentioned in the references. We provide suggestions to improve APA Style for referencing ChatGPT to specifically indicate the contributor who used LLMs (because interactions are stored on personal user accounts), the used version and model (because the same version could use different language models and generate dissimilar responses, e.g., ChatGPT May 12 Version GPT3.5 or GPT4), and the time of usage (because LLMs evolve fast and generate dissimilar responses over time). We recommend that researchers who use LLMs: (1) disclose their use in the introduction or methods section to transparently describe details such as used prompts and note which parts of the text are affected, (2) use in-text citations and references (to recognize their used applications and improve findability and indexing), and (3) record and submit their relevant interactions with LLMs as supplementary material or appendices.},

	abstract = {The analysis of large graphs plays a prominent role in various fields of research and is relevant in many important application areas. Effective visual analysis of graphs requires appropriate visual presentations in combination with respective user interaction facilities and algorithmic graph analysis methods. How to design appropriate graph analysis systems depends on many factors, including the type of graph describing the data, the analytical task at hand and the applicability of graph analysis methods. The most recent surveys of graph visualization and navigation techniques cover techniques that had been introduced until 2000 or concentrate only on graph layouts published until 2002. Recently, new techniques have been developed covering a broader range of graph types, such as time-varying graphs. Also, in accordance with ever growing amounts of graph-structured data becoming available, the inclusion of algorithmic graph analysis and interaction techniques becomes increasingly important. In this State-of-the-Art Report, we survey available techniques for the visual analysis of large graphs. Our review first considers graph visualization techniques according to the type of graphs supported. The visualization techniques form the basis for the presentation of interaction approaches suitable for visual graph exploration. As an important component of visual graph analysis, we discuss various graph algorithmic aspects useful for the different stages of the visual graph analysis process. We also present main open research challenges in this field.},

	abstract = {Example galleries are often used to teach, document, and advertise visually-focused domain-specific languages and libraries, such as those producing visualizations, diagrams, or webpages. Despite their ubiquity, there is no consensus on the role of “example galleries”, let alone what the best practices might be for their creation or curation. To understand gallery meaning and usage, we interviewed the creators (N=11) and users (N=9) of prominent visualization-adjacent tools. From these interviews we synthesized strategies and challenges for gallery curation and management (e.g. weighing the costs/benefits of adding new examples and trade-offs in richness vs ease of use), highlighted the differences between planned and actual gallery usage (e.g. opportunistic reuse vs search-engine optimization), and reflected on parts of the gallery design space not explored (e.g. highlighting the potential of tool assistance). We found that galleries are multi-faceted structures whose form and content are motivated to accommodate different usages—ranging from marketing material to test suite to extended documentation. This work offers a foundation for future support tools by characterizing gallery design and management, as well as by highlighting challenges and opportunities in the space (such as how more diverse galleries make reuse tasks simpler, but complicate upkeep).},

	abstract = {Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reﬂections from ﬁve large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-speciﬁc visualization challenges for design speciﬁcation and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.},

Truth is difficult enough to know, even with the best science, but ‘reality’, the domain of human experience, can be overwhelmingly paralyzing and beyond comprehension or understanding. Careful, accurate description, concomitant with clear explanation, is necessary but not sufficient in the quest for enough understanding to allow wise decisions to be made. The value of judgment is that it allows individuals to overcome their paralysis and engage with the messy complexity of life in a way that, when done well, can bring function, beauty, and meaning to human existence. In this paper we will examine judgment, particularly design judgment. We argue that a better understanding of judgment is needed if we want to improve our design ability in an intentional manner. Judgment is a key dimension in the process of design. The ability to make design judgments is what distinguishes a designer as a designer. The ability to make good design judgments distinguishes good design.},

Three conditions are compared, a control, a fixation group whom were provided with an example solution, and a defixation group whom were also given materials to mitigate their design fixation. Measures include indicators of design fixation and participant perceptions. The study demonstrates that the engineering design faculty show statistically significant evidence of design fixation, but only partially perceive its effects. This study also indicates that design fixation can be mitigated. The group of participants in this study, due to their background in engineering design research and experience with student design teams, was expected to have more accurate perceptions or awareness of design fixation than the typical participant. Understanding the incongruities between participant perceptions and quantitative design outcomes are particularly of interest to researchers of design methods.

Highlights of the findings include: distinctions between exploration as a precursor to more directed analysis versus truly open-ended exploration; confirmation that some analysts see “finding something interesting” as a valid goal of data exploration while others explicitly disavow this goal; conflicting views about the role of intelligent tools in data exploration; and pervasive use of visualization for exploration, but with only a subset using direct manipulation interfaces. These findings provide guidelines for future tool development, as well as a better understanding of the meaning of the term “data exploration” based on the words of practitioners “in the wild.”},

While the effects of examples have been studied in other disciplines, such as web design or engineering, the results are not readily applicable to visualization due to inconsistencies in findings and challenges unique to visualization design. Towards bridging this gap, we conduct an exploratory experiment involving 32 data visualization designers focusing on the influence of five factors (timing, quantity, diversity, data topic similarity, and data schema similarity ) on objectively measurable design outcomes (e.g., numbers of designs and idea transfers). Our quantitative analysis shows that when examples are introduced after initial brainstorming, designers curate examples with topics less similar to the dataset they are working on and produce more designs with a high variation in visualization components. Also, designers copy more ideas from examples with higher data schema similarities. Our qualitative analysis of participants’ thought processes provides insights into why designers incorporate examples into their designs, revealing potential factors that have not been previously investigated. Finally, we discuss how our results inform how designers may use examples during design ideation as well as future research on quantifying designs and supporting example-based visualization design.

	abstract = {Background Design is essential to the engineering profession and plays a crucial role in preparation for future practice. Research investigating variations of how professional designers experience, give meaning to, and approach design can inform the ways we characterize, assess, and facilitate design learning. This may also have significant implications for preparing future engineering professionals to collaborate within and across disciplines. Purpose (Hypothesis) The goal of the study was to reveal and investigate critical differences in how designers from within and outside of engineering disciplines understand what it means to design, and how those understandings are evident in their approaches to and progression through design work. Design/Method A qualitative research approach called phenomenography was used to investigate critical variations in how individuals experience and understand design. Twenty practicing designers were interviewed regarding their design experiences, how they approach design, and the ways they understand design. Conclusions Six qualitatively distinct lenses on how individuals across disciplines experience and come to understand design emerged, comprising a phenomenographic “outcome space.” These include design as (1) evidencebased decision-making, (2) organized translation, (3) personal synthesis, (4) intentional progression, (5) directed creative exploration, and (6) freedom. Theoretical implications include an understanding of how design skills and knowledge come together to form a design approach, while practical implications emphasize structuring variation-based reflection, which can facilitate common ground as a result of recognizing differ “design lenses.”},

We demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that “tell a story” can significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels—the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity—and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.},

This framework guided the two experiments reported here. The first addresses representation intuitiveness, considering both visual variables and iconicity of representation. The second addresses relative performance of the most intuitive abstract and iconic representations of uncertainty on a map reading task.

It can be used to obtain empirical data on the following types of variables: a) frequency and patterning of daily activity, social interaction, and changes in location; b) frequency, intensity, and patterning of psychological states, i.e., emotional, cognitive, and conative dimensions of experience; c) frequency and patterning of thoughts, including quality and intensity of thought disturbance. The article reviews practical and methodological issues of the ESM and presents evidence for its short- and long-term reliability when used as an instrument for assessing the variables outlined above. It also presents evidence for validity by showing correlation between ESM measures on the one hand and physiological measures, one-time psychological tests, and behavioral indices on the other.

CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across diferent felds, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identifed a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the efects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the efects. Our fndings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identifcation, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs. Future research should also advance usability testing methods and trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.},

In this model, new abstract concepts derived from the meta-representation are not simple combinations of the design ideas expressed in the primary representation. Instead, the process of meta-representation corresponds to the abstraction of new features at a higher, hierarchically separated level of representation from an existing one. We show a computational process of pattern extraction from existing design representations that results in the crystallization of design ideas or ‘chunks’ at an abstract level. The relation between the representation and its referent is explicitly described in these ‘chunks’, yet the ‘chunks’ have different properties from the properties of the original representation.},

To close this gap, we advocate a theoretical and methodological focus on the day-to-day, lived experience of designers. To date, this type of theory-generative, experientially oriented research has focused on the users of technologies, not the designers. In contrast, we propose that HCI researchers turn their attention to producing theories of interaction design practice that resonate with practitioners themselves. In part one of this paper, we describe the mismatch between HCI research and interaction design practices. Then we present vignettes from an observational study of commercial design practice to illustrate the issues at hand. In part two, we discuss methodological and theoretical changes in research practice that might support the goal of integrating HCI research with interaction design practices. We then discuss current research methods and theories to identify changes that might enlarge our view on practice. In part three, we elaborate on our theoretically minded agenda and a kind of ideal-type theory.},

We contribute recommendations for the design of translational resources to bridge the gap between theory and practice in HCI. We recommend ways to create theory-driven examples tailored to specific activities: understanding, brainstorming, building, and advocacy. Additionally, practitioners prefer actionable guidance and see prescriptive recommendations and downloadable design patterns as most useful. Designoriented filters, support for mapping design challenges to research keywords, and visual galleries of examples from theory have the potential to facilitate designers’ search processes. Finally, translational resources and discussion features can be integrated into tools for designers and academics to support cross-community collaboration.},

The proposed model contributes to a better understanding of information aesthetics as a potentially independent research field within visualization that specifically focuses on the experience of aesthetics, dataset interpretation and interaction. The proposed model is based on analysing existing visualization techniques by their interpretative intent and data mapping inspiration. It reveals information aesthetics as the conceptual link between information visualization and visualization art, and includes the fields of social and ambient visualization. This model is unique in its focus on aesthetics as the artistic influence on the technical implementation and intended purpose of a visualization technique, rather than subjective aesthetic judgments of the visualization outcome. This research provides a framework for understanding aesthetics in visualization, and allows for new design guidelines and reviewing criteria.},

Twenty combinations of these choices are viable timeline designs that can be matched to different narrative points, while smooth animated transitions between narrative points allow for the presentation of a cohesive story, an important aspect of both interactive storytelling and data videos. We further validate this design space by realizing the full set of viable timeline designs and transitions in a proof-of-concept sandbox implementation that we used to produce seven example timeline stories.

	abstract = {When engaging in new and ill-defined problems, designers are challenged with many ambiguous moments, such as finding how to start. This is particularly the case with novice designers. Thus, for designers, selecting and organizing information have a profound impact on the generation of creative solutions. However, much is not yet known regarding the selection of inspirational sources and how they influence the generation of ideas and the outcome of the design process. This paper presents the results of the analysis of case studies on the design process of eight novice designers, focusing particularly on their inspirational search approaches. Several units of analysis were collected and investigated: design students’ daily work notebooks, intermediate and final written reports, and individual interviews. Whilst all novice designers chose to tackle the design brief in different ways, similarities were found regarding the patterns of search of inspiration. These case studies reveal that while searching for inspiration is mostly an unconscious process, designers would benefit from making it a conscious and reflective approach. The paper promotes a change in the perception of the inspirational search processes, which can have important implications for design education.},

	abstract = {Visual analytics supports humans in generating knowledge from large and often complex datasets. Evidence is collected, collated and cross-linked with our existing knowledge. In the process, a myriad of analytical and visualisation techniques are employed to generate a visual representation of the data. These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making.},

A plea is made for the use of subjective rather than scientific methods in the analysis of this type of material, and by extension for greater emphasis on subjective methods in design. Many descriptions of the design process have been based on an analysis-synthesis model which does not correspond to the design process as seen in practice. A new paradigm has been offered by Hillier, Musgrove and O'Sullivan, one of conjecture-analysis. This is supported by evidence from the present research findings, and an elaboration is suggested to give a model of the design process consisting of generator-conjecture-analysis. The new element is the primary generator, a broad initial objective or small set of objectives, self-imposed by the architect, a value judgement rather than the product of rationality. Case material is presented to support the idea of the primary generator and the generator-conjecture-analysis model.},

In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10-week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students’ understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students’ literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice.

	abstract = {We propose the nested blocks and guidelines model for the design and validation of visualization systems. The nested blocks and guidelines model extends the previously proposed four-level nested model by adding finer grained structure within each level, providing explicit mechanisms to capture and discuss design decision rationale. Blocks are the outcomes of the design process at a specific level, and guidelines discuss relationships between these blocks. Blocks at the algorithm and technique levels describe design choices, as do data blocks at the abstraction level, whereas task abstraction blocks and domain situation blocks are identified as the outcome of the designer’s understanding of the requirements. In the nested blocks and guidelines model, there are two types of guidelines: within-level guidelines provide comparisons for blocks within the same level, while between-level guidelines provide mappings between adjacent levels of design. We analyze several recent articles using the nested blocks and guidelines model to provide concrete examples of how a researcher can use blocks and guidelines to describe and evaluate visualization research. We also discuss the nested blocks and guidelines model with respect to other design models to clarify its role in visualization design. Using the nested blocks and guidelines model, we pinpoint two implications for visualization evaluation. First, comparison of blocks at the domain level must occur implicitly downstream at the abstraction level; second, comparison between blocks must take into account both upstream assumptions and downstream requirements. Finally, we use the model to analyze two open problems: the need for mid-level task taxonomies to fill in the task blocks at the abstraction level and the need for more guidelines mapping between the algorithm and technique levels.},

Converging evidence in cognitive psychology has indicated that the ability to generate original ideas can be limited by recently activated knowledge, such as examples of solutions. On the other hand, neuroimaging studies have recently demonstrated that exposure to examples could, on the contrary, have a stimulating effect on originality. To make sense of what seems to be contradictory studies, we hypothesized that two types of examples could have opposite effects on originality: (1) restrictive examples—within the fixation effect—could lead to a reduction in the originality of the solutions, whereas (2) expansive examples—outside the fixation effect—could provoke solutions of higher originality. Results from a total of 160 participants confirmed that the solutions proposed by the group exposed to restrictive examples were less original than those given by the group exposed to expansive examples.},

	abstract = {The visualization of information is a widely used tool to improve comprehension and, ultimately, decision-making in strategic management decisions as well as in a diverse array of other domains. Across social science research, many findings have supported this rationale. However, empirical results vary significantly in terms of the variables and mechanisms studied as well as their resulting conclusion. Despite the ubiquity of information visualization with modern software, there is little effort to create a comprehensive understanding of the powers and limitations of its use. The purpose of this article is therefore to review, systematize, and integrate extant research on the effects of information visualization on decision-making and to provide a future research agenda with a particular focus on the context of strategic management decisions. The study shows that information visualization can improve decision quality as well as speed, with more mixed effects on other variables, for instance, decision confidence. Several moderators such as user and task characteristics have been investigated as part of this interaction, along with cognitive aspects as mediating processes. The article presents integrative insights based on research spanning multiple domains across the social and information sciences and provides impulses for prospective applications in the realm of managerial decision-making.},

One experiment compares a 50-min session to a 2-h session, observing that senior undergraduates generate more ideas and a greater variety of solutions with additional time, although high novelty solutions are developed within the ﬁrst 50 min. A second study ﬁnds that more novel solutions are generated after an incubation period, although it is at the expense of feasibility. Comparing the two studies shows that incubation generates a greater quantity of ideas, while extended time aids in high quality and novelty. Since the 50-min and 2-h groups generate similar numbers of high quality and high novelty solutions, a 50-min ideation period is eﬀective for developing high quality, novel solutions.

We establish the design space along the four axes of dimensionality, edge representation, node representation, and layout by examining existing implicit hierarchy visualization techniques. The survey is completed by casting some light into regions of the design space that have not yet been explored. Our design space is not a mere theoretical construct, but a practically usable tool for rapid visualization development.

Since visualizations can be used to support decision making - e.g., when choosing a house to buy or an employee to hire - a systematic bias could have important implications. In a first crowdsource experiment, we indeed partially replicated the attraction effect with three alternatives presented as a numerical table, and observed similar effects when they were presented as a scatterplot. In a second experiment, we investigated if the effect extends to larger sets of alternatives, where the number of alternatives is too large for numerical tables to be practical. Our findings indicate that the bias persists for larger sets of alternatives presented as scatterplots. We discuss implications for future research on how to further study and possibly alleviate the attraction effect.},

Finally, we investigated whether the anchoring bias in groups operated through a fast and early influence on individual preferences, or through biased information exchange.

	abstract = {Anchoring effect is the tendency to focus too heavily on one piece of information when making decisions. In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decision-making. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users' interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.},

	abstract = {Research and operational experience have shown that one of the major problems with pilot-automation interaction is a lack of mode awareness (i.e., the current and future status and behavior of the automation). As a result, pilots sometimes experience so-called automation surprises when the automation takes an unexpected action or fails to behave as anticipated. Alack of mode awareness and automation surprises can be viewed as symptoms of a mismatch between human and machine properties and capabilities. Changes in automation design can therefore be expected to affect the likelihood and nature of problems encountered by pilots. Previous studies have focused exclusively on early generation "glass cockpit" aircraft that were designed based on a similar automation philosophy. To find out whether similar difficulties with maintaining mode awareness are encountered on more advanced aircraft, a corpus of automation surprises was gathered from pilots of the Airbus A-320, an aircraft characterized by high levels of autonomy, authority, and complexity. To understand the underlying reasons for reported breakdowns in human-automation coordination, we also asked pilots about their monitoring strategies and their experiences with and attitude toward the unique design of flight controls on this aircraft.},

We term such silent but signiﬁcant failures visualization mirages. We describe a conceptual model of mirages and show how they can be generated at every stage of the visual analytics process. We adapt a methodology from software testing, metamorphic testing, as a way of automatically surfacing potential mirages at the visual encoding stage of analysis through modiﬁcations to the underlying data and chart speciﬁcation. We show that metamorphic testing can reliably identify mirages across a variety of chart types with relatively little prior knowledge of the data or the domain.},

In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist.

Experiments on the effects of delay on human performance are discussed, along with demonstrations of predictive displays to help the human overcome the delay. Supervisory control is shown to offer a variety of options, from switching to local impedance control upon contact with the environment to higher-level local automation. Wave transformation techniques to ameliorate the effects of delay are also described. Space teleoperations have tended to deal with the problem of time delay by avoiding it and not attempting to teleoperate from the ground. It is suggested that the US space effort might have gotten further ahead and at a lower cost with a greater is commitment to space teleoperation from the ground through the delay. Predictive display works well for free positioning. Local impedance control is recommended for control in contact with the environment, possibly accompanied by wave transformation techniques. Higher level supervisory control is always an option for sufficiently predictable tasks and will continue to improve with better sensors and task models.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Mainly, its visualization offered to the clinicians limited situation awareness (SA) to perceive, understand and predict the impacts on resource management and decision-making of an unusual flow of patients affected by the most severe form of coronavirus. To identify the SA requirements during a pandemic, we conducted goal-oriented interviews with 11 clinicians working in ICUs. The result is the design of an SA-oriented dashboard with 22 key indicators (KIs): 1 on the admission capacity, 15 at bedside and 6 displayed as statistics in the central area. We conducted a usability evaluation of the SA-oriented dashboard compared to the resource management dashboard with 6 clinicians. The results showed five usability improvements of the SA-oriented dashboard and five limitations.

	abstract = {The collection and visual analysis of large-scale data from complex systems, such as electronic health records or clickstream data, has become increasingly common across a wide range of industries. This type of retrospective visual analysis, however, is prone to a variety of selection bias effects, especially for high-dimensional data where only a subset of dimensions is visualized at any given time. The risk of selection bias is even higher when analysts dynamically apply filters or perform grouping operations during ad hoc analyses. These bias effects threaten the validity and generalizability of insights discovered during visual analysis as the basis for decision making. Past work has focused on bias transparency, helping users understand when selection bias may have occurred. However, countering the effects of selection bias via bias mitigation is typically left for the user to accomplish as a separate process. Dynamic reweighting (DR) is a novel computational approach to selection bias mitigation that helps users craft bias-corrected visualizations. This paper describes the DR workflow, introduces key DR visualization designs, and presents statistical methods that support the DR process. Use cases from the medical domain, as well as findings from domain expert user interviews, are also reported.},

Knowledge of this behavior is important, as research has shown that using examples too similar to the design problem or too familiar to the designer can cause design fixation and hinder creativity. Therefore, the current study was conducted to provide insights into these example retrieval processes by monitoring 18 professional designers during a 90-minute design task complemented by surveys and interviews for an in-depth understanding of user behavior.

We implement our analysis methods in reVISit, which enables analysts to explore participant interaction performance metrics and responses in the context of users’ analysis strategies. Replays of participant sessions can aid in identifying usability problems during pilot studies and make individual analysis processes salient. To demonstrate the applicability of reVISit to visualization studies, we analyze participant data from two published crowdsourced studies.

This paper explores this relationship privileging a practice perspective through a tentative model, which describes a “bubble-up” of ideas from practice to inform research and theory development, and an accompanying “trickle-down” of theory into practice. Interviews were conducted with interaction designers, which included a description of their use of design methods in practice, and their knowledge and use of two common design methods—affinity diagramming and the concept of affordance. Based on these interviews, potential relationships between theory and practice are explored through this model. Disseminating agents already common in HCI practice are addressed as possible mechanisms for the research community to understand practice more completely. Opportunities for future research, based on the use of the tentative model in a generative way, are considered.},

In this paper, we outline a rapprochement of these methods, which we term cognitive ethnography. The value of qualifying ethnography in this way is to emphasise systematically the differences between ethnography as a radial category and the kinds of legitimate method used to study work practices which are often referred to as ethnographic, but which in practice differ in important ways from prototypical ethnographic studies. Features of cognitive ethnography such as observational specificity, verifiability and purposivenes challenge many of the tenets of a pure ethnographic method, yet they are essential for studies that are undertaken to inform technological change. We illustrate our arguments with reference to a project to develop a tool for supporting design re-use in innovative design environments.},

The study outcomes are at least twofold: a common framework of metrics and approaches to overcome design fixation in a wide range of design problems and nonintuitive results for DbA approaches in design fixation and other related creativity metrics. The application of WordTree and SCAMPER shows that both methods yield increased novelty compared to a control, where the SCAMPER results are significantly higher than WordTree. It is also found that WordTree mitigates design fixation whereas SCAMPER appears to be ineffective for this purpose but effective to generate an increased quantity of novel ideas.

	abstract = {Objective
The aim of this study was to examine how task, social, and situational factors shape work patterns, information networks, and performance in spaceflight multiteam systems (MTSs).
Background
Human factors research has explored the task and individual characteristics that affect decisions regarding when and in what order people complete tasks. We extend this work to understand how the social and situational factors that arise when working in MTSs affect individual work patterns.
Methods
We conducted a complex multi-site space analog simulation with NASA over the course of 3 years. The MTS task required participants from four teams (Geology, Robotics, Engineering, and Human Factors) to collaborate to design a well on Mars. We manipulated the one-way communication delay between the crew and mission support: no time lag, 60-second lag, and 180-second lag.
Results
The study revealed that team and situational factors exert strong effects: members whose teams have less similar mental models, those whose teams prioritize their team goal over the MTS goal, and those working in social isolation and/or under communication delay engage longer on tasks. Time-on-task positively predicts MTS information networks, which in turn positively predict MTS performance when communication occurs with a delay, but not when it occurs in real-time.
Conclusion
Our findings contribute to research on task management in the context of working in teams and multiteam systems. Team and situational factors, along with task factors, shape task management behavior.
Application
Social and situational factors are important predictors of task management in team contexts such as spaceflight MTSs.},

	abstract = {Concepts related to visualization minimalism, such as ‘chartjunk’ and ‘data-ink’, have received significant attention in the visualization literature and have been subject to intense debate and disagreement. Much of the focus has been on determining whether and how nonessential visual elements influence comprehension and performance of users. Less attention has been placed on the perspectives of visualization practitioners, including the ways in which such concepts are used and understood within the context of a community of practice. In this paper, we investigate conversations on Twitter regarding visualization minimalism, focusing on the ways in which design knowledge is negotiated and applied. Our findings suggest that there is a vibrant community of practice engaged in deliberations on topics relating to visualization minimalism. We suggest more research should focus on visualization practice and the social dimensions of how design knowledge is negotiated and used.},

	abstract = {If you aren't using the term naturalistic decision making, or NDM, you soon will be. Even as a very young field, NDM has already had far-reaching applications in areas as diverse as management, aviation, health care, nuclear power, military command and control, corporate teamwork, and manufacturing.

Put simply, NDM is the way people use their experience to make decisions in the context of a job or task. Of particular interest to NDM researchers are the effects of high-stake consequences, shifting goals, incomplete information, time pressure, uncertainty, and other conditions that are present in most of today's work places and that add to the complexity of decision making. Applications of NDM research findings target decision aids and training that help people in their decision-making processes.

This book reports the findings of top NDM researchers, as well as many of their current applications. In addition, the book offers a historical perspective on the emergence of this new paradigm, describes recent theoretical and methodological advancements, and points to future developments. It was written for people interested in decision making research and applications relative to a diverse array of work settings and products such as human-computer interfaces, decision support systems, individual and team training, product designs, and organizational development and planning.},

Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.},

A psychological phenomenon that may occur during such utilization of external stimuli is design fixation, which is widely believed to adversely affect the ideation outcome. One of the difficulties in preventing or alleviating design fixation is that the designer may not easily detect or predict its occurrence during the mentally demanding task of ideation. In an effort to address the problem of design fixation, the current study develops a situation awareness (SA) support system, which helps the novice designer perceive and predict the occurrences of design fixation. The situation awareness support system (SASS) is empirically evaluated in its utility in mitigating design fixation. The study result shows that the situation awareness support system can help the novice designer to mitigate design fixation, while not influencing significant impact on the ideation performance.},

The first experiment investigated participants’ abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

	abstract = {In the online world, user engagement refers to the quality of the user experience that emphasizes the positive aspects of the interaction with a web application and, in particular, the phenomena associated with wanting to use that application longer and frequently. User engagement is a key concept in the design of web applications, motivated by the observation that successful applications are not just used, but are engaged with. Users invest time, attention, and emotion in their use of technology, and it must satisfy both their pragmatic and hedonic needs and expectations. Measurement is key for evaluating the success of information technologies, and is particularly critical to any web applications, from media to e-commerce sites, as it informs our understanding of user needs and expectations, system design and functionality. For instance, news portals have become a very popular destination for web users who read news online. As there is great potential for online news consumption but also serious competition among news portals, online news providers strive to develop effective and efficient strategies to engage users longer in their sites. Measuring how users engage with a news portal can inform the portal if there are areas that need to be enhanced, if current optimization techniques are still effective, if the published material triggers user behavior that causes engagement with the portal, etc. Understanding the above is dependent upon the ability to measure user engagement. The focus of this tutorial is how user engagement is currently being measured and future considerations for its measurement.

	abstract = {Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental "shortcuts"). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.},

We present Land.Info, a proof-of-concept software that allows users to design open spaces with 3D visualization and see the subsequent costs and environmental consequences. To assess how the public engages in design discussion with 3D visualization, we organized three community design workshops for developing a vacant lot. We found that 3D visualization 1) promotes public ideation of user stories around objects, and 2) prohibits ideas beyond spatial design elements. Future research will investigate whether it is possible to aggregate more diverse public aspirations, whether or not visual realism sets expectations for designs, and the potential impacts of expanding the software user base for neighborhood planning cases.},

Interviews were conducted with practitioners in a range of companies, with differing levels of expertise and educational backgrounds represented. Interviewees were asked about their use of design methods in practice, and the methods they considered to be core of their practice; in addition, they were asked what set of methods would be vital for beginning designers joining their company. Based on these interviews, I evaluate practitioner conceptions of design methods, proposing an appropriationoriented mindset that drives the use of tool knowledge, supporting designers’ practice in a variety of corporate contexts.

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization — while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary.},

We present IdeaSquares, a design concept text generation tool for supporting the ideation process. We used text-generation artificial intelligence (AI) that was fine-tuned on the Red Dot design award winners’ data to show newly generated design examples as search results. To understand how young designers use concept text generation tool for the design ideation, we conducted a comparative user study where participants used two versions, generative querying and conventional searching mode, of the tools during the ideation task. Our findings revealed that (1) texts are combined and reinterpreted to different meanings during the ideation and (2) ideas are developed by finding appropriate keywords that fit to a primitive idea when the generative querying mode was used. Based on the tool development and the study results, we discuss how generative texts empowered by AI can be used as a source of inspiration and further support the design ideation.},

	abstract = {Design fixation experiments often report that participants exposed to an example solution generate fewer ideas than those who were not. This reduced‘idea fluency’is generally explained as participants’creativity being constrained by the example they have seen. However, the inclusion of an example also introduces other factors that might affect idea fluency in the experiments. We here offer an additional explanation for these results: participants not exposed to the example tend to generate ideas with little elaboration, while the level of detail in the example encourages a similar level of elaboration among stimulated participants. Because idea elaboration is time consuming, non-stimulated participants record more ideas overall. We investigated this hypothesis by reanalyzing data from three different studies; in two of them we found that non-stimulated participants generated more ideas and more ideas containing only text, whilst stimulated participants generated ideas that were more elaborated. Based on the creativity literature, we provide several explanations for the differences in results found across studies. Our findings and explanations have implications for the interpretation of creativity experiments reported to date and for the design of future studies.},

	abstract = {Understanding a visualization is a multi-level process. A reader must extract and extrapolate from numeric facts, understand how those facts apply to both the context of the data and other potential contexts, and draw or evaluate conclusions from the data. A well-designed visualization should support each of these levels of understanding. We diagnose levels of understanding of visualized data by adapting Bloom’s taxonomy, a common framework from the education literature. We describe each level of the framework and provide examples for how it can be applied to evaluate the efﬁcacy of data visualizations along six levels of knowledge acquisition knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. We present three case studies showing that this framework expands on existing methods to comprehensively measure how a visualization design facilitates a viewer’s understanding of visualizations. Although Bloom’s original taxonomy suggests a strong hierarchical structure for some domains, we found few examples of dependent relationships between performance at different levels for our three case studies. If this level-independence holds across new tested visualizations, the taxonomy could serve to inspire more targeted evaluations of levels of understanding that are relevant to a communication goal.},

Good ideas, it is believed, are the base for creative design processes. In this study we follow ideas as communicated in the studio during a semester-long exercise. We ask: when and how are ideas inﬂuential? Which ideas qualify as good ideas, and how are they developed? How do they lead to a good product? Previous research, which is brieﬂy reviewed here, shows that inﬂuential (critical, in our terminology) ideas share a fundamental property: they are richly interlinked with other ideas. In this paper we substantiate this tenet by showing that this is also the case in the design studio. In addition, we look at other properties of design ideas and correlate them with students’ project grades, which are indicative of successful, and creative, design outcomes. Ó 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {As reﬂected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efﬁcient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do “rational” decisions as deﬁned by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (“Which heuristics do people use in which situations?”) and the prescriptive question (“When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?”), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

In this paper we present Circular, an interactive exploration environment to visualize event-based networks and support research in digital humanities through visualization of historical subjects in space and time. Our radial design is the result of iterative collaboration with domain experts, and we discuss the process of collaborative development and exploration of public music festivities in Vienna as an example of immersive development methodology. We validate our approach by means of both domain and visualization expert interviews and show the potential of this approach in supporting the visual exploration of historical subjects. We discuss our design rationales, visual encodings, and interactions as to allow the reproducibility of this approach within a framework of transdisciplinary collaboration with digital humanities.},

Yet there is something paradoxical about this development: ostensibly, many of these highly successful people have moved out of the ﬁeld of “design.” This phenomenon deserves deeper consideration: how do design practices spread across society? What key design practices are particularly relevant to the problems of today’s society? Should what these people do still be considered design? To answer these questions, ﬁrst we need to understand various ways that practices can be adopted and adapted from one discipline to the other. Problem framing emerges as a key design practice that can be adopted and adapted to other ﬁelds, and one which provides a valuable alternative to conventional types of problem solving. An example will illustrate how this frame creation allows practitioners to approach today’s open, complex, dynamic, networked problems in new and fruitful ways. The paper goes on to argue that the practice of frame creation is still part and parcel of the domain of design, and explores how design can develop into an expanded ﬁeld of practice.},

Because such systems rely on incorporating implicit and explicit user feedback, they are particularly susceptible to the injection and propagation of human biases. To ultimately guard against the potentially negative effects of systems biased by human users, we must ﬁrst qualify what we mean by the term bias. Thus, in this paper we describe four different perspectives on human bias that are particularly relevant to visual analytics. We discuss the interplay of human and computer system biases, particularly their roles in mixed-initiative systems. Given that the term bias is used to describe several different concepts, our goal is to facilitate a common language in research and development efforts by encouraging researchers to mindfully choose the perspective(s) considered in their work.},

Verbal protocols (N ϭ 176) were analyzed for participants’ reasons for reference to the examples. In Experiment 2, fixation to examples was evaluated in nonverbalizing participants (N ϭ 60).

	abstract = {In visualization research, evaluation is a crucial step to assess the impact of visualization on decision-making. Existing work often gauges how good a visualization is by measuring its ability to induce accurate and fast judgment. While those measures provide some insight into the eﬃcacy of a graph, underlying cognitive processes responsible for reasoning and judgment are often overlooked when they can have signiﬁcant implications for visualization recommendation. Cognitive processes do not need to be a black box. There exist multiple models that explain decision processes, such as theories from behavioral economics and dual process theories. In this chapter, we compare and contrast diﬀerent models and advocate for integrating a dual-process approach to visualization evaluation in the context of decision-making. Our goal is to guide visualization researchers to adopt a more granular approach to evaluation at the intersection of visualization and cognitive science.},

However, few experiments have evaluated how timeline shape influences task performance. We present the design and results of a controlled experiment run on Amazon Mechanical Turk (n=192) in which we evaluate how timeline shape affects task completion time, correctness, and user preference. We tested 12 combinations of 4 shapes --- horizontal line, vertical line, circle, and spiral — and 3 data types — recurrent, non-recurrent, and mixed event sequences. We found good evidence that timeline shape meaningfully affects user task completion time but not correctness and that users have a strong shape preference. Building on our results, we present design guidelines for creating effective timeline visualizations based on user task and data types.

In this paper, we describe a crowdsourced experiment, comparing node-link diagrams with onnode encoding and adjacency matrices with juxtaposed tables. We ﬁnd that node-link diagrams are best suited for tasks that require close integration between the network topology and a few attributes. Adjacency matrices perform well for tasks related to clusters and when many attributes need to be considered. We also reﬂect on our method of using validated designs for empirically evaluating complex, interactive visualizations in a crowdsourced setting.

Repeated exposure to examples interspersed with prototyping leads to even better results. However, late exposure to examples increases conformity, but does not improve creativity.},

For missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), delayed communication will limit mission control’s ability to support the space crew in real time. During off-nominal situations, where no procedures have been developed prior to missions, crews must develop responses in real time and may increasingly rely on automation. A systematic approach was used to model the domain knowledge of the collaborative decision-making process of current space operations, extrapolate to missions beyond LEO, and develop the design requirements for a CA. Document analysis and interviews were conducted to create an abstraction hierarchy and a decision-action diagram of the cognitive functions currently performed by space crew, mission control, and onboard automation. These domain models were extrapolated to missions beyond LEO by identifying the breakpoints where current decision-making processes would break down due to increased communication delay between mission control and the space crew. Design requirements were identified for future CA systems that offer real-time decision-making support to mitigate the negative effect of limited support in off-nominal situations. The approach developed for this research can be generalized to identify the design requirements for future support systems in domains beyond space operations.},

Previous HCI research on decision support systems (DSS) has improved the information visualization aspect of DSS information design, but has somewhat overlooked the cognitive aspect of decision-making, namely that human reasoning is heuristic and reﬂects systematic errors or cognitive biases. We report on an empirical study of two cognitive biases: conservatism and loss aversion. Two remediation techniques recommended by previous research were tested: the expected return method, an actuarial-inspired approach presenting objective metrics; and bootstrapping, a technique successful in improving judgment consistency. The results show that the two biases can occur simultaneously and can have a huge impact on decision-making. The results also show that the two debiasing techniques are only partly effective. These ﬁndings suggest a need for more research on debiasing, and indicate some directions for exploring debiasing techniques and building decision support systems.},

A key challenge of this study is the evaluation of generated designs and the retrieval of best ones, hence we put together an evaluation protocol associating automatic metrics and human experimental studies. We show that our proposed creativity loss yields better overall appreciation than the one employed in Creative Adversarial Networks. In the end, about 61\% of our images are thought to be created by human designers rather than by a computer while also being considered original per our human subject experiments, and our proposed loss scores the highest compared to existing losses in both novelty and likability.},

	abstract = {The importance of effective design management, and the significance of the early stages of the design process, are well recognised in other design-led industries but little understood in the garment industry. In the textile industry designers use other garments, photographs of garments, art objects and natural phenomena as inspiration for their designs. It is generally recognised that these sources of inspiration help designers to create features of individual designs, such as shape details in tailoring or pattern motifs in knitwear. But sources of inspiration also play a powerful role at the beginning of the design process, in research and strategic collection planning. They also play an essential role in the communication of design ideas, both among designers, and between designers and managers and buyers. Gathering sources of inspiration costs time and money. Many companies attempt to save money by limiting the designers travelling time to see shops and shows, they do not purchase forecasting materials. This has a number of harmful effects on the design process: it reduces the designers' job satisfaction and accelerates staff turnover; and it limits the range of ideas designers use, so that designs become stereotyped as designers grow stale, and the company loses business. The cost of travel to shops and fashion shows and the purchase of a collection of art books and CD-ROM is small compared to the potential profit on a successful design.},

The two studies reviewed in this paper investigated how three independent variables likely to be present in many design environments affect design fixation. The first study found that working with physical prototypes significantly reduced fixation effects, and that working in groups can reduce fixation effects under certain conditions. The second study found that brief interruptions in designers' thought processes during the initial states of the design process also reduce fixation effects. I conclude by discussing what the data from both studies may indicate about the theoretical causes of fixation effects, and what designers might do to prevent fixation from affecting their creative output.},

A prior study has shown that physical models have the potential to supplement designers’ erroneous mental models; whereas a few observational studies have shown that physical models can cause a high degree of fixation under certain circumstances. At the same time, a previous controlled study fails to show the presence of fixation in idea generation with physical models. This study hypothesizes that prior observed fixation in physical modeling is due to Sunk Cost Effect, which is the reluctance to choose a different path of action once significant money, time or effort is invested in present one. Consistent with the prior study, this study also hypothesizes that physical models supplement designers’ mental models. These hypotheses are investigated through a controlled between-subject experiment. The results show that cost of building plays a vital role in fixation and fixation is not likely inherent in physical representations. Results also show that physical models supplement designers’ mental models and lead them to higher quality ideas.},

	abstract = {Design educators often comment on the difficulties that result from a premature commitment by students to a solution to a design problem. Similarly practitioners can find it difficult to move away from an idea they have developed or precedents in a field. In the psychology of problem solving this effect is called functional fixedness or fixation. It is not surprising that these effects" should occur in design problem solving. However, while these types of issues have been discussed in the context of design, there has been little systematic evidence available about whether or not and under what conditions design fixation does occur. The paper reviews the results of a series of recent experiments which begin to address these issues. The results of the experiments are examined in terms of what insights they provide into the design process, what implications they have for design education and how they relate to the larger and more general area of human problem solving.

This holds, in particular, for time-varying multichannel EEG data. No existing method can successfully visualize simultaneous information from all channels in use at all time steps. To address this problem, a new visualization method is presented based on the parallel coordinate method and making use of a tiled organization. This tiled organization employs a two-dimensional row-column representation, rather than a one-dimensional arrangement in columns as used for classical parallel coordinates. The usefulness of the new method, referred to as tiled parallel coordinates (TPC), is demonstrated by a particular type of EEG data. It can be applied to an arbitrary number of time steps, handling the maximum number of channels currently in use. An extensive user evaluation shows that, for a typical EEG assessment task, data evaluation by the TPC method is faster than by an existing clinical EEG visualization method, without loss of information. The generality of the TPC method makes it widely applicable to other time-varying multivariate data types.},

To gain insight into this phenomenon, we propose the concept ‘decisive constraints’ based on a review of current, but dispersed, studies into creativity constraints. We build decisive constraints on two deﬁnitional conditions related to radical decision-making and creative turning points. To test our concept analytically and ensure its relevance to creative practice, we apply the two deﬁnitional conditions to three media fac¸ade installation projects in which our interaction design research lab has been involved. In accord with insights from these case analyses, we argue that decisive constraints may inform current research into design processes and act as a creative resource for practitioners, not only in interaction design but, we assume, also across related creative domains and disciplines.},

	abstract = {Visualizations—visual representations of information, depicted in graphics—are studied by researchers in numerous ways, ranging from the study of the basic principles of creating visualizations, to the cognitive processes underlying their use, as well as how visualizations communicate complex information (such as in medical risk or spatial patterns). However, findings from different domains are rarely shared across domains though there may be domain-general principles underlying visualizations and their use. The limited cross-domain communication may be due to a lack of a unifying cognitive framework. This review aims to address this gap by proposing an integrative model that is grounded in models of visualization comprehension and a dual-process account of decision making. We review empirical studies of decision making with static two-dimensional visualizations motivated by a wide range of research goals and find significant direct and indirect support for a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations. Consistent with a dual-process model, the first type of visualization decision mechanism produces fast, easy, and computationally light decisions with visualizations. The second facilitates slower, more contemplative, and effortful decisions with visualizations. We illustrate the utility of a dual-process account of decision making with visualizations using four cross-domain findings that may constitute universal visualization principles. Further, we offer guidance for future research, including novel areas of exploration and practical recommendations for visualization designers based on cognitive theory and empirical findings.},

Previous studies have shown that extreme minimalism is not always best, and that visual embellishments can be useful depending on the context.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 data visualization practitioners, investigating how they understand chartjunk and the factors that inﬂuence how and when they make use of embellishments. Our investigation uncovers a broad and pluralistic understanding of chartjunk among practitioners, and foregrounds a variety of personal and situated factors that inﬂuence the use of chartjunk beyond context. We highlight the personal nature of design practice, and discuss the need for more practice-led research to better understand the ways in which concepts like chartjunk are interpreted and used by practitioners.},

Design/methodology/approach Using the professional judgment framework of KPMG (2011), this study performs an analysis of whether and how five major types of cognitive biases (framing, availability, overconfidence, anchoring and confirmation) may occur in an auditor’s data visualization and how such biases potentially compromise audit quality. Findings The analysis suggests that data visualization can trigger and/or aggravate the common cognitive biases in audit. If not properly addressed, such biases may adversely affect auditors' judgment and decision-making. Practical implications To ensure that data visualization improves audit efficiency and effectiveness, it is essential that auditors are aware of and successfully address cognitive biases in data visualization. Six practical approaches to debias cognitive biases in auditors’ visualization are proposed: using data visualization to complement rather than supplement traditional audit evidence; positioning data visualization to support rather than replace sophisticated analytics tools; using a dashboard with multiple dimensions; using both visualized and tabular data in analyses; assigning experienced audit staff; and providing pre-audit tutorials on cognitive bias and visualization. Originality/value The study raises awareness of psychological issues in an audit setting.},

We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully beneﬁt from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study.

This paper reviews the relevant literature, collecting many of these studies together for the ﬁrst time. This allows the texts to be compared, their common themes to be identiﬁed and future work to be planned. More of such studies are necessary to increase the breadth and depth of accounts of creative design. This would permit connections and contrasts to be made and promote methodological diversity within research on inspiration and ﬁxation. Ó 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Systems of precedence knowledge are in good currency at present as they are expected to enhance creativity in the early conceptual phases of the design process by interacting with given design contexts. This paper presents the view that this is a false expectation: the use of precedents is counterproductive with respect to design creativity. It is proposed that creativity can be promoted by architectural and other exemplars, but that they are most instrumental when partial and more ambiguous and manipulable than holistic exemplars such as precedents. It is claimed that open-ended computational systems of references have the potential to enhance creative designing, and they can do so regardless of the particular culture or micro-culture within which a designer operates.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with three questions: How do decision makers conceptualize uncertainty? How do decision makers cope with uncertainty? Are there systematic relationships between different conceptualizations of uncertainty and different methods of coping? To answer these questions we analyzed 102 self-reports of decision-making under uncertainty with an inclusive method of classifying conceptualizations of uncertainty and coping mechanisms developed from the decision-making literature. The results showed that decision makers distinguished among three types of uncertainty: inadequate understanding, incomplete information, and undifferentiated alternatives. To these they applied five strategies of coping: reducing uncertainty, assumption-based reasoning, weighing pros and cons of competing alternatives, suppressing uncertainty, and forestalling. Inadequate understanding was primarily managed by reduction, incomplete information was primarily managed by assumption-based reasoning, and conflict among alternatives was primarily managed by weighing pros and cons. Based on these results and findings from previous studies of naturalistic decision-making we hypothesized a R.A.W.F.S. (Reduction, Assumption-based reasoning, Weighing pros and cons, Suppression, and Hedging) heuristic, which describes the strategies that decision makers apply to different types of uncertainty in naturalistic settings.},

Alhough design in the domain of human-computer interaction has been widely investigated, the focus of research has been mainly on the user’s role and several authors refer to the need for a deeper understanding of the increasingly complex interaction design processes. This paper suggests a conceptual framework for interaction design that accommodates and unifies different perspectives from general design research while considering the specificities of the domain. Within the framework, description and analysis is done through the lens of design spaces, design artefacts, and refinement relationships between design artefacts. The framework extends existing concepts of design spaces by introducing complex spaces which acknowledge that design is rarely an individual activity but is more often undertaken by teams of designers. The framework also offers a distinction between design options into alternatives and variants to better describe and guide processes of idea generation and a convergence within, and between different sub-spaces and sub-teams. Different types of refinement between design artefacts are also discussed.},

While constructive “bottomup” tools promote a hands-on, user-driven design process that enables a deep understanding and control of the visual mapping, automated tools are more efﬁcient and allow people to rapidly explore complex alternative designs, often at the cost of transparency. We investigate how to design visualization tools that support a user-driven, transparent design process while enabling efﬁciency and automation, through a series of design workshops that looked at how both visualization experts and novices approach this problem. Participants produced a variety of solutions that range from example-based approaches expanding constructive visualization to solutions in which the visualization tool infers solutions on behalf of the designer, e.g., based on data attributes. On a higher level, these ﬁndings highlight agency and granularity as dimensions that can guide the design of visualization tools in this space.},

After reading a text, the pairs were given a learning task in one of four conditions: Textual, Concrete visualized, Abstract visualized, and Combined. Post-test and retention test results showed no significant differences. There were some significant differences on the evaluation questionnaire. Combining text and different types of visualizations in learning tasks does not necessarily enhance history learning. Possible explanations given are the ecological setting, the semiotics of the domain of history – that are not defined clearly – and the difficulty of unequivocally visualizing historical concepts},

However, existing formalisms focus on operating on a single visualization instead of multiple visualizations, making it challenging to perform analysis tasks such as sorting and clustering visualizations. Through a systematic analysis of previous work, we abstract visualization-related tasks into mathematical operators such as union and propose a design space of visualization operations. We realize the design by developing ComputableViz, a library that supports operations on multiple visualization specifications. To demonstrate its usefulness and extensibility, we present multiple usage scenarios concerning processing and analyzing visualization, such as generating visualization embeddings and automatically making visualizations accessible. We conclude by discussing research opportunities and challenges for managing and exploiting the massive visualizations on the web.},

Accurately and effectively measuring system performance of an HMT is crucial for moving the design of these systems forward. Metrics are the enabling tools to devise a benchmark in any system and serve as an evaluation platform for assessing the performance, along with the verification and validation, of a system. Currently, there is no agreed-upon set of benchmark metrics for developing HMT systems. Therefore, identification and classification of common metrics are imperative to create a benchmark in the HMT field. The key focus of this review is to conduct a detailed survey aimed at identification of metrics employed in different segments of HMT and to determine the common metrics that can be used in the future to benchmark HMTs. We have organized this review as follows: identification of metrics used in HMTs until now, and classification based on functionality and measuring techniques. Additionally, we have also attempted to analyze all the identified metrics in detail while classifying them as theoretical, applied, real-time, non-real-time, measurable, and observable metrics. We conclude this review with a detailed analysis of the identified common metrics along with their usage to benchmark HMTs.},

Using a custom-built visual analytic system, we presented users with news content from social media accounts from a variety of news outlets, including outlets engaged in distributing misinformation. We conducted controlled experiments to study decision-making regarding the veracity of these news outlets and tested the role of conﬁrmation bias (the tendency to ignore contradicting information) and uncertainty of information on human decision-making processes. Our ﬁndings reveal that the presence of conﬂicting information, presented to users in the form of cues, impacts the ability to judge the veracity of news in systematic ways. We also ﬁnd that even instructing participants to explicitly disconﬁrm given hypotheses does not signiﬁcantly impact their decision-making regarding misinformation when compared to a control condition. Our ﬁndings have the potential to inform the design of visual analytics systems so that they may be used to mitigate the effects of cognitive biases and stymie the spread of misinformation on social media.},

	abstract = {The importance of interaction to Information Visualization (InfoVis) and, in particular, of the interplay between interactivity and cognition is widely recognized [12, 15, 32, 55, 70]. This interplay, combined with the demands from increasingly large and complex datasets, is driving the increased significance of interaction in InfoVis. In parallel, there have been rapid advances in many facets of interaction technologies. However, InfoVis interactions have yet to take full advantage of these new possibilities in interaction technologies, as they largely still employ the traditional desktop, mouse, and keyboard setup of WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, and a Pointer) interfaces. In this paper, we reflect more broadly about the role of more “natural” interactions for InfoVis and provide opportunities for future research. We discuss and relate general HCI interaction models to existing InfoVis interaction classifications by looking at interactions from a novel angle, taking into account the entire spectrum of interactions. Our discussion of InfoVis-specific interaction design considerations helps us identify a series of underexplored attributes of interaction that can lead to new, more “natural,” interaction techniques for InfoVis.},

	abstract = {We investigate using generated decorative art as a source of inspiration for design tasks. Using a visual similarity search for image retrieval, the {\textbackslash}emph\{Camera Obscurer\} app enables rapid searching of tens of thousands of generated abstract images of various types. The seed for a visual similarity search is a given image, and the retrieved generated images share some visual similarity with the seed. Implemented in a hand-held device, the app empowers users to use photos of their surroundings to search through the archive of generated images and other image archives. Being abstract in nature, the retrieved images supplement the seed image rather than replace it, providing different visual stimuli including shapes, colours, textures and juxtapositions, in addition to affording their own interpretations. This approach can therefore be used to provide inspiration for a design task, with the abstract images suggesting new ideas that might give direction to a graphic design project. We describe a crowdsourcing experiment with the app to estimate user confidence in retrieved images, and we describe a pilot study where Camera Obscurer provided inspiration for a design task. These experiments have enabled us to describe future improvements, and to begin to understand sources of visual inspiration for design tasks.},

However, these features shield people from lower-level visualization design steps, such as the speciﬁc mapping of data points to visuals. In contrast, recent research promotes constructive visualization where individual data units and visuals are directly manipulated. We present a qualitative study comparing people’s visualization processes using two visualization tools: one promoting a top-down approach to visualization construction (Tableau Desktop) and one implementing a bottom-up constructive visualization approach (iVoLVER). Our results show how the two approaches inﬂuence: 1) the visualization process, 2) decisions on the visualization design, 3) the feeling of control and authorship, and 4) the willingness to explore alternative designs. We discuss the complex trade-offs between the two approaches and outline considerations for designing better visualization tools.},

Disrupting the UX process by introducing novel digital tools such as artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve efficiency and accuracy, while creating more innovative and creative solutions. Thus, understanding how AI can be leveraged for UX has important research and practical implications. Design/methodology/approach This article builds on a systematic literature review approach and aims to understand how AI is used in UX design today, as well as uncover some prominent themes for future research. Through a process of selection and filtering, 46 research articles are analysed, with findings synthesized based on a user-centred design and development process. Findings The authors’ analysis shows how AI is leveraged in the UX design process at different key areas. Namely, these include understanding the context of use, uncovering user requirements, aiding solution design, and evaluating design, and for assisting development of solutions. The authors also highlight the ways in which AI is changing the UX design process through illustrative examples. Originality/value While there is increased interest in the use of AI in organizations, there is still limited work on how AI can be introduced into processes that depend heavily on human creativity and input. Thus, the authors show the ways in which AI can enhance such activities and assume tasks that have been typically performed by humans.},

	abstract = {Recently, as people have to deal with increasingly complex information, the anchoring effect tends to be one issue of concern. It is a phenomenon that prior information might bias cognition and result in estimation deviation. To understand the behavioral characteristics and underlying neural mechanisms of the anchoring effect in visualization, a 2 × 2 within-subject experiment was performed under four conditions: lower anchor with a number, higher anchor with a number, lower anchor without a number and higher anchor without a number. We conducted a pie-chart reading task, which was to estimate the value of the target pie chart. Participants’ perception and judgement under different conditions was examined by using event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioral metrics. The behavioral results showed that a significant anchoring effect was confirmed only under the anchor with a number condition, indicating the anchor without a concrete number is helpful in mitigating the anchoring effect. The ERPs results indicated that the anchor without a number elicited larger P2 and P300 amplitudes than that with a number. This study contributes to the understanding of the neural processing of view transitions in data visualization by providing electrophysiological evidence of this cognitive process. Moreover, the neuro-design method suggested in this study use P2 and P300 as potential indicators of anchoring bias, which could help information visualization researchers to gain deeper insight on the underlying cause of human performance. The recommendations from this study for the design of information visualization with multiple views might be that avoiding the use of concrete numerical data and providing graphic representations could mitigate the anchoring effect.},

Interactive data visualization can play a critical role in allowing domain experts to select and analyze data from these large collections. However, there is a critical mismatch between the very large number of dimensions in complex real-world datasets and the much smaller number of dimensions that can be concurrently visualized using modern techniques. This gap in dimensionality can result in high levels of selection bias that go unnoticed by users. The bias can in turn threaten the very validity of any subsequent insights. In this paper, we present Adaptive Contextualization (AC), a novel approach to interactive visual data selection that is speciﬁcally designed to combat the invisible introduction of selection bias. Our approach (1) monitors and models a users visual data selection activity, (2) computes metrics over that model to quantify the amount of selection bias after each step, (3) visualizes the metric results, and (4) provides interactive tools that help users assess and avoid bias-related problems. We also share results from a user study which demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.},

In this paper, we present a user study that evaluates the perception of uncertainty amongst four of the most commonly used techniques for visualizing uncertainty in one-dimensional and two-dimensional data. The techniques evaluated are traditional errorbars, scaled size of glyphs, color-mapping on glyphs, and color-mapping of uncertainty on the data surface. The study uses generated data that was designed to represent the systematic and random uncertainty components. Twenty-seven users performed two types of search tasks and two types of counting tasks on 1D and 2D datasets. The search tasks involved finding data points that were least or most uncertain. The counting tasks involved counting data features or uncertainty features. A 4 times 4 full-factorial ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between the techniques used and the type of tasks assigned for both datasets indicating that differences in performance between the four techniques depended on the type of task performed. Several one-way ANOVAs were computed to explore the simple main effects. Bonferronni's correction was used to control for the family-wise error rate for alpha-inflation. Although we did not find a consistent order among the four techniques for all the tasks, there are several findings from the study that we think are useful for uncertainty visualization design. We found a significant difference in user performance between searching for locations of high and searching for locations of low uncertainty. Errorbars consistently underperformed throughout the experiment. Scaling the size of glyphs and color-mapping of the surface performed reasonably well. The efficiency of most of these techniques were highly dependent on the tasks performed. We believe that these findings can be used in future uncertainty visualization design. In addition, the framework developed in this user study presents a structured approach to evaluate uncertainty visualization techniques, as well as provides a basis for future research in uncertainty visualization.},

	abstract = {Earthquakes, lightning, and history-changing ideas are classic examples of powerful, unpredictable forces of nature. These sorts of phenomena have been difficult to explain and predict, an often frustrating fact as humans try to understand and control the significant influences in our lives. Historically, such phenomena have been attributed to supernatural sources, such as the Muses or various deities. And yet, as scientific inquiry continues to focus on such problems, we begin to make progress, albeit incremental, in comprehending such unpredictable occurrences. Earthquakes and lightning serve as analogies for the phenomenon referred to as insight. As such, these analogies may help us better understand where ideas come from; in each case, the rare, and potentially powerful phenomenon occurs unexpectedly, yet, as we learn more, it becomes better understood. Lightning is an electrical phenomenon, caused by particles colliding, and building up large electrical fields in the clouds. Earthquakes occur at the edges of tectonic plates, as the Earth releases its heat. Thus, we may begin to understand what causes insight, even though we cannot as yet predict specific occurrences of new insights. Analogies may not provide fully developed solutions to problems, but they can help us restructure our thinking about certain problems. Problem restructuring is especially appropriate when fixation obstructs problem solving. In this paper, we will explain a few of the fundamentals about human insight experiences, particularly in relation to what have been termed incubation effects. Putting a fixated problem aside can be helpful, and new ideas encountered during fixation can sometimes trigger new insights, particularly if useful analogies help resolve fixation. How does one overcome the counterproductive effects of fixation? We suggest a three-pronged approach to this problem: 1. Forgetting fixation, 2. Redefining problems, and 3. Using clues or hints to provoke new ideas. We will explain each of these ideas, in brief, after providing a background for insight, incubation, and fixation.},

	abstract = {Designers implement a variety of models and representations during the design process, yet little is known about the cognitive impacts of various representations. This study focuses on how physical models can assist novices in mitigating design fixation on undesirable features. During idea generation, designers tend to fixate on examples they encounter or on their own initial ideas. The first hypothesis states that designers tend to duplicate features of provided examples. The second hypothesis states that this fixation can be mitigated with appropriate warnings. The last hypothesis is that building and testing physical models can help designers in mitigating fixation. To investigate these theories, a quasi-experiment is conducted as part of a freshman class project. Students design, build and test stunt cars in three different experimental conditions, each receiving a different pictorial example: an effective example, a flawed example and a flawed example with warnings about the flaws. The results show that in all the conditions, designers duplicate undesirable features from their examples, even when they received warnings about the flawed features. Copying these flawed features creates more complicated and less effective designs. However, through the physical testing of their designs, participants identify and fix the design flaws. These results indicate that existing designs and experiences have the potential to limit innovation and that designers need to be trained with effective methods for mitigating design fixation. Building prototypes can help designers in identifying the flawed features and in reducing design fixation; hence, the use of physical models in engineering design needs to be encouraged.},

	abstract = {How do ideas evolve in the context of collaborative design? This research explores the framing strategies and tools involved in the co-construction of a shared understanding in the early stages of a design project. We observed a team of four industrial design students working to design a popup shop. We found that, while the key design elements of the solution were present from the early stages of discussion, they were continually framed and reframed through intense verbal discussion supported by sketching reflection-in-action (individual or collective) that help each team member make sense about the popup shop branding, user experience, visibility, structure, etc. The design ideas were crystallized at the end of the fourth working session. The research identifies patterns of framing, deframing and reframing of ideas that emerged from different symbolic elements associated with a brand, allowing students to design customized, non-standard, impressive and complex forms. Linking these patterns with specific ‘designerly actions’ led us to develop an empirically grounded model of the framing cycle. This model extends previous work of Schôn and Dorst and Valkenburg to specifically take into account collaborative design situations. In such situations, discussion among team members plays a vital role in clarifying, explaining, and interpreting as well as in encouraging reflection and critique.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a framework that supports the detection and mitigation of cognitive biases in visual analytics environments for criminal analysis. Criminal analysts often use visual analytics environments for their analysis of large data sets, for gaining insights on criminal events and patterns of criminal events, and for drawing conclusions and making decisions. However, due to the nature of human cognition, these cognitive processes may lead to systematic errors, so-called cognitive biases. The most prominent and relevant cognitive bias in the intelligence field is the confirmation bias, in which an analyst disproportionally considers and selects information that supports the initial expectation and hypothesis. The framework presented in this paper describes a model, how the possible occurence of the confirmation bias can be detected automatically, while the analyst makes use of the visual environment. Moreover, based on this information, different feedback methods are employed that support and encourage the mitigation of the confirmation bias. This framework is in a work-in-progress state and contains research objectives and directions, the framework design, initial implementations, plans for further development and integration, as well as user-centric evaluation.},

Nonetheless, recent work has begun to approach this problem by proposing theoretical computational metrics that are applied to user interaction sequences to measure bias in real-time. In this paper, we implement and apply these computational metrics in the context of anchoring bias. First, We present the results of a formative study that examining how the metrics can capture anchoring bias in real-time during a visual analytic task. Next, We present lessons learned in the form of considerations for applying the metrics in a visual analytic tool.

This results in a clear need to bring these different aspects together under the common hood of a general design space of visualization tasks, which we propose in this paper. Our design space consists of five design dimensions that characterize the main aspects of tasks and that have so far been distributed across different task descriptions.

In a first study, we show how applying a Bayesian cognition model to a simple visualization scenario indicates that people’s judgments are consistent with a hypothesis that they are doing approximate Bayesian inference. In a second study, we evaluate how sensitive our observations of Bayesian behavior are to different techniques for eliciting people subjective distributions, and to different datasets. We find that people don’t behave consistently with Bayesian predictions for large sample size datasets, and this difference cannot be explained by elicitation technique. In a final study, we show how normative Bayesian inference can be used as an evaluation framework for visualizations, including of uncertainty.},

The line between manipulation and persuasion strategies is often blurred, leading to legal and ethical concerns. This paper examines the tension between persuasive UX practices and manipulative designs. UX/UI design professionals (n=22), split into eight focus groups, conducted design activities on two fctitious scenarios. We qualitatively analysed their discussions regarding strategies for infuencing user behaviours and their underlying reasoning. Our fndings reveal a combination of classical UI design strategies like sticky interfaces and incentives as their most common practice to infuence user behaviour. We also unveil that trust, transparency, and user autonomy act as guiding principles for the professionals in assessing their ideas. However, a thorough approach is missing; despite a general user-frst attitude, they feel constrained by contextual factors. We explain how the tensions between principles and context contribute to manipulative designs online.},

These challenges exist at the intersection of many diferent technology professions that are rapidly evolving and “shapeshifting” their design practices to confront emerging regulation. A wide range of scholars have increasingly addressed these challenges through the label “dark patterns,” describing the content of deceptive and coercive design practices, the ubiquity of these patterns in contemporary digital systems, and the impact of emerging regulatory and legislative action on the presence of dark patterns. Building on this convergent and trans-disciplinary research area, the aims of this SIG are to: 1) Provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to address methodologies for detecting, characterizing, and regulating dark patterns; 2) Identify opportunities for additional empirical work to characterize and demonstrate harms related to dark patterns; and 3) Aid in convergence among HCI, design, computational, regulatory, and legal perspectives on dark patterns. These goals will enable an internationally-diverse, engaged, and impactful research community to address the threats of dark patterns on digital systems.},

We present three short case studies of UX practitioners with difering levels of educational and professional experience that worked in diferent contexts of design practice. We identifed how participants understood legal dimensions of their work and engaged with (or were unaware of) legal and regulatory issues as part of their design activity. Across these cases, we reveal key areas of concern and the need for researchers and educators to investigate how UX practices might need to adapt to address legal and regulatory issues alongside other established forms of design or social science knowledge.},

	abstract = {Previous research has established leader development as an ongoing process across the entire lifespan. Experience, especially on-the-job experience, has been increasingly acknowledged as a needed condition for leader development. From a life span developmental perspective, however, individuals are exposed to a variety of critical experiences across their life course—from preschool, childhood, through adolescence, emerging adulthood, adulthood and well into late adulthood. These time periods, characterized by speciﬁc developmental experiences, serve as potential windows of opportunity for one's leader development. However, the extant research primarily focuses on the development of leadership through on-the-job experiences in adulthood; there is little integration of leader developmental experiences that occur before and after adulthood, as well as those that occur beyond the workplace. Additionally, the inﬂuencing mechanism of experiences during the leader development process has been understudied. Using an interdisciplinary perspective, we present a framework that explores the critical developmental experiences at each stage in the lifespan. These experiences inﬂuence one's expertise in leadership through the mediating role and dynamic interaction of the leader experience processing system and the leader self-view system that are introduced in the model of this framework. This theoretical study systematically explores experiential opportunities across the course of life and within multiple contexts, as well as the underlying mechanisms that foster leader development. There are important implications for enhancing process-oriented leadership research and leadership pedagogical practices. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In order to tackle multiple parameters involved in the UX evaluation function, a hierarchical Bayesian model is proposed with a technique called “Markov chain Monte Carlo.” It estimates parameters that represent different cognitive tendencies and affective influences for customers at the individual and group levels by generating posterior probability density functions of the parameters to incorporate inherent uncertainty. An experiment with four hypotheses was designed to test the proposed model. We found that: 1) anxious participants tend to be more risk-averse than those in joy and excitement; 2) joyful and excited participants tend to be more risk-seeking than those in anxiety in UX-related choice decision making; 3) all participants tend to be averse to unpleasant UX; and 4) participants tend to value by feeling for affect-rich products and value by calculation for affect-poor products. Furthermore, the models of five different types can predict choice decision making between product profiles with around 80\% accuracy. In summary, the results explain affective-cognitive decision-making behavior in the complex domain of UX design and, thus, illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {In an era defined by rapid technological advancement and the ever-increasing importance of user-centric design, the roles and expectations of design professionals have evolved significantly. This transformation is particularly evident in the trajectories of individuals with formal educational backgrounds in industrial design and physical product design, who seem to increasingly find themselves gravitating towards roles in User Experience Design (UX), User Interface Design (UI), and Digital Product Design. The journey from traditional industrial and product design to the digital realm represents a paradigm shift in the design profession, driven by the growing integration of technology into our daily lives and the profound impact it has on user interactions with products and services. Understanding the motivations, challenges, and opportunities that drive this transition is essential not only for professionals making this career shift but also for educational institutions and wider industries seeking to adapt to the evolving needs of the design field. This master's thesis aims to explore the multifaceted factors that underpin the transition from Industrial and Physical Product design to UX, UI, and Digital Product Design roles. By delving into the personal experiences, educational pathways, and career choices of individuals who have made this shift, this research seeks to shed light on the following key questions: 1. What motivates individuals with formal backgrounds in industrial and product design to transition into roles focused on digital design and user experience? 2. What challenges and opportunities do these professionals encounter during their career transitions and what are the skills that translate from one career path to the other? 3. How do academic institutions’ requirements, industry demands, and evolving technologies contribute to this career shift? The result of this research aim to inform and help in the evolution of the study programs offered at Politecnico di Milano, suggesting alternative course paths that may be more in line with current professional needs. This investigation will involve a comprehensive exploration of the educational and professional backgrounds of design professionals, their personal aspirations, and their adaptation to the digital age's requirements. It will also consider how their design expertise from traditional disciplines is translated into innovative, user-cantered solutions within digital domains. Through in-depth interviews and surveys, this thesis seeks to provide valuable insights into the motivations and journeys of these design professionals, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the ever-evolving landscape of design in the digital age. Moreover, the findings may offer guidance to design educators, career advisors, and professionals contemplating a similar transition, enabling them to make informed decisions and maximize their impact in the dynamic and multifaceted field of design. As we embark on this exploration, it becomes evident that the convergence of design and technology continues to reshape the very essence of design practice, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary knowledge and a commitment to user-centric design. In doing so, we embrace a future where the traditional boundaries of design blur, and creativity knows no bounds, promising innovative and enhanced user experiences for all},

We believe the time is right for gaining an in-depth understanding of the UX roles responsibilities in an agile case company that has moved beyond the question of UX integration. Through interviews with UX professionals, developers and managers we found that the UX professionals have a very broad set of responsibilities, of which some are unseen in relation to previous studies and not classically considered part of the UX role. Interestingly, these newly identified responsibilities are some of the most critical to the success of integrating UX into agile development.},

The usage of User Experience (UX) methods has been studied through the years. However, little is known about UX professionals’ lifelong learning processes related to UX methods in Agile, choosing what UX methods to use, and the enablers and hindrances for using the UX methods.
Objective
The study aims to broaden current knowledge about UX professionals’ lifelong learning practices to understand their work situations better. The paper describes how UX professionals learn about and choose UX methods, their frequency of use, and the enablers and barriers when using the UX methods in Agile.
Method
An interview study was conducted with 13 UX professionals from various industries and two countries working with Agile and UX. We used a qualitative approach, and a thematic analysis was carried out to answer the research questions.
Results
The results show that support from colleagues is an essential component for learning about the methods and how to use UX methods. Time pressure makes UX professionals choose methods they know will deliver their desired results. Prototyping, user testing, user journeys, and workshops are the most frequently used UX methods. Additionally, the results show that UX professionals think that the UX methods are often too complicated and take too long to learn. Additionally, they find it challenging to integrate UX methods into Agile.
Conclusion
These findings indicate that UX methods might work better if designed to be less complicated and deliver results more efficiently. Moreover, collegial and peer learning is central to UX professionals. The HCI community could be more active in supporting this culture by sharing information and learning. Finally, the usability and UX of the tools affect which UX methods are used.},

	abstract = {This study explores university students’ perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective integration. A survey of 399 undergraduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines in Hong Kong revealed a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning. Students recognized the potential for personalized learning support, writing and brainstorming assistance, and research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about accuracy, privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal development, career prospects, and societal values were also expressed. According to John Biggs’ 3P model, student perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and outcomes. By understanding students’ perceptions, educators and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies to address needs and concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes. Insights from this study can inform policy development around the integration of GenAI technologies into higher education. By understanding students’ perceptions and addressing their concerns, policymakers can create well-informed guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective implementation of GenAI tools, ultimately enhancing teaching and learning experiences in higher education.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, technological advancements, especially artificial intelligence (AI), have significantly transformed educational practices. Recently, the development and adoption of Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has sparked considerable interest. The unprecedented capabilities of these models, such as generating humanlike text and facilitating automated conversations, have broad implications in various sectors, including education and health. Despite their immense potential, concerns regarding their widespread use and opacity have been raised within the scientific community. ChatGPT, the latest version of the GPT series, has displayed remarkable proficiency, passed the US bar law exam, and amassed over a million subscribers shortly after its launch. However, its impact on the education sector has elicited mixed reactions, with some educators heralding it as a progressive step and others raising alarms over its potential to reduce analytical skills and promote misconduct. This paper aims to delve into these discussions, exploring the potential and problems associated with applying advanced AI models in education.

Using a self-study methodology, two university educators attempted to collaborate with ChatGPT to create course materials targeted at higher education design students, before reflecting on its strengths and weaknesses during the process. Contextualising ChatGPT as the latest acute example of digital disruptors that design practices and processes have faced, the authors evaluated its current and potential threats and opportunities for the creation of design-focused learning content. The authors found that ChatGPT was a competent partner with regard to saving time, structuring textual content and documentation, and as a brainstorming tool. However, ChatGPT’s weaknesses included content generation that was often generic, usually requiring much human prompting, cajoling, and manual editing to produce desirable outcomes. Overall, ChatGPT was found to excel at its stated functionality as a language model, with some potentially useful functionality for the creation of higher education design course materials and outlines, as well as limitations. The reflections discussed can be used to inform design educators who may want to work with ChatGPT when designing course materials. However, acknowledging limitations and potential ethical challenges, the authors’ caution that educators may have to evaluate for themselves whether ChatGPT’s potential advantages outweigh its disadvantages.},

Although the course policy neither explicitly encouraged nor prohibited using GenAI, students independently integrated these tools into their work. Through conducting 12 post-class group interviews, we reveal the dual nature of GenAI: while it stimulates creativity and accelerates design iterations, it also raises concerns about shallow learning and over-reliance. Our findings indicate that GenAI's benefits are most pronounced in the Execution phase of the design process, particularly for rapid prototyping and ideation. In contrast, its use in the Discover phase and design reflection may compromise depth.

The method encompasses three general stages: to explore a podcast from a particular social field, to engage with it through careful, ethnographic reflexivity and to examine the podcast by developing typologies and themes expedient for analysis. Podcast ethnography is beneficial due to its spatial and temporal flexibility; observing a podcast universe can be performed on the move and in parallel with other tasks. This advantage enables a muchneeded breathing space for researchers inquiring vehement milieus, such as white radical nationalism. The article uses an example from this precise milieu in Sweden – the podcast Motgift [Antidote] – to illustrate and flesh out the potentials and challenges of applying the method’s three stages. In so doing, the article argues for inclusion of podcast ethnography into the extended family of ethnographic methods.},

	abstract = {Background Engineering programs have increasingly incorporated design challenges into courses. These design challenges vary in the degree to which they present complex, ill-structured, and relevant problems, and therefore may vary in the degree to which they support students to learn to frame design problems. Purpose/Hypothesis We characterized how first-year engineering students with little formal design training approach problem framing. We developed design challenges informed by funds of knowledge. We compared the development of problem framing skills in first-year students who completed these challenges to students who completed more traditional challenges and to students in capstone design. Design/Method Students completed a pre/post performance-based assessment of problem framing skills. We analyzed student responses in terms of design requirements, design practices, and design styles. We used descriptive statistics and correlations to characterize how students initially approached problem framing and repeated-measures ANOVA to compare groups of students. Results First-year students approached framing a design problem in one of four primary ways. Compared to students in the original course, they showed growth in attending to an underlying need, considering contexts of use, and depicting design function. Compared to capstone students, they also showed growth in considering stakeholder roles and planning the next steps. Conclusions Funds of knowledge can provide a means to evaluate possible design challenges as authentic yet accessible for first-year students, in turn, providing opportunities to support the development of the design problem framing ability.},

	abstract = {User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been increasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It has been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric approaches and towards embracing a more human centric approach, a core principle of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. This review aims to provide an overview of the user trust definitions, influencing factors, and measurement methods from 23 empirical studies to gather insight for future technical and design strategies, research, and initiatives to calibrate the user AI relationship. The findings confirm that there is more than one way to define trust. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user trust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by three main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design features, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings, reinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to monitoring of AI enabled systems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be addressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or discussed. In addition, calibrating the user-AI relationship requires finding the optimal balance that works for not only the user but also the system.},

The early stages of collaborations are typically time consuming for all stakeholders as researchers piece together an understanding of domain challenges from disparate discussions and meetings. A number of recent projects, however, report on the use of creative visualization-opportunities (CVO) workshops to accelerate the early stages of applied work, eliciting a wealth of requirements in a few days of focused work. Yet, there is no established guidance for how to use such workshops effectively. In this paper, we present the results of a 2-year collaboration in which we analyzed the use of 17 workshops in 10 visualization contexts. Its primary contribution is a framework for CVO workshops that: 1) identifies a process model for using workshops; 2) describes a structure of what happens within effective workshops; 3) recommends 25 actionable guidelines for future workshops; and 4) presents an example workshop and workshop methods. The creation of this framework exemplifies the use of critical reflection to learn about visualization in practice from diverse studies and experience.},

For the interpretation to be as easy as possible, we need to be as close as possible to the original data. As most visualization tools have an internal metamodel, which is different from the one for the presented data, they usually need to duplicate the original data to conform to their metamodel. This leads to an increase in the resources needed, increase which is not always justiﬁed. In this work we argue for the need of having an engine that is as close as possible to the data and we present our solution of moving the visualization tool to the data, instead of moving the data to the visualization tool. Our solution also emphasizes the necessity of reusing basic blocks to express complex visualizations and allowing the programmer to script the visualization using his preferred tools, rather than a third party format. As a validation of the expressiveness of our framework, we show how we express several already published visualizations and describe the pros and cons of the approach.},

	abstract = {While a number of information visualization software frameworks exist, creating new visualizations, especially those that involve novel visualization metaphors, interaction techniques, data analysis strategies, and specialized rendering algorithms, is still often a difficult process. To facilitate the creation of novel visualizations we present a new software framework, behaviorism, which provides a wide range of flexibility when working with dynamic information on visual, temporal, and ontological levels, but at the same time providing appropriate abstractions which allow developers to create prototypes quickly which can then easily be turned into robust systems. The core of the framework is a set of three interconnected graphs, each with associated operators: a scene graph for high-performance 3D rendering, a data graph for different layers of semantically-linked heterogeneous data, and a timing graph for sophisticated control of scheduling, interaction, and animation. In particular, the timing graph provides a unified system to add behaviors to both data and visual elements, as well as to the behaviors themselves. To evaluate the framework we look briefly at three different projects all of which required novel visualizations in different domains, and all of which worked with dynamic data in different ways: an interactive ecological simulation, an information art installation, and an information visualization technique.},

In making sense of diverse information sources, dashboards have become an indispensable tool, providing fast, effective, adaptable, and personalized access to information for professionals and the general public alike. However, these objectives place heavy requirements on dashboards as information systems in usability and effective design. Understanding these issues is challenging given the absence of consistent and comprehensive approaches to dashboard evaluation. In this article we systematically review literature on dashboard implementation in healthcare, where dashboards have been employed widely, and where there is widespread interest for improving the current state of the art, and subsequently analyse approaches taken towards evaluation. We draw upon consolidated dashboard literature and our own observations to introduce a general definition of dashboards which is more relevant to current trends, together with seven evaluation scenarios - task performance, behaviour change, interaction workflow, perceived engagement, potential utility, algorithm performance and system implementation. These scenarios distinguish different evaluation purposes which we illustrate through measurements, example studies, and common challenges in evaluation study design. We provide a breakdown of each evaluation scenario, and highlight some of the more subtle questions. We demonstrate the use of the proposed framework by a design study guided by this framework. We conclude by comparing this framework with existing literature, outlining a number of active discussion points and a set of dashboard evaluation best practices for the academic, clinical and software development communities alike.},

Additionally, effectiveness of a visualization software tool often depends on the context of systems and actors within the domain problem. The nested blocks and guidelines model is a useful template for informing design and evaluation criteria for visualization software development because it aligns design to need. Characterizing the outermost block of the nested model—the domain problem—is challenging, mainly due to the nature of contemporary domain problems, which are dynamic and by definition difficult to problematize. We offer here our emerging conceptual model, based on the central question in our research study—what visualization works for whom and in which situation—to characterize the outermost block, the domain problem, of the nested model. We apply examples from a 3-year case study of visualization software design and development to demonstrate how the conceptual model might be used to create evaluation criteria affecting design and development of a visualization tool.},

Existing work often gauges how good a visualization is by measuring its ability to induce accurate and fast judgment. While those measures provide some insight into the efﬁcacy of a graph, underlying cognitive processes responsible for reasoning and judgment are often overlooked when they can have signiﬁcant implications for visualization recommendation. Cognitive processes do not need to be a black box. There exists multiple models that describe decision processes, such as theories from behavioral economics and cognitive science. In this chapter, we compare and contrast different models and advocate for the inclusion of cognitive models for visualization evaluation in the context of decision-making. The goal of this work is to show visualization researchers the advantages of adopting a more mechanistic approach to evaluation at the intersection of visualization and cognitive science.},

	abstract = {We propose an extension to the four-level nested model of design and validation of visualization system that defines the term "guidelines" in terms of blocks at each level. Blocks are the outcomes of the design process at a specific level, and guidelines discuss relationships between these blocks. Within-level guidelines provide comparisons for blocks within the same level, while between-level guidelines provide mappings between adjacent levels of design. These guidelines help a designer choose which abstractions, techniques, and algorithms are reasonable to combine when building a visualization system. This definition of guideline allows analysis of how the validation efforts in different kinds of papers typically lead to different kinds of guidelines. Analysis through the lens of blocks and guidelines also led us to identify four major needs: a definition of the meaning of block at the problem level; mid-level task taxonomies to fill in the blocks at the abstraction level; refinement of the model itself at the abstraction level; and a more complete set of mappings up from the algorithm level to the technique level. These gaps in visualization knowledge present rich opportunities for future work.},

	abstract = {Whether AI explanations can help users achieve specific tasks efficiently (i.e., usable explanations) is significantly influenced by their visual presentation. While many techniques exist to generate explanations, it remains unclear how to select and visually present AI explanations based on the characteristics of domain users. This paper aims to understand this question through a multidisciplinary design study for a specific problem: explaining graph neural network (GNN) predictions to domain experts in drug repurposing, i.e., reuse of existing drugs for new diseases. Building on the nested design model of visualization, we incorporate XAI design considerations from a literature review and from our collaborators' feedback into the design process. Specifically, we discuss XAI-related design considerations for usable visual explanations at each design layer: target user, usage context, domain explanation, and XAI goal at the domain layer; format, granularity, and operation of explanations at the abstraction layer; encodings and interactions at the visualization layer; and XAI and rendering algorithm at the algorithm layer. We present how the extended nested model motivates and informs the design of DrugExplorer, an XAI tool for drug repurposing. Based on our domain characterization, DrugExplorer provides path-based explanations and presents them both as individual paths and meta-paths for two key XAI operations, why and what else. DrugExplorer offers a novel visualization design called MetaMatrix with a set of interactions to help domain users organize and compare explanation paths at different levels of granularity to generate domain-meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected visual presentation and DrugExplorer as a whole via a usage scenario, a user study, and expert interviews. From these evaluations, we derive insightful observations and reflections that can inform the design of XAI visualizations for other scientific applications.},

They discuss several techniques for generating visual-embedding functions, including probabilistic graphical models for embedding in discrete visual spaces. They also describe two complementary approaches–crowdsourcing and visual product spaces–for building visual spaces with associated perceptual–distance measures. In addition, they recommend several research directions for further developing the visual-embedding model.},

This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. The author extends and proposes a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model (E.H. Chi and J.T. Reidl, 1998). In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in the paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the effectiveness of data visualizations is a challenging undertaking and often relies on one-off studies that test a visualization in the context of one specific task. Researchers across the fields of data science, visualization, and human-computer interaction are calling for foundational tools and principles that could be applied to assessing the effectiveness of data visualizations in a more rapid and generalizable manner. One possibility for such a tool is a model of visual saliency for data visualizations. Visual saliency models are typically based on the properties of the human visual cortex and predict which areas of a scene have visual features (e.g. color, luminance, edges) that are likely to draw a viewer's attention. While these models can accurately predict where viewers will look in a natural scene, they typically do not perform well for abstract data visualizations. In this paper, we discuss the reasons for the poor performance of existing saliency models when applied to data visualizations. We introduce the Data Visualization Saliency (DVS) model, a saliency model tailored to address some of these weaknesses, and we test the performance of the DVS model and existing saliency models by comparing the saliency maps produced by the models to eye tracking data obtained from human viewers. Finally, we describe how modified saliency models could be used as general tools for assessing the effectiveness of visualizations, including the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.},

Most visualization algorithms aim to find a projection from the data space down to a two-dimensional visualization space. However, for complex data sets living in a high-dimensional space, it is unlikely that a single two-dimensional projection can reveal all of the interesting structure. We therefore introduce a hierarchical visualization algorithm which allows the complete data set to be visualized at the top level, with clusters and subclusters of data points visualized at deeper levels. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical mixture of latent variable models, whose parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We demonstrate the principle of the approach on a toy data set, and we then apply the algorithm to the visualization of a synthetic data set in 12 dimensions obtained from a simulation of multiphase flows in oil pipelines, and to data in 36 dimensions derived from satellite images.},

Beyond-desktop visualizations involve a wide range of emerging technologies such as wall-sized displays, 3D and shape-changing displays, touch and tangible input, and physical information visualizations. While these technologies allow for new forms of interaction, they are often studied in isolation. New conceptual models are needed to build a coherent picture of what has been done and what is possible. We describe a modified pipeline model where raw data is processed into a visualization and then rendered into the physical world. Users can explore or change data by directly manipulating visualizations or through the use of instruments. Interactions can also take place in the physical world outside the visualization system, such as when using locomotion to inspect a large scale visualization. Through case studies we illustrate how this model can be used to describe both conventional and unconventional interactive visualization systems, and compare different design alternatives.},

In order to obtain such an abstraction, we first examined six classes of workflows in data analysis and visualization, and identified four levels of typical visualization components, namely disseminative, observational, analytical and model-developmental visualization. We noticed a common phenomenon at different levels of visualization, that is, the transformation of data spaces (referred to as alphabets) usually corresponds to the reduction of maximal entropy along a workflow. Based on this observation, we establish an information-theoretic measure of cost-benefit ratio that may be used as a cost function for optimizing a data visualization process. To demonstrate the validity of this measure, we examined a number of successful visualization processes in the literature, and showed that the information-theoretic measure can mathematically explain the advantages of such processes over possible alternatives.},

Incremental visualization approaches are a means to address this challenge, as they permit the user to interact with, steer, and change the visualization at intermediate time points and not just after it has been completed. In this paper, we put forward a model for incremental visualizations that is based on the established Data State Reference Model, but extends it in ways to also represent partitioned data and visualization operators to facilitate intermediate visualization updates. In combination, partitioned data and operators can be used independently and in combination to strike tailored compromises between output quality, shown data quantity, and responsiveness-i.e., frame rates. We showcase the new expressive power of this model by discussing the opportunities and challenges of incremental visualization in general and its usage in a real world scenario in particular.},

Significant visualization research has focused on the generation of visualizations (the depiction); less effort has focused on the exploratory aspects of visualization (the process). However, without formal models of the process, visualization exploration sessions cannot be fully utilized to assist users and system designers. Toward this end, we introduce the P-Set model of visualization exploration for describing this process and a framework to encapsulate, share, and analyze visual explorations. In addition, systems utilizing the model and framework are more efficient as redundant exploration is avoided. Several examples drawn from visualization applications demonstrate these benefits.

	abstract = {A sociologist and a linguist, unaware of each other's work, each assigned a technical meaning to the term frame around 1970, based on separate usages of the word frame from the 1950s. Each researcher instigated a theory of frame analysis. Over the following decades, the two approaches to framing became intertwined as followers of both Goffman and Fillmore studied metaphoric framing, examined factors affecting the communication of frames, and became particularly interested in politics and the mass media. Years later, many theorists complain about the fragmented field of frame studies. The paper suggests that some of the fragmentation can be resolved by recognizing the dual origins of framing studies, and classifying instances of framing in either the Goffman or the Fillmore tradition as occurring at the level of language, thought, or communication. These three levels are termed semantic framing, cognitive framing, and communicative framing.

In particular the importance of judgement and evaluation in design is stressed. Using the framework of decision making and value theory, a tentative synthesis, compatible with both empirical and theoretical design studies, is proposed.},

Problems in the US healthcare delivery system provide another informative case where faster, better, cheaper pressures conflict with safety and other chronic goals. The Institute of Medicine in a calculated strategy to guide national improvements in health care delivery conducted a series of assessments. Safety, access, patient-centeredness are chronic goals in the sense that they are system properties that emerge from the interaction of elements in the system and play out over longer time frames. For example, safety is an emergent system property, arising in the interactions across components, subsystems, software, organizations, and human behavior. The basic issue for organizational design is how large-scale systems can cope with complexity, especially the pace of change and coupling across parts that accompany the methods that advance the acute goals. Resilience engineering needs to identify the classes of dynamics that undermine resilience and result in organizations that act riskier than they realize.},

This research focuses on how interdisciplinary teams that include UX practitioners design real-world enterprise ML systems outside of big technology companies. We conducted a survey with product managers, and interviews with interdisciplinary teams and individual UX practitioners. The findings show that nontechnical UX practitioners are highly capable in designing AI/ML systems. In addition to applying UX and interaction design expertise to make decisions regarding functionality, they employ skills that aid collaboration across interdisciplinary teams. However, our findings suggest existing HCI design techniques such as prototyping and simulating complexity of enterprise ML systems are insufficient. We propose adaptations to design practices and conclude that some existing research should be reconsidered.},

To maximise the reuse of components through the life span, companies need to plan for changes that they can anticipate and cannot anticipate, and facilitate accommodation of such changes in the original architecture and design of the system. However, the degree to which future product changes can be planned depends on the uncertainties that the system, product or product family is subject to. A deeper understanding of these uncertainties is the focus of this paper. The paper first provides a brief literature survey, and discusses the sources and nature of uncertainty. This is followed by a classification of the types of uncertainties that are often encountered and that should be considered, as well as methods and techniques for modelling these uncertainties for incorporation in system design. The paper also provides examples of uncertainties for a variety of systems and products throughout and concludes with an uncertainty checklist for system architects and product designers.},

In 4 studies, the authors held information about positive and negative film clips constant while varying the feeling of not knowing by having people repeat phrases connoting certainty or uncertainty while watching the films. As predicted, the subjective feeling of uncertainty intensified people's affective reactions to the film clips. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {At inception, much design activity is unstructured and as such is faced with an array of uncertainties. If not addressed early enough these uncertainties can gestate into undesirable outcomes which the design team will find difficult to redress at later stages in project—especially, where the project is constrained by resources (time, money, people). In order to militate against such circumstances occurring the design team has to understand both the nature of the problem facing it and the nature of the uncertainties contained within the problem space. These issues impact not just at the creative, early stage of the project but across the design spectrum. The chapter begins by identifying the main elements within this spectrum; creativity, innovation and the oft-neglected execution phase. Two core conditions that designers have to come to terms within this process, are then explored: how can problems be categorized and which of these variants is the most problematical? The second condition addresses the nature of uncertainty when applied to the more intractable end of the problem scale. In response to design situations governed by these two conditions, methods that support decision making and mitigate risk are introduced under the broad category of Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs). Within the gamut of methods available the authors then explore the particular value of two methods which operate best when faced with qualitative judgment rather that observed metrics; morphological analysis to help generate and identify viable possibilities followed by Multi-criteria Decision Analysis which can help position these possibilities in a hierarchy. Finally, an argument is posited that the design process or system has to take into account an understanding of the business model for the designed item as this can impact success or failure at the execution phase when the end product is introduced to the end user. Early consideration of the business model (in all its variety) can redress some of the inherent uncertainties during the overall design process.},

	abstract = {The client-side project manager is a professional who manages projects within complex and dynamic environments while ensuring their client’s interests are protected and maintained. This thesis explores the ‘lived experience’ of client-side project managers who deliver projects in the Australian Construction sector. In this sector, client-side project managers are regularly confronted with challenges such as poorly defined project scope, disparate and conflicting stakeholder expectations, and countless opportunities for carefully planned and rigorously monitored projects to encounter unforeseen events that can ultimately result in the project being regarded as a failure.

Little is known about the ‘lived-experience’ of a client-side project manager, and even less about how they deal with these challenges to effectively manage their project work. Client-side project management has traditionally been considered a form of production management. However, in many ways, this perception appears at odds with the ‘lived-experience’ of client-side project management practitioners. Through this thesis, I argue that this perception is hindering the development of the body of theory for the profession by limiting discussions within unjustified constraints and restricting the development of tools that could help client-side project managers perform crucial elements of their role.

This thesis comprises a collection of publications that investigates the ‘lived experience’ of client-side project managers. How they think; how they manage ambiguity, conflicting expectations, and poorly defined problems; and ultimately how they create value in the project delivery process.

During the course of my candidature; I have published thirteen papers. Seven of these papers (one theoretical and six empirical) have been included in this thesis. All of the empirical papers adopted qualitative research methodologies, the most predominant of these is Grounded Theory. This particular methodology aligned well with the emerging nature of the research included in this thesis. The themes of the thesis move from a broad recognition and understanding of a divide that exists between the theory and practice of client-side project management, through to a detailed analysis of how a cohort of practitioners adopt the role of System Specialists to deliver their projects, and thereby create value through managing a complex network of actors.

Through this thesis I will argue that the ‘lived experience’ of client-side project management is not supported by the traditionally accepted theoretical foundations of Transformational Production Management, and I call for a broader theoretical basis for the profession. I argue that client-side project managers operate beyond the role of project Implementers and instead play a critical role in managing a complex value network. This network is created to deliver the strategic, technical, financial and human goals which clients are expecting from their projects. As I will demonstrate through this thesis, achieving these outcomes requires client-side project managers to think more strategically, holistically and creatively about their projects than the current theoretical foundations of their profession supports.

This thesis will demonstrate that client-side project managers must balance both the success and satisfaction paradigms of their projects, manage Drift-Changes and attempt to create Project Management Yinyang. To achieve this they utilize Design Thinking Mentalities, Thinking Styles, Practices and Tools, and act as System Specialist who create network Constructs and Controls to create value.

This thesis outlines multiple opportunities for project management researchers to pursue. These include, but are not limited to, new project management practices such as Funnelling and Optioneering, the role of Design Thinking in the practice of client-side project management and how client-side project managers create value by acting as System Specialists. In addition this thesis provides insight in to new skills, competencies and tools which practitioners can adopt if they wish to become more proficient in their craft.

In summary, this thesis demonstrates that the ‘lived experience’ of the client-side project manager is not the ordered, rational and well planned experience that the traditional theoretical foundations of the profession would have us believe. Instead it is dynamic and complex, as well as exciting and challenging. Client-side project management demands a high level of technical expertise combined with highly developed social skills and creativity. It requires optimistic professionals who are capable of balancing paradoxes, navigating through ambiguity, relentlessly pressing forward in the face of uncertainty and who have the intellectual capacity to manage a complex value network using an action-as-planning approach. Finally, in the midst of all this, they must foster the belief among all the stakeholders that the Functionality and Representation of value required by the project is achievable. Consequently, the client-side project manager creates confidence among complexity.},

	abstract = {Purpose Project complexity has been comprehensively investigated over the last two decades, resulting in many descriptive frameworks and models. The common layout is a multidimensional construct. While the perception of the complexity of projects is essential for a managerial approach, only scant research has been conducted into how practitioners perceive project complexity. The purpose of the paper is to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a quantitative study based on a large survey among managers of projects with more than 1,000 participants. The questionnaire is designed based on a review of research literature on project complexity. Findings The findings indicate that practitioners' mental models are concentrated on only a few dimensions of the many found in descriptive models. Further, the findings indicate that the mental models are much influenced by the project role of the perceiver and less so by the type of project and sector. Originality/value This paper discusses the differentiation of concepts of perceived project complexity and provides a framework for a survey of the topic. The contribution of the paper is an increased understanding of practitioners' perceptions of project complexity as a concept very different from the descriptive frameworks that have been the focal point for research in project complexity thus far. The project complexity might be in the eye of the beholder; however, the findings indicate that the eyes are very much influenced by the project role of the beholder.},

	abstract = {Managing uncertainties in industrial systems is a daily challenge to ensure improved design, robust operation, accountable performance and responsive risk control. Authored by a leading European network of experts representing a cross section of industries, Uncertainty in Industrial Practice aims to provide a reference for the dissemination of uncertainty treatment in any type of industry. It is concerned with the quantification of uncertainties in the presence of data, model(s) and knowledge about the system, and offers a technical contribution to decision-making processes whilst acknowledging industrial constraints. The approach presented can be applied to a range of different business contexts, from research or early design through to certification or in-service processes. The authors aim to foster optimal trade-offs between literature-referenced methodologies and the simplified approaches often inevitable in practice, owing to data, time or budget limitations of technical decision-makers. Uncertainty in Industrial Practice:  Features recent uncertainty case studies carried out in the nuclear, air \& space, oil, mechanical and civil engineering industries set in a common methodological framework.    Presents methods for organizing and treating uncertainties in a generic and prioritized perspective.  Illustrates practical difficulties and solutions encountered according to the level of complexity, information available and regulatory and financial constraints. Discusses best practice in uncertainty modeling, propagation and sensitivity analysis through a variety of statistical and numerical methods.   Reviews recent standards, references and available software, providing an essential resource for engineers and risk analysts in a wide variety of industries.  This book provides a guide to dealing with quantitative uncertainty in engineering and modelling and is aimed at practitioners, including risk-industry regulators and academics wishing to develop industry-realistic methodologies.},

	abstract = {Much economic advice is bogus quantification, warn two leading experts in this essential book, now with a preface on COVID-19. Invented numbers offer a false sense of security; we need instead robust narratives that give us the confidence to manage uncertainty. “An elegant and careful guide to thinking about personal and social economics, especially in a time of uncertainty. The timing is impeccable." — Christine Kenneally, New York Times Book Review Some uncertainties are resolvable. The insurance industry’s actuarial tables and the gambler’s roulette wheel both yield to the tools of probability theory. Most situations in life, however, involve a deeper kind of uncertainty, a radical uncertainty for which historical data provide no useful guidance to future outcomes. Radical uncertainty concerns events whose determinants are insufficiently understood for probabilities to be known or forecasting possible. Before President Barack Obama made the fateful decision to send in the Navy Seals, his advisers offered him wildly divergent estimates of the odds that Osama bin Laden would be in the Abbottabad compound. In 2000, no one—not least Steve Jobs—knew what a smartphone was; how could anyone have predicted how many would be sold in 2020? And financial advisers who confidently provide the information required in the standard retirement planning package—what will interest rates, the cost of living, and your state of health be in 2050?—demonstrate only that their advice is worthless. The limits of certainty demonstrate the power of human judgment over artificial intelligence. In most critical decisions there can be no forecasts or probability distributions on which we might sensibly rely. Instead of inventing numbers to fill the gaps in our knowledge, we should adopt business, political, and personal strategies that will be robust to alternative futures and resilient to unpredictable events. Within the security of such a robust and resilient reference narrative, uncertainty can be embraced, because it is the source of creativity, excitement, and profit.},

Recently, User eXperience (UX) has become a hot topic that interests software teams of start-ups. However, software and UX professionals have struggled to match UX practices into the development activities, partially because of the lack of resources in the start-ups. This paper investigates how software start-ups handle UX activities during software development and how relevant UX is to these companies’ professionals. To achieve our aim, we surveyed 88 professionals who take part in software teams in star-ups, analyzing the responses using descriptive and statistical methods. Our results reveal that regardless of having or not a UX position in the start-up, UX practices are spread in diﬀerent software development phases and not ﬁtting into them. Results also show although professionals consider UX relevant and recognize important skills to perform UX activities, some obstacles hinder the eﬀective use of UX in software start-ups. From the survey results, we identiﬁed a set of challenges to be overcome in consolidating the UX work in software start-ups. By diagnosing the UX state-of-practice in start-up scenarios and identifying such challenges, our work contributes to provides relevant insights to further academic and practical studies in this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Context We teach judgement in pieces; that is, we talk about each aspect separately (patient, plan, resources, technique, etc.). We also let trainees figure out how to put the pieces together. In complex situations, this might be problematic. Using data from a drawing-based study on surgeons’ experiences with complex situations, we explore the notion of ‘problem definition’ in real-world clinical judgement using the theoretical lens of systems engineering. Methods ‘Emergence’, the sensitising concept for analysis, is rooted in two key systems premises: that person and context are inseparable and that what emerges is an act of choice. Via a ‘gallery walk’ we used these premises to perform analysis on individual drawings as well as cross-comparisons of multiple drawings. Our focus was to understand similarities and differences among the vantage points used by multiple surgeons. Results In this paper we challenge two assumptions from current models of clinical judgement: that experts hold a fixed and static definition of the problem and that consequently the focus of the expert's work is on solving the problem. Each situation described by our participants revealed different but complementary perspectives of what a surgical problem might come to be: from concerns about ensuring standard of care, to balancing personal emotions versus care choices, to coordinating resources, and to maintaining control while in the midst of personality clashes. Conclusion We suggest that it is only at the situation and system level, not at the individual level, that we are able to appreciate the nuances of defining the problem when experts make judgements during real-world complex situations.},

	abstract = {Engineering judgment is critical to both engineering education and engineering practice, and the ability to practice or participate in engineering judgment is often considered central to the formation of professional engineering identities. In practice, engineers must make difficult judgments that evaluate potentially competing objectives, ambiguity, uncertainty, incomplete information, and evolving technical knowledge. Nonetheless, while engineering judgment is implicit in engineering work and so central to identification with the profession, educators and practitioners have few actionable frameworks to employ when considering how to develop and assess this capacity in students. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework designed to inform both educators and researchers that positions engineering judgment at the intersection of the cognitive dimensions of naturalistic decision-making, and discursive dimensions of identity. Our proposed theory positions engineering judgment not only as an individual capacity practiced by individual engineers alone but also as the capacity to position oneself within the discursive community so as to participate in the construction of engineering judgments among a group of professionals working together. Our theory draws on several strands of existing research to theorize a working framework for engineering judgment that considers the cognitive processes associated with making judgments and the inextricable discursive practices associated with negotiating those judgments in context. In constructing this theory, we seek to provide engineering education practitioners and researchers with a framework that can inform the design of assignments, curricula, or experiences that are intended to foster students’ participation in the development and practice of engineering judgment.},

However, most UX practitioners face challenges in understanding ML's capabilities or envisioning what it might be. We interviewed 13 designers who had many years of experience designing the UX of ML-enhanced products and services. We probed them to characterize their practices. They shared they do not view themselves as ML experts, nor do they think learning more about ML would make them better designers. Instead, our participants appeared to be the most successful when they engaged in ongoing collaboration with data scientists to help envision what to make and when they embraced a data-centric culture. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of UX education and as opportunities for additional design research in support of UX designers working with ML.},

To better understand practices at the intersection of user experience (UX) and RAI, we conducted an interview study with industrial UX practitioners and RAI subject matter experts, both of whom are actively involved in addressing RAI concerns throughout the early design and development of new AI-based prototypes, demos, and products, at a large technology company. Many of the specifc practices and their associated challenges have yet to be surfaced in the literature, and distilling them ofers a critical view into how practitioners’ roles are adapting to meet present-day RAI challenges. We present and discuss three emerging practices in which RAI is being enacted and reifed in UX practitioners’ everyday work. We conclude by arguing that the emerging practices, goals, and types of expertise that surfaced in our study point to an evolution in praxis, with associated challenges that suggest important areas for further research in HCI.},

	abstract = {User experience (UX) design is an interdisciplinary field that combines elements of psychology, computer science, and design. It is concerned with how a product or service is perceived by its users and how it meets their needs. UX designers work to ensure that a product or service is easy to use, efficient, and satisfying for the person using it. The purpose of this article is to describe some implications of User Experience (UX) in the metaverse. UX is relevant in the metaverse because it determines how people interact with and perceive virtual environments. This will involve working with a variety of stakeholders, including developers, designers, and users, to understand the goals and needs of the virtual environment and to create user experiences that are intuitive, engaging, and satisfying. The role of the UX professional in the metaverse will involve applying traditional UX design principles and techniques to the unique challenges and opportunities presented by virtual environments. There are several ways in which UX professionals can insert themselves into working in the metaverse. First of all, work with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) companies, VR and AR companies are at the forefront of developing metaverse technologies, and they often hire UX professionals to help design and improve their products. UX professionals in the metaverse must be able to design for immersive and interactive environments that can be difficult to predict and control.},

Yet, despite increasing educational provision, UX design industry figures criticize UX degree courses for not meeting industry’s needs. To examine the issue, this study asks: (1) What competencies are specified by UX degree courses? (2) How do UX and UX related degree courses’ competencies and employers’ requirements align? To answer these questions, the researchers analysed 93 programme and module specification documents for 34 UX, and UX related, degree courses and 50 job adverts for UX designers in the UK. The study concludes that UX, within formal education, is narrowly reliant on already established subjects and yet to mature into a holistic discipline. UX curricula are also developing in diverse ways across different institutions. Finally, the findings reveal that industry and academia have different priorities. The study underscores the need for further research into UX practice and pedagogy, cross-institutional cooperation, and enhanced connections with the communities of UX practice.},

However, theories based on principles of uncertainty reduction overlook opportunities arising from uncertainty creation. Building on recent research in management, cognition and neuroscience, we expand current conceptualizations of uncertainty by introducing a model of uncertainty regulation where individuals employ opening and closing behaviors to achieve alignment between preferred and experienced levels of uncertainty and with exogenous requirements for effectiveness. We derive propositions for uncertainty regulation and work performance which extend existing concepts of adaptation in uncertain environments to include deliberate uncertainty creation and expansive agency. We discuss implications for dynamic models of agentic goal striving, organizational support for individuals' uncertainty regulation, and extensions to team- and organization-level phenomena.},

However, the variety of ways in which uncertainty has been defined and studied in the international business literature, has contributed to a fragmented view of MNC behavior and of the role of uncertainty in international decision-making. Adopting a broad view of uncertainty, and by means of a systematic review, this paper examines the treatment of uncertainty in international decision-making in the IB literature and identifies directions for future research. The review organizes studies across 13 dimensions of uncertainty and eight approaches to managing it. The paper further identifies five characteristics of individual decision-makers that have been shown to impact their perceptions of uncertainty and their choice of uncertainty management approach. Based on this systematic review, the paper makes three main critical observations about existing research: inconsistency in the conceptualization and measurement of uncertainty, lack of diversity regarding the dimensions of uncertainty included in single studies, and downplaying the role of individual decision-makers. A research agenda is presented that offers suggestions on how future research might address these limitations.},

While working on innovation projects designers have to deal with the uncertainty associated with complexity, multi-disciplinarity and outcomes that in the early phases are not - and are not supposed to be - foreseeable. Design methodology aims to support the designer by providing structure and thus assist in dealing with uncertainty. However, design methodology often does not provide methodological support that is adaptable to the individual's needs in situations of unusual or high uncertainty, referred to herein as non-routine situations. We define non-routine situations as being associated with levels or types of uncertainty in which the designer does not obviously know how to proceed.

	abstract = {Throughout the history of human spaceﬂight, NASA has relied on a team of ground-based experts on Earth to manage its missions, vehicles, and crews to ensure crew safety and mission success. However, as missions progress beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO), this paradigm of dependence on ground must evolve. Beyond LEO, in missions to the moon and Mars, crews will confront new challenges: limited evacuation options, reduced resupply capabilities, and signiﬁcant communication delays that impede real-time support from experts on the ground. This reduction in ground support ampliﬁes the likelihood that crews will be unable to adequately respond to unanticipated, safety-critical events. Understanding the scope of these risks and identifying effective countermeasures hinges on understanding the impact of communication delays on complex operations, especially in urgent, unforeseen events. Real-time communication currently provides the crew with continuous access to a large, extensively resourced ground team skilled in anomaly resolution. However, as communication delays grow, the need to transfer some responsibilities from ground experts to onboard crew becomes evident. NASA has been exploring this shift in operational responsibilities and its effectiveness in managing complex operations for decades. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the speciﬁc challenges posed by communication delays and the necessary countermeasures to mitigate them remains a gap. In this paper, we present an update on our systematic review of the literature on communication delays, the ﬁrst in-depth review since 2013 (Rader et al.). We introduce a coding taxonomy to capture key constructs from papers of interest and discuss preliminary ﬁndings. These preliminary results suggest two signiﬁcant research gaps: limited studies have been conducted 1) with lunar-like latencies and 2) on problem-solving strategies for the maximum latencies expected in Mars missions. We outline plans and propose recommendations to address these gaps through ongoing and future research.},

	abstract = {The concept of design thinking (DT) has emerged in management debates as promising innovation inspired by the way designers work. Despite the growing interest in DT, it is a difficult concept to study due to the lack of coherence between what DT ‘is’ in academic and practical terms. While there are numerous normative and often process-focused depictions of DT, they seem limited in their ability to account for what occurs in practice. Given the discussion of DT as a concept, and emerging discussion of its enactment, a framing is needed that acknowledges both aspects. This paper proposes a framing of DT that makes it researchable in both theory and practice, and discusses commonalities and discrepancies in how the concept is usually portrayed in the literature. The paper builds on an empirical interview study in six large organizations, which led to the development of a framework structure and the identification of five themes characterizing DT: User focus, Problem framing, Visualization, Experimentation and Diversity. Each theme is associated with specific principles/mindsets, practices and techniques. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a framework that includes DT both as an idea and as the enactment of the idea, inspired by the works of Latour.},

One of these methods is based on the definition of design recommendations for interactive data visualizations to reduce the potential effects of cognitive biases. Another expert-driven method is the in-depth analysis of a VAE and the cognitive biases it may induce. The second, empirical approach, encompasses behavioral observations, as well as experimental methods to operationalize cognitive biases. We describe methods to measure the Confirmation Bias and the Clustering Illusion. Finally, the third approach refers to data-driven methods that enable a non-invasive measurement of cognitive biases. This method is based on data-mining techniques to analyze and interpret user interaction patterns in terms of cognitive biases.},

	abstract = {When analyzing the results of an experiment, we often assume that the interpretation of the data is a straightforward act; however, experiments on reproducibility that have large numbers of scientists analyze the same dataset show that even subtle differences in workflows can lead to drastically different results. Beyond the use of different analysis methods, one potential reason for different conclusions from the same data is confirmation bias, a phenomenon well documented in psychology. We reasoned that confirmation bias might not only influence the choice of analysis methods and depth of analysis, but that it might even shape how different researchers interpret the same graphical representation of data. To test this notion, we designed a simple experiment, in which we contrast the prior expectation of participants’ for the relationship between two variables (income and happiness) with their interpretation of a corresponding data plot. We artificially engineered the data such that under superficial examination, it shows an overall negative correlation, while a closer look at distinct age groups (distinguished by color) reveals a within-group positive correlation. Prior to showing the plot, we had asked the participants whether they expected a positive or a negative relationship. We found that participants who expected a positive correlation were more than twice as likely to detect the positive within-age group correlation than those expecting a negative correlation. This simple experiment demonstrates the presence of confirmation bias in the interpretation of graphical data representations.},

	abstract = {Data visualization is crucial in today’s data-driven business world, which has been widely used for helping decision making that is closely related to major revenues of many industrial companies. However, due to the high demand of data processing w.r.t. the volume, velocity, and veracity of data, there is an emerging need for database experts to help for efficient and effective data visualization. In response to this demand, this article surveys techniques that make data visualization more efficient and effective. (1) Visualization specifications define how the users can specify their requirements for generating visualizations. (2) Efficient approaches for data visualization process the data and a given visualization specification, which then produce visualizations with the primary target to be efficient and scalable at an interactive speed. (3) Data visualization recommendation is to auto-complete an incomplete specification, or to discover more interesting visualizations based on a reference visualization.},

	abstract = {Data visualization tools have revolutionized processing, analysing, and communicating data. With the increasing amount of data available, it has become increasingly important to present data in an easily understandable and visually appealing way. As such, data visualization tools have become essential to data analysis and decision-making processes in various fields, including business, healthcare, social sciences, and engineering. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the various data visualization tools available and their features, strengths, and weaknesses. We begin by introducing the concept of data visualization and its importance in the data analysis process. We then provide a brief history of data visualization, highlighting its evolution over time from static charts to interactive and dynamic visualizations. We then discuss the available data visualization tools, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, heat maps, tree maps, and network diagrams. For each type of visualization, we provide examples of when and how they can be used to present and analyse data effectively. Next, we examine the features and functionalities of popular data visualization tools, such as Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio, D3.js, and Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each tool and provide examples of real-world applications. In addition, we highlight the importance of choosing the right visualization tool based on the data type, audience, and purpose. We also discuss best practices for creating effective data visualizations, such as choosing the right colour scheme, designing for accessibility, and avoiding common pitfalls. Finally, we discuss future trends and developments in data visualization, such as using augmented and virtual reality for data visualization and incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence in data visualization tools. In conclusion, data visualization tools have become an essential part of the data analysis process. This review paper overviews the available data visualization tools and their features, strengths, and weaknesses. By understanding the strengths and limitations of different visualization tools, researchers and analysts can effectively present and analyse data, leading to better decision-making and insights.},

Traditionally, HCI has taken place within a constrained and well-understood domain of experience—single users sitting at desks and interacting with conventionally-designed computers employing screens, keyboards and mice for interaction. New opportunities have engendered considerable interest in “context-aware computing”—computational systems that can sense and respond to aspects of the settings in which they are used. However, considerable confusion surrounds the notion of “context”—what it means, what it includes and what role it plays in interactive systems. This paper suggests that the representational stance implied by conventional interpretations of “context” misinterprets the role of context in everyday human activity, and proposes an alternative model that suggests different directions for design.},

Lucy Suchman argues that the planning model of interaction favoured by the majority of AI researchers does not take sufficient account of the situatedness of most human social behaviour. The problems that can arise as a result are pertinently, and often amusingly, illustrated by the careful analysis of a recorded interaction between novice users and an intelligent machine, whose design has failed to accommodate essential resources of successful human communication. Plans and Situated Actions presents a compelling case for the re-examination of current models underlying interface design. Lucy Suchman's proposals for a fresh characterisation of human-computer interaction which also incorporates recent insights from the social sciences provides a challenge that everyone interested in machine intelligence will seriously need to consider.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise to empower us with knowledge and augment our effectiveness. We can -- and must -- ensure that we keep humans safe and in control, particularly with regard to government and public sector applications that affect broad populations. How can AI development teams harness the power of AI systems and design them to be valuable to humans? Diverse teams are needed to build trustworthy artificial intelligent systems, and those teams need to coalesce around a shared set of ethics. There are many discussions in the AI field about ethics and trust, but there are few frameworks available for people to use as guidance when creating these systems. The Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) Framework for Designing Ethical AI Experiences described in this paper, when used with a set of technical ethics, will guide AI development teams to create AI systems that are accountable, de-risked, respectful, secure, honest, and usable. To support the team's efforts, activities to understand people's needs and concerns will be introduced along with the themes to support the team's efforts. For example, usability testing can help determine if the audience understands how the AI system works and complies with the HMT Framework. The HMT Framework is based on reviews of existing ethical codes and best practices in human-computer interaction and software development. Human-machine teams are strongest when human users can trust AI systems to behave as expected, safely, securely, and understandably. Using the HMT Framework to design trustworthy AI systems will provide support to teams in identifying potential issues ahead of time and making great experiences for humans.},

Time may be needed to model entities and dynamics to be simulated, plan and conduct simulation-based tests and experiments, and translate the results into requirements, user stories, or other inputs to the technology’s design and implementation plan. Complexity is increased when simulation results suggest new or changed requirements, identify technology design and implementation improvements, or produce conflicting feedback from potential users. We will discuss these challenges, methods and tools that minimize their disruptive effects, varieties of simulation we have used to support technology development, and benefits of using simulation in development.},

Communicating the uncertainty associated with such forecasts is important, because it may affect users’ trust in a forecasting model and, in turn, the decisions made based on the model. Although there exists a growing body of research on visualizing uncertainty in general, the important case of visualizing prediction uncertainty in time series forecasting is under-researched. Against this background, we investigated how different visualizations of predictive uncertainty affect the extent to which people follow predictions of a time series forecasting model. More specifically, we conducted an online experiment on forecasting occupied hospital beds due to the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring the influence of uncertainty visualization of algorithmic predictions on participants’ own predictions. In contrast to prior studies, our empirical results suggest that more salient visualizations of uncertainty lead to decreased willingness to follow algorithmic forecasts.},

The simulations identified many challenges: confusion of sequence, blocked calls, wasted crew time, impaired ability to provide relevant information to the other party, losing track of which messages have reached the other party, weakened rapport between crew and ground, slow response to rapidly changing situations, and reduced situational awareness. These challenges were met in part with additional training; greater attention and foresight; longer, less frequent transmissions; meticulous recordkeeping and timekeeping; and specific alerting and acknowledging calls. Several simulations used both delayed voice and text messaging. Text messaging provided a valuable record of transmissions and allowed messages to be targeted to subsets of the flight and ground crew, but it was a poor choice for high-workload operators such as vehicle drivers and spacewalkers. Even with the foregoing countermeasures, delayed voice communication is difficult. Additional aids such as automatic delay timers and voice-to-text transcription would help. Tests comparing delays of 50 and 300s unexpectedly revealed that communicating with the shorter delay was just as challenging as with the longer one.},

Background Rigorous data collection procedures fundamentally influence the results of studies. The semi-structured interview is a common data collection method, but methodological research on the development of a semi-structured interview guide is sparse. Design Systematic methodological review. Data sources We searched PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science for methodological papers on semi-structured interview guides from October 2004–September 2014. Having examined 2,703 titles and abstracts and 21 full texts, we finally selected 10 papers. Review methods We analysed the data using the qualitative content analysis method. Results Our analysis resulted in new synthesized knowledge on the development of a semi-structured interview guide, including five phases: (1) identifying the prerequisites for using semi-structured interviews; (2) retrieving and using previous knowledge; (3) formulating the preliminary semi-structured interview guide; (4) pilot testing the guide; and (5) presenting the complete semi-structured interview guide. Conclusion Rigorous development of a qualitative semi-structured interview guide contributes to the objectivity and trustworthiness of studies and makes the results more plausible. Researchers should consider using this five-step process to develop a semi-structured interview guide and justify the decisions made during it.},

In this domain, little formal human factors research has previously been undertaken, despite that human performance limitations are frequently noted as a bottleneck to effective production. This article presents a broad, operator-centered investigation on the current status of control room operations and explores the underlying barriers in the operators’ work environment. A total of 20 operators working at two types of Australian mineral processing plants were involved. Multiple data collection methods, including in situ observations and interviews, surveys, and reviews of documentation, were used. The findings revealed that operator control was essentially in a reactive mode, with operators often lacking the will or ability to engage in process optimization. A simplified work domain analysis was used to highlight the essential elements involved in operator control and to explore the gaps between the observed reactive behavior and the required proactive control employed by operators. Also, this study uncovered deficiencies in the current information and organizational environments constraining operator control ability. These deficiencies included poorly designed human-machine interface and alarms, insufficient operator training, and inappropriate task allocations. Further research for enhancing operator capacity is recommended and highlighted.},

	abstract = {Electric distribution utilities, the companies that feed electricity to end users, are overseeing a technological transformation of their networks, installing sensors and other automated equipment, that are fundamentally changing the way the grid operates. These grid modernization efforts will allow utilities to incorporate some of the newer technology available to the home user – such as solar panels and electric cars – which will result in a bi-directional flow of energy and information. How will this new flow of information affect control room operations? How will the increased automation associated with smart grid technologies influence control room operators’ decisions? And how will changes in control room operations and operator decision making impact grid resilience? These questions have not been thoroughly studied, despite the enormous changes that are taking place. In this study, which involved collaborating with utility companies in the state of Vermont, the authors proposed to advance the science of control-room decision making by understanding the impact of distribution grid modernization on operator performance. Distribution control room operators were interviewed to understand daily tasks and decisions and to gain an understanding of how these impending changes will impact control room operations. Situation awareness was found to be a major contributor to successful control room operations. However, the impact of growing levels of automation due to smart grid technology on operators’ situation awareness is not well understood. Future work includes performing a naturalistic field study in which operator situation awareness will be measured in real-time during normal operations and correlated with the technological changes that are underway. The results of this future study will inform tools and strategies that will help system operators adapt to a changing grid, respond to critical incidents and maintain critical performance skills.},

	abstract = {In today’s rapidly evolving industrial landscape, control room operators must grapple with an ever-growing array of tasks and responsibilities. One major challenge facing these operators is the potential for task overload, which can lead to decision fatigue and increased reliance on cognitive biases. To address this issue, we propose the use of dynamic influence diagrams (DID) as the core of our decision support system. By monitoring the process over time and identifying anomalies, DIDs can recommend the most effective course of action based on a probabilistic assessment of future outcomes. Instead of letting the operator choose or search for the right procedure, we display automatically the optimal procedure according to the model. The procedure is streamlined compared to the traditional approach, focusing on essential steps and adapting to the system’s current state. Our research tests the effectiveness of this approach using a simulated formaldehyde production environment. Preliminary results demonstrate the ability of DIDs to effectively support control room operators in making informed decisions during times of high stress or uncertainty. This work represents an important step forward in the development of intelligent decision support systems for the process industries.},

Although multiple SA assessment techniques have been developed, they require periodic interruptions of a task to query the individual regarding their knowledge of the situation. There has been a recent proliferation of more rugged and durable sensor devices (e.g., functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensors) that can be used while people take part in ecologically valid activities to assess changes in neurophysiology, physiology, and behavior that correlate with cognitive state (e.g., SA). In addition, recent advances in machine learning and modeling techniques can be used to interpret information about human states (e.g., SA) from noisy data acquired in such environments that previously was unusable. These advances provide opportunity to develop physiological measurement approaches that could provide a potential avenue for real time, continuous, and objective assessment of SA in many real-world settings. This class of measures could potentially provide a window into low SA states where an intervention may be necessary to ensure acceptable levels of performance. In this paper, we review potential SA metrics to assess their suitability for continuous real-world monitoring.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is a pervasive and important problem that has attracted increasing attention in health care, given the growing emphasis on evidence-based medicine, shared decision making, and patient-centered care. However, our understanding of this problem is limited, in part because of the absence of a unified, coherent concept of uncertainty. There are multiple meanings and varieties of uncertainty in health care that are not often distinguished or acknowledged although each may have unique effects or warrant different courses of action. The literature on uncertainty in health care is thus fragmented, and existing insights have been incompletely translated to clinical practice. This article addresses this problem by synthesizing diverse theoretical and empirical literature from the fields of communication, decision science, engineering, health services research, and psychology and developing a new integrative conceptual taxonomy of uncertainty. A 3-dimensional taxonomy is proposed that characterizes uncertainty in health care according to its fundamental sources, issues, and locus. It is shown how this new taxonomy facilitates an organized approach to the problem of uncertainty in health care by clarifying its nature and prognosis and suggesting appropriate strategies for its analysis and management.},

It is also a broad concept, including uncertainty over the path of macro phenomena like GDP growth, micro phenomena like the growth rate of firms, and noneconomic events like war and climate change. In this essay, I address four questions about uncertainty. First, what are some facts and patterns about economic uncertainty? Both macro and micro uncertainty appear to rise sharply in recessions and fall in booms. Uncertainty also varies heavily across countries—developing countries appear to have about one-third more macro uncertainty than developed countries. Second, why does uncertainty vary during business cycles? Third, do fluctuations in uncertainty affect behavior? Fourth, has higher uncertainty worsened the Great Recession and slowed the recovery? Much of this discussion is based on research on uncertainty from the last five years, reflecting the recent growth of the literature.},

	abstract = {Data ensembles are often used to infer statistics to be used for a summary display of an uncertain prediction. In a spatial context, these summary displays have the drawback that when uncertainty is encoded via a spatial spread, display glyph area increases in size with prediction uncertainty. This increase can be easily confounded with an increase in the size, strength or other attribute of the phenomenon being presented. We argue that by directly displaying a carefully chosen subset of a prediction ensemble, so that uncertainty is conveyed implicitly, such misinterpretations can be avoided. Since such a display does not require uncertainty annotation, an information channel remains available for encoding additional information about the prediction. We demonstrate these points in the context of hurricane prediction visualizations, showing how we avoid occlusion of selected ensemble elements while preserving the spatial statistics of the original ensemble, and how an explicit encoding of uncertainty can also be constructed from such a selection. We conclude with the results of a cognitive experiment demonstrating that the approach can be used to construct storm prediction displays that significantly reduce the confounding of uncertainty with storm size, and thus improve viewers' ability to estimate potential for storm damage.},

In a controlled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncertainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). Frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to better extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better decisions. Decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were(1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97\% of optimal(95\% CI: [95\%,98\%]), 5 percentage points more than control (95\% CI: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95\% CI:[2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95\% CI: [2,6]).Cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated.

Visualization research has often overlooked the errors and uncertainty which accompany the scientific process and describe key characteristics used to fully understand the data. The lack of these representations can be attributed, in part, to the inherent difficulty in defining, characterizing, and controlling this uncertainty, and in part, to the difficulty in including additional visual metaphors in a well designed, potent display. However, the exclusion of this information cripples the use of visualization as a decision making tool due to the fact that the display is no longer a true representation of the data. This systematic omission of uncertainty commands fundamental research within the visualization community to address, integrate, and expect uncertainty information. In this chapter, we outline sources and models of uncertainty, give an overview of the state-of-the-art, provide general guidelines, outline small exemplary applications, and finally, discuss open problems in uncertainty visualization.},

Di erent forms of uncertainty and errors are also introduced as the data are derived, transformed, interpolated, and nally rendered. In the absence of integrated presentation of data and uncertainty, the analysis of the visualization is incomplete at best and often leads to inaccurate or incorrect conclusions. This paper surveys techniques for presenting data together with uncertainty. These uncertainty visualization techniques present data in such a manner that users are made aware of the locations and degree of uncertainties in their data so as to make more informed analyses and decisions. The techniques include adding glyphs, adding geometry, modifying geometry, modifying attributes, animation, soni cation, and psycho-visual approaches. We present our results in uncertainty visualization for environmental visualization, surface interpolation, global illumination with radiosity, ow visualization, and gure animation. We also present a classi cation of the possibilities in uncertainty visualization, and locate our contributions within this classi cation.},

	abstract = {Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.},

This view identifies a fuzzy set with a point in a unit hypercube and a nonfuzzy set with a vertex of the cube. Paradoxes of two-valued logic and set theory, such as Russell's paradox, correspond to the midpoint of the fuzzy cube. The fundamental questions of fuzzy theory—How fuzzy is a fuzzy set? How much is one fuzzy set a subset of another?—are answered geometrically with the Fuzzy Entropy Theorem, the Fuzzy Subsethood Theorem, and the Entropy-Subsethood Theorem. A new geometric proof of the Subsethood Theorem is given, a corollary of which is that the apparently probabilistic relative frequency nA /N turns out to be the deterministic subsethood S(X, A), the degree to which the sample space X is contained in its subset A. So the frequency of successful trials is viewed as the degree to which all trials are successful. Recent Bayesian polemics against fuzzy theory are examined in light of the new sets-as-points theorems.},

Because of their popularity, there have been many findings from diverse domains of research (economics, engineering, ergonomics, human–computer interaction, management, psychology), but they remain largely disconnected from each other. The objective of this article is to review theoretical developments and empirical work on CDC tasks, and to introduce a novel framework (monitoring and control framework) as a tool for integrating theory and findings. The main thesis of the monitoring and control framework is that CDC tasks are characteristically uncertain environments, and subjective judgments of uncertainty guide the way in which monitoring and control behaviors attempt to reduce it. The article concludes by discussing new insights into continuing debates and future directions for research on CDC tasks. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In this article, we reviewed evidence suggesting that cognitive control processes are at the heart of uncertainty in decision-making contexts. Available evidence suggests that: (1) There is a strong conceptual overlap between the constructs of uncertainty and cognitive control; (2) There is a remarkable overlap between the neural networks associated with uncertainty and the brain networks subserving cognitive control; (3) The perception and estimation of uncertainty might play a key role in monitoring processes and the evaluation of the “need for control”; (4) Potential interactions between uncertainty and cognitive control might play a significant role in several affective disorders.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The authors base their arguments principally on observations made during the last year in a Marine Corps-sponsored study of regimental command and control. The main arguments are that uncertainty is a more fundamental, pervasive, and dominant problem than commonly recognized, and that the prospect of using information technology to significantly reduce the problem is not good. In fact, it is believed that the view that technology will blow away the fog of war is a dangerous delusion. The Marine Corps can benefit more from people solutions than from technology solutions. First and foremost, leaders can be taught to do a better job of handling uncertainty. The first step is to emphasize the point in doctrine and education that uncertainty is an inevitable and dominant feature of all military action and that commanders must be willing to act in the face of uncertainty.

We fitted several alternative cognitive models to a series of participants’ judgements of automation reliability observed in a maritime classification task in which participants were provided with automated advice. We examined three experiments including eight between-subjects conditions and 240 participants in total. Our results favoured a two-kernel delta-rule model of learning, which specifies that humans learn by prediction error, and respond according to a learning rate that is sensitive to environmental volatility. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in learning processes across participants. These outcomes speak to the learning processes underlying how humans estimate automation reliability, and thus have implications for practice.},

In many cases automation has provided the desired benefits and has extended system functionality well beyond existing human capabilities. Situation awareness, a person's mental model of the world around him or her is central to effective decision making and control in dynamic systems. This construct can be severely impacted by the implementation of automation. Complacency—overreliance on automation—is one major factor associated with a lack of vigilance in monitoring automation. Monitoring problems have also been found with systems that have a high incidence of false alarms, leading to a lack of trust in the automation. In addition to vigilance problems, the fact that operators are passive observers of automation instead of active processors of information may add to their problems in detecting the need for manual intervention and in reorienting themselves to the state of the system in order to do so.},

	abstract = {Air traffic control instructors controlled simulated traffic while a variety of techniques for determining situation awareness (SA) were implemented. SA was assessed using a self-report measure (the Situation Awareness Rating Technique, or SART), a query method that removed information on the plan-view display (the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique, or SAGAT), a query technique that did not have a memory component (the Situation-Present Assessment Method, or SPAM), and the detection of errors integrated into the scenarios (implicit performance). We used these measures of SA together with a measure of workload, NASA Task Load Index (TLX), to predict two different performance measures: (1) an over-the-shoulder, subjective assessment by a subject matter expert (SME), and (2) a count of the number of control actions remaining to be performed at the end of the scenario. The SME evaluation was predicted by workload and the controller’s appreciation of both the present and the future. The remaining-actions count (RAC) was predicted by the controller’s appreciation of the future. In fact, an appreciation of the present led to poorer RAC scores: the better the participant was at answering questions about the present or the better he or she understood the present situation, the larger the number of actions that remained to be performed. The results have implications for the relationships among workload, SA, and performance, and suggest limitations on several of the measures currently proposed as SA techniques. The results confirm that future versus present is an important conceptual difference in ATC. More important, they suggest that a controller who remains overly focused on the present may do so at the expense of the future.},

	abstract = {Automated driving systems are becoming increasingly prevalent throughout society. In conditionally automated vehicles, drivers may engage in non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), which can negatively affect their situation awareness (SA) and preparedness to resume control of the vehicle, when necessary. Previous work has investigated engagement in NDRTs, but questions remain unanswered regarding its effect on drivers’ SA during a takeover event. The objective of the current study is to use eye-tracking to aid in understanding how visual engagement in NDRTs affects changes in SA of the driving environment after a takeover request (TOR) has been issued. Thirty participants rode in a simulated SAE Level 3 automated driving environment and engaged in three separate pre-TOR tasks (Surrogate Reference Task, Monitoring Task, and Peripheral Detection Task) until presented with a TOR. Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT) scores and gaze behavior were recorded during the post-TOR segment. Overall, longer times spent viewing the driving scene, and more dispersed visual attention allocation, were observed to be associated with better overall SA. Also, location-based eye tracking metrics show most promise in differentiating between task conditions with significantly different SAGAT scores. Findings from this work can inform the development of real-time SA assessment techniques using eye movements and ultimately contribute to improved operator roadway awareness for next-generation automated transportation.},

	volume = {67},
	abstract = {Situation Awareness (SA) is a crucial factor in effective decision-making, especially in the dynamic flight environment. Consequently, an understanding of the types of SA errors that occur in this environment is beneficial.
This study uses reports from the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) database (accessed by the term "situational awareness") to investigate the types of SA errors that occur in aviation. The errors were classified into one of three major categories: Level 1 (failure to correctly perceive the information), Level 2 (failure to comprehend the situation), or Level 3 (failure to project the situation into the future).
Of the errors identified, 76.3\% were Level 1 SA errors, 20.3\% were Level 2, and 3.4\% were Level 3. Level 1 SA errors occurred when relevant data were not available, when data were hard to discriminate or detect, when a failure to monitor or observe data occurred, when presented information was misperceived, or when memory loss occurred. Level 2 SA errors involved a lack of or an incomplete mental model, the use of an incorrect mental model, over-reliance on default values, and miscellaneous other factors. Level 3 errors involved either an overprojection of current trends or miscellaneous other factors.
These results give an indication of the types and frequency of SA errors that occur in aviation, with failure to monitor or observe available information forming the largest single category. Many other causal factors are also indicated, however, including vigilance, automation problems, and poor mental models.},

The essential element in each of these endeavors is a focused effort on understanding and increasing operator SA in T\&D control centers. The power T\&D domain presents multiple vantage points upon which operator SA can be improved. The power T\&D industry continues to seek a solution to its situation awareness gap. The work described in this paper helps to identify areas where SA needs are lacking within the industry, and provides valuable insights to inform the development of future technology to support SA in the power T\&D domain.},

The objectives of this scoping review were to identify what types of SA frameworks are used in sports, what methods are used to directly assess SA in sports, and what are the cognitive skills that have been linked to SA in sports. Seven databases were searched for peer-reviewed papers examining SA in a sporting context. The literature search revealed a scarcity of studies that directly describe SA within a sporting context. The most common frameworks described in the sporting literature were the three-level framework and Distributed Situation Awareness. The direct methods of measuring SA in sports varied and included the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Technique (SAGAT), Cognition Self-Assessment Tool (CSAT), and Random Number Cognition Test (RANCT) tools. Lastly, the cognitive skills linked to SA in sports included visual behaviours, anticipation, and decision-making. After evaluating the research, we argue there is potential benefit in applying SA to a sporting context but there are, currently, issues of validity and reliability in how SA is described and assessed in sports.

However, research suggests that indirect physiological sensing methods may also be capable of predicting SA. Currently, it is unclear which particular physiological approaches are sensitive to changes in SA.MethodSeven databases were searched using the PRISMA reporting guidelines. Eligibility criteria included human-subject experiments that used at least one direct SA assessment technique, as well as at least one physiological measurement. Information extracted from each article was the physiological metric(s), the direct SA measurement(s), the correlation between these two metrics, and the experimental task(s). All studies underwent a quality assessment.ResultsTwenty-five articles were included in this review. Eye tracking techniques were the most commonly used physiological measures, and correlations between conscious aspects of eye movement measures and direct SA scores were observed. Evidence for cardiovascular predictors of SA were mixed. EEG studies were too few to form strong conclusions, but were consistently positive.ConclusionFurther investigation is needed to methodically collect more relevant data and comprehensively model the relationships between a wider range of physiological measurements and direct assessments of SA.ApplicationThis review will guide researchers and practitioners in methods to indirectly assess SA with sensors and highlight opportunities for future research on wearables and SA.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Investigation reports into the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig disaster identified issues with the drill crew's situation awareness (SA). The aim was to (1) apply the Driller's Situation Awareness (DSA) model to the cognitive data extracted from accident reports from this event to determine if it could help to explain why the crew erroneously concluded that the well was stable, which would (2) provide a preliminary evaluation of the model's validity.
Method
The DSA model was used for a content analysis of the SA components in the accounts of the crew's actions during two Negative Pressure Tests (NPT), in the hours before the blowout.
Results
The analysis provided (1) insight into the crew's likely cognitive processes before the blowout. In particular, it revealed issues with their interpretation and mental models of the well state, as well as possible influencing factors including expectation, distraction and experience, emphasising the impact that SA can have on process safety. The categorisation has (2) initially suggested that the DSA model does contain the appropriate components.
Limitations
There are limited first hand reports of this event and thus cognitive processes have to be inferred with a degree of caution.
Practical implications
The findings give a preliminary validation of the DSA model for further use in training and in investigation of well control events. Recommendations based on the findings are offered for assisting driller SA and consequently, for supporting safe and efficient drilling operations. There is also the opportunity to adapt the DSA model and apply the recommendations from the analysis to similar monitoring positions, where SA is essential, within the process industries.},

	abstract = {Adaptive cruise control (ACC), a driver assistance system that controls longitudinal motion, has been introduced in consumer cars in 1995. A next milestone is highly automated driving (HAD), a system that automates both longitudinal and lateral motion. We investigated the effects of ACC and HAD on drivers’ workload and situation awareness through a meta-analysis and narrative review of simulator and on-road studies. Based on a total of 32 studies, the unweighted mean self-reported workload was 43.5\% for manual driving, 38.6\% for ACC driving, and 22.7\% for HAD (0\%=minimum, 100=maximum on the NASA Task Load Index or Rating Scale Mental Effort). Based on 12 studies, the number of tasks completed on an in-vehicle display relative to manual driving (100\%) was 112\% for ACC and 261\% for HAD. Drivers of a highly automated car, and to a lesser extent ACC drivers, are likely to pick up tasks that are unrelated to driving. Both ACC and HAD can result in improved situation awareness compared to manual driving if drivers are motivated or instructed to detect objects in the environment. However, if drivers are engaged in non-driving tasks, situation awareness deteriorates for ACC and HAD compared to manual driving. The results of this review are consistent with the hypothesis that, from a Human Factors perspective, HAD is markedly different from ACC driving, because the driver of a highly automated car has the possibility, for better or worse, to divert attention to secondary tasks, whereas an ACC driver still has to attend to the roadway.},

A questionnaire designed to measure these variables was completed by 185 drillers working offshore on the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). The total WSA scale was found to exhibit acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha=0.86). Sub-scales measuring concentration; attention; anticipation and distraction had coefficients between 0.65 and 0.79. Higher levels of stress, sleep disruption and fatigue were significantly associated with lower levels of WSA. In a regression analysis, stress was found to be the only significant predictor of WSA. In relation to safety outcomes, lower WSA was related to increased participation in unsafe behaviour. Individuals who had previously been involved in a work accident had significantly lower WSA scores than those who had not had an accident.},

	abstract = {Background
Nursing work often occurs in complex and potentially hazardous settings. Awareness of patient and practice environments is an imperative for nurses in practice.
Objectives
To explore nursing students' situation awareness while engaging in simulated patient deterioration scenarios.
Design
The educational process of FIRST2ACT was the model for the nurse intervention. Situation awareness was measured quantitatively using the Situation Awareness Global Assessment tool. Four domains were measured: physiological perception (patient parameters), global perception (surroundings), comprehension (interpretation of information), and projection (forecasting outcomes).
Settings
Clinical laboratories at each of three participating universities.
Participants
Ninety-seven nursing students from three Australian universities.
Methods
Between March and July 2012, students participated in three video-recorded simulation events, in which a trained actor played patient roles and groups of three students worked as teams. To measure situation awareness, following the simulation each team leader was taken to a separate room and asked to report on a question set regarding the patient's vital signs, bedside setting and medical diagnosis.
Results and Conclusions
Overall, situation awareness was low (41\%). Of the four domains, physiological perceptions scored the lowest (26\%) and projection the highest (59\%). Final year nursing students may not have well developed situation awareness skills, especially when dealing with these types of scenarios. Education providers need to consider ways to assist students to fully develop this attribute. Findings suggest that this is an aspect of undergraduate nursing education that requires significant consideration by curriculum developers.},

Because of the underlying complexity of many such tasks, however, the models of the world implicitly or explicitly embedded in such tools are often incomplete and the problem-solving methods fallible. The result can be "brittleness" in situations that were not anticipated by the system designers. To deal with this weakness, it has been suggested that "cooperative" rather than "automated" problem-solving systems be designed. Such cooperative systems are proposed to explicitly enhance the collaboration of the person (or a group of people) and the computer system. This study evaluates the impact of alternative design concepts on the performance of 30 airline pilots interacting with such a cooperative system designed to support en-route flight planning. The results clearly demonstrate that different system design concepts can strongly influence the cognitive processes and resultant performances of users. Based on think-aloud protocols, cognitive models are proposed to account for how features of the computer system interacted with specific types of scenarios to influence exploration and decision making by the pilots. The results are then used to develop recommendations for guiding the design of cooperative systems.},

Two experiments explored human abilities to generate actions which might solve ill-defined decision problems. Subjects were given unlimited time to suggest as many solutions as possible. Their suggestions were compared to a hierarchical structural model of the actions developed by the experimenters that could be taken to solve the problem. Although subjects were capable of generating several actions that might be worth taking, their suggestions were far from complete. The second experiment replicated and extended these results by introducing instructions to generate quality actions. It employed a structural model derived from cluster analysis, an improved utility estimation technique, and offered substantial monetary incentives for quality or quantity of actions generated. This study confirmed the general conclusion that subjects fail to generate important high-utility actions. The implications of this result are discussed in respect to decision analysis in which a complete structural model of the decision problem is highly desirable.},

To build a cognitive description of a problem solving world, it is necessary to understand how representations of the world interact with different cognitive demands imposed by the application world in question and with characteristics of the cognitive agents, both for existing and prospective changes in the world. Building a cognitive description is part of a problem driven approach to the application of computational power. In tool-driven approaches, knowledge acquisition focuses on describing domain knowledge in terms of the syntax of computational mechanisms, that is, the language of implementation is used as a cognitive language. Semantic questions are displaced either to whoever selects the computational mechanisms or to the domain expert who enters knowledge. The alternative is to provide an umbrella structure of domain semantics that organizes and makes explicit what particular pieces of knowledge mean about problem solving in the domain. Acquiring and using domain semantics is essential to be capable of avoiding potential errors and specifying performance boundaries when building intelligent machines.},

Whereas the notion has gained considerable traction in the academic discourse, few empirical studies investigated how procedures are used as resources or if they are the only resources deployed. This paper applies resources for action approach to describe how a cockpit manages emergencies and other non-normal situations and the role played by the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH). Data was collected through participant observation, interviews, and analysis of technical documents. The results indicate that some situations encountered by pilots are far more complicated than the procedure anticipates. In order to cope with these situations, pilots employed strategies that interleaved a range of resources, often consulting fragments of the QRH checklists rather than following them from start to finish. These findings suggest that emergency checklists should be divided into smaller units that can be followed independently, and that procedures should sometimes provide pilots with choices rather than mandatory instructions. The other resources deployed can also enhance the performance of pilots.},

The model was reviewed a decade later and only a few studies have applied it to aviation. This paper proposes adjustments to the original model, based on recent theoretical developments and empirical evidence on the anomaly management activity in aviation. The model was divided into five components; three of which—activity, types of reasoning involved, and resources—were revisited and further developed. The two other components—fault behaviour and unit of analysis—were not updated and only discussed in the aviation context. As a result, the revisited model descriptively clarifies how the activity of anomaly management emerges from the use of a wide repertoire of strategies, involving a spectrum of types of reasoning and a set of resources for action, which are not limited to those anticipated by designers, such as checklists and the warning system. An instantiation of the revisited model highlights the implications of false alarms, which trigger a cascade of disturbances that, in turn, requires adaptive strategies based on heuristics and analogies and supported by pilot’s experience. The revisited model can support a more accurate analysis of anomalous situations and the redesign of work systems to achieve a better performance.},

Although numerous laboratory studies have been conducted, few data are available from routine flight operations. A survey among a representative sample of 200 Dutch airline pilots was used to determine the prevalence of AS and the severity of its consequences, and to test some of the factors leading to AS. Results show that AS is a relatively widespread phenomenon that occurs three times per year per pilot on average but rarely has serious consequences. In less than 10\% of the AS cases that were reviewed, an undesired aircraft state was induced. Reportable occurrences are estimated to occur only once every 1–3 years per pilot. Factors leading to a higher prevalence of AS include less flying experience, increasing complexity of the flight control mode, and flight duty periods of over 8 hr. It is concluded that AS is a manifestation of system and interface complexity rather than cognitive errors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {In domains such as nuclear power, industrial process control, and space shuttle mission control, there is increased interest in reducing personnel during nominal operations. An essential element in maintaining safe operations in high risk environments with this ‘on-call’ organizational architecture is to understand how to bring called-in practitioners up to speed quickly during escalating situations. Targeted ﬁeld observations were conducted to investigate what it means to update a supervisory controller on the status of a continuous, anomaly-driven process in a complex, distributed environment. Sixteen shift changes, or handovers, at the NASA Johnson Space Center were observed during the STS-76 Space Shuttle mission. The ﬁndings from this observational study highlight the importance of prior knowledge in the updates and demonstrate how missing updates can leave ﬂight controllers vulnerable to being unprepared. Implications for mitigating risk in the transition to ‘on-call’ architectures are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective
This research sought to determine whether people can perceive and process three nonredundant (and unrelated) signals in vision, hearing, and touch at the same time and how aging and concurrent task demands affect this ability.
Background
Multimodal displays have been shown to improve multitasking and attention management; however, their potential limitations are not well understood. The majority of studies on multimodal information presentation have focused on the processing of only two concurrent and, most often, redundant cues by younger participants.
Method
Two experiments were conducted in which younger and older adults detected and responded to a series of singles, pairs, and triplets of visual, auditory, and tactile cues in the absence (Experiment 1) and presence (Experiment 2) of an ongoing simulated driving task. Detection rates, response times, and driving task performance were measured.
Results
Compared to younger participants, older adults showed longer response times and higher error rates in response to cues/cue combinations. Older participants often missed the tactile cue when three cues were combined. They sometimes falsely reported the presence of a visual cue when presented with a pair of auditory and tactile signals. Driving performance suffered most in the presence of cue triplets.
Conclusion
People are more likely to miss information if more than two concurrent nonredundant signals are presented to different sensory channels.
Application
The findings from this work help inform the design of multimodal displays and ensure their usefulness across different age groups and in various application domains.},

Since group performance incorporates additional components of expertise that are not present in individual performance situations, these additional components must be examined in order to see a full picture of the successful utilisation of expertise in a group setting.

They also capture communication data from mobile devices, instruments, tools, machines and transmissions. Much of this data possesses an enormous amount of valuable knowledge, exploitation of which could yield economic benefit. Many organizations are taking advantage of business analytics and intelligence solutions to help them find new insights in their business processes and performance. For companies, however, it is still a nascent area, and many of them understand that there are more knowledge and insights that can be extracted from available big data using creativity, recombination and innovative methods, apply it to new knowledge creation and produce substantial value. This has created a need for finding a suitable approach in the firm’s big data related strategy. In this paper, the authors concur that big data is indeed a source of firm’s competitive advantage and consider that it is essential to have the right combination of people, tool and data along with management support and data‐oriented culture to gain competitiveness from big data. However, the authors also argue that organizations should consider the knowledge hidden in the big data as tacit knowledge and they should take advantage of the cumulative experience garnered by the companies and studies done so far by the scholars in this sphere from knowledge management perspective. Based on this idea, a big data oriented framework of organizational knowledge‐based strategy is proposed here.},

Currently, the processes by which humans track the level of reliability of automation are unclear. In the current study, we test cognitive models of learning that could potentially explain how humans track automation reliability. We fitted several alternative cognitive models to a series of participants’ judgements of automation reliability observed in a maritime classification task in which participants were provided with automated advice. We examined three experiments including eight between-subjects conditions and 240 participants in total. Our results favoured a two-kernel delta-rule model of learning, which specifies that humans learn by prediction error, and respond according to a learning rate that is sensitive to environmental volatility. However, we found substantial heterogeneity in learning processes across participants. These outcomes speak to the learning processes underlying how humans estimate automation reliability, and thus have implications for practice.},

How people really make decisions: by drawing on prior experience and using a combination of intuition and analysis. We have all seen images of firefighters rescuing people from burning buildings and paramedics treating bombing victims. How do these individuals make the split-second decisions that save lives? Most studies of decision making, based on artificial tasks assigned in laboratory settings, view people as biased and unskilled. In this modern classic, Gary A. Klein proposes a naturalistic approach to decision making, which views people as gaining experience that then enables them to use a combination of intuition and analysis to make decisions. To illustrate this approach, Klein tells stories of people—from pilots to chess masters—acting under such real-life constraints as time pressure, high stakes, personal responsibility, and shifting conditions. Since its publication, Sources of Power has been enormously influential. The book has sold more than 50,000 copies, has been translated into six languages, has been cited in professional journals that range from Journal of Marketing Research to Journal of Nursing, and is mentioned by Malcolm Gladwell in Blink. Author Gary Klein has collaborated with Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and served on a team that redesigned the White House Situation Room to support more effective decision making. The model of decision-making Klein proposes in the book has been adopted in many fields, including law enforcement training and petrochemical plant operation.},

Most studies that took into account cognitive style used rather general instruments to measure it, which do not focus on the specifics of managerial decision making. In this paper, we describe an experiment that uses an instrument specifically developed for a managerial context to study the relationship between cognitive style and decision performance when using tabular or graphical representations. We also take into account that having to deal with a misfitting information representation depletes cognitive resources, and thus might not only impede the solution of the current problem, but also impact subsequent problems. Our results confirm that a mismatch between information representation and cognitive style indeed has effects that last beyond the solution of the current decision problem.},

However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.},

Visualization research has often overlooked the errors and uncertainty which accompany the scientific process and describe key characteristics used to fully understand the data. The lack of these representations can be attributed, in part, to the inherent difficulty in defining, characterizing, and controlling this uncertainty, and in part, to the difficulty in including additional visual metaphors in a well designed, potent display. However, the exclusion of this information cripples the use of visualization as a decision making tool due to the fact that the display is no longer a true representation of the data. This systematic omission of uncertainty commands fundamental research within the visualization community to address, integrate, and expect uncertainty information. In this chapter, we outline sources and models of uncertainty, give an overview of the state-of-the-art, provide general guidelines, outline small exemplary applications, and finally, discuss open problems in uncertainty visualization.},

Lessons learned are derived from incidents that occurred during actual space missions. Some of these lessons are explained directly by the astronauts who experienced them firsthand"--},

Fortunately, researchers are making significant advancements in the communication of uncertainty. In this chapter, we detail new visualization methods and emerging cognitive theories that describe how we reason with visual representations of uncertainty. We describe the best practices in uncertainty visualization and the psychology behind how each approach supports viewers' judgments. This chapter begins with a brief overview of conventional and state-of-the-art uncertainty visualization techniques. Then we take an in-depth look at the pros and cons of each technique using cognitive theories that describe why and how the mind processes different types of uncertainty information.},

	abstract = {We propose an extension to the four-level nested model of design and validation of visualization system that deﬁnes the term “guidelines” in terms of blocks at each level. Blocks are the outcomes of the design process at a speciﬁc level, and guidelines discuss relationships between these blocks. Within-level guidelines provide comparisons for blocks within the same level, while between-level guidelines provide mappings between adjacent levels of design. These guidelines help a designer choose which abstractions, techniques, and algorithms are reasonable to combine when building a visualization system. This deﬁnition of guideline allows analysis of how the validation efforts in different kinds of papers typically lead to different kinds of guidelines. Analysis through the lens of blocks and guidelines also led us to identify four major needs: a deﬁnition of the meaning of block at the problem level; mid-level task taxonomies to ﬁll in the blocks at the abstraction level; reﬁnement of the model itself at the abstraction level; and a more complete set of mappings up from the algorithm level to the technique level. These gaps in visualization knowledge present rich opportunities for future work.},

With the goal of providing guidance between these visual encoding choices, we conducted an empirical data study in which two human coders manually inspected a broad set of 816 scatterplots derived from 75 datasets, 4 DR techniques, and the 3 previously mentioned scatterplot techniques. Each coder scored all color-coded classes in each scatterplot in terms of their separability from other classes. We analyze the resulting quantitative data with a heatmap approach, and qualitatively discuss interesting scatterplot examples. Our findings reveal that 2D scatterplots are often 'good enough', that is, neither SPLOM nor interactive 3D adds notably more cluster separability with the chosen DR technique. If 2D is not good enough, the most promising approach is to use an alternative DR technique in 2D. Beyond that, SPLOM occasionally adds additional value, and interactive 3D rarely helps but often hurts in terms of poorer class separation and usability. We summarize these results as a workflow model and implications for design. Our results offer guidance to analysts during the DR exploration process.},

“One of the things that really hurt Apple was, after I left, John Sculley got a very serious disease. And that disease—I’ve seen other people get it too—is the disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90\% of the work.”

But that’s never the case. As Steve explains, a product idea never turns out as originally conceived because you learn a lot from the details of building it, and there are always tradeoffs you have to make.

“There’s a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product… and it’s that process that is the magic.”

He compares a team working hard on something they’re passionate about to a rock tumbler:

“It's through the team--through a group of incredibly talented people--bumping up against each other, having arguments, having fights sometimes, making some noise, and working together... they polish each other and polish the ideas. And what comes out are these really beautiful stones.”

	abstract = {Creativity is one of the most important assets we have to navigate through the fast changing world of the 21st century. Anecdotal accounts of creative individuals suggest that oftentimes, creative discoveries result from a process whereby initial conscious thought is followed by a period during which one refrains from task-related conscious thought. For example, one may spend an embarrassing amount of time thinking about a problem when the solution suddenly pops into consciousness while taking a shower. Not only creative individuals but also traditional theories of creativity have put a lot of emphasis on this incubation stage in creative thinking. The aim of the present article is twofold. First, an overview of the domain of incubation and creativity is provided by reviewing and discussing studies on incubation, mind-wandering, and sleep. Second, the causes of incubation effects are discussed. Previously, little attention has been paid to the causes of incubation effects and most findings do not really speak to whether the effects should be explained by unconscious processes or merely by consequences of a period of distraction. In the latter case, there is no need to assume active unconscious processes. The findings discussed in the current article support the idea that it is not merely the absence of conscious thought that drives incubation effects, but that during an incubation period unconscious processes contribute to creative thinking. Finally, practical implications and directions for future research will be discussed.},

	abstract = {Purpose The aim of this paper is to outline how artificial intelligence (AI) can augment learning process in the workplace and where there are limitations.Design/methodology/approach The paper is a theoretical-based outline with reference to individual and organizational learning theory, which are related to machine learning methods as they are currently in use in the workplace. Based on these theoretical insights, the paper presents a qualitative evaluation of the augmentation potential of AI to assist individual and organizational learning in the workplace.Findings The core outcome is that there is an augmentation potential of AI to enhance individual learning and development in the workplace, which however should not be overestimated. AI has a complementarity to individual intelligence, which can lead to an advancement, especially in quality, accuracy and precision. Moreover, AI has a potential to support individual competence development and organizational learning processes. However, a further outcome is that AI in the workplace is a double-edged sword, as it easily shows reinforcement effects in individual and organizational learning, which have a backside of unintended effects.Research limitations/implications The conceptual outline makes use of examples for illustrating phenomenon but needs further empirical analysis. The research focus on the meso level of the workplace does not fully refer to macro level outcomes.Practical implications The practical implication is that it is a matter of socio-technical job design to integrate AI in the workplace in a valuable manner. There is a need to keep the human-in-the-loop and to complement AI-based learning approaches with non-AI counterparts to reach augmentation.Originality/value The paper faces workplace learning from an interdisciplinary perspective and bridges insights from learning theory with methods from the machine learning community. It directs the social science discourse on AI, which is often on macro level to the meso level of the workplace and related issues for job design and therefore provides a complementary perspective.},

In this paper, we intend to explain why the Fitts list is such a pervasive factor in function allocation research, despite having received extensive criticism. We invoke philosophy of science, and we show that the Fitts list fulfils six important criteria for appraising scientific theories: plausibility, explanatory adequacy, interpretability, simplicity, descriptive adequacy, and generalisability. Furthermore, we show that the Fitts report identified issues which decades later became known as the ironies of automation. We conclude that the Fitts list is an adequate approximation that captures the most important regularity of automation, and that the Fitts report represents an unprecedented intellectual achievement that has succeeded in its pioneering objective.},

The focus of this discussion is on understanding the impact of knowledge-based systems on human users' knowledge acquisition and retention and outlining an alternative research strategy that centers more on transferring knowledge to the user during the work production process in order to maintain human expertise and relevance in professional decision making. Contemporary research still argues that human-computer collaboration may outperform either on their own; but, to limit the deskilling effect of knowledge-based systems and alternatively promote skill development, we call upon academic researchers to seek better ways to keep the human relevant in a broad range of knowledge work fields. Further, we suggest that expanding the philosophical discussions of the ethics of artificial intelligence-based technologies and the corollary impact on the rapid decline of the professions is necessary.},

They emphasized the unique human factors of "enjoyment" and "agency", where humans remain the arbiters of "AI alignment". However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers.

In expressing an artistic intent or form, data-based creative practices synthesize and build upon techniques in communications and aesthetics.

Although it is usually considered an essentially technical field, effort has been made recently to better understand users' human explanation methods and cognitive constraints. Despite these advances, the community lacks a general vision of what and how cognitive biases affect explainability systems. To address this gap, we present a heuristic map which matches human cognitive biases with explainability techniques from the XAI literature, structured around XAI-aided decision-making. We identify four main ways cognitive biases affect or are affected by XAI systems: 1) cognitive biases affect how XAI methods are designed, 2) they can distort how XAI techniques are evaluated in user studies, 3) some cognitive biases can be successfully mitigated by XAI techniques, and, on the contrary, 4) some cognitive biases can be exacerbated by XAI techniques. We construct this heuristic map through the systematic review of 37 papers-drawn from a corpus of 285-that reveal cognitive biases in XAI systems, including the explainability method and the user and task types in which they arise. We use the findings from our review to structure directions for future XAI systems to better align with people's cognitive processes.},

Twenty cognitive biases are covered, as are possible debiasing techniques that can be adopted by designers of machine learning algorithms and software.

Students preparing for UX careers are positioned in a liminal space between their educational experience and future practice, and are actively working to build a bridge between their developing philosophy of design and the translation of that philosophy when faced with the complexity of design practice. In this study, we interviewed ten students and practitioners educated within design-oriented HCI programs, focusing on their design philosophy and evaluating how their philosophical beliefs were shaped in practice. Building on prior work on ﬂows of competence, we thematically analyzed these interviews, identifying the philosophical beliefs of these designers and their trajectories of development, adoption, or suppression in industry. We identify opportunities for enhancements to UX educational practices and future research on design complexity in industry contexts.},

	abstract = {User experience (UX) professionals' attempts to address social values as a part of their work practice can overlap with tactics to contest, resist, or change the companies they work for. This paper studies tactics that take place in this overlap, where UX professionals try to re-shape the values embodied and promoted by their companies, in addition to the values embodied and promoted in the technical systems and products that their companies produce. Through interviews with UX professionals working at large U.S.-based technology companies and observations at UX meetup events, this paper identifies tactics used towards three goals: (1) creating space for UX expertise to address values; (2) making values visible and relevant to other organizational stakeholders; and (3) changing organizational processes and orientations towards values. This paper analyzes these as tactics of resistance: UX professionals seek to subvert or change existing practices and organizational structures towards more values-conscious ends. Yet, these tactics of resistance often rely on the dominant discourses and logics of the technology industry. The paper characterizes these as partial or "soft" tactics, but also argues that they nevertheless hold possibilities for enacting values-oriented changes.},

Reframing processes are amplified in a social context, requiring considerable time and effort on the part of design teams. Reframing has distinctive features that set it apart from other steps of reflective practice. Two iterative stages are discerned: sensemaking, to reconstruct prior operating frames; and future framing, to design a frame for future activities. Surprises incite reframing, and we argue that surprises are a source for team learning and innovation.},

	abstract = {Sample sizes must be ascertained in qualitative studies like in quantitative studies but not by the same means. The prevailing concept for sample size in qualitative studies is “saturation.” Saturation is closely tied to a specific methodology, and the term is inconsistently applied. We propose the concept “information power” to guide adequate sample size for qualitative studies. Information power indicates that the more information the sample holds, relevant for the actual study, the lower amount of participants is needed. We suggest that the size of a sample with sufficient information power depends on (a) the aim of the study, (b) sample specificity, (c) use of established theory, (d) quality of dialogue, and (e) analysis strategy. We present a model where these elements of information and their relevant dimensions are related to information power. Application of this model in the planning and during data collection of a qualitative study is discussed.},

Researchers in other fields have developed concepts that are distinct from, but clearly related to team mental models, including information sharing, transactive memory, group learning, and cognitive consensus. Although these research streams currently exist in parallel with little cross-fertilization, there is much to be gained from integration across disciplinary boundaries. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to enrich the theoretical understanding of team mental models and to broaden the empirical research base by adopting a cross-disciplinary focus and incorporating related team knowledge domains from other literatures. Based on a synthesis of various literatures, we develop a framework that delineates the relationships among team knowledge constructs. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fast product follow-ups and increasing customer demands have changed product design from a rather unstructured process, into a systematic activity. Nowadays, both companies and researchers have developed the organizational aspects of integrated product design. However, attention to the collaborative aspects lags behind the structural and organizational aspects. The aim of this study was gaining a better understanding of the collaborative processes of actors from different disciplines during the product design process in industry. We called this process collaborative design. Collaborative design consists of three building blocks: - knowledge creation and -integration between actors from different disciplines - communication between the actors about both the design content and the design process - the creation of shared understanding about the subjects communicated In this thesis, we focused on the third building block: the process of creating shared understanding between different disciplines about the design they were making. During empirical case study research in industry, we investigated what factors influence the creation of shared understanding between actors in collaborative design projects. Additionally, we examined the collaborative mechanisms that occur in these projects. Collaborative mechanisms describe what influence the factors found have on the creation of shared understanding have on the three building blocks of collaborative design. The results of thesis form a significant step towards a better understanding of collaborative design processes in industry.},

However, despite the potential for knowledge sharing between these communities, we have little understanding of the ways in which practitioners design in real-world, professional settings. Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding visualization design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment. These ﬁndings have implications for how visualization researchers understand and engage with practitioners, and how educators approach the training of future data visualization designers.},

	abstract = {The thinking process of designers is one of the most important issues in design research. This paper intends to enlarge design thinking theory and research by taking a close theoretical and empirical look at the very basic elements of thinking in design. Based on theoretical assumptions, thinking in design is reduced to the four basic cognitive operations of generation, exploration, comparison and selection, which, in various combinations, are applied to the goal space and the solution space of a given problem as well as to the organisation of the collective process of teamwork. These basic cognitive operations can be mapped onto different stages of the design process, thus establishing a generic model of design team activity. The generic model can be used to describe both, activities directed towards the content of a design problem as well as activities towards the organisation of the group process. Three laboratory teams solving a complex design problem extending over six hours have been studied in order to investigate the collective thinking process. Team communication has been recorded and analysed sentence-by-sentence, with each communicative act being classified according to the generic model. Based on previous results in the psychology of human information-processing and decision-making, a two-process-theory of thinking in design teams is proposed capable of explaining the results from the empirical investigation. The implications of the two-process-theory for training and practice of designers are discussed.},

	abstract = {Design thinking comprises an approach to problem solving that uses tools traditionally utilized by designers of commercial products, processes, and environments (e.g., designing a new car or the layout of a new airport). While design thinking was originally introduced as an approach that would work best when infused into the culture of an organization, most early studies of design thinking focused on identifying the specific tools and methods that might be used to solve management problems. Only recently have researchers examined how the implementation of design thinking might relate to organizational-level constructs, such as organizational culture. In this review, we examine empirical research (mostly from the past decade) that relates the practice of design thinking to the development of culture in organizations. Through this review, we identify how the use of specific design thinking tools supports the development of specific organizational cultures and vice versa. In addition, we identify how using design thinking tools produces emotional experiences and physical artifacts that help users to understand why and how specific cultures support the effective use of specific tools. Together, our review findings suggest that the experiential nature of design thinking tools and cultures (i.e., that they require people to actively engage in hands-on work) allows them to support one another. On the basis of this insight, we develop a general framework for organizing design thinking research and identify a number of avenues for future research that might advance our understanding of design thinking in organizational contexts.},

Our review draws on research and theory in social psychology, sociology, and organization behavior. We conclude that these innovative perspectives on socially shared behavior represent a new approach to the study of groups and are distinct from traditional models of the group mind and crowd behavior. The key processes implicated in these models focus on the potency of immediate interaction, reciprocal influence processes between individuals and groups, goal-directed behavior, negotiated processing of information and ideas, and the maintenance and enhancement of social identity. This approach to socially shared understanding is not antagonistic toward the analysis of individual-level processes but rather maintains that individual-level processes are necessary but not sufficient to build a social psychology of shared understanding.},

We first review how collective action frames have been conceptualized, including their characteristic and variable features. We then examine the literature related to framing dynamics and processes. Next we review the literature regarding various contextual factors that constrain and facilitate framing processes.

We propose that user goals direct visualization use tasks, but the strength of user motivation is modified by promoting and inhibiting factors. Based on the duration and frequency of use for reported artifacts, we hypothesize that artifact use patterns depend on how promoters and inhibitors change over time, and we propose a six-stage model of artifact use. We hypothesize that the differences in how these artifacts were used ultimately reveals how promoters and inhibitors can be manipulated to promote frequent and long-duration visualization use. This model provides a cognitive framework for visualization designers and suggests new research directions.},

Existing dashboard design guidelines, however, are often unable to account for this expanded scope as they largely focus on best practices for visual design. In contrast, we frame dashboard design as facilitating an analytical conversation: a cooperative, interactive experience where a user may interact with, reason about, or freely query the underlying data. By drawing on established principles of conversational flow and communication, we define the concept of a cooperative d ashboard as one that enables a fruitful and productive analytical conversation, and derive a set of 39 dashboard design heuristics to support effective analytical conversations. To assess the utility of this framing, we asked 52 computer science and engineering graduate students to apply our heuristics to critique and design dashboards as part of an ungraded, opt-in homework assignment. Feedback from participants demonstrates that our heuristics surface new reasons dashboards may fail, and encourage a more fluid, supportive, and responsive style of dashboard d esign. Our approach suggests several compelling directions for future work, including dashboard authoring tools that better anticipate conversational turn-taking, repair, and refinement and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows.},

In particular, VERB offers easy-to-follow examples that explore the effects of these debiasing techniques on the geometry of high-dimensional word vectors. To help understand how various debiasing techniques change the underlying geometry, VERB decomposes each technique into interpretable sequences of primitive transformations and highlights their effect on the word vectors using dimensionality reduction and interactive visual exploration. VERB is designed to target natural language processing (NLP) practitioners who are designing decision-making systems on top of word embeddings and researchers working with the fairness and ethics of machine learning systems in NLP. It can also serve as a visual medium for education, which helps an NLP novice understand and mitigate biases in word embeddings.},

The goal of visual analytics was to develop ways of interactively visualizing data, information, and computational analysis methods that augment human expertise in analysis and decision-making. In this paper, we examine the role of human reasoning in data analysis and decision-making, focusing on issues of expertise and objectivity in interpreting data for purposes of decision-making. We do this by integrating the visual analytics perspective with Decision Intelligence, a cognitive framework that emphasizes the connection between computational data analyses, predictive models, actions that can be taken, and predicted outcomes of those actions. Because Decision Intelligence models factors of operational capabilities and stakeholder beliefs, it necessarily extends objective data analytics to include intuitive aspects of expert decision-making such as human judgment, values, and ethics. By combining these two perspectives we believe that researchers will be better able to generate actionable decisions that ideally effectively utilize human expertise, while eliminating bias. This paper aims to provide a framework of how Decision Intelligence leverages visual analytics tools and human reasoning to support the decision-making process.},

We highlight three main findings: outliers skew trend perception but exert less influence than other points; trend lines make trends seem stronger but also mitigate the influence of some outliers; and people's beliefs have a small influence on perceptions of weak, but not strong correlations. From these results we derive guidelines for adjusting visual elements to mitigate the influence of factors that distort interpretations of scatter plots.

Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms judgment and decision making are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence peoples judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.},

Recent studies attempted to examine the origins of this bias and to mitigate it by using the logarithmic vs. the linear scale in graphical representations. However, they yielded conflicting results as to which scale induces more perceptual errors. In the current study, in an experiment with a short educational intervention, we further examine the factors modulating the exponential bias in graphs and suggest a theoretical explanation for our findings. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that each of the scales can induce misperceptions in a particular context. In addition to this, we explore the effect of mathematical education by testing two groups of participants (with a background in humanities vs. formal sciences). The results of this study confirm that when used in an inadequate context, these scales can have a dramatic effect on the interpretation of visualizations representing exponential growth. In particular, while the log scale leads to more errors in graph description tasks, the linear scale misleads people when they have to make predictions on the future trajectory of exponential growth. The second part of the study revealed that the difficulties with both scales can be reduced by means of a short educational intervention. Importantly, while no difference between participants groups was observed prior to the intervention, participants with a better mathematical education showed a stronger learning effect at posttest. The findings of this study are discussed in light of a dual-process model.},

Second, that neither recommendation or presentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral change. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a visualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's personal content. We performed an "in the wild" evaluation of this platform, and found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased algorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the mixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed politically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the recommended profiles. Finally, our results contribute insights in two aspects: first, which individual differences are important when designing platforms aimed at behavioral change; and second, which algorithms and user interfaces should be mixed to help users avoid cognitive mechanisms that lead to biased behavior.},

Building on their insights, we introduce BiasEye, a bias-aware real-time interactive material screening visualization system.

It also aids users in identifying and mitigating biases through a machine learning (ML) approach that models individual screening preferences. Findings from a mixed-design user study with 20 participants demonstrate that, compared to a baseline system lacking our bias-aware features, BiasEye increases participants' bias awareness and boosts their confidence in making final decisions.

This design space encompasses existing approaches to address the forking paths problem (multiple comparison correction) as well as solutions that have not been applied to exploratory visual analytics (regularization). We also discuss how perceptual bias correction techniques may be used to correct biases induced in analysts’ understanding of their data due to the forking paths problem, and outline how this problem can be cast as a threat to validity within Munzner’s Nested Model of visualization design.

            Data visualizations are often represented in public discourse as objective proof of facts. However, a visualization is only a single translation of reality, just like any other media, representation devices, or modes of representation. If we wish to encourage thoughtful, informed, and literate consumption of data visualizations, it is crucial that we consider why they are often presented and interpreted as objective. We reflect theoretically on data visualization as a system of representation historically anchored in science, rationalism, and notions of objectivity. It establishes itself within a lineage of conventions for visual representations which extends from the Renaissance to the present and includes perspective drawing, photography, cinema and television, as well as computer graphics. By examining our tendency to see credibility in data visualizations and grounding that predisposition in a historical context, we hope to encourage more critical and nuanced production and interpretation of data visualizations in the public discourse.},

	abstract = {Misinformation has disruptive effects on our lives. Many researchers have looked into means to identify and combat misinformation in text or data visualization. However, there is still a lack of understanding of how misinformation can be introduced when text and visualization are combined to tell data stories, not to mention how to improve the lay public's awareness of possible misperceptions about facts in narrative visualization. In this paper, we first analyze where misinformation could possibly be injected into the production-consumption process of data stories through a literature survey. Then, as a first step towards combating misinformation in data stories, we explore possible defensive design methods to enhance the reader's awareness of information misalignment when data facts are scripted and visualized. More specifically, we conduct a between-subjects crowdsourcing study to investigate the impact of two design methods enhancing text-visualization integration, i.e., explanatory annotation and interactive linking, on users' awareness of misinformation in data stories. The study results show that although most participants still can not find misinformation, the two design methods can significantly lower the perceived credibility of the text or visualizations. Our work informs the possibility of fighting an infodemic through defensive design methods.},

This panel brings together human factors researchers and systems designers who are familiar with mission control to discuss the cognitive factors, organizational practices, and technological innovations that contribute to the success of space shuttle missions. As with other complex domains, economic and technological pressures are threatening mission control's bases for success. These pressures (e.g., budget/staff reductions, more complex technology, and longer, more remote missions) are intensifying demands for “smarter”, more autonomous computer support tools. Therefore, this panel explores approaches for designing intelligent systems and automation that perform as “team players” in challenging operational environments - where effective collaboration constitutes the key to success.},

	abstract = {NASA’s exploration program envisions the utilization of a Deep Space Habitat (DSH) for human exploration of the space environment in the vicinity of Mars and/or asteroids. Communication latencies with ground control of as long as 20+ minutes make it imperative that DSH operations be highly autonomous, as any telemetry-based detection of a systems problem on Earth could well occur too late to assist the crew with the problem. A DSHbased development program has been initiated to develop and test the automation technologies necessary to support highly autonomous DSH operations. One such technology is a fault management tool to support performance monitoring of vehicle systems operations and to assist with real-time decision making in connection with operational anomalies and failures. Toward that end, we are developing Advanced Caution and Warning System (ACAWS), a tool that combines dynamic and interactive graphical representations of spacecraft systems, systems modeling, automated diagnostic analysis and root cause identification, system and mission impact assessment, and mitigation procedure identification to help spacecraft operators (both flight controllers and crew) understand and respond to anomalies more effectively. In this paper, we describe four major architecture elements of ACAWS: Anomaly Detection, Fault Isolation, System Effects Analysis, and Graphic User Interface (GUI), and how these elements work in concert with each other and with other tools to provide fault management support to both the controllers and crew. We then describe recent evaluations and tests of ACAWS on the DSH testbed. The results of these tests support the feasibility and strength of our approach to failure management automation and enhanced operational autonomy.},

	abstract = {Any system with a human component is inherently risky. Studies in human factors and psychology have repeatedly shown that human operators will inevitably make errors, regardless of how well they are trained. Onboard the International Space Station (ISS) where crew time is arguably the most valuable resource, errors by the crew or ground operators can be costly to critical science objectives. Operations experts at the ISS Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC), located at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, have learned that from payload concept development through execution, there are countless opportunities to introduce errors that can potentially result in costly losses of crew time and science. To effectively address this challenge, we must approach the design, testing, and operation processes with two specific goals in mind. First, a systematic approach to error and human centered design methodology should be implemented to minimize opportunities for operator error. Second, we must assume that human errors will be made and enable rapid identification and recoverability when they occur. While a systematic approach and human centered development process can go a long way toward eliminating error, the complete exclusion of operator error is not a reasonable expectation. The ISS environment in particular poses challenging conditions, especially for flight controllers and astronauts. Operating a scientific laboratory 250 miles above the Earth is a complicated and dangerous task with high stakes and a steep learning curve. While human error is a reality that may never be fully eliminated, smart implementation of carefully chosen tools and techniques can go a long way toward minimizing risk and increasing the efficiency of NASA’s space science operations.},

	abstract = {This paper contrasts cooperative work in two cases of distributed anomaly response, both from space shuttle mission control, to learn about the factors that make anomaly response robust. In one case (STS-76), ﬂight controllers in mission control recognized an anomaly that began during the ascent phase of a space shuttle mission, analyzed the implications of the failure for mission plans, and made adjustments to plans (the ﬂight ended safely). In this case, a Cooperative Advocacy approach facilitated a process in which diverse perspectives were orchestrated to provide broadening and cross-checks that reduced the risk of premature narrowing. In the second case (the Columbia space shuttle accident—STS-107), mission management treated a debris strike during launch as a side issue rather than a safety of ﬂight concern and was unable to recognize the dangers of this event for the ﬂight which ended in tragedy. In this case, broadening and cross-checks were missing due to fragmentation over the groups involved in the anomaly response process. The comparison of these cases points to critical requirements for designing collaboration over multiple groups in anomaly response situations.},

Recently, literature has focused on knowing how influential the anchoring effect is when applied to information visualization, with studies finding its reproducibility in the field. Despite the extensive literature surrounding the anchoring effect?s robustness, there is still a need for research on which individual differences make people more susceptible. We explore how Locus of Control influences visualization?s ubiquitous and resilient anchoring effect. Locus of Control differentiates individuals who believe their life depends on their behavior or actions from those who blame outside factors such as destiny or luck for their life?s outcomes. We focus on the relationship between Locus of Control and the anchoring effect by exposing subjects to an anchor and analyzing their interaction with a complex visualization. Our results show that the anchoring strategies primed individuals and suggest that the Locus of Control plays a role in the susceptibility to the anchoring effect.},

Engineering ethics has to be framed and taught in a way that addresses these realities. This paper proposes a combination of the philosophy of pragmatism and the ethic of care as a possible framework for the practice of engineering ethics that can provide flexibility and openness to address engineering ethics problems more realistically within the ethos and culture of engineering. Embedding values into practice, pragmatism and care provide a broad, reflective, and corrective framework for engineering ethics that can accommodate the realities in which engineering operates. It is shown that these two approaches are more consonant with design methodologies and have a natural fit with design thinking, so they mesh well with what engineers do and with the complexities of their work today. As humans more and more try to alter the socio-techno-natural world, e.g., the earth’s climate, the combination of pragmatism and care will allow enhanced ethical behavior. Alterations to complex adaptive systems will produce highly uncertain results that require engineers to have a mindset that allows them to act with humility in the face of significant uncertainty and potential catastrophic failures.},

Despite previous research acknowledging the importance of including societal-level discussions in engineering and technology undergraduate curricula, there is a lack of research around college students’ understanding of and engagement with the ethics of new and emerging technology. In this qualitative study, we present the results from 17 interviews with students from a range of engineering and technology fields, describing how they reason as both designers and consumers of new technology. Our goal is to characterize students’ patterns of reasoning about the ethics of new technology, and, in this paper, we describe how this reasoning is argued from multiple stakeholder perspectives (corporations, government, professionals, users and society). Our findings indicate privacy, security and balance of power as the most relevant ethical issues to respondents, and that participants consider several stakeholders in their reasoning, often shifting among multiple perspectives. Furthermore, interviewed students often concluded their reasoning by either resigning themselves to the pervasiveness of technology or by pushing the liability concerns to one stakeholder while diminishing the responsibility of others. In each case, respondents frequently avoided entering societal-level discussions related to ethical issues of emerging technology. Our results offer relevant insights that can facilitate further work related to the research and teaching of ethics to college students, as well as suggest areas for future research particularly building upon participants’ feelings of resignation in relation to unethical use of new technology.},

	abstract = {One major problem with pilot-automation interaction on modern flight decks is a lack of mode awareness; that is, a lack of knowledge and understanding of the current and future status and behavior of the automation. A lack of mode awareness is not simply a pilot problem; rather, it is a symptom of a coordination breakdown between humans and machines. Recent changes in automation design can therefore be expected to have an impact on the nature of problems related to mode awareness. To examine how new automation properties might affect pilot-automation coordination, we performed a full-mission simulation study on one of the most advanced automated aircraft, the Airbus A-320. The results of this work indicate that mode errors and "automation surprises" still occur on these advanced aircraft. However, there appear to be more opportunities for delayed or missing interventions with undesirable system activities, possibly because of higher system autonomy and coupling.},

	abstract = {Purpose In a work environment marked by unprecedented complexity, volatility and ambiguity, managers must accomplish their objectives while navigating many challenges. This paper aims to investigate potential interrelations among environmental transformations, cognitive biases and strategic decisions. In particular, the purpose of the study is to crystallize the state of art on the impact of cognitive biases on strategic decisions, in the context of environmental transformations. Design/methodology/approach The authors have conducted a systematic literature review to identify existing relevant work on this topic and to detect potential avenues for future research. Findings The findings highlight how decision-making is influenced and enabled by internal (e.g. perception) and external factors (e.g. digitalization). Specifically, the strategic role of cognitive biases appears to be crucial when investigating the related impact on strategic decisions in times of environmental transformation. Practical implications Implications are drawn for scholars and practitioners interested in evaluating the role of specific decision-making determinants for the formation and implementation of strategic decisions. In this sense, we stress that decision-makers need to manage their cognitive biases and select the right information out of a wide data set in order to adapt to environmental transformations. Originality/value By systematizing the literature review, potential interrelations among environmental transformations, cognitive biases and strategic decisions are identified. Furthermore, the primary phases that drive the decision-making process are proposed (analysis, decision, onboarding and control).},

We address the research question: how do sticky notes support design cognition and collaboration when compared to other kinds of design materials? We compare four types of design materials (sketches, prototypes, cards, sticky notes) and the activities aﬀorded by the properties of these materials. We ﬁnd that the aﬀordances of sticky notes make them well-suited to supporting cognitive processes associated with visualizing and understanding “part/whole” relationships in concept development. Furthermore, sticky notes facilitate design collaboration by enabling shared attention through material anchors and the modulation of turn-taking. We conclude by suggesting new directions for theorizing about sticky-note usage in design. Ó 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Theories and models of design propose reasoning that follows abductive-deductive patterns. At the micro-level, these patterns are untested. This study analyses verbal reasoning patterns at the micro-level for group idea generation using protocol analyses of concurrent verbalisations from ﬁve design teams with industry participants. The results show that reasoning in design activity across 218 ideas follows general patterns of abductive-deductive reasoning. At the individual idea level, the reasoning patterns are disorderly and enter into micro-patterns of inference. The study concludes that understanding reasoning at early-stage idea generation processes is indicative of the mental models and abductive-deductive reasoning that are prevalent in design activity.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has been disseminated across various industries, and algorithm-based activities are becoming common in design disciplines. Despite high expectations of collaborating with intelligent systems, whether designers are actually interested in working with algorithms has been little discussed. This paper summarises ongoing research findings that have probed the use of AI features in design practices. A survey of Brazilian UX/UI professionals was conducted to map their AI-supported activities and explore their perspectives on interacting with AI systems and future adoption scenarios. The findings indicate a low usage rate of AI tools in the Brazilian UX/UI industry and a limited operational perspective regarding the role, application, and impact of intelligent technologies on design. Surveyed UX/UI designers are more prone to adopt AI as a virtual assistant to facilitate practice and increase process efficiency rather than as a creative collaborator.},

We contrast our framework against cognitive bias codex by Buster Benson. The framework is inspired by Norman’s Human Action Cycle [23] and classiﬁes biases into three levels: perceptual biases, action biases, and social biases. For each of the levels of cognitive processing, we discuss examples of biases from the cognitive science literature, and speculate how they might also be important to the area of visualization. In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist. We hope that the framework will help spark new ideas and discussions on how to proceed studying the important topic of biases in visualization.},

	abstract = {Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI’s role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of “enjoyment” and “agency”, where humans remain the arbiters of “AI alignment”. However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens of responsible and participatory AI, we contribute a deeper understanding of GenAI fears and opportunities for UXD.

The purpose of this study is to conduct an illustrated literature review of eleven studies on AI-supported UX processes in order to highlight research problems, benefits, methodologies, gaps, and solutions to address them. These may provide insight and information that may help guide future studies. This study is prompted by the fact that there are numerous UX process issues that can obstruct designers' work.

	abstract = {User experience (UX) is often cited as one of the fastest growing occupations, creating opportunities across nearly every sector for individuals skilled in the application of user-centered design principles and methods. Many information and library schools have responded to this demand by introducing more UX coursework into their curriculum, but the proliferation of agile software development and lean product design has incentivized organizations to look for experienced individuals for UX roles, even those that are considered entry-level. As a result, aspiring information professionals face a paradoxical situation in which they are required to have UX experience before they can gain UX experience. This article provides an assessment of one institution's efforts to overcome this experience gap by offering opportunities for students to participate in three types of authentic client-facing UX projects. Through surveys of students and clients served over four academic years, we provide a set of lessons learned and recommended best practices for incorporating project-based learning opportunities into UX courses.},

We argue, in contrast, that it is a resource for design that can be used to encourage close personal engagement with systems. We illustrate this with examples from contemporary arts and design practice, and distinguish three broad classes of ambiguity according to where uncertainty is located in the interpretative relationship linking person and artefact. Ambiguity of information finds its source in the artefact itself, ambiguity of context in the sociocultural discourses that are used to interpret it, and ambiguity of relationship in the interpretative and evaluative stance of the individual. For each of these categories, we describe tactics for emphasising ambiguity that may help designers and other practitioners understand and craft its use.},

Against the backdrop of a rapidly changing occupational landscape, it is crucial to understand how people participate in online communities focused on practices that have a volatile nature, as well as how social computing tools can best support them. In this article, we examine user experience (UX) design as a volatile practice that has no coherent body of knowledge and lacks a concrete path for newcomers to become a UX professional. Our study site is the “/r/userexperience” subreddit, an online UX community where practitioners socialize and learn. Using a mixed-methods approach, we identified five distinct social roles in relation to knowledge production and dissemination in the online community of volatile practice. We demonstrate that knowledge production is highly distributed, involving the participation and sensemaking of community members of varied levels of experience. We discuss how online platforms support online community of volatile practice and how our findings contribute to the CoP literature.},

In this paper, we conducted a content analysis of the subreddit “/r/assholedesign,” identifying how users on Reddit engage in conversation about ethical concerns. We identify what types of artifacts are shared, and the salient ethical concerns that community members link with “asshole” behaviors. Based on our analysis, we propose properties that describe “asshole designers,” both distinct and in relation to dark patterns, and point towards an anthropomorphization of ethics that foregrounds the inscription of designer’s values into designed outcomes. We conclude with opportunities for further engagement with ethical complexity in online and ofﬂine contexts, stimulating ethics-focused conversations among social media users and design practitioners.},

This has implications for university-level design education which has traditionally displayed clear distinctions between the full-time and part-time 4undergraduate sectors, particularly in their teaching and learning strategies. However, a number of pressures and trends are evident which suggest that these two sectors are moving closer together. One of the drivers in this phenomenon is the need for students to be exposed to realistic levels of design complexity. This paper examines complexity in design and draws some significant parallels between modern design practice in general and the production of a new undergraduate course at the Open University. Both are used to illuminate design complexity. The paper suggests that some of the tools, techniques and approaches of part-time, undergraduate, distance design education might usefully be exploited in more traditional, full-time course models.},

We then determined the authors of these tweets and analyzed the types of artifacts or links they shared.

To this end, we conducted a survey (𝑁 = 114) with UX practitioners at software organizations based in the U.S. to better understand their collaborative practices and tools used throughout the design process. We found that while an increase in collaborative activity enhanced many aspects of UX work, some long-standing challenges—such as handing off designs to developers—still persist. Moreover, we observed new challenges emerging from activities enabled by collaborative tools such as design system management. Based on our findings, we discuss how UX practices can improve collaboration moving forward and provide concrete design implications for collaborative UX tools.},

A 12-week longitudinal data collection, including surveys and interviews, documents this shift, with participants beginning internships and full-time positions in UX. Students and early professionals were asked to assess their level of competence and factors that influenced competence. A co-construction of identity between the designer and their environment is proposed, with a variety of factors relating to tool and representational knowledge, complexity, and corporate culture influencing perceptions of competence in UX over time. Opportunities for future research, particularly in building an understanding of competency in UX based on this preliminary framing of early UX practice are addressed.},

The aim is to identify and understand challenges of requirements elicitation in general and in distributed environments. We focus on human, social, and cultural factors that have an impact on communication in the requirements elicitation process. More specifically we aim to i) unfold potential cultural impediments that hamper the requirements elicitation process; ii) highlight cultural factors that should be taken into account in the requirements elicitation process in order to avoid incomplete and inconsistent requirements; and iii) make recommendations for alleviating the problems. In this paper our first step is to report on the findings of a review of the literature regarding culture in RE. The results suggest that the cultural studies in the field of RE are insufficient and thus more empirical studies are required. Secondly, we look at current solutions that are being adopted to assist in improving the cultural aspect of the requirements elicitation process. In the following step we map the identified communication gaps to the SPI Manifesto Values revealing the manifestations of the problems and finally we prescribe a set of recommendations that could be exercised and fulfilled by actors in the requirements elicitation process in order for them to improve cultural considerations in the RE process. These recommendations address the shortcomings that were identified in the literature review and mapped the Values of the SPI Manifesto. The proposals regard technologies, platforms, methods, and frameworks that are readily available. A requirements elicitation process that adopts one or a number of these proposals can help alleviate the challenges invoked by stakeholders’ cultural diversity in the RE process, thus leading to systems development and deployment that much better reflects the requirements/needs of diverse stakeholders and users.},

This research investigates how the timing of agent actions impacts team performance, as well as human workload and behavior. A human-in-the-loop experiment demonstrated that when the agent performs tasks faster than the human, the human tends to become reliant upon the automation and assumes a supervisory role. A human performance model predicts that extending agent execution time will decrease human reliance on the automation. However, in the environment under investigation, a tradeoff exists between team performance and human involvement.},

We also need to discover how successful geographically distributed agile development (GDAD) organizations deal with these challenges.

Research questions: 1. What are the challenges of communication between GDAD teams? 2. How can the impact of GDAD communication challenges be mitigated? Methodology: Data were collected by interviewing 12 members of a three-team organization using distributed agile development. These teams are distributed over three countries; the main team located in Australia, the developers’ team located in China, and the testers’ team located in India. A thematic analysis technique was used to identify communication challenges and practices used to mitigate the effect of these challenges. Results: Our ﬁndings reveal that the ﬁve challenges are still critical to GDAD. Moreover, we report a new critical challenge of communication in GDAD, the insufﬁcient documentation provided by distributed teams and members. In addition, we recommend several practices to mitigate the impact of these challenges. Conclusions: Communication among distributed agile development teams still faces several critical challenges, and the solutions to these challenges provided in recent years have not been sufﬁcient. This fact prompts the need for more research on how the impact of these challenges can be lessened.},

	abstract = {Objective: We investigated implicit communication strategies for anticipatory information sharing during team performance of tasks with varying degrees of complexity. We compared the strategies used by teams with the highest level of performance to those used by the lowestperforming teams to evaluate the frequency and methods of communications used as a function of task structure.
Background: High-performing teams share information by anticipating the needs of their teammates rather than explicitly requesting the exchange of information. As the complexity of a task increases to involve more interdependence among teammates, the impact of coordination on team performance also increases. This observation motivated us to conduct a study of anticipatory information sharing as a function of task complexity.
Method: We conducted an experiment in which 13 teams of four people performed collaborative search-anddeliver tasks with varying degrees of complexity in a simulation environment. We elaborated upon prior characterizations of communication as implicit versus explicit by dividing implicit communication into two subtypes: (a) deliberative/ goal information and (b) reactive status updates. We then characterized relationships between task structure, implicit communication, and team performance.
Results: We found that the five teams with the fastest task completion times and lowest idle times exhibited higher rates of deliberative communication versus reactive communication during high-complexity tasks compared with the five teams with the slowest completion times and longest idle times (p = .039).
Conclusion: Teams in which members proactively communicated information about their next goal to teammates exhibited improved team performance.},

The present meta-analysis addresses this inconsistency by examining the moderating influence of communication characteristics, as well as other salient team and task characteristics, on the relationship between team communication and performance. The findings revealed several fundamental insights. First, communication quality had a significantly stronger relationship with team performance than communication frequency. Second, further distinguishing between different communication types, classifying communication into the eight most commonly measured communication forms (e.g., knowledge sharing, information elaboration), has further value; information elaboration has the strongest relationship with performance while self-report frequency and objective frequency have the weakest relationships. Third, familiar and face-to-face teams exhibited a stronger relationship between communication and performance. These results indicate the necessity of distinguishing between different communication types in both practical and theoretical applications of team science.},

Current research argues that the reliance on the technology (versus face-to-face) for communication may inhibit geographically distributed team performance. In contrast, we argue that previous research associates negative performance effects with the level or degree of exclusive reliance on ICT without regard to the specific form or ways in which team members use ICT. We hypothesize that teams will be more successful when they use ICT to specifically facilitate the situational awareness needs created by their teams’ composition and task. We studied 54 geographically dispersed teams that all relied exclusively on ICT (with minimal to no face-to-face interactions) for coordination in order to control for the effect of the level of reliance on ICTs. Our multi-source/multimethod study demonstrates that the form of use can have a positive association with team performance even in teams relying exclusively on ICT depending on the team composition and nature of task being performed. Our findings suggest that, instead of assuming that technology reliance negatively impacts team performance, researchers studying distributed teams should separate the level of reliance (degree of use) from form of reliance (type of use) on ICT.},

Current research in customer satisfaction conceptualizes satisfaction as a stable, singular construct driven by expectations and relies predominately on quantitative assessments. We argue that conceptualizing customer satisfaction as the relation of meanings experienced by customers and incorporating qualitative forms of assessment contribute additional insights into customers’ lived experiences of customer/patient satisfaction. Specifically, based on observations of and interviews with patients at a medical facility, we argue that customers are simultaneously satisfied and dissatisfied and, moreover, the relation of satisfaction and dissatisfaction forms a system of meaning upon which they draw when making behavioral decisions. Finally, we articulate how taking a meaning-centered approach to customer satisfaction can enhance both theorists’ and managers’ ability to understand what it means to create satisfaction.},

They were also asked to suggest reasons for that use. In study 2, subjects from Norway, Poland, Germany, and the UK were asked to answer questions concerning the use of incomprehensible language in the academic community. Study 3 was similar to study 2, but in this case only highly comparable subjects from the USA and Poland were recruited. The three studies show that the use of difficult and incomprehensible language is perceived by the layperson as a serious sociolinguistic problem. They point to lawyers, politicians, computer specialists, academics and medical doctors as the heaviest users of such language. They also show that such language exerts much negative impact on the educational process and that the educational domain is a huge potential field for future research in this respect.},

Previous research has demonstrated that ease of production plays a role in speakers’ syntactic choices, but that ease of comprehension does not. However, such studies have not employed dialogues that involve role swapping on a turn-by-turn basis. In our experiment, participants alternated in giving and following instructions to move objects around on a grid. They tended to repeat the syntactic form just used by their interlocutor, reﬂecting sensitivity to ease of production. More interestingly, they were more likely to disambiguate their utterances when the visual context was potentially ambiguous than when it was not, reﬂecting sensitivity to ease of comprehension. We conclude that speakers pay attention to their beliefs about their addressees’ ease of comprehension, in addition to considering ease of production for themselves.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinarity is a key ingredient in amplifying the breadth of design explorations and the ability to merge different perspectives is essential for the future of design innovation. Several studies on collaborative work emphasise and support this point of view, however creative collaboration can trigger conflicts mainly due to interpretative differences between individuals with diverse disciplinary backgrounds. A common conception in design and interdisciplinary practice assumes that communications should be clear and effort should be made to reduce ambiguity in order to enhance creativity and efficiency. However, a number of case studies from interdisciplinary collaborations have indicated that the reverse may be true, that in fact miscommunications are a key ingredient of creativity and serendipitous exploitation of different meanings can engender new innovative solutions. Issues that arise in the course of interdisciplinary work can become a bridge or a barrier depending on team context and the ability to identify and investigate the nature of these issues can broaden the opportunity for translation. ‘I’ll take 9’ is a masters teaching module that was selected for analysis to test the identification of miscommunications and the maximising of creative potentials. The findings shed light on interdisciplinarity and question the assumption that clarity and the avoidance of ambiguity in communication is a desired practice. Missing miscommunications emerges as a powerful insight into design creativity across disciplines and signifies the opportunity of using diverse interdisciplinary teams to creatively explore cultural, material, disciplinary and cognitive differences to exploit the chaos in design systems.},

Architecture decisions are at times made under conditions of time pressure, high stakes, uncertainty, and with too little information. At other times, decision-makers have sufficient time to reflect on the decision and consider alternatives. Understanding context is critical to choosing appropriate approaches to architecture decision making. Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) explains how people make decisions under real-world conditions. This paper investigates NDM in software architecture and studies architecture decisions in their environment and decision-making context. The research approach includes a case study of large technology organizations consisting of a survey, multiple focus groups, and participant observation. Previous studies that touch on NDM in software architecture have mainly focused on decision-making processes or tools or developing decision models. This paper provides three contributions. First, we build on previous studies by other researchers to produce an in-depth exploration of NDM in the context of software architecture. We focus on Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) making as an implementation of NDM. Second, we present an examination of the decisions made by experienced architects under conditions that can be considered naturalistic. Third, we provide examples and recommendations that help software architects determine when an NDM approach is appropriate for their context.},

	abstract = {Is it true that if citizens understand hurricane probabilities, they will make more rational decisions for evacuation? Finding answers to such questions is not straightforward in the literature because the terms “judgment” and “decision making” are often used interchangeably. This terminology conflation leads to a lack of clarity on whether people make suboptimal decisions because of inaccurate judgments of information conveyed in visualizations or because they use alternative yet currently unknown heuristics. To decouple judgment from decision making, we review relevant concepts from the literature and present two preregistered experiments (N=601) to investigate if the task (judgment vs. decision making), the scenario (sports vs. humanitarian), and the visualization (quantile dotplots, density plots, probability bars) affect accuracy. While experiment 1 was inconclusive, we found evidence for a difference in experiment 2. Contrary to our expectations and previous research, which found decisions less accurate than their direct-equivalent judgments, our results pointed in the opposite direction. Our findings further revealed that decisions were less vulnerable to status-quo bias, suggesting decision makers may disfavor responses associated with inaction. We also found that both scenario and visualization types can influence people’s judgments and decisions. Although effect sizes are not large and results should be interpreted carefully, we conclude that judgments cannot be safely used as proxy tasks for decision making, and discuss implications for visualization research and beyond.

Unfortunately, human judgment and decision making are imperfect and often plagued by cognitive biases. There is limited empirical research documenting how these biases affect visual data analysis activities. Existing taxonomies are organized by cognitive theories that are hard to associate with visualization tasks. Based on a survey of the literature we propose a task-based taxonomy of 154 cognitive biases organized in 7 main categories. We hope the taxonomy will help visualization researchers relate their design to the corresponding possible biases, and lead to new research that detects and addresses biased judgment and decision making in data visualization.},

A systematic approach to analysing the inﬂuence of biases on decision making has been introduced. Twelve cognitive biases identiﬁed during the workshop were analysed with regard to the elements of the decision-making context that affected the aspects of architectural decision making.

The Army faces an operating environment characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity.2 Military professionals struggle to make sense of this paradoxical and chaotic setting. Succeeding in this environment requires an emergent style of decision making, where practitioners are willing to embrace improvisation and reflection.3 The theory of reflection-in-action requires practitioners to question the structure of assumptions within their professional military knowledge.4 For commanders and staff officers to willingly try new approaches and experiment on the spot in response to surprises, they must critically examine the heuristics or rules of thumb by which they make decisions and understand how they may lead to potential bias. The institutional nature of the military decision making process MDMP, our organizational culture, and our individual mental processes in how we make decisions shape these heuristics and their accompanying biases. The theory of reflection-in-action and its implications for decision making may sit uneasily with many military professionals. Our established doctrine for decision making is the MDMP. The process assumes objective rationality and is based on a linear, step-based model that generates a specific course of action and is useful for the examination of problems that exhibit stability and are underpinned by assumptions of technical-rationality. 5 The Army values MDMP as the sanctioned approach for solving problems and making decisions. This stolid template is comforting we are familiar with it. However, what do we do when our enemy does not conform to our assumptions embedded in the process We discovered early in Iraq that our opponents fought differently than we expected.},

Psychological research on cognitive heuristics and biases offers another relevant body of knowledge for application. Cognitive biases are inherent biases in human information processing, which can lead to suboptimal reasoning. Cognitive heuristics are unconscious rules utilized to enhance the efficiency of information processing and are possible antecedents of cognitive biases. This paper presents two studies that examined the role of confirmation bias, which is a tendency to seek and interpret evidence in order to confirm existing beliefs. The results of the first study, a protocol analysis involving novice designers engaged in a biomimetic design task, indicate that confirmation bias is present during concept generation and offer additional insights into the influence of confirmation bias in design. The results of the second study, a controlled experiment requiring participants to complete a concept evaluation task, suggest that decision matrices are effective tools to reduce confirmation bias during concept evaluation.},

In this work, we explore the ways in which the design of visualizations (vis) may be used to mitigate cognitive biases. We derive a design space comprised of 8 dimensions that can be manipulated to impact a user’s cognitive and analytic processes and describe them through an example hiring scenario. This design space can be used to guide and inform future vis systems that may integrate cognitive processes more closely.},

However, the physiological processes by which the human element achieves creative solutions have only recently received significant attention. Understanding the mechanisms that allow the brain to change in response to experience may have implications for creative thought processes. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is one such mechanism, and has already been implicated in learning and memory development. This paper presents a theoreticalphysiological explanation of creativity, implicating LTP as a modulator of neural networks. The proposed model is applied to explain existing creativity phenomena, including fixation, incubation, and obstacles in design-by-analogy. The model is then used to describe existing, and propose new methods for overcoming obstacles to creativity in design. The results of a study, which tested one application of the theory – the effect of physical activity on fixation, are also discussed.},

            We investigated the relationship between two kinds of problem solving using Kitchener's model of hierarchical cognitive processing. We predicted that performance on well‐defined problems (i. e. those with a single, guaranteed solution) would be independent of ill‐defined problems (i. e. those with multiple, non‐guaranteed solutions). We also predicted that self‐reported epistemic beliefs (i. e. assumptions about the nature and acquisition of knowledge) would be related to ill‐defined, but not well‐defined, solutions. Results confirmed these predictions. We concluded that well‐defined and ill‐defined problems require separate cognitive processes and that epistemic beliefs play an important role in ill‐defined problem solving. These findings supported Kitchener's three‐level model of problem solving.},

Psychologists have studied insight using behavioral methods for nearly a century. Recently, the tools of cognitive neuroscience have been applied to this phenomenon. A series of studies have used electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural correlates of the “Aha! moment” and its antecedents. Although the experience of insight is sudden and can seem disconnected from the immediately preceding thought, these studies show that insight is the culmination of a series of brain states and processes operating at different time scales. Elucidation of these precursors suggests interventional opportunities for the facilitation of insight.},

Previous studies have explored behaviors leading to subjectively experienced trust and/or liking, or trusting behaviors associated with group output, but have not linked behaviors, subjective affect, and output quality. Deriving principles from the social information processing theory of computer-mediated communication, this research identified and tested six communication rules for virtual groups. Employing a quasi-experimental procedure to maximize the variance in rule-following behavior, some distributed groups in a cross-university course were assigned to follow rules as part of their grades on group assignments conducted using computer-mediated communication from which messages were collected and later coded. Through self-reported measures of rule following and affect, results reveal correlations between each rule with trust and liking. Less consistent are the relationships between rule following, specific observed behaviors, and actual performance quality. Interpretations suggest that a powerful set of collaboration rules has been identified or that the mere following of any rules and norms reduces uncertainty and enhances trust in distributed work teams.},

We examine two related research questions: (1) What are the organizational implications of pursuing multiple performance goals? (2) Are local and myopic (as opposed to global) goal prioritization strategies effective in dealing with multiple goals? We employ a series of computational experiments to examine these questions. Our results from these experiments both formalize the intuition behind existing wisdom and provide new insights. We show that imposing a multitude of weakly correlated performance measures on even simple organizations (i.e., an organization comprised of independent employees) leads to a performance freeze in that actors are not able to identify choices that enhance organizational performance across the full array of goals. This problem increases as the degree of interdependence of organizational action increases. We also find that goal myopia, spatial differentiation of performance goals, and temporal differentiation of performance goals help rescue organizations from this status quo trap. In addition to highlighting a new class of organizational problems, we argue that in a world of boundedly rational actors, incomplete guides to action in the sense of providing only a subset of underlying goals prove more effective at directing and coordinating behavior than more complete representations of underlying objectives. Management, in the form of the articulation of a subset of goals, provides a degree of clarity and focus in a complex world.},

	abstract = {The integration of agile software development and user experience (UX) design has been a topic of investigation for practitioners and researchers for many years, and agile teams have become increasingly aware of the importance of UX design. Most studies have focused so far on the integration of UX theories and methods with agile practices. The objective of this research is to investigate whether and how UX information is embedded in the daily work of an agile team. We conducted an ethnographic study of an agile team based in the UK. We performed a qualitative analysis using different data sources and three complementary analytical lenses: Distributed Cognition of Teamwork, Garrett’s set of UX elements and planes, and Hassenzahl’s content-oriented model of UX. This combination provided an understanding of the different types of UX information available to the agile team through artefacts and face-to-face meetings, how the information flowed within and around the agile team, and the type of engagement they have with UX information. The findings reveal that: (1) agile team members were consumers of UX information not producers; (2) the most common type of UX information found in the system related to how the user interacts with the product rather than to user goals or needs; (3) information focusing on the user perspective appears in verbal communication rather than being captured in artefacts; and, (4) the flow of UX information around the team is complex. In combination, these factors indicate a potential breakdown in the communication of UX information. We argue that these findings have relevance for other agile teams because the artefacts and methods used by this team are commonly used by other agile teams. To improve the situation, we suggest a number of recommendations to engage agile team members in UX work, and reduce the complexity of UX information flow.},

They shared they do not view themselves as ML experts, nor do they think learning more about ML would make them better designers. Instead, our participants appeared to be the most successful when they engaged in ongoing collaboration with data scientists to help envision what to make and when they embraced a data-centric culture.

	abstract = {International dispersed (virtual) teams are becoming increasingly prevalent in complex international business environments, and their ability to handle internal communication is critical to their performance. Modern information and communication technology offer a variety of media to support team communication. Nonetheless, research is trailing behind practice and offers no established framework to explain media use in contemporary teams. Here, we seek to address this void. In a comparative study of domestic and international teams’ choice of media, we extend media-richness theory by focusing on the construct of complexity. Using structural equation modelling and multigroup analysis to assess a multinational sample of 285 project teams, we find partial support for mediarichness theory and demonstrate the specific relevance of this theory to the study of communication in international teams. Complexity affects international teams more strongly than domestic teams, prompting international teams to intensify their use of rich and semirich communication media to an extent not observed in domestic teams.},

	abstract = {Although Fogg’s ideas of persuasive technologies are widely accepted, few attempts have been made to test his ideas, particularly in a team context. In this article, we (1) theoretically extend Fogg’s ideas by identifying contexts in which virtual teams are more likely to use persuasive technologies; (2) empirically measure technology visualness, a factor that likely makes technologies more or less persuasive; and (3) assess the association between the use of persuasive technologies, judgment shifts, and forecast performance in a real-world virtual team context. We identify visual representation technologies (VRTs) as a class of technologies used by virtual teams to select, transform, and present data in a rich visual format. We propose that such technologies play a persuasive, as well as diagnostic, role in virtual team decisions. Over a three-year period, we examine the daily chat room discussions and decisions of a virtual team that makes smog forecasts with large economic and health consequences. We supplement regression models of field data with an experiment, interviews with team members, and analyses of imagery processing and group cohesion in team language use. Experiment results show that, relative to non-VRTs, the use of a VRT in a forecasting task increases imagery processing. Field data results show that team members increase their use of VRTs during chat room discussions when initial team consensus is low and the environment is more exacting. Greater use of VRTs in team discussions relates to greater shifts in the initial to final consensus forecasts of the team and greater odds of the team shifting its forecast policy to issue a smog alert. Increased use of VRTs is associated with lower forecast bias but is not significantly associated with forecast accuracy. VRT use is also associated with greater imagery processing and increased group cohesion, as shown through language use.},

This analysis leads to the claim that there are a set of invariant features in the problem spaces of design situations that collectively constitute a design problem space. Protocol studies are reported in which the problem spaces of three design tasks in architecture, mechanical engineering, and instructional design are explored and compared with several protocols from nondesign problem-solving tasks.},

	abstract = {The effective management and response to either volcanic eruptions or (often prolonged) periods of heightened unrest, is fundamentally dependent upon effective relationships and communication between science advisors, emergency managers and key decision makers. To optimise the effectiveness of the scientific contribution to effective prediction and management decision making, it is important for science advisors or scientific advisory bodies to be cognisant of the many different perspectives, needs and goals of the diverse organisations involved in the response. Challenges arise for scientists as they may need to be embedded members of the wider response multi-agency team, rather than independent contributors of essential information. Thus they must add to their competencies an understanding of the different roles, responsibilities, and needs of each member organisation, such that they can start to provide information implicitly rather than in response to explicit requests. To build this shared understanding, the team situational awareness (understanding of the situation in time and space), and the wider team mental model (a representation of the team functions and responsibilities), requires participating in a response environment together. Facilitating the availability of this capability has training and organizational development implications for scientific agencies and introduces a need for developing new inter-agency relationships and liaison mechanisms well before a volcanic crisis occurs. In this chapter, we review individual and team decision making, and the role of situational awareness and mental models in creating “shared meaning” between agencies. The aim is to improve communication and information sharing, as well as furthering the understanding of the impact that uncertainty has upon communication and ways to manage this. We then review personal and organisational factors that can impact response and conclude with a brief review of methods available to improve future response capability, and the importance of protocols and guidelines to assist this in a national or international context.},

	abstract = {Background: Teams are a basic way of organizing work in many professional and personal settings. However, misunderstandings among team members can lead to poor performance, hurt feelings, and lack of motivation to attack subsequent tasks. A common source of such misunderstandings is miscommunication caused by differences in how people interpret everyday words and phrases. Team members might interpret these differences as a natural occurrence of group work, if they notice them at all. Research questions: We seek to answer two research questions regarding miscommunication within teams: (1) Can a communication exercise create awareness among team members of the danger of miscommunication? (2) What beneﬁts do team members gain from the exercise? Situating the case: We describe a classroom exercise that relies on an integrative model for improving communication within teams. We also present evidence of the exercise’s effectiveness in raising awareness and fostering accommodation and social learning among team members. Our approach is similar to that used in other cases. How this case was studied: We used 13 teams from three classes during the course of a regular semester. A communication exercise we have used for many years was conducted as part of team formation activities early in the semester. Team discussions regarding exercise results formed the basis for team members to analyze their communication during the semester. About the case: A signiﬁcant variance of understanding among people as to the meaning of several of the focal terms can lead to suboptimal outcomes for any given work the team is tasked to achieve. In this case, we describe a study designed to improve communication among team members and, thus, lessen the likelihood of such a negative outcome. Results: Team members reported better awareness of communication issues and improved team functioning as a result of having completed the exercise. Conclusion: We ﬁnd that a shared understanding of terminology is an important part of training leaders and managers to help teams reduce common miscommunication problems in the workplace.},

We synthesize research from organisational, family, social, and personality psychology identifying factors that support successful conflict responses. Individual factors of cognitive flexibility, an appropriate balance of self– other focus, emotion regulation, and fit of the person to the conflict situation show promise for conflict success and appear to be trainable. Organisational interventions, including individual training, work group conflict training, and mediation, also demonstrate efficacy in building conflict skills. We conclude by proposing implications for conflict resolution interventions and critical directions for future research.},

Our qualitative study revealed that working from home creates unique challenges for remote workers because the work role becomes embedded in the family domain such that their home comes to be associated with the work role, work physically and psychologically intrudes upon their family, and habits and norms form that induce remote workers to be preoccupied with work when home. Based on the qualitative findings, a model was proposed and tested via a questionnaire. Findings from this study of remote workers demonstrated that work–family integration increases family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict, and that an inability to disengage from work increases work-to-family conflict. Furthermore, strong work–family integration was found to be particularly harmful to male remote workers’ work-to-family conflict whereas a strong inability to disengage from work was found to be particularly harmful to female remote workers’ work-to-family conflict. Our findings therefore revealed that working solely from home encourages remote workers to overwork and to allow their work to infringe on their family role.},

Subsequently, our user study delved into practitioners’ reactions and attitudes toward ChatGPT as a visualization assistant. Participants, who brought their visualizations and questions, received feedback from both Human experts and ChatGPT in a randomized order. They filled out experience surveys and shared deeper insights through post-interviews. The results highlight the unique advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT, such as its ability to quickly provide a wide range of design options based on a broad knowledge base, while also revealing its limitations in terms of depth and critical thinking capabilities.},

Public sector organisations have a key role in addressing these issues. It is widely acknowledged that tackling these problems requires new approaches and methods. Design, and in particular human-centred design, offers opportunities to develop these methods. In this paper I argue that a new type of human-centred innovation practice is necessary to adjust traditional user-centred design methods and tools to the public sector innovation context. This context involves different types of stakeholders with conflicting needs and aspirations, and requires a precise articulation of the value of human-centred design. I will propose a possible answer to these challenges through a case study relating to severe mental illness, in which we applied Dorst’s frame creation methodology, in combination with the NADI-model of Needs and Aspirations for Design and Innovation.},

Nevertheless, the majority of innovation in the realm of healthcare has been focused on products and services. Beyond being the major contributor to healthcare expenditure, these technology-driven innovations treat medical staff as the primary stakeholder and do little in the way of improving the quality of care for patients. This presents an opportunity to explore other forms of innovation in the context of healthcare. As a human-centred approach, design offers a method for holistically exploring problems, meeting stakeholder needs, and has been established as a means of driving innovation. This paper suggests that a design-led approach to innovation could increase quality of care and assist in creating value-driven services. To conclude, the paper contributes a framework, along with a set of examples, detailing four design objectives in the context of health and medicine.},

Now the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) features within graphic design software enables practitioners to automate many design processes. However, this threatens to deskill the profession and create a second tier of ‘non-professional’ designers, particularly within less creative work that emphasises fast turnover and functional artefact production. Research at the intersection of AI and graphic design has been led by computer scientists. This paper argues, from a designer’s perspective, that a paucity of scholarly engagement by graphic designers with their own practice and of AI research has resulted in computer scientists defaulting to functional approaches to design. Acknowledging that discursive and methodological differences between computer science and graphic design renders interdisciplinary collaboration problematic, this paper places the onus on design practitioners and researchers to engage with research into AI-supported graphic design.},

Design is perceived as a promising way to create more successful policies and public services. Out of many different approaches, design thinking (DT) has become significantly popular, as it promises to deal with wicked problems in a new way. Despite growing popularity, however, a critical reflection on benefits and challenges, as well as about different understandings of DT practices in public sector, are still lacking. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate different ways public organisations engage and introduce DT. In this paper we present 3 different municipalities in Denmark and the way design and DT is understood and implemented in organizational work practices. Our contribution to theory is twofold. First, our research responds to the recent call of different researchers to investigate how DT is operationalised and drawn upon in practice by different organizations in the public sector. Second, our research contributes to the design field, by showing barriers of implementations, different benefits and challenges connected with design in organisations with no prior experience in design.},

	abstract = {Is there a difference between design practice and design research practice? Building on recent discussions within design research about whether the design practice which occurs within design research is distinct and separate from the design practice which occurs within the design profession, this paper presents a case where constructive design practice was employed within a research project, using this example to study the nature of the design process in research. Through a thorough analysis of the designs generated, the motivations behind their development, their use as research tools, and the knowledge they generated, we identified three ways in which the design process was altered when it was imported into the research. First, the degree of development of the designs shifted from fully functional to functional enough. Second, the designs were developed in order to ask questions rather than trying to solve a problem. And finally, the failure of the design was equally able to contribute to generating knowledge as its success. We argue that these shifts in values clearly distinguish design research practice from professional design practice, but come with very real consequences that challenge the core measures we use to assess design.},

	abstract = {It is generally agreed that the concept of inspiration is one of the most basic and persistent of Greek notions about poetry. Yet there appears to be a certain confusion on the significance of this observation. For instance, while most scholars consider that the idea is of very great antiquity in Greece, there is a recent tendency to regard the concept as a formulation of the fifth century B.C. E. A. Havelock, for example, describes the notion of poetic inspiration as an invention of fifth century philosophers, and G. S. Kirk states, without discussion, that poetic inspiration was ‘probably quite a new conception’ at the time Euripides was writing. This type of disagreement clearly relates to the more fundamental question of the meaning of the concept of inspiration itself. For although there is an apparent consensus that ancient notions of poetic inspiration correspond in some way to certain modern ideas about the nature of poetic creativity, little attention has been paid to these modern notions of inspiration. And unless such modern notions are investigated, the mere observation that there is a similarity is of little value.},

Illusions are essential for maintaining occupational reputation, but in the process they create a set of moral dilemmas. So it is with ethnographic work. This article describes the underside of ethnographic work: compromises that one frequently makes with idealized ethical standards. It argues that images of ethnographers?personal and public?are based on partial truths or self-deceptions. The focus is on three clusters of dilemmas: the classical virtues (the kindly ethnographer, the friendly ethnographer, and the honest ethnographer), technical skills (the precise ethnographer, the observant ethnographer, and the unobtrusive ethnographer), and the ethnographic self (the candid ethnographer, the chaste ethnographer, the fair ethnographer, and the literary ethnographer). Changes in ethnographic styles and traditions alter the balance of these deceptions but do not eliminate the need for methodological illusions.},

	abstract = {When COVID-19 health guidelines vastly restricted or shut down in-person ethnographic research in 2020, many researchers pivoted to forms of online qualitative research using platforms such as WeChat, Twitter, and Discord. This growing body of qualitative internet research in sociology is often encapsulated under the umbrella term “digital ethnography.” But the question of what makes digital qualitative research ethnographic remains open. In this article, we posit that digital ethnographic research necessitates a negotiation of the ethnographer's self-presentation and co-presence within the field that other forms of qualitative research, such as content or discourse analysis, do not require to satisfy their epistemological stance. To make our case, we provide a brief overview of digital research in sociology and related disciplines. Then, we draw upon our experiences conducting ethnographies in digital communities and in-person communities (what we call here, “analog ethnography”) to explore how decisions about self-presentation and co-presence facilitate or block the generation of meaningful ethnographic data. We think through pertinent questions such as: Does the lower barrier for anonymity online justify disguised research? Does anonymity generate thicker data? How should digital ethnographers participate in research environments? What are the possible repercussions of digital participation? We argue that digital and analog ethnographies share a common epistemology that is distinct from non-participatory forms of qualitative digital research—namely the need for the researcher to relationally gather data from the field site over an extended period of time.},

Abstract One of the main characteristics of the Strategic Design concept adopted in this research is the use of a design method that proposes a stage called metadesign – a space for discussion of the design problem. At this stage, a special type of tool is used, called Blue Sky research. It is essentially composed by visual references, that are external to the design context, and reveals trends and offers useful stimuli in the project. The purpose of this investigation is to reflect about the role of images not directly related to the design problems -indirect references -as inspiration sources for the creative design process. To do so, several aspects are reviewed, such as the "wicked problems" and it's solution process; creative process; and usage of images as reference. A exploratory research is proposed, to evaluate how these specific images are used during the project process. Evidence is presented, showing that indirect references help the formulation of conceptual ideas, by increasing the reflection time of the individuals about the problem and about the solution. Introduction Design projects deals with unique and specific situations and intend to resolve them in accordance with the criteria and requirements of the design problem. The design problem corresponds to what the designer must solve and this process is characterized by being open and ill-structured (Simon: 1973; Cross: 1984; Dorst: 2004, 2006). In open, ill-structured problems decision-making involves the choice of design paths that do not necessarily exist in the beginning. To aid this structuring process, which is in itself a creative process, several design methodologies were developed – which are used according to the nature of the problem (graphics, mechanics, usability, etc.), and according to the personal preferences of the designer. During the past five decades, a lot has been discussed about methodologies for solving problems and several tools were developed to assist the designer in it. According to Fischer (et al., 2010), "the complexity of the processes involved, the non-linearity of the creation path and its open nature makes any model that aims to represent such a process inaccurate". Nevertheless, there are several design methodologies that address various tools to assist professionals in solving design problems (Munari: 2000; Baxter: 2000). These tools and instruments can be defined as "thought facilitators" (Fischer et al.: 2010). 3 2},

	abstract = {The creation of new products and services is an everyday activity for many industries, often assisted by professional design studios. It is evident that extensive knowledge is required by designers during the conceptual product design process, matching the complexity of design problems. Techniques based on association, analogy and metaphors are often used to facilitate the process of creative thinking and inspiration leading to new product designs. This paper presents a novel semantic tool, which has been developed to seamlessly assist product designers with knowledge management tasks during information discovery and support the formulation of new product concepts. The technology can be used in combination with a sketching application to support the generation of relevant visual content, helping to stimulate associative thinking, and thus assist creativity at the initial stage of the product design process.},

Therefore, a new approach is needed which would help the students to come up with a good design concept.

The behaviors and rhythm of textile designers were mapped using participant observation with multiple methods including field observation, capturing visual records using video equipment and photography, note taking, auditory records using mp3 recorders, and conducting informal dialogue during studio sessions. The results provide detailed interpretive information in the form of themes focused on understanding how they used and transformed inspirational sources towards the completion of their projects and how designers use their personal thesauruses through their sociocultural capital as influences. No two designers used and transformed inspirational sources in exactly the same way, yet each designer exhibited multiple methods of transformation by including an element of inspiration in their design process. Four separate themes emerged when we looked at how the designers used their personal thesauruses as influences. These themes were: (a) connections made to their sociocultural capital and through research, (b) narratives found or told to focus their projects, (c) emotions related to their attachments and reactions, and (d) design elements they referenced that aided in their decision making. Our rich descriptions of when and how often influence and inspirational sources play into the creative and problem-solving processes are a step toward a better understanding of creativity as a dynamic, complex, and diverse endeavor.},

	abstract = {Designers typically explore and experience several inspiration sources from which they generate unconventional ideas and compositions. Tangible cultural heritage, as one inspiration source that represents a designer’s identity, is concerned with the appearances and connotations of objects. Arab culture inherited many diverse design elements, one of which is Arabic calligraphy. This art form has been developed across generations, distinguished by its flexibility, script variety, and geometric forms. Few researchers have examined calligraphy as an inspiration source for three-dimensional design elements. The researchers of the present study argue that a merger between the aesthetics and geometry of Arabic calligraphy, with respect to its rigorous mathematical drawing rules, can inspire new geometric design forms. This article presents essential information on Arabic calligraphy, explains its scripts, and explores its applications in art and design, based on a comprehensive literature review. The objective is to examine the capabilities of two-dimensional Arabic calligraphy in generating contemporary and functional three-dimensional design forms, which includes identifying the design concept and constraints, determining the most suitable script for achieving new forms, and investigating the design procedures. The results obtained from the experiments show the inspirational processes and procedures behind contemporary furniture design.},

They may seek inspiration from a variety of sources not only to generate ideas to realise intentions, but also to analyse and communicate intentions. However, there is little or no knowledge about which inspiration sources (e.g. similar products, dissimilar products, etc.) and inspiration media (e.g. images, text, etc.) they use in their activities associated with intentions.

	title = {{CREATING} {INSPIRATION} {IN} {DESIGN} {EDUCATION}},
	abstract = {In design education the topic ‘sources of inspiration’ is strongly related to the search for inspiration in the context of a specific design assignment. Yet developing oneself as a designer also asks for a search for inspiration on a more personal level: to be inspired to be a designer, to develop oneself as a creative person. Design education should acknowledge the importance of this search for personal inspiration, and stimulate, facilitate and reward this process. To do so, we need insights in this process; we need to understand what being inspired actually means, and what tools and techniques we could develop to support the development of it. This article explores the concept of personal inspiration, by unravelling the concept in different themes. These insights will serve as starting points for the development of tools and techniques to create inspiration in design education.},

	doi = {10.22034/bagh.2019.81658},
	abstract = {Particular attention to the relationship between architecture and nature, especially in the past three decades, has flourished a very distinctive accomplishments, and yet more useful than the past, in terms of the emergence of new architectural approaches as well as the coordination of new technologies, such as nanotechnology. Structure, as one of the essential components of architecture, is of particular importance. Different and sometimes contradictory approaches to designing structure and architecture, “with” each other or “on” each other, may create different qualities and affect the value of architecture and structure. Relying on the fact that the dialogue between the architect and the designer of the structure is one of the necessities of creating an architectural work, this paper puts a substantial emphasis on the learning of structural sciences by the architects and their mastery in the recognition of structural principles. Furthermore, with a critical look at the adherence of architecture to structure and the key role of naturalism the paper seeks out the origins of this problem in the method of structure training for architects. The pathology of failure to realize the use of nature strategies for the harmony of architecture and structure in the current architecture of Iran is the main research question in this study. This research has been based on three pillars of analysis, assessment and evaluation. In the first step, using a causal-comparative research methodology, the challenges of naturalism in architectural techniques after the industrial revolution are addressed and the position of structure in the naturalistic approach of these styles is evaluated. In the second step, applying interpretive-historical research method, the critics of architecture under discussion are addressed and the achievements of nature in architecture and in particular structure in academic arena are then pointed out. The survey and analysis with the help of SPSS software is the last instrument used for assessment and evaluation in this research. It should be noted that in this survey, the structural and experimental knowledge of the architect in forms, structures and natural structures were considered as the independent variables, whereas the design skills of architect in the harmony of architecture and structure using more naturalist strategies were considered as the dependent variable.Comparison of previous research with the survey indicates that the failure of Iran’s current architecture for the harmony with structure and better exploitation of nature is due to the incorrect reception of the Iranian public architecture in this area, which is often formed in the area of education. Finally, this research accentuates on the purposeful change in teaching method of technical courses to improve the understanding of the behavior and structures by architects. Suggestions to improve such an important phenomenon in professional workspace are also presented.},

	abstract = {This publication seeks to explore and design a model truck with a concept idea development that will serve as a desk organizer. The automobile selected is a semi-truck that has a sleeper. The sleeper is what serves as a resting place for drivers during long journeys. This truck is best suited for the concept because of the sleeper to convey all necessary compartments to accommodate office supplies. Observation of most desk organizers found on the desk of some general offices are containers that have simple shapes like cylinders, boxes where items are placed. These organizers do not add any aesthetic appeal to the office since it's very simple and the items placed in them are not singled out thereby making accessing them inconvenient. There is also no distinct design that will make them stand out and also welcome the visitor. This research explores various design ideas of combining the truck concept into a desk organizer. The descriptive research and studio-based methods based on the qualitative research approach were employed. The researchers rather employed the use of an inanimate object being Avocado or Pear fruit as the design inspiration that guided all design experiments. The Latin word for Pear is 'Pirum', which means to 'bear fruit'. Every nation's income is partly dependent on the money generated from the movement of goods and services. Therefore, for a nation to bear fruit economically, the import and export of goods and services must be very effective. Trucks are very instrumental in conveying these goods and services across the country. The design is meant to serve as a wheel of academia where all necessary items needed at offices are well organized and conveyed for knowledge acquisition. To explore and produce further unique objects of product design that can serve a completely different purpose aside its original purpose or its aesthetic appearance and value was recommended. It was also recommended that there should be a form of collaboration with other departments to produce interesting results. There should be a collaboration between the Metal Product Design Section and the Engineering Section to produce works of art where the engineers introduce their technological concepts into the design ideas and concepts of the Metal Product Designer.},

	abstract = {The advertisers would seek to create unique, unexpected, and dreamlike images for use in promotions because advertisers often try to gain consumers' attention, to fuel their fantasies and to induce them to view a product in a new light. As a result, surrealistic ads have been used to promote a variety of products. One of the artists who have the most influence on advertisers and publicity is René Magritte. Parodying the works of famed artist like René Magritte not only catches the consumer’s attention but also, it shows the advertisement from a novel perspective. Advertisers involved in designing persuasive communications have long been interested in creative ways of capturing audience attention and the use of incongruity is one effective way to do so. The surrealist advertisement is constructing the association between the images of the “unrealistic” artwork and the unbelievably good performance of the products or services as the works of surrealist painters are usually considered as a symbol of “unrealistic, absurd, surreal” concepts. In 1986 an article was published in the Journal of Advertising that sought to determine how and why Surrealism was effective in advertisements, this article stated that "social adaptation theory predicts that employing surrealistic techniques in advertising design should draw attention because the information will be perceived as unexpected, novel and out-of-context". The main objective of this paper is to describe the influence of René Magritte’s artworks techniques as on modern advertising design, through analyzing some modern advertising designs that got inspired by René Magritte’s techniques. Also, this paper shows and analyzes the advertising designs of the well-known surrealist artist René Magritte. The importance of this paper is to explore René Magritte’s approach in advertising designs and to discuss the key influences and motives that were the foundation for René Magritte’s surrealist conception in ads designs. Also, to explore why René Magritte’s artworks techniques are a great inspiration for modern advertising designs. The problem of this paper can be formulated as the following: How does Surrealism art conception affect in a modern advertising design?, What was René Magritte’s approach in advertising designs?, What is the dissociation of image and text in René Magritte artworks?, What are the influences of René Magritte’s artworks techniques as on modern advertising design?, How do René Magritte artwork techniques inspire modern advertising designers?. The hypotheses of the paper: Firstly, as an effective way to highlight the product’s strength and strongly catch the audiences' attention to the advertising, designers use the concepts and techniques of surrealism such as surprise, unexpected juxtapositions, and non sequitur. Secondly, the modern advertising can explore new heights by parodying the artworks of surrealist famous artists such as René Magritte. Finally, the dissociation technique between image and text in René Magritte paintings is effective for advertising design, where incongruity is often used as a creative strategy. This paper follows the descriptive method to describe René Magritte’s surrealist approach in advertising designs throughout the study of his artwork techniques and surrealist conceptions. This paper also uses the analytical method to analyze René Magritte’s advertising designs, also to analyze chosen examples modern advertisings designs that use René Magritte techniques as an inspiration.},

	abstract = {Nature provides us with abundant examples of how large numbers of individuals can make decisions without the coordination of a central authority. Social insects, birds, ﬁshes, and many other living collectives, rely on simple interaction mechanisms to do so. They individually gather information from the environment; small bits of a much larger picture that are then shared locally among the members of the collective and processed together to output a commonly agreed choice. Throughout evolution, Nature found solutions to collective decision-making problems that are intriguing to engineers for their robustness to malfunctioning or lost individuals, their ﬂexibility in face of dynamic environments, and their ability to scale with large numbers of members. In the last decades, whereas biologists amassed large amounts of experimental evidence, engineers took inspiration from these and other examples to design distributed algorithms that, while maintaining the same properties of their natural counterparts, come with guarantees on their performance in the form of predictive mathematical models. In this paper, we review the fundamental processes that lead to a collective decision. We discuss examples of collective decisions in biological systems and show how similar processes can be engineered to design artiﬁcial ones. During this journey, we review a framework to design distributed decision-making algorithms that are modular, can be instantiated and extended in diﬀerent ways, and are supported by a suit of predictive mathematical models.},

We present a methodology based on the principle of virtual work for synthesizing the cam shape in the joint. Key innovations of our design are a) human-like joint stiffness proﬁle, b) large joint range of motion, and c) modular arrangement for varying torque range. We have built a prototype for validating our approach and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed joint mechanism fulﬁlls the design goals of our study.},

	abstract = {Legal financial obligations serve a range of practical and ideological functions within the modern American criminal justice system. Criminal fines are punitive in nature and intended to reflect the severity of the offense as well as having a deterrent component. When assessed in conjunction with other financial penalties, including fees and restitution, the collective economic burden of these sanctions can be significant. An increasingly robust body of literature highlights the unequal impact and collateral harms of these punishments, especially those for people who fall into different socioeconomic groupings. There is a danger that the well-deserved opprobrium directed at fees and the cumulative effect of legal financial obligations will mask some benefits of properly targeted and calibrated fines. Here, we explore an opportunity for reform in the United States inspired by two Nordic sentencing policy models for fines. First, we look to Norwegian penal policy to consider expanding the use of fines as the primary sanction for a wider range of criminal offenses, especially in lieu of short terms of incarceration. We temper the impact of this change, especially for indigent defendants, by considering the implementation of a means-adjusted “day fine” system which are prevalent in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland, and other individualized adjustments as in Norway. Taken together, these policies could reduce the American over-reliance on incarceration while modifying punitive fiscal sanctions in a manner that meets the purposes of punishment and seeks to minimize the unintended harms of financial punishment.},

Among all the traditional paintings, Madhubani painting as its name itself indicates forest honey, it has its own place for its replication of flora and fauna. In order to revive the tradition in the minds of youngsters an attempt was made by selecting the common motifs like birds, fish, sun and borders from Madhubani style which were then developed into designs by arranging in proper fashion.

Around the globe, scientiﬁc and engineering research efforts in Bio-inspiration have made astonishing discoveries that have impacted future possibilities in the ﬁelds of robotics, biomedical technology and material science, amongst many other examples. Yet, despite rising evidence about Biology’s relevance to innovative design, examples demonstrating speciﬁcs about how it can be applied in the near term in consumer product design are limited. This paper presents a case study wherein Bio-inspired design was used successfully as a tool to help develop novel, viable and product concepts for a packaged-goods industry client. Speciﬁcally, emphasis will be placed on how the method of ‘biologizing the problem’ contributed to redeﬁning the parameters of the challenge, which ultimately drove the project’s success. After receiving a focused brief for reinventing the generally unpleasant experience of bathroom shower cleaning, the ﬁrst round of creative ideation yielded incremental solutions based on the goal of ‘mildew removal and extermination.’ During the second round of creative ideation, after the problem had been redeﬁned in terms of biological strategies, an entirely different set of solutions resulted from a revised goal of ‘mildew prevention.’ Such examples of problem redeﬁnition can be propelled by a growing number of free databases like Asknature.org, which enable designers to ﬁnd useful analogies between their design goals and Biological strategies. As these databases mature, product design efforts will be able to augment their creative output with improved results.},

The present paper was conducted to model the natural structure of load transfer in order to design the structure of a pedestrian bridge with a span of 100 meters. This bridge is located in a mountain park in the tourist area of Kashan, 230 km south of Tehran. For this purpose, by examining the patterns in the nature, which provides a relevant answer to the problem, the spine of animals was identified as the bearing skeleton of the body, the best option for patterning. Inspired by it, a stable structure was designed as a skeleton of a bridge without a middle pillar. Based on a form inspired by the spine of a four-legged animal, the bridge structure was designed. To control the stability of the bridge structure against the loads, the initial design idea was analysed employing the Karamba plugin in Grasshopper software to identify its weaknesses and the final design was obtained. The final design was analysed with SAP2000 structural finite element software to ensure the stability and control of permissible deformations. Additionally, attention to the modular structure of the spine was the source of inspiration for the design of prefabricated elements of the bridge parts, which in addition to reducing the cost of execution, increases the speed of construction of the project. The final design of the pedestrian bridge, which acts similar to a suspension bridge in terms of load transfer and was inspired by the structure of a four-legged vertebrate, is a combination of truss and tensegrity structure and in addition to visual aesthetic, has optimal structural performance.},

	abstract = {In this article, I explore a single case of vernacular clothing design — the practice and learning of design for contemporary Iñupiaq-Inuit clothing made by women from Kaktovik in Northern Alaska —and I hope to contribute to a better understanding of design practice and learning in general. Design research has many unexplored areas, and one of these omissions is vernacular design, or folk design. In my opinion, professional and academic design may well have something to learn from vernacular design, although this research is about vernacular learning and about what, why and how the ‘making’ discipline of clothing design is learned. This study was based on observations of and interviews with seamstresses and research-by-design, which includes authorial participation in designing and sewing in adherence to Iñupiaq tradition. All of this was recorded on digital video film. The investigation of Iñupiaq-Inuit clothing design indicates that watching was the most common way of learning, a phenomenon I have chosen to call learning-by-watching, a concept that can be seen as a development of both Schön and Wenger’s theories of learning, as influenced by John Dewey’s theory of learning-by-doing. This study will be discussed in connection with design education, from kindergarten to professional studies in higher education, in the forthcoming research project, Design Literacy, the purpose of which is to develop theory to improve design education in both compulsory and academic design education. Consequently, to improve design education in general, a thorough focus on learning-by-watching in communities of practice would make for more reflective practitioners and more sustainable design practices in the long run.},

	abstract = {In physical environments such as aerospace and process control, many system components and their associated information are interrelated (e.g., an increase in a chamber temperature results in an increase in its pressure). Displaying interrelationships between individual parameters and also among sets of parameters reveals meaningful information and can help yield understanding about the ?big picture,? which operators in complex systems commonly strive for. In this paper, we propose a framework for information organization, discuss a method for computation of such interrelations, and suggest a display organization approach to ?house? them. The computation is done using data mining tools and the display organization approach is based on concepts from Islamic medieval architecture. We illustrate these ideas using a helicopter engine display and briefly discuss some of the implications for a holistic display of multiple components and subsystems.},

	abstract = {Nature serves as a compass for all the sciences. Nature was and continues to be the first teacher for humanity. A certain area of study advances through observing and copying nature. This area of research, known as biomimicry, can be characterized as the imitation of organic biological processes. Just like scientists and designers, architects can find inspiration in nature. Like many other professions, the realm of architectural design holds that behavior resembles nature. For instance, it is used as a source of inspiration for architectural designs, building materials, and aesthetic and environmental systems. To draw conclusions and develop solutions from nature to all fields of science and architecture, there are not enough investigations. A new field of study known as "Biomimicry" has emerged, and it is an innovation strategy that seeks sustainable solutions by modeling nature's time-tested patterns. In this context, the research paper discusses biomimicry, a recent development in the field of architecture, the idea of nature as inspiration; the concept of biomimicry, its levels, its application to architecture, and how to think about design and nature in the context of architectural sustainability.},

A survey (n = 821) was administered from seven universities across different regions of Taiwan. The results of this study supported that imaginative capabilities consisted of ten characteristics namely: concentration, crystallization, dialectics, effectiveness, exploration, intuition, novelty, productivity, sensibility, and transformation. The psychological influences were comprised of six indicators namely: generative cognition, intrinsic motivation, positive emotion, negative emotion, inspiration through action, and self-efficacy. The environmental influences were composed of five indicators namely: physical component, learning resources, organizational measure, social climate, and human aggregate. The hypothesis of the study that inspiration through action plays a mediator in imagination development was partially supported. The structural model also showed that the variables of human aggregate, generative cognition, intrinsic motivation, negative emotion and self-efficacy have significant and indirect effects on imagination. Reflections on talent development of web design were proposed, future inquiries were discussed, and limitations of the study were acknowledged.},

Most University students make use of technology to find and develop their ideas especially in creative industries where the OIM (Observe, Imitate, Modify) practice can be done through the Internet by observing from another researcher's observation. While biomimicry offers researchers to observe nature and create technology innovation inspired by nature. Students need to experience and learn from nature and use technology wisely. This study examines the biomimicryinspired works of Product Design undergraduate program students of Podomoro University Jakarta. The methodology research that we use in this study is a qualitative participatory method with comparative and correlational studies. The content of this study is to learn and evaluate the process and result of student's biomimicry observation into innovative product design. The conclusion can also be drawn that comparing the different levels of students which is the first year, second year, and third-year students by using the biomimicry observation approach will show variated concepts and skills on their work depending on what knowledge that they have learned from each semester.},

In this paper, we describe the outcomes of introducing a human-centered design tool, the Inspiration Design Toolkit (IDT), to encourage students to think nonlinearly. The IDT is an educational resource consisting of a deck of illustrated cards that contain provocative questions, reflection messages and icons, applicative examples, and key takeaways on microlearning units. The aim of the IDT is to improve the participants’ learning experience and course engagement, increase opportunities for them to interact with their peers and teaching team, enable them to practice and reinforce the concepts through the creation of their own IDT cards, and share the cards in the discussion to increase learners’ engagement with course material and peers. We designed the IDT for an MIT online course on System Thinking. We collected, analyzed, and synthesized qualitative and quantitative feedback from 171 course participants. Our findings suggest that IDT provides learners with a digital asset that allows them to reinforce and recall the course takeaways, and apply them to other contexts. For future research, we want to understand how learners like and use IDT through demographic differences and preferred selfidentified learning styles. We discuss how these findings may help educators consider critical design principles and for creating a digital self-learning toolkit connected to the course content and increasing its content adaptability.},

Discovery of a historical patent for a coat made from a single pattern piece led to an examination of United States coat and jacket patents to identify past patternmaking explorations that could inform current design practice, with a focus on those with one pattern piece. These patterns allowed large expanses of cloth for surface design, especially for creation of engineered digital prints on a single canvas, and opened up avenues for creative experimentation. The research objectives were to analyze the patterns for shape and accuracy of fit, to evaluate them as a beginning point to inform future patternmaking and design approaches, to engineer digital prints for prototypes, and to create aesthetically appealing designs that could be produced with minimal fabric waste. Digital copies of the patterns were created, tested and compared, with a focus on evaluation of critical fit points and the potential for further creative development. Prototype designs were generated from the patent patterns, with some faithful to the original patent and others moving away from the patentee?s intentions, although keeping the pattern shape. Digital prints were then created and engineered for the patterns. This investigation also reoriented traditional apparel design practice by placing pattern manipulation at the beginning of the design process, and made design development contingent upon research objectives. At the same time it confirmed that research through design is not linear, and that studio practice also informed the objectives.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information technologies, the generative design has started to rethink the future roles of industrial designers. The simulation integrated into generative design helps designers to create manufacturable products. Therefore, this study examines how generative design can progress with conventional production processes and how this progress can help designers in the future. The potential of generatively obtained form-seeking processes to create optimal results is discussed within the scope of this study. For this purpose, a generative design triggered design process was conducted with a firm in the real sector about re-designing a bicycle frame. Generative design outputs have been optimized in terms of manufacturability. The effects of generative design-based inputs on the final product have been discussed through material usage and the sustainability. Based on the outcomes of the study, suggestions have been developed on how generative design can be transformed into results that can be a source of innovation.},

	abstract = {For this study of the design and development of fabric patterns for casual wear inspired by the decorative arts at WatPhraDhatPhasornkaew, the researcher has studied beautiful patterns, color schemes, techniques and decorative materials at the temple which are in a modern art style with a Ratanakosin Era uniqueness that is aesthetically and physically valuable. The objectives of this research were; 1) to study the patterns of design and color in the decorative arts of WatPhraDhatPhasornkaew, Phetchabun, to apply in the design and development of new patterns, and 2) study the different types of Thai fabric and production techniques that are appropriate for the designs. This qualitative research covered the study of documents and information relating to the topic; a field trip to collect information about the decorative techniques at WatPhraDhatPhasornkaew; site visits to fabric producers to check whether the newly developed patterns and types of fabric matched, and interviews with not fewer than 30 target users including working males and females in the private and government sectors in the Bangkok area. The objective was to find a direction in designing and developing fabric patterns to suit the target users and daily usage. The research found that the decorative techniques at WatPhraDhatPhasornkaew had a variety of details including color schemes, patterns and material mixes created by colored tiles, Bencharong ware, pearl, beads, glass, jewelry, valuable items and colorful ceramic ware which created beautiful patterns. Moreover, dharma teachings and stories about the way of the world were narrated through the works of fine arts and sculpture as created by the artists’ ideas. The researcher took inspiration from the designs, textures and color schemes of this decoration in designing and developing contemporary fabric patterns with printing techniques on woven fabric made from natural fibers that were easy to care for and suitable as casual wear for daily usage. Since WatPhraDhatPhasornkaew was one central form of religious architecture at the heart of Thai Buddhism, this research will greatly help preserve and develop these Ratanakosin Era works of art and culture to pass on to future generations.},

Several strategies for designing with emotions have been explored from designing for meaning, to designing for pleasure or for rich experiences. While there has been a great focus on tangible products in emotional design, our increasingly digital lives make engaging users in these contexts essential. Rich emotional experiences are relevant for digital contexts because they help create more immersive and realistic experiences. Design that considers emotions is a design that becomes more relevant, and this relevance is fundamental for better human-product/human-computer relationships that result in longer-lasting designs with which people want to engage. In this paper, we define emotion and offer a panorama on the work that has been developed in the design field surrounding this concept.},

	abstract = {The metaphor of ‘foraging as search’ provides a rich source of inspiration for the design of optimisation algorithms. An extensive literature has resulted in computer science over the past twenty years based on this, with algorithmic families such as ant colony optimisation and honeybee optimisation amongst others, being successfully applied to a wide range of real-world problems. Of course, all organisms must forage to acquire necessary resources and in recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the mechanisms by which nonneuronal organisms, in other words organisms without a central nervous system, forage. The vast majority of living organisms, encompassing some 99.5\% of all biomass on earth, are nonneuronal. In this paper we introduce the plasmodial slime mould Physarum polycephalum. This nonneuronal organism is formed when individual amoebae swarm together and fuse, resulting in a large bag of cytoplasm encased within a thin membrane which acts a single organism. Inspiration has been drawn from some of its foraging behaviours to develop algorithms for graph optimisation and exemplars of these algorithms along with some suggestions for future research are presented in this paper.},

It follows research through design, embodying the body of knowledge in the inspiration network as a design artifact. Inspiration networks offer a novel way to discover game genres that have not yet been formally recognised, but have displayed a large influence. The findings offer three design implications: an understanding gained by “thinking with networks”, the ability to identify emerging game genres, and the support for intuitive, visual browsing of ideas.

However promising, such methods are not scalable as the time investment is shifted to an up-front investment. Furthermore, most proposed methods require the engineer to adopt a new design process. The current study presents FISh, a scalable search method based on the standard engineering design process. By leveraging machine translation between a representative corpus of biological and engineering texts, the engineer can start the search using engineering terminology, which, behind the scenes, is automatically converted to a biological query. This conversion is done using language models trained on patents and biological publications for the engineering and biology domains. Both models are aligned using the most used English words. The biological query is used to retrieve biological documents that describe the most relevant functionality for the engineering query. The presented method allows searching for bio-inspiration using a free-text query. Furthermore, updating the underlying datasets, models and organism aspects is automated, allowing the system to stay up to date without requiring interactive effort. Finally, the search functionality is validated by comparing the search results for the functionality of existing bioinspired designs with their inspiring organisms.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the results of research ongoing at Cranfield University to establish useful tools for designers to aid them in the process of sustainable design. Research completed as long ago as 1999 at Cranfield University [1] identified that to be successful, sustainable design should be considered at the earliest stages of PDP, where the design brief is most flexible. Despite this, research has shown that many companies do not have the appropriate mechanisms to integrate sustainable design early in the product development process and that there is a lack of appropriate tools. Many tools are available under the general heading of sustainable design but recent analysis [2] of these tools shows that the majority either focus on setting the strategic direction or are reflective tools such as life cycle analysis. Both of these types of tools do not aid designers in the early stages of product development. Research at Cranfield University has developed a greater understanding of the type of criteria required of a sustainable design tool in order to make it more appropriate to industrial designers. One of the deliverables of this project has been a sustainable design web based tool that combines sustainable design information with a selection of inspirational ideas. This paper presents the results to date of the research, outlines the tool and gives examples of its use.},

The anatomical dissection method was used to analyze the ostrich foot characteristics. The structure and material of the bionic shock absorption midsole were designed according to the principles of bionic engineering and reverse engineering. F-Scan and numerical simulation were used to evaluate the bionic shock absorption midsole performance. The results showed that the bionic shock absorption midsole decreased the peak pressure (6.04–12.27\%), peak force (8.62–16.03\%), pressure–time integral (3.06–12.66\%), and force–time integral (4.06–10.58\%) during walking and brisk walking. In this study, the biomechanical effects to which the bionic shock absorption midsole structure was subjected during walking and brisk walking exercises were analyzed. The bionic midsole has excellent shock resistance. It is beneﬁcial for the comfort of the foot during exercise and might reduce the risk of foot injuries during exercise.},

	abstract = {Octopus arms house 200–300 independently controlled suckers that can alternately afford an octopus ﬁne manipulation of small objects and produce high adhesion forces on virtually any non-porous surface. Octopuses use their suckers to grasp, rotate and reposition soft objects (e.g., octopus eggs) without damaging them and to provide strong, reversible adhesion forces to anchor the octopus to hard substrates (e.g., rock) during wave surge. The biological ‘design’ of the sucker system is understood to be divided anatomically into three functional groups: the infundibulum that produces a surface seal that conforms to arbitrary surface geometry; the acetabulum that generates negative pressures for adhesion; and the extrinsic muscles that allow adhered surfaces to be rotated relative to the arm. The effector underlying these abilities is the muscular hydrostat. Guided by sensory input, the thousands of muscle ﬁbers within the muscular hydrostats of the sucker act in coordination to provide stiffness or force when and where needed. The mechanical malleability of octopus suckers, the interdigitated arrangement of their muscle ﬁbers and the ﬂexible interconnections of its parts make direct studies of their control challenging. We developed a dynamic simulator (ABSAMS) that models the general functioning of muscular hydrostat systems built from assemblies of biologically constrained muscular hydrostat models. We report here on simulation studies of octopus-inspired and artiﬁcial suckers implemented in this system. These simulations reproduce aspects of octopus sucker performance and squid tentacle extension. Simulations run with these models using parameters from man-made actuators and materials can serve as tools for designing soft robotic implementations of man-made artiﬁcial suckers and soft manipulators.},

	abstract = {Art Deco is a geometric art style popular in Europe and widely spread in United States in the beginning of 20 th century. It is marked by sharp angles and crisp clean lines. Art Deco architectures are characterized by geometric shapes, rich motifs, streamlined and curvilinear forms, vivid and bold colors. Usually, the architectures building materials consists of stucco, concrete, stones, terracotta, steel, aluminum, and glass. Both garments and buildings share their importance for human; they provide protection, shelter, and express identity. In addition, fashion and architecture forms are three dimensional, contain space and related to fine arts. In fashion design; the designer translate a two dimensional materials (cloth) into a three dimensional shape when constructed as a garment surrounding the human body. In this research the connection between architecture and fashion is translated into creative hybrid practices of fashionable designs, which inspired from features and soul of Art Deco style.},

	abstract = {Launch date of the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 was on October 4, 1957, therefore it was commonly considered to be the starting year of the space age. Being inspired by the rapid developments in space and universe explorations, Andr´e Courr`eges, Pierre Cardin and many other designers opened the frontier territory of the space-age era in the fashion community. From 1964, Andr´e Courr`eges extensively used the white and silver metallic colours which soon became the definition of aesthetics at that time and was named Godfather of the space-age designer. On the other hand, Pierre Cardin demonstrated his early space-age work at the Paris Fashion Week in 1968 and was called the pioneer of the space-age fashion designer. For the six decades up to now, at least 15 fashion designers launched the so-called “Fashion communities’ interplanetary mission” in different years: Andr´e Courr`eges (1964), Mary Quant (1965), Reed Crawford (1966, specialized in hat design), Pierre Cardin (1968), Paco Rabanne (1968), Thierry Mugler (1979), Issey Miyake (1995), Alexander McQueen (1995), Nicolas Ghesqui`ere (2007), Hussein Chalayan (2007), Christopher Kane (2011), Raf Simons (2014), Donatella Versace (2016), Karl Lagerfeld (2017), Nicolas Ghesqui`ere (second time in 2019, as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton) and Iris Van Herpen (2019). The purpose of this paper is to systematically and methodically review the inspi­ ration and significant influence of space exploration and universe discovery on the fashion aesthetics, styling and design in six decades from 1960 to the current year. Major creative ideas included new colours such as silver, new materials such as metallic, new styling such as flying saucer, new patterns such as totems, and the use of new technologies such as 3-dimensional (3D) printing, with the most important considerations of noble, elegancy and aesthetics. Also, the feedback influence of the space-age fashion on the new generation SpaceX and Boeing suits is discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method to design the internal stiffeners layout of the supporting parts of a machine tool. This method skillfully adopts the natural growth law of leaf veins. Firstly, the similarity between the growth law of leaf veins and the layout of stiffeners in the supporting parts is dealt with in detail. The mechanical properties of different growth types of leaf veins are compared and analyzed by the finite element simulation. In addition, the optimality of the adaptive growth law of leaf veins is also analyzed. Then, a parameter optimization method of stiffeners layout based on a variable cross-section structure is proposed. Distinct from the traditional design of stiffeners layout, the method proposed in this paper not only adopts the idea of a variable cross-section structure, but also simulates the adaptive growth law of leaf veins through a parametric method. In the process of establishing a meta model, three modeling methods are compared, and the excellent performance of the genetic algorithm and BP neural network (GABPNN) method in meta model accuracy is determined. And a marine predator algorithm is implemented to optimize the meta model. Finally, the method proposed in this paper is applied to the design of the column part of a machine tool, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experiments, which provides a good idea for the design of stiffeners layout of the supporting parts of a machine tool.},

	abstract = {Biological inspiration evaluation has been widely acknowledged as one of the most important phases in biologically inspired design (BID) as it substantially determines the direction of the following-up design activities. However, it is inherently an interdisciplinary assessment, which includes both the engineering domain and the biological systems. Due to the lack of knowledge at the early stage of product design, the risk assessments mainly depend on experts' subjective judgments, which values are vague, imprecise, and even inconsistent. How to objectively evaluate the biological inspiration under such uncertain and interdisciplinary scenarios remains an open issue. To bridge such gaps, this study proposes a fuzzy rough number extended multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) to evaluate the biological inspiration for BID. A fuzzy rough number is introduced to represent the individual decision maker's risk assessment and aggregate respective evaluation values within the decision-making group. A fuzzy rough number extended decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory is presented to determine the criteria weights and a fuzzy rough number extended multi-attribute ideal real comparative analysis is proposed to rank the candidate biological inspirations. Experimental results and comparative analysis validate the superiority of the proposed MCGDM in handling the subjectivity and uncertainty in biological inspiration evaluation.},

Study 1 shows that, when applied to the functional (not aesthetic) aspect of the servicescape, repurposed design (vs. no repurposed design) will render significantly higher levels of customer inspiration and repurchase intention toward the business. Study 2 results indicate that the functional servicescape bounded effect of repurposed design (vs. no repurposed design) applies only when the design source was supplier (not employee). Moderated mediation analysis further demonstrates that such conditional effects of repurposed design (vs. no repurposed design) are driven by the psychological mechanism via substantive CSR engagement attribution. Findings from this pioneering research provide important theoretical and practical contributions for CSR, sustainability, and responsible consumption.},

	abstract = {Biologically inspired design (BID) is one of the common methods for product design. To solve the problem of inaccurate acquisition of inspirational creatures due to the lack of user perception preference analysis, a data-driven intelligent service model for BID considering user perception needs is proposed based on Kansei engineering. Firstly, by extracting the perceptual features of creatures from the semantic source elements of products through mapping and encodes them, we proposed a data acquisition method based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets considering different customer preference distributions, bridging the gap caused by the asymmetry between designers and users. Secondly, the functional relationship between biometric features and user-perceived attributes is identified and predicted, and a predictive model of biodata considering user preferences is obtained by multiple linear regression analysis. Finally, based on the data clustering and reorganization theory to understand the organization and dynamics of the database, the construction of a BID library was completed, and the design resources in the library were used as analyzed knowledge for designers to plan design activities. Taking the bionic design of a UAV product as an example, a prototype of a computer-aided design service system was developed based on the theory proposed in the article, and the analyzed knowledge was used to improve the efficiency and science of the design, effectively verifying the usefulness of this study for design. To a certain extent, this study addresses the problem of cognitive limitations of designers and cognitive differences between designers and users, promotes the application of bioinspiration in product design, and improves the marketability of design solutions.},

The artiﬁcial saltatorial leg is designed to imitate the characteristics of a real jumping insect, kinematically and dynamically, and proposed to reduce the contact force at tarsus–ground interface during jumping acceleration thus optimizes the jumping motion by minimizing the risk of both leg ruptures and tarsus slippage. Then by means of high speed camera experiment, the jumping characteristics of the theoretical jumping model, the jumping insect leafhopper and the robot are compared so as to show the dynamic similarity and optimization results among them. The ﬁnal energy integrated jumping robot prototype is able to accomplish a movement of continuous jumping, of which a single jumping reaches 100 mm high and 200 mm long, about twice and four times of its body length respectively.},

In this essay, I argue that the emerging practice of learning experience design (LX) affords the opportunity to develop more engaging, innovative, and effective experiences for learners in diverse settings. However, in order to realize this potential, designers must expand our definitions of what counts as a learning experience, for whom, and for what ends. In addition, I challenge us as designers to foreground equity in our designs by beginning with the assumption that whatever learning situations we create will always be usable to some learners (and unusable for others), and will also have unintended consequences (even negative consequences) for some learners.},

Section 2 summarises the experiences and observations of engineers and the most comprehensive theories of creativity and innovation proposed by psychologists and educators, which set the stage for a generic model. Section 3 evaluates and synthesises the scope and use of over 100 commercially available tools to enhance creativity and innovation. We place this in the context of the 'processes of creating' outlined in the psychological literature as well as those generally accepted to lead to internationally competitive outcomes in engineering, business, sociology and literature, among others. The series of tables defines a preliminary Taxonomy of Tools to enable potential users to clarify how and where additional information or help should be solicited, to streamline any stage of engineering design. Section 4 elucidates a 'process of creating' as a generic model, which illustrates how contradictory input data become novel outcomes in processes that co-evolve the bodies of knowledge on both sides of a problem–solution equation. The model, in contrast to previous theories, is not vague – apparent contradictions between design demands can be resolved in precise steps, as long as the starting point of all actors/stakeholders is made coincident.},

These design-culture community websites have also exposed the tensions between production and consumption, professional and amateur practices, work and play and expression/exploration and service. Evolving practices, enabled by networked technologies, have supported a reputation-based system of knowledge building and resource distribution that allow for modest, open creative cultural production to grow outside the commercial realm. While this parallel practice has promoted an expansion of our notion of creative production, it has also been fed in part by corporate mythologies that contribute to the precarious nature of contemporary creative work. The community's designed artefacts, including shared resources and tools such as the portal itself, have subsequently revealed struggles over cultural production in the early Web design era and, perhaps, a more nuanced view of the creative knowledge worker.},

	abstract = {This work lends insight into the meaning and impact of “near” and “far” analogies. A cognitive engineering design study is presented that examines the effect of the distance of analogical design stimuli on design solution generation, and places those findings in context of results from the literature. The work ultimately sheds new light on the impact of analogies in the design process and the significance of their distance from a design problem. In this work, the design repository from which analogical stimuli are chosen is the U.S. patent database, a natural choice, as it is one of the largest and easily accessed catalogued databases of inventions. The “near” and “far” analogical stimuli for this study were chosen based on a structure of patents, created using a combination of latent semantic analysis and a Bayesian based algorithm for discovering structural form, resulting in clusters of patents connected by their relative similarity. The findings of this engineering design study are juxtaposed with the findings of a previous study by the authors in design by analogy, which appear to be contradictory when viewed independently. However, by mapping the analogical stimuli used in the earlier work into similar structures along with the patents used in the current study, a relationship between all of the stimuli and their relative distance from the design problem is discovered. The results confirm that “near” and “far” are relative terms, and depend on the characteristics of the potential stimuli. Further, although the literature has shown that “far” analogical stimuli are more likely to lead to the generation of innovative solutions with novel characteristics, there is such a thing as too far. That is, if the stimuli are too distant, they then can become harmful to the design process. Importantly, as well, the data mapping approach to identify analogies works, and is able to impact the effectiveness of the design process. This work has implications not only in the area of finding inspirational designs to use for design by analogy processes in practice, but also for synthesis, or perhaps even unification, of future studies in the field of design by analogy.},

Understanding these properties is critical for effectively harnessing the power of analogy. The current research explores how variations in analogical distance, commonness, and representation modality influence the effects of examples on conceptual ideation. Senior-level engineering students generated solution concepts for an engineering design problem with or without provided examples drawn from the U.S. Patent database. Examples were crossed by analogical distance (near-field vs. far-field), commonness (more vs. less-common), and modality (picture vs. text). A control group that received no examples was included for comparison. Effects were examined on a mixture of ideation process and product variables. Our results show positive effects of far-field and less-common examples on novelty and variability in quality of solution concepts. These effects are not modulated by modality. However, detailed analyses of process variables suggest divergent inspiration pathways for far-field vs. less-common examples. Additionally, the combination of far-field, less-common examples resulted in more novel concepts than in the control group. These findings suggest guidelines for the effective design and implementation of design-by-analogy methods, particularly a focus on far-field, less-common examples during the ideation process.},

            Information acquisition, utilization, and communication are integral to the design process, but systematic investigation of information behavior is complicated by its variety and the ways in which designers engage with information throughout the design process. Our previous work developed a theoretical framework to categorize the various types of information used during the design process, known as the Information Archetypes Framework. This article explores how these information dimensions manifest in design practice, as reflected on by experienced practicing designers. Deep qualitative analysis of eight interviews with practicing designers revealed that the designers intentionally adapt their behavior to match situation specific needs and navigate the tensions between information dimensions through trajectories and loops.},

            In today’s world, the advantages of data-enabled design are undeniable, increasing the performance of organisations drastically by informing and inspiring the design process. While organisations seem to be more experienced with quantitative data for evaluative purposes, they do struggle to use data as creative material to inspire the design process. Choosing the right type of data representation is critical for using data for creative purposes. Data visualization has proven to be highly effective in increasing understanding of data, as it is fast, accurate and flexible. Data physicalization, on the other hand, remains unexplored in comparison, especially its effect on creativity. This paper presents the results of two studies (one preliminary and one follow-up study), which explored the use of data physicalization in creative settings. The preliminary study enabled to collect initial requirements for the development of a physicalization toolkit, while the follow-up study investigated its impact on the design process, in comparison to data visualization. From the studies, we developed Concreate, a collaborative data physicalization toolkit designed to lead to creative insights from quantitative data. Our results show that Concreate can potentially stimulate creative thinking, by encouraging intense, tangible interaction with data leading to increased reflection-in-action and a deeper understanding of data. The two studies and toolkit development were carried out at a multinational automotive company, interested in innovating by incorporating data as creative material. Besides the immediate practical implications, we conclude this paper with a discussion on future recommendations for using data physicalization in the design process.},

	abstract = {Design by analogy is a design ideation strategy to find inspiration from source domains to generate design concepts in target domains. Recently, many computational methods were proposed to measure similarities between source domains and target domains to build connections between them. However, most existing methods only explore either visual or semantic cues of the concepts in source and target domains but ignore the integration of both modalities. In fact, humans have remarkable visual reasoning ability to transfer knowledge learned from objects in familiar categories (source domains) to recognize objects from unfamiliar categories (target domains). In this paper, we propose a visual reasoning framework to support design by visual analogy. The challenge of this research is how computation methods can mimic the process of humans’ visual reasoning, which fuses visual and semantic knowledge. In the framework, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is applied to learn visual knowledge from objects in familiar categories. The hierarchy-based graph convolutional network (HGCN) is proposed to transfer learned visual knowledge from familiar categories to unfamiliar categories by their semantic distances. Finally, the unfamiliar objects can be reasoned and recognized based on the transferred visual knowledge. Extensive experimental results on one mechanical component benchmark dataset demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed methods.},

The goal of this study was to investigate the information seeking behavior of student designers while validating a previously developed "Typology of Design Information" framework. Participants were asked to use and evaluate pieces of information during the idea generation process. Results show a discrepancy between the information that participants naturally sought out and their perceived utility (helpfulness) of the information. However, individually significant relationships between perceived utility and behavior were found with features generated by participants, suggesting that even though participants' perception of the utility of information pieces and their actual behavior are not related, both constructs have an identifiable influence on design outcomes. This study advances the Typology of Design Information framework by empirically exploring the link between the types of information used by novice designers and the ideas generated, and it illustrates that participants employ complex cognitive behavior when engaging with design information to generate novel ideas.},

Via more in-depth surveys, we sought to elicit correlations between the students’ design creativity and stimuli permutations of the different design conditions. Results show that the contextual information groups, which were presented with higher levels of stimulus fidelity, had higher novelty scores, while abstract groups performed well in usefulness.

	abstract = {This paper reports a systematic literature review with the aim of determining the role of stimuli and other factors, such as timing, the designers’ background, expertise, and experience, in the idea generation phase of conceptual design related to engineering and industrial design and architecture. “Stimulus” is a general expression for a source of information characterized by several features, including the source (internal or external), analogical distance (near or far), and form (textual, visual, or other). Several recent studies have been conducted on this topic involving neurophysiological measurements with significant results. This comprehensive review will help to determine if the neurophysiological results are consistent with those from protocol studies. This allows for determining how the features of stimuli affect – among the related factors – designers’ performance in idea generation. The literature search was carried out using the Snowball and PRISMA methods. A total of 72 contributions were selected from studies adopting protocol analysis or neurophysiological measurements. This study presents a framework to support the selection of stimuli most likely to maximize performance, based on the designer’s background and expertise in the different idea generation metrics. The main findings of the framework suggest that visual stimuli enhance the creative performance of designers, regardless of their background, while textual stimuli foster the variety and quality of ideas, but only in engineering and industrial designers. Comparing the findings, the resulting framework reveals aspects of stimuli that require further investigation. These can be considered valuable insights for new directions for design research.},

	abstract = {Designers can benefit from inspirational stimuli when presented during the design process. Encountering external stimuli can also lead designers to negative design outcomes by limiting exploration of the design space and idea generation. Prior work has investigated how specific features of inspirational stimuli can be beneficial or harmful to designers. However, the processes designers use to search for and discover inspirational stimuli leading to these outcomes are less known. The objective of this work is thus to better understand how designers search for inspirational design stimuli. Specifically, we investigate how factors such as designer expertise and search modality (e.g., text vs. visual-based) impact both explicit and implicit features during the search for design stimuli. A cognitive study was completed by novice and expert designers (seven students and eight professionals), who searched for design stimuli using a novel multi-modal search platform while following a think-aloud protocol. The multi-modal search platform enabled search using text and nontext inputs, and provided design stimuli in the form of 3D-model parts. This work presents methods to describe search processes in terms of three levels: activities, behaviors, and pathways, as defined in this paper. Our findings determine that design expertise and search modality influence search behavior. Illustrative examples are presented and discussed of search processes leading designers to both negative and beneficial outcomes, such as designers fixating on specific results or benefiting unexpectedly from unintentional inspirational stimuli. Overall, this work contributes to an improved understanding of how designers search for inspiration, and key factors influencing these behaviors.},

	abstract = {The biological domain has the potential to offer a rich source of analogies to solve engineering design problems. However, due to the complexity embedded in biological systems, adding to the lack of structured, detailed, and searchable knowledge bases, engineering designers find it hard to access the knowledge in the biological domain, which therefore poses challenges in understanding the biological concepts in order to apply these concepts to engineering design problems. In order to assist the engineering designers in problem-solving, we report, in this paper, a web-based tool called Idea-Inspire 4.0 that supports analogical design using two broad features. First, the tool provides access to a number of biological systems using a searchable knowledge base. Second, it explains each one of these biological systems using a multimodal representation: that is, using function decomposition model, text, function model, image, video, and audio. In this paper, we report two experiments that test how well the multi-modal representation in Idea-Inspire 4.0 supports understanding and application of biological concepts in engineering design problems. In one experiment, we use Bloom’s method to test “analysis” and “synthesis” levels of understanding of a biological system. In the next experiment, we provide an engineering design problem along with a biological-analogous system and examine the novelty and requirement-satisfaction (two major indicators of creativity) of resulting design solutions. In both the experiments, the biological system (analogue) was provided using Idea-Inspire 4.0 as well as using a conventional text-image representation so that the efficacy of Idea-Inspire 4.0 is tested using a benchmark.},

The Collaborative Ideation Partner (CIP) is a co-creative design system that provides inspirational sketches based on the visual and conceptual similarity to sketches drawn by a designer. To evaluate the effect of CIP on design ideation, we conducted an exploratory study that measures ideation in a co-creative system. To measure the ideation, we developed a way of measuring ideation in a co-creative system including an outcome and a process approach. From the exploratory study, we learned that the image quality in the dataset is important in AI-based creativity and inspirations based on conceptual similarity to the target design have more impact on ideation than inspirations based on visual similarity to sketches drawn by a designer. We present the architecture of the CIP system and a study design based on what we learned from the exploratory study.},

Through a series of in-depth qualitative interviews and online observation of design professionals, we identify three aspects of curatorial labor on Pinterest: (1) performance, (2) process, and (3) product. The strategic and creative selection and arrangement of digital images by these designers becomes an ongoing authorial act of creative labor. This community demonstrates how the public digital curation of visual images is an important part of the ongoing venture labor of design professionals.

	abstract = {Biology provides a rich and novel source of inspiration for product design. An increasing number of industrial designers are gaining inspiration from nature, producing creative products by extracting, classifying, and reconstructing biological features. However, the current process of gaining biological inspiration is still limited by the prior knowledge and experience of designers, so it is necessary to investigate the designer’s perception of biological features. Herein, we investigate designer perceptions of bionic object features based on Kansei engineering, achieving a highly comprehensive structured expression of biological features forming ﬁve dimensions—Overall Feeling, Ability and Trait, Color and Texture, Apparent Tactile Sensation, and Structural Features—using factor analysis. Further, producing creative design solutions with a biologically inspired design (BID) has a risk of failing to meet user preferences and market needs. A user preference prediction support tool may address this bottleneck. We examine user preference by questionnaire and explore its association with the perceptual evaluation of designers, obtaining a user preference prediction model by conducting multiple linear regression analysis. This provides a statistical model for identifying the relative weighting of the perception dimensions of each designer in the user preference for an animal, giving the degree of contribution to the user preference. The experiment results show that the dimension “Overall Feeling” of the designer perception is positively correlated with the “like” level of the user preference and negatively correlated with the “dislike” level of the user preference, indicating that this prediction model bridges the gap caused by the asymmetry between designers and users by matching the designer perception and user preference. To a certain extent, this research solves the problems associated with the cognitive limitations of designers and the diﬀerences between designers and users, facilitating the use of biological features in product design and thereby enhancing the market importance of BID schemes.},

We present a protocol and network analysis of 31 ideation sessions, based on novice designers working individually, revealing the emergence of eight idea archetypes and a number of process features. Based on this, we propose the Dual-Process Ideation (DPI) Model, which links idea creation and idea judgement. This explains a number of previously contradictory results and oﬀers testable predictive power. Ó 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Digital ethnography can be defined as a contemporary form of ethnography which considers online social spaces of discussion following the advances in data transmission technology. In the last few years, various attempts of considering online spaces in ethnographic research have been made producing different styles of online ethnography, each identified by a different label. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the topic to map the practice of digital ethnography. The research process followed four key steps: search, selection, analysis and synthesis. In the search phase, we searched contributions iteratively in Web of Science and Scopus by using a variety of keywords corresponding to the different labels used to refer to digital ethnography. In the selection phase, we adopted a selective stance that aims to provide a critical review of the existing research and practices in the context of digital ethnography. In the analysis phase, we carried out a content analysis of the papers combining deductive and inductive coding. The synthesis phase involves a process of typology development to pragmatically reduce and systematize an extensive set of features and digital ethnography practices. Basing on the type of data collected (Small vs Big Data) and the type of fieldwork (meta or contextual field), we detected four types of ethnographic research: social media ethnography, contextual digital ethnography, meta digital ethnography, cross-media ethnography.},

The paper especially focusses on how researchers draw space boundaries, set time boundaries and engage their online field. Design/methodology/approach– The authors perform a systematic review of extant literature and identify 59 papers in 40 different journals as online ethnographies from various management disciplines. The authors perform both qualitative and quantitative analyses on papers in the sample. Findings– The paper identifies how online ethnographers both define boundaries and engage their online field. The paper shows that some of the advantages of online ethnography actually prompt researchers to favor-specific research designs over others. Research limitations/implications– The authors only focussed on articles adopting online ethnography in organization and management studies that are listed in Social Sciences Citation Index database. Online ethnographies in other research fields and indexes are not studied in this paper. Practical implications– The paper makes suggestions on how to complement existing online ethnographies to reach a more comprehensive practice of online ethnography. Social implications– The systematic review may help researchers to locate useful online ethnography examples across various management disciplines and may contribute to the maturation of online ethnography. Originality/value– The paper synthesizes emerging trends in online ethnography and identifies how specific advantages actually prompt online ethnographers to limit themselves in their research designs.},

The article concludes that a balanced combination of physical and digital ethnography not only gives researchers a larger and more exciting array of methods, but also enables them to demarginalize the voice of respondents.

	abstract = {To understand how the digitalization of higher education influences the inter-relationship between students, teachers, and their broader contexts, research must account for the social, cultural, political, and embodied aspects of teaching and learning in digital environments. Digital ethnography is a research method that can generate rich contextual knowledge of online experiences. However, how this methodology translates to higher education is less clear. In order to explore the opportunities that digital ethnography can provide in higher education research, this paper presents a methodological review of previous research, and discusses the implications for future practice. Through a systematic search of five research databases, we found 20 papers that report using digital ethnographies to explore teaching and learning in higher education. The review synthesizes and discusses how data collection, rigour, and ethics are handled in this body of research, with a focus on the specific methodological challenges that emerge when doing digital ethnographic research in a higher education setting. The review also identifies opportunities for improvement—especially related to participant observation from the student perspective, researcher reflexivity in relation to the dual teacher-researcher role, and increased diversity of data types. This leads us to conclude that higher education research, tasked with understanding an explosion of new digital practices, could benefit from a more rigorous and expanded use of digital ethnography.},

To capture the experience of being in New York City during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used a novel method of remote ethnography to interview people who were walking the city. We developed the Walkie-Talkie Map to collect and present these interviews, enabling website visitors to see what the subject saw as they walked the route of their choice.

	abstract = {As the field of visualization continues to expand, understanding how visualization designers think and the kinds of assumptions they hold becomes crucial for creating and communicating clear, accurate, and impactful visualizations. In this exploratory study, we analyzed Twitter threads discussing visualization, aiming to uncover the beliefs and assumptions held by visualization designers. Utilizing 8 Twitter threads rich in discussion as case studies, we reveal the implicit assumptions that designers harbor while creating visualizations. If unaddressed, these assumptions often lead to confusion or misinterpretation. This paper discusses several strategies that designers can leverage to increase awareness about the assumptions they make. Though this study has limitations, given its reliance on inferred findings from self-reported Twitter data, it offers valuable insights for visualization design practitioners and proposes directions for future research. By addressing the issue of implicit assumptions by visualization designers, we can enhance the effectiveness and clarity of visualization communication.},

This paper considers the indexing and retrieval of informal, unstructured information captured from electronic design logbooks. One of the key observations of informal design information is its evolutionary nature over time. While this characteristic makes informal information a rich source for reuse, it also makes it diﬃcult to employ traditional information retrieval (IR) approaches. The work described in this paper is based on a framework developed speciﬁcally for the information handling requirements of designers. This manual method for indexing information is adapted to meet the evolutionary nature of design through the development of thesauri for design context. Several approaches to building thesauri are examined, including manual and automated methods. It is found that manual methods provide a high level of IR performance, but also have high overhead requirements. Machine methods, however, may provide a viable, low overhead alternative.},

	abstract = {All designers know that it is impossible to infer a design solution from the givens of a task alone, no matter how complete and well presented they are. Therefore, designers seek to complementinformation they receive, and the material they bring into the task environment includes visual images. Images may be gathered from every imaginable source, from domain-specific images (in architecture they are usually classified and pertain to building type, location, period, technology, style or creator) through 'metaphoric' images (art, nature) to eclectic personal favourites. Inaddition, randomly encountered images may find their way into a database of references: a depository of potentially useful images. With the exception of factual information that fills in thetask givens, it is usually far from clear what purpose may be served by images in general, or to what use the specific images aligned for a particular task may be put. We propose that the singlemost significant 'on line' role of visual references during the process of designing is to suggest potential analogies to the entity that is being designed. The process of discovering and exploitingan analogy in design is complex; we shall explain it in terms of Gentner's structure mapping theory, which we adapt to visual structures. We further propose that the abstraction process thatmust take place for the successful identification and mapping from source (visual reference) onto target (designed entity) requires transformations of images, and such transformations are bestachieved through sketching. Sketching facilitates the two way process of movement from the pictorial to the diagrammatic and from the schematic to the figural. Such transformations musttake place to arrive at the match that allows conceptual transfer, mapping of structural relations and insight through analogy.},

However, in this uptake of design methods that encourage designerly action, the ontological status of design methods is often diffuse, with contradictory messages from practitioners and academics about the purpose and desired use of methods within a designer’s process. In this paper, I explore the paradoxical nature of design methods, arguing for a nuanced view that includes the (often) conflicting qualities of prescription and performance. A prescriptive view of methods is drawn from the specification of methods and their “proper” use in the academic literature, while a performative view focuses on in situ use in practice, describing how practitioners use methods to support their everyday work. The ontological characteristics and practical outcomes of each view of design methods are considered, concluding with productive tensions that juxtapose academia and practice.},

Developed through a literature review and interviews with UX professionals, the UXCAF includes 21 concepts split into six dimensions of UX capacity: people, resources, practices and processes, organiza­ tional literacy, organizational decision-making, and benefits. We apply the UXCAF to three organizations in different sectors to show how organizations of any type and size can learn how to improve their internal UX practices and stay competitive in an increasingly digital world.},

In this paper, we draw from an analysis of 60 interviews with experienced UX professionals to argue that a nuanced understanding of communication strategies should be explicitly included in HCI education. Specifically, we identify five goals that shape communications between UX practitioners and four distinct audiences and show that they select specific methods (techniques, artifacts, and tools) to achieve these goals. Drawing on theories of situated and authentic learning, we discuss three key implications for HCI educators: embracing rhetorical complexity, simulating real-world communication challenges, and high­ lighting the performative elements of communication. Educators must embrace these challenges to help students become more effective communicators and prepare them for UX careers.},

Here, we take a closer look at how prior embodied and explicit knowledge of HCI that all of the students have, combined with understanding of design practice through the course, shape them as human-computer interaction designers.

Perhaps for this reason, little work has been conducted to investigate how designers’ personal experiences can contribute to technology design. Yet it’s undeniable designers have applied their personal experiences to their design practice and also benefited from such experiences. This paper reports on a multiple case study that looks at how interaction designers worked with their personal experiences in three industrial interaction design projects, thus calling for the need to explicitly recognize the legitimacy of using and better support of the use of designers’ personal experiences in interaction design practice. In this study, a designer’s personal experiences refer to the collections of his/her individual experiences derived from his/her direct observation or past real-life events and activities, as well as his/her interaction with design artifacts and systems whether digital or not.},

Our analyses revealed that analogies that matched (versus mismatched) educational backgrounds were generated and revisited more frequently, presumably because they were more accessible. Matching analogies were also associated with increased epistemic uncertainty, perhaps because domain experts appreciate the challenge of mapping such analogies between domains.

This paper addresses this by detailing an analysis of designer activity in three situations commonly studied by design researchers: information seeking, ideation and design review. This comparison is instantiated through three complementary studies: an observational study of practice and two experimental studies. These reveal a range of similarities and diﬀerences that are described using a mixed methods approach. Based on this it is concluded that laboratory studies are important research tools and that clear and deﬁnable relationships do exist between design activity in practice and the laboratory.

The instructors prepared and presented teaching materials and assessed related projects for the required courses in Apparel Design and Fashion History. To assess students’ learning and satisfaction, the instructors developed prequestionnaires and postquestionnaires based on Lamb and Kallal () Functional, Expressive and Aesthetic (FEA) Apparel Design Framework. Responses to the prequestionnaire showed that students lacked awareness and information about using historic dress as inspiration. Responses from the postquestionnaires revealed that students looked at historic garment details, colors, and silhouettes and interpreted them in a modern way. Students said that additional benefits were that the exposure to historic dress increased their creativity, helped them understand FH, and helped them connect their course work in Fashion History and Apparel Design.},

The research literature on inspiration developed only recently due to inconsistency in definition and due to the presumption that inspiration is unimportant relative to effort.

Inspiration is then distinguished from insight and other constructs. Finally, the authors consider the broader cultural phenomenon of inspiration contagion. Inspiration is infectious, such that inspired writers inspire their readers, particularly readers high in openness to experience.},

	abstract = {Inspiration is an epistemic-motivational episode in which an individual is awoken to what is valuable and imbued with the spirit to express this understanding. In this article, I tell the story of my research program on inspiration. I begin by describing the origin of my research program as a corrective to the emphasis on personal agency in the motivation literature. I then review work on foundational issues of conceptualization, typology, methodology, and construct validation. Next I review research on the role of inspiration in the creative process. Inspiration is a response to, not a source of, creative ideas. Its function is to motivate transmission (e.g., actualization) of an idea in the form of a tangible product. Inventors prone to inspiration receive more patents, and inspired writers are more creative, productive, and efficient. Next I situate inspiration within a broader cultural-evolutionary context. Inspiration is infectious, such that inspired writers inspire their readers. Processes of transmission and contagion suggest that the core significance of inspiration lies in its procultural function. Inspiration, I argue, is a genetically evolved adaptation that catalyzes and guides cultural evolution by compelling selective retention of cultural wisdom in the form of cultural artifacts (e.g., scripture, poetry, inventions, actualized selves), thereby making the species more adaptable to local and changing environments. Finally, I discuss benefits to well-being. Inspiration marks moments of peak functioning that integrate the hedonic well-being of the primitive creature, the eudaimonic well-being of the social creature, and the self-transcendent well-being of the cultural creature.},

In Study 3, both trait inspiration and personal goals inspiration predicted increases in positive well-being variables across a 3-month period. In contrast, well-being did not predict longitudinal change in inspiration. Study 4, a diary study, extended the relation between inspiration and well-being to the within-person level of analysis. For given individuals, variations in inspiration across mornings predicted variations in evening levels of positive well-being variables. These effects were mediated by purpose in life and gratitude.

Creators have long argued that inspiration is important to the creative process, but until recently, scientists have not investigated this claim. In this article, we review challenges to the study of creative inspiration, as well as solutions to these challenges afforded by theoretical and empirical work on inspiration over the past decade. First, we discuss the problem of deﬁnitional ambiguity, which has been addressed through an integrative process of construct conceptualization. Second, we discuss the challenge of how to operationalize inspiration. This challenge has been overcome by the development and validation of the Inspiration Scale (IS), which may be used to assess trait or state inspiration. Third, we address ambiguity regarding how inspiration differs from related concepts (creativity, insight, positive affect) by discussing discriminant validity. Next, we discuss the preconception that inspiration is less important than “perspiration” (effort), and we review empirical evidence that inspiration and effort both play important—but different—roles in the creative process. Finally, with many challenges overcome, we argue that the foundation is now set for a new generation of research focused on neural underpinnings. We discuss potential challenges to and opportunities for the neuroscientiﬁc study of inspiration. A better understanding of the biological basis of inspiration will illuminate the process through which creative ideas “ﬁre the soul,” such that individuals are compelled to transform ideas into products and solutions that may beneﬁt society.},

              – The purpose of this paper is to identify both the inspiration sources used by fast fashion designers and ways the designers sort information from the sources during the product development process.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              – This is a qualitative study, drawing on semi-structured interviews conducted with the members of the in-house design teams of three Australian fast fashion companies.
            
            
              Findings
              – Australian fast fashion designers rely on a combination of trend data, sales data, product analysis, and travel for design development ideas. The designers then use the consensus and embodiment methods to interpret and synthesise information from those inspiration sources.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              – The empirical data used in the analysis were limited by interviewing fashion designers within only three Australian companies.
            
            
              Originality/value
              – This research augments knowledge of fast fashion product development, in particular designers’ methods and approaches to product design within a volatile and competitive market.},

However, for inexperienced designers or common consumers, it is difficult to complete the design of ready-to-wear clothes. In this paper, we introduce a novel fashion attributes disentanglement generative adversarial network (FadGAN) to assist users in automatically accomplishing the design process. Different from the typical style transfer methods, which are limited to perform coarse-level style transfer, our FadGAN works on learning the accurate mapping which can preserve the identity of one fashion item, as well as learning the texture of another fashion item. Specifically, given two different fashion items, a fashion item disentanglement encoder first disentangles the features of the two inputs into structure codes and texture codes, respectively. Subsequently, a texture swap module is proposed to learn mixed texture codes to eliminate the differences of features from different fashion items. The mixed texture codes and the structure codes are then fed into a generator for new fashion item generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior results in comparison to several state-of-the-art methods with a 0.006-0.446 improvement on the mask-LPIPS, a 3.976-6.724 improvement on CDH, a 9.266-13.127 improvement on CIEDE, and a 0.145-0.325 improvement on HISTO.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose an unorthodox approach to enhancing creativity and user experience (UX) in product design with a “magic”-based tool. To support the introduction of magic in product interaction design, we created magic-based inspirational cards that show examples of magic effects. The tool was developed in two modalities, a “static” containing card that show illustrations of magic effects, and a “dynamic” containing the same cards plus videos of magic effects. The tools were experimentally tested with 30 novice designers who were asked to use the tools as a source of inspiration and to generate design ideas for a design task. The ideas generated by the participants were assessed in terms of creativity and intended UX. The findings show that the use of magic-based inspiration resulted in significantly more original but less feasible ideas, and that the use of videos led to design ideas that were significantly more “enjoyable” and more “exciting” than the use of cards only. Consequently, we propose guidelines on the use of magic-based inspiration tools for group ideation in order to help design students create original, enjoyable and exciting UX.},

	abstract = {Understanding how designers think is core to advancing design methods, tools, and outcomes. Engineering researchers have effectively turned to cognitive science approaches to studying the engineering design process. Empirical methods used for studying designer thinking have included verbal protocols, case studies, and controlled experiments. Studies have looked at the role of design methods, strategies, tools, environment, experience, and group dynamics. Early empirical studies were casual and exploratory with loosely defined objectives and informal analysis methods. Current studies have become more formal, factor controlled, aiming at hypothesis testing, using statistical design of experiments (DOE) and analysis methods such as analysis of variations (ANOVA). Popular pursuits include comparison of experts and novices, identifying and overcoming fixation, role of analogies, effectiveness of ideation methods, and other various tools. This paper first reviews a snapshot of the different approaches to study designers and their processes. Once the current basis is established, the paper explores directions for future or expanded research in this rich and critical area of designer thinking. A variety of data may be collected, and related to both the process and the outcome (designs). But there are still no standards for designing, collecting and analyzing data, partly due to the lack of cognitive models and theories of designer thinking. Data analysis is tedious and the rate of discoveries has been slow. Future studies may need to develop computer based data collection and automated analyses, which may facilitate collection of massive amounts of data with the potential of rapid advancement of the rate of discoveries and development of designer thinking cognitive models. The purpose of this paper is to provide a roadmap to the vast literature for the benefit of new researchers, and also a retrospective for the community.},

However, existing example-based chart retrieval methods are built upon non-decoupled and low-level visual features that are hard to interpret, while definition-based ones are constrained to pre-defined attributes that are hard to extend. In this work, we propose a new framework, namely WYTIWYR (What-You-Think-Is-What-You-Retrieve), that integrates user intents into the chart retrieval process. The framework consists of two stages: first, the Annotation stage disentangles the visual attributes within the bitmap query chart; and second, the Retrieval stage embeds the user's intent with customized text prompt as well as query chart, to recall targeted retrieval result. We develop a prototype WYTIWYR system leveraging a contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model to achieve zero-shot classification, and test the prototype on a large corpus with charts crawled from the Internet. Quantitative experiments, case studies, and qualitative interviews are conducted. The results demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

Given the importance of energy efﬁcient buildings in reducing global building energy consumption, the aim of this research was to investigate the practical usefulness of a framework developed for designing bio-inspired energy efﬁcient ofﬁce buildings. Biologists conﬁrmed what became known as the thermal bio-architectural framework (ThBA) was both valid and potentially useful as a bridge between biology and architecture. Using the ThBA building designers can follow a systemic process to ﬁnd relevant solutions in biology to improve the thermal performance of ofﬁce buildings by reducing building energy consumption. This article investigates the impact of the ThBA in improving the thermal performance of two case study ofﬁce buildings in New Zealand through looking for innovative biomimetic design. The results showed that the simplest ways of translating biological thermoregulatory strategies (BTS) have been already used by architects. In addition to recognised parallels in sustainable building design, any other translations of BTS will require an energy balance calculation to ensure the innovative thermoregulatory system is energy efﬁcient. The ThBA also suggested innovative solutions that cannot be realised given the current state of technology but that offer opportunities for further research.},

The method uses a repository of existing design solutions where designers can recognize and retrieve analogical inspirations. Yet, exploring for analogical inspiration has been a laborious task for designers. This work presents a computational methodology that is driven by a topic modeling technique called non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). NMF is widely used in the text mining field for its ability to discover topics within documents based on their semantic content. In the proposed methodology, NMF is performed iteratively to build hierarchical repositories of design solutions, with which designers can explore clusters of analogical stimuli. This methodology has been applied to a repository of mechanical design-related patents, processed to contain only component-, behavior-, or material-based content to test if unique and valuable attribute-based analogical inspiration can be discovered from the different representations of patent data. The hierarchical repositories have been visualized, and a case study has been conducted to test the effectiveness of the analogical retrieval process of the proposed methodology. Overall, this paper demonstrates that the exploration-based computational methodology may provide designers an enhanced control over design repositories to retrieve analogical inspiration for DbA practice.},

Three factors were summarized, including knowledge, knowledge relations and innovative strategies. Representations of these three factors that were extracted from the international patent classification (IPC) were analyzed. An experimental scheme was designed, where 40 undergraduate students were selected as subjects and divided into five groups. One group was used as the control group with no materials provided, and the other four groups were used as the experimental subjects. The three factors and their combinations were provided to each of the four experimental groups. Subjects in each group were asked to propose preliminary designs of a coin-sorting device. The submitted designs were evaluated based on the novelty and practicality of the innovation. By comparing the groups, the impact of each factor on inspiration could be analyzed. The results show that the verb knowledge in the IPC has a significant impact on stimulating inspiration. For untrained students lacking experience, innovative strategies have a negative impact on the novelty of the inspiration. The knowledge relations can overcome the negative impact on the novelty induced by the innovative strategies.},

Two experts statistically analyzed the categories and quantities of cultural features, and then evaluated the creativity (originality and practicality) of design outcomes. Results show that students who worked with CTI create more creative outcomes than students who worked with CPI.

Although many human designs take inspiration from the natural world, the interest for systematizing this approach is relatively recent and need a more rigorous analysis in order to be applied in industrial research and development innovative contexts. This paper presents a model for biologically inspired design based on the framework of the C-K design theory. This model was elaborated using a sample of biologically inspired examples from the scientiﬁc literature. The results of this analysis reveal the main roles or biological knowledge in the design process: it expands the knowledge space, by means of the diﬀerences between natural systems and human-designed systems and also the concepts space, by indicating directions that were not previously exploited in a human design. This research also highlights the new forms of knowledge management and design organization that the systematic use of biological knowledge will require.},

However, there are difﬁculties in introducing bio-inspiration concepts in the university curriculum in that they involve multidisciplinary work, which can only possibly be successfully delivered by a team with integrated competencies. The aim of this work is summarising the results of the ﬁrst workshop on bio-inspired design carried out at the Hybrid Design Lab of Seconda Universita` di Napoli, involving Year 2 students of the BSc in Industrial Design. The common theme proposed for their projects was ‘‘Bio-inspired design of sport’’. Ideally, a sport item would need to respond to a number of exigencies, including safety, comfort, zero-energy balance and/or use of renewable energy sources, multi-functionality. The common aim of the projects was investigating in which cases bio-inspiration can assist in the fulﬁlment of the above exigencies. The students were asked to present examples from nature and, via an abstraction process, to apply them to the design of sport items. Finally, they were required to clarify the nature and the extent of bio-inspiration in their projects. Some of the projects, which were considered more interesting and realisable, are reported and brieﬂy commented, especially on the nature, extent and appropriateness of their bio-inspiration. A test for feedback has been given to the students, whose scope, structure and general outcome is also discussed.},

Students interacted with VR technology as a part of an experimental apparel design project in an upper-level university course. Open-ended questionnaires, documentation, and reﬂections provided data for the study. A majority of the students indicated VR technology was beneﬁcial as inspiration, and students said they would recommend VR use in future classes. After participating in this study, students expressed interest in exploring other interactive apps in future coursework that could allow students to draft patterns and design in VR. Student comments about interactions with the technology were useful and will inform future curriculum development. Little research has been published using VR in university apparel design classrooms, and this study serves as a starting point to gauge future interest in VR as a part of the apparel design process.},

Requirements of the fashion sector necessitate a tool to enhance the browsing experience for creative applications beyond retrieval. This paper highlights limitations of CBIR for applications in creative industries such as fashion.

In design research, the aﬀective qualities of inspirational materials and the perception of such aﬀective qualities have been studied, mainly from a positivist standpoint. This involves experimental methodologies and tools like rating scales which imply objective measurements of perception of aﬀective qualities to establish cause-eﬀect relationships. However, aﬀective quality is enmeshed in cultural and contextual frameworks. This implies that there can be subjective perceptions of aﬀective quality that demand more descriptive research. This paper contextualises a descriptive phenomeological approach to study designers’ subjective perceptions of aﬀective qualities of inspirational material.

We then outline how the methods relate to each of these aspects. The paper contributes to design practitioners by providing an overview of the methods and insights into when and how they may be employed to foster creativity and innovation in the design process; with regards to design research, the main contribution of the paper lies in the establishment and discussion of the four aspects as a frame for analyzing and comparing design methods.},

A selected sample based on yearly citations yielded 221 publications, which were analyzed using constant comparison analysis. We found that HCI is almost exclusively responsible for creativity-oriented publications; they focus on collaborative creativity rather than individual creativity; there is a general lack of definition of the term ‘creativity’; empirically based contributions are prevalent; and many publications focus on new tools, often developed by researchers. On this basis, we present three implications for future creativity-oriented HCI research: develop and employ clearer definitions of creativity; go beyond in-vitro studies of novel tools; and move toward interdisciplinary research collaborations.},

	abstract = {Inspiration is an important stage in conceptual design, wherein designers interact with different stimuli to generate creative ideas. Various cognitive processes like analogical reasoning have been described in design inspiration scenarios and have also been mapped to ontologies of cognitive psychology. However, the emotional processes in design inspiration are not clearly explained through ontological frameworks. In studies which report the signiﬁcance of emotion in design inspiration, various aspects of emotion tend to get conﬂated. This conﬂation may lead to inappropriate choices of methods to measure emotion. To address this gap, this paper adopts the core affect model of emotion to offer a constructivist understanding of emotion in design inspiration contexts. The components of the core affect model are mapped to aspects of emotion reported in design inspiration scenarios which involve the use of stimuli. The paper then brieﬂy outlines the potential of this ontological approach to study emotion in design inspiration. For this, a speciﬁc inspiration scenario is taken wherein a design student, while perceiving stimuli, thinks aloud to denote an emotion. It is then shown that this utterance could instantiate a detailed multipronged analysis in the framework of the core affect model, which delineates various constituent parts of emotion such as core affect, affective quality and so on. These constituents of emotion are broadly linked to different methodological frameworks with which they can be captured and analysed. The implications of this approach for future design research is also discussed.},

	abstract = {This article presents an approach to creating sources of inspiration through a collaborative concept design that was developed and observed during a future visioning concept design project concerning the theme of “performance wear,” which was conducted at the University of Helsinki for second-year textile student teachers. During the project, the students created future scenarios; used the functional, expressive, and aesthetic (FEA) consumer needs model for apparel design (Lamb and Kallal in Cloth Text Res J 10(2):42–47, 1992) when considering what performance wear could be like in a future scenario; and created digital collages (eCollages) to present their concepts. In the course that followed the concept design project, the students designed and made actual clothes using the concepts developed during the concept design project as one of their sources of inspiration. The outcomes of the process are described in this article through four research questions: (1) What type of future scenarios did the teams create, what types of eCollages did the teams make, and how did the teams use information and communication technologies (ICT) in their collages? (2) How did the use of eCollages enrich the concept presentations? (3) How were the three dimensions of the FEA model utilized and presented in the eCollages and team presentations? (4) How did the future visions of the concepts and the eCollages act as sources of inspiration in the students’ clothing designs? Five of the six teams studied created a global future scenario that envisioned the world as a dystopia. The high level of technical and visual executions of all the eCollages was surprising. The ECollages played an important role in every team presentation and enriched them considerably. The FEA model, on the other hand, both provided a supporting framework for the concepts and guided the students to direct their attention to apparel within their future scenarios, as well as to consider different dimensions of it. The concepts especially inspired students to create aesthetic elements to their design and to consider the expressiveness and functionality of the garments from the concept’s perspective. The students also challenged themselves to find technical solutions to design ideas they created through being inspired by the concepts. Furthermore, the students often described gaining inspiration from the story or atmosphere of the concept or other non-visual elements of it, and thereby it seems that our approach indeed succeeded in promoting multi-sensory inspiration.},

Two classes got similar design briefs and worked simultaneously in two countries, communicating through a common Facebook group. By the end of the project, each class discussed and analysed their sources of inspiration. The design solutions were dissected in separate design elements to look for national characteristics, despite similar international digital inspiration. By investigating cultural differences and similarities in designing based on the hypothesis that design students in Singapore and Norway have the same online design inspiration, this article demonstrates how international sources of inspiration affect the local visual traditions of designers.

            Visual stimuli can be useful in supporting design ideation process. However, researchers still know very little about how stimuli should be delivered to designers during the early design stage. This question is crucial to the effective use of stimuli because previous researches have proved that ill-presented stimuli can have a negative impact on design creativity. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted with the aim of exploring if and how combinational pictorial stimuli can affect designers' creative performance. Results from a total of 36 participants show that the design outcomes presented by the group exposed to combinational pictorial stimuli were more creative than those given by the group exposed to no stimuli or randomly presented pictorial stimuli. These results imply that the form of stimuli delivery can affect creative design outcomes and combinational pictorial stimuli best support design creativity among these three conditions. These findings give us a better understanding of the roles that visual stimuli play in design, which is expected to bring us important implications for both design education and design support tool development},

	abstract = {Inspirational stimuli are known to be effective in supporting ideation during early-stage design. However, prior work has predominantly constrained designers to using text-only queries when searching for stimuli, which is not consistent with real-world design behavior where fluidity across modalities (e.g., visual, semantic, etc.) is standard practice. In the current work, we introduce a multi-modal search platform that retrieves inspirational stimuli in the form of 3D-model parts using text, appearance, and function-based search inputs. Computational methods leveraging a deep-learning approach are presented for designing and supporting this platform, which relies on deep-neural networks trained on a large dataset of 3D-model parts. This work further presents the results of a cognitive study (n = 21) where the aforementioned search platform was used to find parts to inspire solutions to a design challenge. Participants engaged with three different search modalities: by keywords, 3D parts, and user-assembled 3D parts in their workspace. When searching by parts that are selected or in their workspace, participants had additional control over the similarity of appearance and function of results relative to the input. The results of this study demonstrate that the modality used impacts search behavior, such as in search frequency, how retrieved search results are engaged with, and how broadly the search space is covered. Specific results link interactions with the interface to search strategies participants may have used during the task. Findings suggest that when searching for inspirational stimuli, desired results can be achieved both by direct search inputs (e.g., by keyword) as well as by more randomly discovered examples, where a specific goal was not defined. Both search processes are found to be important to enable when designing search platforms for inspirational stimuli retrieval.},

However, minimal prior work has allowed individuals to search using multiple modes of input simultaneously, which is more representative of real design behavior. In the current work, we developed a multi-modal search platform that retrieves 3D model parts based on text, appearance, and function-based search inputs. This work presents the results of an experimental study (n=21) in which the search platform was used to find parts identified as potentially useful for inspiring solutions to a design challenge. Participants were asked to engage with three different search modalities: search by keywords, by curated 3D parts, and by user-assembled 3D parts in their workspace. When searching by parts that are curated or in their workspace, additional control over the similarity of appearance and function of results in reference to the input was available to participants. The results of this study demonstrate that the modality used affects search behavior, such as in the frequency of searches, how participants engage with retrieved search results, and how broadly the search space is covered. Specific results link interactions with the interface to search strategies participants may have used during the task. Findings suggest that multi-modal search should enable intentional search for desired goals through direct search inputs (e.g., by keyword) and incremental adjustments to features of visually represented search inputs. Moreover, enabling discovery of inexplicitly searched for examples through related information or more randomly encountered examples may assist exploratory search behavior.},

In this study, we explore the connection between information and inspiration through a qualitative approach, using the museum as our setting; specifically, the researchers’ own visits to three separate museums. We use collaborative auto-hermeneutics, a methodology specifically suited to such a reflexive exploration, to document and analyze three individual museum visits. The following research questions were the main driver for this exploratory study: What is inspiration, and How are inspiration and information related? In answer, we present an inductive definition of inspiration as a kind of information, and we discuss how this definition fits in with the information science literature as well as offer some practical applications.},

We studied 39 high-school students’ inspiration search strategies using Google Images. Low task constrainedness led to divergent search marked by quick iterations, limited design task usage, and a heterogeneous image set. Intermediate constrainedness prompted in-depth, on-task exploration characterized by slow and careful iterations with more search result examination, extensive design task usage, and homogenous images. High constrainedness led to flexible bracketing with quick, flexible design task use, ending with heterogeneous images. Images from the intermediately and highly constrained conditions generated more ideas and were perceived as more inspiring (relative to low) in a new group of students. We discuss the idea of a ‘sweet spot’ of constrainedness in an inspiration search process in design and consider implications for design research and future work.},

The included exploring and encountering information (in addition to searching and browsing for it) and visualizing/appropriating information. The observations also highlighted the importance of information use behaviors (such as editing and recording) and communication behaviors (such as sharing and distributing) as well as the importance of multimedia materials, particularly images, for architectural design projects. A key overarching theme was that inspiration was found to be both an important driver for and potential outcome of information work in the architecture domain, suggesting the need to design electronic information tools for architects that encourage and foster creativity.

As a ground for such developments, design cognition studies aim at describing designers’ mental strategies within the design process. So far, most researches have been focused on the idea generation phases, e.g. sketching activity, which is explicit enough to be observed and described. However, the early stages of design remain incompletely understood, while the informational phase is identified as a crucial step of the design process. In this context, our objective is to identify and evaluate inspirational information used by designers before generating ideas, and to describe how inspirational information is used. In this article, we report a two-part study (interviews and experimental protocol) carried out with professional designers.

It aims to analyse simple, general accounts of observed design behaviour and early stages of the clothing design process, what is the nature of design inspiration, how sources of inspiration are gathered and how they affect the creativity and originality in clothing design.Design/methodology/approach– A progressive series of empirical studies looking at ready‐to‐wear clothing design has been undertaken; in situ observation, semi‐structured interviews and constrained and semi‐constrained design tasks. This empirical approach used ethnographic observational methods, which is effective in situations where conventional knowledge acquisition methods are insufficient, when broad understanding of an industry is needed, as in the fashion industry, not just a case study of a single individual or company.Findings– Identifies the major types of idea sources in clothing design and provides information about each source. Recognises that these sources of inspiration help designers to create design elements and principles of individual designs. In order to foster originality, sources of inspiration play a powerful role throughout the creative stage of design process, and also in the early stages of fashion research and strategic collection planning.Originality/value– This paper highlights the role of sources of inspiration and its effect in creativity and originality in the clothing design process. Offers practical help to clothing designers and design‐led clothing companies.},

	abstract = {Sources of inspiration help designers to define the context of their designs and reflect on the emotional impact of their new products. By observing and interpreting sources of inspiration, designers form vocabularies of terms, pallets of colors, or mood boards with images, which express their feelings, inspire their creativity and help them communicate design concepts. These ideas are the motivation behind the EU-funded project TRENDS, which aimed at developing a software tool that supports the inspirational stage of design by providing designers of concept cars with various sources of inspiration. This paper concentrates on OntoTag, the semantic-based image retrieval algorithm developed within the TRENDS project, and its evaluation. OntoTag uses concepts from a general-purpose lexical ontology called OntoRo, and semantic adjectives from a domain-specific ontology for designers called CTA, to index the images in the TRENDS database in a way which provides designers with a degree of serendipity and stimulates their creativity. The semantic-based algorithm involves the following four steps: (i) creating a collection of documents and images retrieved from the web, (ii) for each document, identifying the most frequently used keywords and phrases in the text around the image, (iii) identifying the most powerful concepts represented in each document, and (iv) ranking the concepts identified and linking them to the images in the collection. OntoTag differs significantly from earlier approaches as it does not rely on machine learning and the availability of tagged corpuses. Its main innovation is in the use of the words’ monosemy and polysemy as a measure of their probability to belong to a certain concept. The proposed approach is illustrated with examples based on the software tool developed for the needs of two of the industrial collaborators involved in the TRENDS project.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to further an understanding of the nature and function of analogising and mental simulation in design through an analysis of the transcripts of two engineering design meetings. Analogies were coded for ‘purpose’ and in terms of whether they were within-domain or between-domain. Mental simulations were coded for ‘focus’: technical/functional or end-user. All expressions of uncertainty were also identiﬁed. Analogies were found to be typically between-domain (indicative of innovative reasoning) and were evenly distributed across solution generation, function ﬁnding and explanation. Mental simulations were predominantly technical/functional. Our most striking observation was that analogies and mental simulations were associated with conditions of uncertainty. We propose that analogising and mental simulation are strategies deployed to resolve uncertainty e a claim that is supported by the fact that uncertainty levels returned to baseline values at the end of analogising and simulation episodes.

	abstract = {The thinking process of designers is one of the most important issues in design research. This paper intends to enlarge design thinking theory and research by taking a close theoretical and empirical look at the very basic elements of thinking in design. Based on theoretical assumptions, thinking in design is reduced to the four basic cognitive operations of generation, exploration, comparison and selection, which, in various combinations, are applied to the goal space and the solution space of a given problem as well as to the organisation of the collective process of teamwork. These basic cognitive operations can be mapped onto different stages of the design process, thus establishing a generic model of design team activity. The generic model can be used to describe both, activities directed towards the content of a design problem as well as activities towards the organisation of the group process. Three laboratory teams solving a complex design problem extending over six hours have been studied in order to investigate the collective thinking process. Team communication has been recorded and analysed sentence-by-sentence, with each communicative act being classiﬁed according to the generic model. Based on previous results in the psychology of human information-processing and decision-making, a two-process-theory of thinking in design teams is proposed capable of explaining the results from the empirical investigation. The implications of the two-process-theory for training and practice of designers are discussed. kc 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We present practitioners’ experiences and perspectives from their own design practice, speciﬁcally focusing on their views of (i) the nature of ﬁxation, (ii) factors encouraging ﬁxation, and (iii) factors discouraging ﬁxation.

This stands in contrast to the prevailing mainstream HCI paradigm, which we term the ‘interaction’ perspective. The ‘practice turn’, as it has been dubbed in the social sciences, provides a conceptual frame to organize a variety of issues emerging in more recent HCI research. While this approach has been present in certain strands of HCI research for some time, it has not been articulated fully to date. In this paper, we provide a short account of the main tenets of this perspective, and then show how it can illuminate some of the recent debates within HCI. Our argument is one which does not seek to replace extant HCI theories, but rather to provide an alternative, complementary theoretical lens which may illuminate the present confusion among both researchers and practitioners as to the direction of HCI. The paper articulates a set of issues which can help direct HCI research programs, as well as highlighting the potential contribution of the HCI field to this practice approach itself, in terms of a more nuanced understanding of emerging practices.},

This tension manifests itself in, e.g., recurring problems with fluctuating requirements. I argue that this tension can be understood as the clash of two views on external design work: the engineering design and the creative design perspectives. To explain the tension and to lay a foundation for new ways to structure software development, I seek to apply critical insights and concepts from design methodology -the theoretical framework for creative design. The result is a development process in which external design is separated from internal design and construction. The external design work consists of conceptual, constitutive and consolidatory steps. The process shares some characteristics with participatory design, but the designer's expertise is recognized and identified.},

Objects are variously described in the literatures as relatively stable or in flux; as abstract or concrete; and as used within or across practices. We clarify these dimensions, drawing on and extending the literature on boundary objects, and connecting it with work on epistemic and technical objects. In particular, we highlight the epistemic role of objects, using our observations of knowledge work on an architectural design project to show how, in this setting, visual representations are characterized by a ‘lack’ or incompleteness that precipitates unfolding. The conceptual design of a building involves a wide range of technical, social and aesthetic forms of knowledge that need to be developed and aligned. We explore how visual representations are used, and how these are meaningful to different stakeholders, eliciting their distinct contributions. As the project evolves and the drawings change, new issues and needs for knowledge work arise. These objects have an ‘unfolding ontology’ and are constantly in flux, rather than fully formed. We discuss the implications for wider understandings of objects in organizations and for how knowledge work is achieved in practice.},

Tackling these challenges requires us to understand the past and present of design cognition research, and open fresh discussions on its future. This thematic collection aims to address this need by taking stock of current approaches, exploring emerging topics and methodologies, and identifying future directions for enquiry. In this editorial, we examine key issues regarding both what we investigate and how we conduct this research. We present a vision formed from a structured literature review, the work of authors in the collection, and the views of a broad cross-section of the design cognition community. This vision is formalized in a roadmap from the present to the near and far future, highlighting key topics and research questions for the field. Ultimately, ecological measurement, new applications of artificial intelligence, and a move towards theory construction and research maturation constitute key long term challenges for the design cognition community.},

We shall arrive most swiftly at the centre of the theory, by going back to the point from which I started about twenty years ago.

No rules can account for the way a good idea is found for starting an inquiry; and there are no firm rules either for the verification or the refutation of the proposed solution of a problem. Rules widely current may be plausible enough, but scientific enquiry often proceeds and triumphs by contradicting them. Moreover, the explicit content of a theory fails to account for the guidance it affords to future discoveries. To hold a natural law to be true, is to believe that its presence may reveal itself in yet unknown and perhaps yet unthinkable consequences; it is to believe that such laws are features of a reality which as such will continue to bear consequences inexhaustibly.},

NDM helped identify important areas of inquiry previously neglected (e.g. the use of expertise in sizing up situations and generating options), it introduced new models, conceptualizations, and methods, and recruited applied investigators into the field. Above all, NDM contributed a new perspective on how decisions (broadly defined as committing oneself to a certain course of action) are made. NDM still faces significant challenges, including improvement of the quantity and rigor of its empirical research, and confirming the validity of its prescriptive models.

While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

These values derive from the ‘designerly ways of knowing’. Because of a common concern with these fundamental ‘ways of knowing’, both design research and design education are contributing to the development of design as a discipline.},

	abstract = {Methods: We interviewed novice emergency physicians (ﬁrst-year residents) and attending physicians with signiﬁcant expertise, working in an academic Level I trauma center in Southern California. With cognitive task analysis, we used task diagrams to capture nonroutine critical incidents that required the use of complex cognitive skills. Timelines were constructed to develop a detailed understanding of challenging incidents and the decisions involved as the incident unfolded, followed by progressive deepening to tease out situation-speciﬁc cues, knowledge, and information that experts and novices used. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was conducted to identify key categories. Using classiﬁcation techniques for data reduction, we identiﬁed a smaller set of key themes, which composed the core ﬁndings of the study.
Results: Five interns and 6 attending physicians participated in the interviews. Novice physicians reported having difﬁculties representing the patient’s story to attending physicians and other health care providers. Overrelying on objective data, novice physicians use linear thinking to move to diagnosis quickly and are likely to discount and explain away data that do not “ﬁt” the frame. Experienced physicians draw on expertise to recognize cues and patterns while leaving room for altering or even changing their initial diagnosis. Whereas experts maintain high levels of spatial, temporal, and organizational systems awareness when overseeing treatment modalities of multiple patients, novices have difﬁculty seeing and maintaining the “big picture.”
Conclusion: Novice physicians use sense-making styles that differ from those of experts. Training novices to respond to the high cognitive demand of complex environments early in their careers requires instructional modalities that not only increase their knowledge base but also accelerate the integration of knowledge and practice. Simulation and custom-designed avatar-mediated virtual worlds are a promising new technology that may facilitate such training. Future research should expand on the results of this study through the use of larger sample sizes and interviews conducted at multiple sites to increase generalizability.

A further consistent theme to emerge in our review concerns the central role played by metacognitive monitoring and control processes in ensuring the eﬀective deployment of design strategies in response to designers’ ﬂuctuating feelings of uncertainty. We argue that a metacognitive perspective on design cognition is critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of strategic processing in design, additionally engendering many new avenues for important future research.

Specifically, we extend our previous research on engineering student design processes to compare the design behavior of students and expert engineers. Nineteen experts from a variety of engineering disciplines and industries each designed a playground in a lab setting, and gave verbal reports of their thoughts during the design task. Measures of their design processes and solution quality were compared to pre-existing data from 26 freshmen and 24 seniors. The experts spent significantly more time on the task overall and in each stage of engineering design, including significantly more time problem scoping. The experts also gathered significantly more information covering more categories. Results support the argument that problem scoping and information gathering are major differences between advanced engineers and students, and important competencies for engineering students to develop. Timeline representations of the expert designers' processes illustrate characteristic distinctions we found and may help students gain insights into their own design processes.},

It is the first part of a cyclical design process which involves “framing”, “moving”, and “reflecting”. Framing activities can be considered as a typical cognitive design process involving several levels. As an essential design activity, framing can be considered an indicator to trace whether digital media changes the way designers engage in their work. The results indicate that problem framing activities are significantly different in an online remote setting as compared to the two other settings. It appears that a chat line-based remote setting does not only facilitate a greater proportion of framing activities, particularly high level framing, but also shows more richly interlinked design activities.},

Whereas expert designers actively interrogate and reframe given problems, novice designers tend to solve them as given. We investigated novice designers’ perceptions of their ideas relative to problem frames and their cognitive styles. We found that innovative styles and framings corresponded to higher perceptions of idea diversity and creativity, whereas adaptive framings corresponded to lower perceptions of idea creativity and perceptions of greater diﬃculty generating ideas. Novice designers may hold implicit theories of creativity that undervalue adaptive creativity. However, problem frames that misalign with a novice’s preferred cognitive style can impact their ideation, and so hold promise for challenging their initial interpretations and approaches.

However, little is known about the interactions and activities that reveal frames and support frame sharing in teams. Our study follows 22 newly-formed multi-disciplinary teams through the early phases of the design process in a New Product Development course. We used a mixed method, interdisciplinary approach to understand the dynamic process through which design frames are socially negotiated and shared. We identified core framing activities of design teams and propose a framing cycle of pseudo-frame setting, making individuals’ frames explicit, making frame conflicts salient, and building a common frame.},

Authenticity, however, is unique to constructivist inquiry and has no parallel in the positivistic paradigm. Authenticity involves an assessment of the meaningfulness and usefulness of interactive inquiry processes and social change that results from these processes. However, the techniques for ascertaining authenticity are in the early stages of development. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe a process for assessing authenticity in a constructivist inquiry. A brief overview of constructivist inquiries are described in relation to a set of techniques designed specifically to assess five dimensions of authenticity.

This study investigates how five public and social innovation agencies adapted and used the core design practice of problem framing to address complex problems in society. The frames evolved according to nonlinear patterns through the co-evolution of problem and solution spaces. Practitioners adapted their framing practices to suit the complex social contexts by applying systemic design principles, pursuing multiple solutions and problem frames, and operationalizing wider research and thinking methods that align with the complex nature of each specific challenge. I argue that such practices require high-level expertise, and that capability building in public and social innovation should consider these emerging practices and levels of expertise.},

	url = {http://peer.asee.org/32505},
	doi = {10.18260/1-2--32505},
	abstract = {Purpose. To make course-based, undergraduate design projects more manageable, instructors often reduce or remove the open-ended quality, which in turn limits opportunities for students to learn to frame design problems. Here we introduce and characterize the construct, framing agency, which involves taking up opportunities to make consequential decisions about design problems and how to proceed in learning and developing solutions.
Methodology. We employed a multi-case study design, selecting cases of student design teams across different sites and levels, all in undergraduate engineering courses. Teams were audio/video recorded during their design process. We adapted a functional linguistics tool [1] to identify markers of agency in students’ design discourse, comparing and contrasting the cases to illuminate the nuances of framing agency. We also identified learning versus task-completion orientations.
Results. All students exhibited agency in some form, but not all exhibited framing agency. Analysis suggests that framing agency, when exhibited, is commonly shared across collaborating designers and tentative in nature early in the design process. Students who exhibited framing agency tended to adopt a learning rather than taskcompletion orientation. Students who exhibited agency, but not framing agency, made decisions that foregrounded accuracy and efficiency at the expense of exploring tentative ideas, and tended to treat the problem as having a single right answer.
Conclusions. We argue that how students negotiate design problem framing depends on whether or not they consider the design problem relevant and authentic, the belief that each member brings different and potentially useful information to the task, and the opportunity to iterate design ideas over time. Framing agency provides a lens for understanding the kinds of design learning experiences students need to direct their own learning and negotiate that learning with peers in design projects.},

In this paper we use teamwork protocol analysis to examine the problem framing activities of architecture students to identify differences in framing activities in three different design settings, namely online co-located, online remote and paper-based co-located. In order to encode these design activities, we first developed Schön's model of “reflective conversation with the situation” into “framing”, “moving”, and “reflecting”. The “framing – moving – reflecting” model is adopted as first coding scheme to examine framing activities. Furthermore we use Minsky’s frame system as second coding scheme to investigate the different types of problem framing activities. We find that paper based design tools can afford marginally more design communications than digital based tools; however, the proportion of framing activities in online remote setting is higher than others. Implication of these findings is discussed.},

Project-based learning classrooms are an ideal setting to investigate how teachers facilitate this process. Using participant observation, this study investigated how teachers supported students in taking ownership over the framing of problems in a charter school that serves students who have been underserved by traditional schooling. Data include audio/video records, field notes, interviews, and student work from a nineweek project. Interaction analysis was used to examine ownership and learning over time. Analysis suggests that providing a relevant yet revisable design problem, giving instruction about design process as iterative, and problematizing a model of design process supported students in taking ownership over the framing of the problem; students were motivated to pose questions and gathered information purposefully, thereby learning in the process.},

Among the implications of the model are the following: (a) CAD tools should be extended to represent the state of the design at more abstract levels, (b) CAD tools should help the designer manage constraints, and (c) CAD tools should be designed to give cognitive support to the designer.},

Every advance, or change of direction, in the design process is the result of the designer's judgement. But the notion o f judgement is somewhat elusive. What is it? How can we know whether a judgement is good or bad? Can judgement be taught and if so when and how? This paper attempts to answer at least in part these questions. It draws on the work of Sir Geoffrey Vickers, seeking to adapt and relate his ideas on judgement to engineering design. It constructs aframework for design in which judgements are made in three knowledge domains; the formative, the commercial and the instrumental. It then considers the efficacy of contemporary academe and industry in developing the capacity for judgement in the neophyte engineer.

However, it is unclear how students learn to generate these frames effectively, particularly in relation to ethical decision-making and selecting appropriate constraints. In this study, undergraduate and graduate industrial design students at a large Midwestern United States university participated in a one-day workshop that focused on designing products for natives of sub-Saharan Africa to sell in their home nations. Participants (n=100) worked in 21 teams to generate a range of constraints and problem statements while being scaffolded by instructions, research materials and worksheets. Teams struggled to identify specific use contexts and users, even though these elements were present in relatively complex form in provided research materials. Students appeared to build distance between their own experiences and that of users they were designing for, leading to little awareness of the ethical and normative commitments that were reified in their problem statements and solutions. Implications for the explicit development of an ethically aware design character in design education are considered.},

In this article, I will focus on the question of whether the current design paradigm is capable of delivering on these expectations, or whether design is overextended when dealing with areas of great complexity, such as in the social realm. The fact that at its core, design reasoning or design abduction requires the consideration of two unknowns more or less simultaneously (the “what” and the “how”) puts a heavy strain on our human cognitive limitations in the best of times—and doubly so in highly complex problem situations. Over the years, expert designers have developed an elaborate array of coping strategies to contend with this issue. All of these help to a degree, but the fundamental issue remains. Design might be limiting itself by approaching complex problem situations through a ‘problem solving’ perspective. In this article, a radically different approach is explored, which takes the complex nature of the problem situation as its starting point, and reframes the task of design as system transformation, rather than the creation of a solution. An example from practice illustrates this new design paradigm.},

However, further clarification and development of the theory and terminology of framing are needed in order to understand and support the rather complex framing process that the design team engages in during the early phases of innovation. There is a need to understand how design teams move from an overall framing of the wicked problem, in literature termed the “ problem frame,” to creating a meaningful solution. Through in-depth case studies of the framing processes at five design companies, we learn how designers use the overall problem frame as a stepping-stone to constructing a set of “ solution frames” in order to move toward a meaningful solution that integrates different perspectives. Together with the problem frame these sets of additional solution frames constitute an overall framing of the meaningful product—a “ meaning frame.” This overall meaning frame clarifies and sets the boundaries, the values and goals, and the criteria for evaluation of a proposed solution. As such, the study sheds light on the otherwise hidden reasoning process of framing toward a meaningful solution, rather than framing the problem, which a majority of current literature discusses.},

Through taking advantage of recent advances in image-to-image translation by generative adversarial networks (GANs), marked improvement in designers efficiency is now possible. Considering both randomness and controllability in the design process, this article presents a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework for fashion design. Under this framework, a sketch-generation module which is based on latent space is firstly introduced for designing various sketches. Secondly, a rendering-generation module is proposed to learn mapping between textures and sketches to complete the task of fashion design. In order to achieve effectiveness in synthesizing semantic-aware textures on sketches, a multi-conditional feature interaction module is developed in the rendering-generation model. Moreover, two different training schemes are introduced to optimize both the sketch-generation module and the rendering-generation module. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed models, we built a large-scale dataset which consists of 115,584 pairs of fashion item images. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and indicate that our model can facilitate designers design process by taking full advantage of the controllability of different conditions (e.g., sketch and texture) and the randomness of latent space.},

The first is called the goal reformulation failure mode and occurs when designers reformulate the goal of the client in a design task and give design solutions that solve the reformulated goal but not the original goal. The second is called the frame failure mode and occurs when designers propose a frame for the design task that cannot be accepted by the client. The analysis of framing and its failure modes is aimed at better understanding this design practice and provides a first step towards arriving at criteria that successful applications of framing should meet. The description and the failure modes are illustrated by critically considering an initially successful case of framing, namely the redesign of the Kings Cross entertainment district in Sydney.},

We investigate the intersection of these domains, and show how the language of superpowers can be used to characterize existing visualization systems and suggest opportunities for new and empowering ones. We introduce two frameworks: The ﬁrst characterizes seven underlying mechanisms that form the basis for a variety of visual superpowers portrayed in ﬁction. The second identiﬁes seven ways in which visualization tools and interfaces can instill a sense of empowerment in the people who use them. Building on these observations, we illustrate a diverse set of “visualization superpowers” and highlight opportunities for the visualization community to create new systems and interactions that empower new experiences with data.},

It is an action oriented cycle that people continually and fairly automatically go through in order to integrate experiences into their understanding of the world around them. A frame is an active perspective that both describes and perceptually changes a given situation. A frame is, simplistically, a point of view; often, and particularly in technical situations, this point of view is deemed “irrelevant” or “biasing” because it implicitly references a non-objective way of considering a situation or idea. But a frame – while certainly subjective and often biasing – is of critical use to the designer, as it is something that is shaped over the long-term aggregation of thoughts and experiences, through the above process of sensemaking, and is therefore a larger way of viewing the world and situations that occur in it. Like a point of view, a frame too will change, but will change over the long-term rather than the short term.},

However, no study has examined individuals’ creative performance under an instruction to diverge from given examples, when these examples are formulated with a high level of abstraction. In the present study, we show that (a) instructing participants to avoid using common examples when formulated with a high level of specificity increases fixation; whereas (b) instructing participants to avoid such examples while using a more abstract level for stating these common examples—such as a categorization of these examples—mitigates fixation and doubles the number of creative ideas generated.

            Using examples to inspire designers to generate more innovative design solutions is a widely adopted methodology for design support, while inappropriate use of examples may simultaneously lead to design fixation. Once a designer falls into “design fixation” in the design process, the novelty of generated design solutions will not be satisfactory. Numerous prior studies have explored the usage of examples in the design process, while ignoring the importance of the background knowledge possessed by the designer. In this study, we performed a series of designer-involved experiments (N = 57) to explore the sources of design fixation and the factors that influence the level of fixation. From the experimental results, we found: (1) the shallow sources of design fixation are the example stimuli and the deeper sources are the previous design solutions that use the same design features. (2) Fixation-design features linkage diagrams could show the connection between design solutions. (3) For novice designers, using broad-type design features other than focused-type design features in the design processes can lead to better design performance. (4) Design-type knowledge contributes more to design innovation when no examples are provided, while engineering-type knowledge performs better when a model example is provided. These results not only show a strong link between design features and design fixation but also present the importance of professional background for design fixation. This study lays the foundation for proposing various targeted design methods to help designers mitigate fixation.},

Some studies suggest constraints may have a positive impact on creativity while others find a negative impact. In an effort to clarify this debate and provide direction for future efforts, this meta-analysis examined the relationship between constraints and creativity. Using a sample of 111 published and unpublished studies, a series of random-effects meta-regression models and subgroup analyses were conducted and identified a significant positive relationship between constraints and creativity. Moderator analyses confirmed the relationship differed substantially depending on the constraint type, study design, funding status, and creativity operationalization and measurement. These findings suggest that constraints may not be detrimental to creativity, despite prior assumptions. Findings further suggest that constraint type may be less influential than typically assumed. Instead, methodological artifacts provide a better explanation for the varying existing findings in how constraints benefit or hinder creativity.

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown the value of introducing cognitive supports to encourage the development of creative ability, and researchers have developed a variety of methods to aid in generating ideas. However, design students often struggle to explore more ideas after their initial ideas are exhausted. In this study, an empirically validated tool for idea generation, called Design Heuristics, was introduced as a means of productively pushing past creative exhaustion in an industrial design course at a large Midwestern university. Students worked on a simple design task on their own, generating an average of 6.1 concepts in a 30-min session; then, after 10 min of instruction on the Design Heuristics tool, students generated an average of 2.8 additional concepts for the same task using Design Heuristics for an additional 30 min. The concepts created in this second session using Design Heuristics were rated as higher in novelty, speciﬁcity and relevance. These results suggest that students beneﬁt from introducing support tools following a period of working on their own ideas. Once their own ideas are exhausted, students may be more open to using and learning from support tools, and these tools may support skill development while producing higher quality outcomes.},

By dividing examples into high-, medium- and low-novel ideas, experiment 1 revealed that idea originality was more enhanced in the high-novel example group than in the low-novel example and none example groups (control group). The low-novel group showed higher idea fluency and flexibility than the control group. In experiment 2, participants were divided into high-creative and low-creative groups. Both groups received diverse and similar examples with high novelty. Results showed that idea fluency, originality and flexibility were higher in the high-creative group than those in the low-creative group. Moreover, diverse ex­ amples facilitated fluency and flexibility while similar examples facilitated originality after creative exhaustion. These findings indicate that example features affect the stimulation effect of example after creative exhaustion.},

The theoretical points are grounded in empirical findings about the role of constraints in creativity and in particular by a distinction between two functions of constraints: exclusionary and focusing. The practical points suggest best practices for the cultivation of cre­ ative skills in students, and include a four-step guiding instructional framework. Illustrations of areas in education where constraints play an especially pronounced role in creativity are struc­ tured from a broader level of analysis (content knowledge and skills, domain specificity, curricular standards, and discovery learning), to more specific teaching tools (rubrics, the use of examples, and class activities). Although both a school setting and constraints may appear to inhibit creativity, we argue it is possible to promote creativity in the classroom. One way to do so is for educators to implement constraint-based strategies to develop student creativity.},

Through an experimental study grounded in cognitive psychology, this work examined the inﬂuence of precedents on the novelty, variety, quality, and utility of design solutions devised through an iterative design process involving groups of participants. Another tested hypothesis was whether incremental changes of requirements improve novelty. Results show that precedents did not increase solution novelty and quality, but improved utility. Precedents reduced design feature variety as solutions converged toward a few dominant designs. Incremental modiﬁcation of requirements did not increase novelty. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper combines evidence from new empirical data on the perception of drawings with interviews with expert designers and research on expertise from other cognitive ﬁelds.

To support our analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users’ interactions, and (iii) collected data of participants’ impressions. Our prototype conﬁrms that agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants’ engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment. Finally, participants beneﬁted from our expressive toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.},

We use the concept of Visual Information Flow (VIF), which is the underlying semantic structure that links graphical elements to convey the information and story to the user. To explore VIF, we collected a repository of over 13K infographics. We use a deep neural network to identify visual elements related to information, agnostic to their various artistic appearances. We construct the VIF by automatically chaining these visual elements together based on Gestalt principles. Using this analysis, we characterize the VIF design space by a taxonomy of 12 different design patterns. Exploring in a real-world infographic dataset, we discuss the design space and potentials of VIF in light of this taxonomy.},

First, we conducted a workshop with 9 data story experts to understand the possible benefits of eliciting negative emotions in serious data stories and 19 potential design methods that contribute to negative emotions. Based on the findings from the workshop, we then conducted a lab study with 35 participants to explore the outcomes of eliciting negative emotions as well as the effectiveness of the design methods. The results indicated that negative emotions mainly facilitated contemplative experiences and long-term memory. Besides, the design methods showed varied effectiveness in augmenting negative emotions and being recalled.},

	abstract = {Continuous ‘pseudocolor’ maps visualize how a quantitative attribute varies smoothly over space. These maps are widely used by experts and lay citizens alike for communicating scientiﬁc and geographical data. A critical challenge for designers of these maps is selecting a color scheme that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. Although there exist empirically grounded guidelines for color choice in segmented maps (e.g., choropleths), continuous maps are signiﬁcantly understudies, and their color-coding guidelines are largely based on expert opinion and design heuristics—many of these guidelines have yet to be veriﬁed experimentally. We conducted a series of crowdsourced experiments to investigate how the perception of continuous maps is affected by colormap characteristics and spatial frequency (a measure of data complexity). We ﬁnd that spatial frequency signiﬁcantly impacts the effectiveness of color encodes, but the precise effect is task-dependent. While rainbow schemes afforded the highest accuracy in quantity estimation irrespective of spatial complexity, divergent colormaps signiﬁcantly outperformed other schemes in tasks requiring the perception of high-frequency patterns. We interpret these results in relation to current practices, and devise new and more granular guidelines for color mapping in continuous maps.},

To help identify crime patterns, a Spatial Temporal Visualization (STV) system was designed to integrate a synchronized view of three types of visualization techniques: a GIS view, a timeline view and a periodic pattern view.

Within the set of all possible tree visualization techniques, we identify a subset of techniques that are both “unit-decomposable” and “axis-decomposable” (terms we deﬁne). For tree visualizations within this subset, GoTree gives the user ﬂexible and ﬁne-grained control over the parameters of the techniques, supporting both explicit and implicit tree visualizations. We developed Tree Illustrator, an interactive authoring tool based on GoTree grammar. Tree Illustrator allows users to create a considerable number of tree visualizations, including not only existing techniques but also undiscovered and hybrid visualizations. We demonstrate the expressiveness and generative power of GoTree with a gallery of examples and conduct a qualitative study to validate the usability of Tree Illustrator.},

In our work, we leverage the body and physical action as an engaging platform for learning through live physiological sensing and visualization (LPSV). Prior research suggests the potential of this approach, but was limited to single-session evaluations in informal environments. In this paper, we examine LPSV tools in a classroom environment during a four-day deployment. To highlight the complex interconnections between space, teachers, curriculum, and tool use, we analyze our data through the lens of Activity Theory. Our findings show the importance of integrating model-based representations for supporting exploration and analytic representations for scaffolding scientific inquiry. Activity Theory highlights leveraging life-relevant connections available within a physical space and considering policies and norms related to learners’ physical bodies.},

Existing techniques, such as zoom-and-pan on a 2D plane and hyperbolic browser facilitate large graph exploration by showing both the details of a focal area and its surrounding context that guides the exploration process. However, existing techniques for large graph exploration are limited in either providing too little context or presenting graphs with too much distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel focus+context technique, iSphere, to address the limitation. iSphere maps a large graph onto a Riemann Sphere that better preserves graph structures and shows greater context information. We conduct extensive experiment studies on different graph exploration tasks under various conditions. The results show that iSphere performs the best in task completion time compared to the baseline techniques in link and path exploration tasks. This research also contributes to understanding large graph exploration on small screens.},

We present DataQuilt, a novel system that enables visualization authors to iteratively design pictorial visualizations as collages. Real images (e.g., paintings, photographs, sketches) act as both inspiration and as a resource of visual elements that can be mapped to data. The creative pipeline involves the semi-guided extraction of relevant elements of an image (arbitrary regions, regular shapes, color palettes, textures) aided by computer vision techniques; the binding of these graphical elements and their features to data in order to create meaningful visualizations; and the iterative reﬁnement of both features and visualizations through direct manipulation. We demonstrate the usability of DataQuilt in a controlled study and its expressiveness through a collection of authored visualizations from a second open-ended study.},

Accordingly, there has been an increasing interest in exploring how to retrieve perceptually similar visualizations from a large corpus, since it can beneft various downstream applications such as visualization recommendation. Existing methods mainly focus on the visual appearance of visualizations by regarding them as bitmap images. However, the structural information intrinsically existing in SVG-based visualizations is ignored. Such structural information can delineate the spatial and hierarchical relationship among visual elements, and characterize visualizations thoroughly from a new perspective. This paper presents a structureaware method to advance the performance of visualization retrieval by collectively considering both the visual and structural information. We extensively evaluated our approach through quantitative comparisons, a user study and case studies. The results demonstrate the efectiveness of our approach and its advantages over existing methods.},

These resulting bivariate maps can be difﬁcult to interpret, and interference between visual channels can reduce the discriminability of marks. To address this issue, we contribute ValueSuppressing Uncertainty Palettes (VSUPs). VSUPs allocate larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. This non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more economical use of the limited visual encoding space when uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decisionmaking when uncertainty is high. We demonstrate several examples of VSUPs, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that, compared to traditional bivariate maps, VSUPs encourage people to more heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.},

Inspired by the success of probabilistic programming languages, PGoG makes probability expressions, such as P(A{\textbar}B), a ﬁrstclass citizen in the language. PGoG abstractions also reﬂect the distinction between probability and frequency framing, a concept from the uncertainty communication literature. It is expressive, encompassing product plots, density plots, icon arrays, and dotplots, among other visualizations. Its coherent syntax ensures correctness (that the proportions of visual elements and their spatial placement reﬂect the underlying probability distribution) and reduces edit distance between probabilistic visualization speciﬁcations, potentially supporting more design exploration. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of PGoG in R.},

The key idea behind projection boxes is to start with a full semantics of the program, and then use projections to pick a subset of the semantics to display. By varying the projection used, projection boxes can encode both previously known visualization techniques, and also new ones. As such, projection boxes provide an expressive and conﬁgurable framework for displaying runtime information. Through a user study we demonstrate that (1) users ﬁnd projection boxes and their conﬁgurability useful (2) users are not distracted by the always-on visualization (3) a key driving force behind the need for a conﬁgurable visualization for live programming lies with the wide variation in programmer preferences.},

To address these issues, we design and implement ATMSeer, an interactive visualization tool that supports users in refining the search space of AutoML and analyzing the results. To guide the design of ATMSeer, we derive a workflow of using AutoML based on interviews with machine learning experts. A multi-granularity visualization is proposed to enable users to monitor the AutoML process, analyze the searched models, and refine the search space in real time. We demonstrate the utility and usability of ATMSeer through two case studies, expert interviews, and a user study with 13 end users.},

Based on the identiﬁcation results and search requests, each descriptive sentence is displayed beside the described focal areas as annotations. Different sentences are presented in various scenes of the generated animation to promote a vivid step-by-step presentation. With a user-customized style, the animation can guide the audience’s attention via proper highlighting such as emphasizing speciﬁc features or isolating part of the data. We demonstrate the utility and usability of our method through a user study with various use cases.},

Even though past empirical research provides foundational knowledge for visualization design, practitioners still rely on their hunches to deal with intricate trade-ofs in the wild. On the other hand, researchers lack the time and resources to rigorously explore the growing design space through controlled experiments. In this work, we aim to address this two-fold problem by crowdsourcing visualization experiments. We developed VisLab, an online platform in which anyone can design and deploy experiments to evaluate their visualizations. To alleviate the complexity of experiment design and analysis, our platform provides scafold templates and analytic dashboards. To motivate broad participation in the experiments, the platform enables anonymous participation and provides personalized performance feedback. We present use case scenarios that demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the platform in addressing the diferent needs of practitioners, researchers, and educators.},

From these observations, we identify trends in the use of physical models in architecture, which have the potential to inform the design of data physicalizations. We identify four functions of architectural modeling that can be directly adapted for use in the process of building rich data models. Finally, we discuss how the visualization community can apply observations from architecture to the design of new data physicalizations.},

Users can personalize the NLI with new commands using direct manipulation, known commands, or by combining both.

We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user’s ability to recall and understand the data. We ﬁnd that participants who are prompted to reﬂect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when participants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data. We characterize the design space of graphical prediction and feedback techniques and describe design recommendations.},

We introduce PredictMe, a tool for belief-driven visual analysis, enabling users to draw and test their beliefs against data, as an alternative to data-driven exploration. PredictMe combines belief elicitation with traditional visualization interactions to support mixed analysis styles. In a comparative study, we investigated how these afordances impact participants’ cognition. Results show that PredictMe prompts participants to incorporate their working knowledge more frequently in queries. Participants were more likely to attend to discrepancies between their mental models and the data. However, those same participants were also less likely to engage in interactions associated with exploration, and ultimately inspected fewer visualizations and made fewer discoveries. The results suggest that belief elicitation may moderate exploratory behaviors, instead nudging users to be more deliberate in their analysis. We discuss the implications for visualization design.},

Through an iterative design process with expert machine learning researchers and practitioners, we designed a visual analytics system, Gamut, to explore how interactive interfaces could better support model interpretation. Using Gamut as a probe, we investigated why and how professional data scientists interpret models, and how interface affordances can support data scientists in answering questions about model interpretability. Our investigation showed that interpretability is not a monolithic concept: data scientists have different reasons to interpret models and tailor explanations for specific audiences, often balancing competing concerns of simplicity and completeness. Participants also asked to use Gamut in their work, highlighting its potential to help data scientists understand their own data.},

We investigated whether visualizing the uncertainty associated with sensor measurements improves the quality of users’ inference. We tested four visualizations with increasingly detailed representation of uncertainty.

We found that uncertainty information improves users’ estimates, especially if sensors differ largely in their associated variability. Improvements were larger for information-rich visualizations.

	abstract = {We present Fitster, a social visualization interface that supports fitness motivation among busy people struggling to exercise. Among our pilot group of busy graduate students, we found that a popular time-saving strategy is to recast exercise in terms of everyday, informal activities. Fitster employs pedometer data to support activity tracking, goal setting, and motivation through virtual competitions and teamwork. It contributes to the human-computer interaction (HCI) and health domains by identifying a new facet of exercise behavior and by offering a lightweight social interface to promote fitness motivation and enjoyment.},

This is based on the Weiserian assumption that people will be inclined to distribute their work across multiple “pads” if such are available. We observed that this is not the reality today, even when devices were in abundance. We present a study with 24 participants in 12 dyads completing a collaborative visualization task with up to six tablets. They could choose between three different visualization types to answer questions about economic data. Tasks were designed to afford simultaneous use of tablets, either with linked or independent views. We found that users typically utilized only one tablet per user. A quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a “legacy bias” that introduced barriers for using more tablets and reduced the overall beneﬁt of multi-device visualization.},

We present a series of crowdsourced experiments that assess the accuracy of trends estimated using regression by eye across a variety of bivariate visualizations, and examine potential sources of bias in these estimations. We ﬁnd that viewers accurately estimate trends in many standard visualizations of bivariate data, but that both visual features (e.g., “within-thebar” bias) and data features (e.g., the presence of outliers) can result in visual estimates that systematically diverge from standard least-squares regression models.},

Monitoring participant compliance with respect to multi-modal data can be a tedious process, especially if there are only a few personnel involved. In this case study, we describe the iterative design of an interactive visualization system we developed for monitoring compliance and refned based on changing requirements in an ongoing study. We fnd that the visualization system, leveraging the digital medium, both facilitates the exploratory tasks of monitoring participant compliance and supports asynchronous collaboration among non-co-located researchers. Our documented requirements for checking participant compliance as well as the design of the visualization system can help inform the compliancemonitoring process in future studies.},

Visualization techniques can facilitate the understanding of relationships among these data sets.

Our analysis is informed both by research progress and by our own experience in an ongoing industrial case study on modelling and mapping underground assets, where it would appear that uncertainty plays a major role. In this case study, we try to identify promoting and limiting factors. We conclude that the value of uncertainty visualization is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data itself, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the depiction of this data can generate. We hope to broaden the discussion on the utility of uncertainty in visualization from the purely technical and perceptual issues to social and organizational factors.},

	abstract = {Remote collaboration can be more difﬁcult than collocated collaboration for a number of reasons, including the inability to easily determine what your collaborator is looking at. This impedes a pair’s ability to efﬁciently communicate about on-screen locations and makes synchronous coordination difﬁcult. We designed a novel gaze visualization for remote pair programmers which shows where in the code their partner is currently looking, and changes color when they are looking at the same thing. Our design is unobtrusive, and transparently depicts the imprecision inherent in eye tracking technology. We evaluated our design with an experiment in which pair programmers worked remotely on code refactoring tasks. Our results show that with the visualization, pairs spent a greater proportion of their time concurrently looking at the same code locations. Pairs communicated using a larger ratio of implicit to explicit references, and were faster and more successful at responding to those references.},

T-Cal also incorporates a number of analytical techniques for disentangling interleaving conversations, extracting keywords, and estimating sentiment. The design of T-Cal is based on an iterative user-centered design process including interview studies, requirements gathering, initial prototypes demonstration, and evaluation with domain users.

However, there have been few attempts to empirically demonstrate whether adding interaction to a static visualization improves its function beyond popular beliefs. In this paper, we address this gap. We use a classic Bayesian reasoning task as a testbed for evaluating whether allowing users to interact with a static visualization can improve their reasoning. Through two crowdsourced studies, we show that adding interaction to a static Bayesian reasoning visualization does not improve participants’ accuracy on a Bayesian reasoning task. In some cases, it can signifcantly detract from it. Moreover, we demonstrate that underlying visualization design modulates performance and that people with high versus low spatial ability respond diferently to diferent interaction techniques and underlying base visualizations. Our work suggests that interaction is not as unambiguously good as we often believe; a well designed static visualization can be as, if not more, efective than an interactive one.},

Visualization techniques are currently being employed to help integrate quantitative and qualitative data. Despite that, two existing challenges are to determine the level of detail to be presented to developers based on their needs and to effectively communicate the collected data so that informed design changes can be reached. In this paper, we first propose an aggregated visualization technique that makes use of clustering, territory tessellation, and trajectory aggregation to simultaneously display mixed playtesting data. Secondly, to assess the usefulness of our technique we evaluate it through interviews with professional game developers and compare it to a non-aggregated visualization. The results of this study also provide an important contribution towards identifying areas of improvement in the portrayal of gameplay data.},

While there are established research fields within HCI for visualizing specific use cases of a smart home, studies targeting user demands on visualizations spanning across multiple use cases are rare. Especially, individual data-related demands pose a challenge for usable visualizations. To investigate potentials of an end-user development (EUD) approach for flexibly supporting such demands, we developed a smart home system featuring both pre-defined visualizations and a visualization creation tool. To evaluate our concept, we installed our prototype in 12 households as part of a Living Lab study. Results are based on three interview studies, a design workshop and system log data. We identified eight overarching interests in home data and show how participants used pre-defined visualizations to get an overview and the creation tool to not only address specific use cases but also to answer questions by creating temporary visualizations.},

In this paper we present examples of visualizations where this y-axis truncation can be beneﬁcial as well as harmful, depending on the communicative and analytic intent. We also present the results of a series of crowd-sourced experiments in which we examine how y-axis truncation impacts subjective effect size across visualization types, and we explore alternative designs that more directly alert viewers to this truncation. We ﬁnd that the subjective impact of axis truncation is persistent across visualizations designs, even for designs with explicit visual cues that indicate truncation has taken place. We suggest that designers consider the scale of the meaningful effect sizes and variation they intend to communicate, regardless of the visual encoding.},

It is widely argued that the most common manner to deal with data bias is to rebalance biased datasets. Unfortunately, rebalancing is not an aseptic transformation, so it leads to several potentially undesired side-effects such as altering the distribution of the data or lowering the overall accuracy.},

	abstract = {It can be difficult to identify trends and perform quality control in large, high-dimensional fMRI or omics datasets. To remedy this, we develop ImageNomer, a data visualization and analysis tool that allows inspection of both subject-level and cohort-level features. The tool allows visualization of phenotype correlation with functional connectivity (FC), partial connectivity (PC), dictionary components (PCA and our own method), and genomic data (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs). In addition, it allows visualization of weights from arbitrary ML models. ImageNomer is built with a Python backend and a Vue frontend. We validate ImageNomer using the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset, which contains multitask fMRI and SNP data of healthy adolescents. Using correlation, greedy selection, or model weights, we find that a set of 10 FC features can explain 15\% of variation in age, compared to 35\% for the full 34,716 feature model. The four most significant FCs are either between bilateral default mode network (DMN) regions or spatially proximal subcortical areas. Additionally, we show that whereas both FC (fMRI) and SNPs (genomic) features can account for 10-15\% of intelligence variation, this predictive ability disappears when controlling for race. We find that FC features can be used to predict race with 85\% accuracy, compared to 78\% accuracy for sex prediction. Using ImageNomer, this work casts doubt on the possibility of finding unbiased intelligence-related features in fMRI and SNPs of healthy adolescents.},

To reduce these accidents, a new technology that can detect rip currents and notify beachgoers by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) was proposed. However, studies on the effect of visualizing rip currents or considering the effect of optimism bias have not been conducted. This study investigates if visualization of rip currents might help in preventing drowning accidents, while considering the effect of optimism bias. The participants were 90 Japanese beachgoers. They were asked to answer questions based on their knowledge of the beach and rip currents, their optimism bias regarding rip currents, and awareness with or without visualization. The results of the analyses suggest that despite optimism bias, the visualization of rip currents increases the tendency of beachgoers to perceive and avoid rip currents. As described above, it was found that by visualizing the rip current, beachgoers were able to perceive and avoid rip currents. In addition, an understanding of rip currents is positively related to the intent to avoid rip currents even when rip currents are visualized. Therefore, it is necessary not only to enhance the avoidance tendency by visualizing rip currents, but also to further enhance knowledge of beachgoers to deepen the understanding of rip currents including the danger associated and methods to avoid them.},

	abstract = {We present a topic modelling and data visualization methodology to examine gender-based disparities in news articles by topic. Existing research in topic modelling is largely focused on the text mining of closed corpora, i.e., those that include a fixed collection of composite texts. We showcase a methodology to discover topics via Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which can reliably produce human-interpretable topics over an open news corpus that continually grows with time. Our system generates topics, or distributions of keywords, for news articles on a monthly basis, to consistently detect key events and trends aligned with events in the real world. Findings from 2 years worth of news articles in mainstream English-language Canadian media indicate that certain topics feature either women or men more prominently and exhibit different types of language. Perhaps unsurprisingly, topics such as lifestyle, entertainment, and healthcare tend to be prominent in articles that quote more women than men. Topics such as sports, politics, and business are characteristic of articles that quote more men than women. The data shows a self-reinforcing gendered division of duties and representation in society. Quoting female sources more frequently in a caregiving role and quoting male sources more frequently in political and business roles enshrines women’s status as caregivers and men’s status as leaders and breadwinners. Our results can help journalists and policy makers better understand the unequal gender representation of those quoted in the news and facilitate news organizations’ efforts to achieve gender parity in their sources. The proposed methodology is robust, reproducible, and scalable to very large corpora, and can be used for similar studies involving unsupervised topic modelling and language analyses.},

	abstract = {A viewer's existing beliefs can prevent accurate reasoning with data visualizations. In particular, confirmation bias can cause people to overweigh information that confirms their beliefs, and dismiss information that disconfirms them. We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowdworkers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. We created two scenarios, one in which we primed people with a belief before asking them to make a decision, and another in which people held pre-existing beliefs. The data was presented as either a table, a bar table, or a bar chart. To correctly solve the problem, participants should use a complex reasoning strategy to compare two ratios, each between two pairs of values. But participants could also be tempted to use simpler, superficial heuristics, shortcuts, or biased strategies to reason about the problem. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. These findings suggest that data presentation formats can affect affordances for reasoning.},

Recent research suggests that cognitive biases, like numerical anchoring, transfers to visual analytics in the form of visual anchoring. However, it is unclear how visualization users can be visually anchored and how the anchors affect decision-making. To investigate, we performed a between-subjects laboratory experiment with 94 participants to analyze the effects of visual anchors and strategy cues using a visual analytics system. The decision-making task was to identify misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned to conditions that modified the scenario video (visual anchor) and/or strategy cues provided. Our findings suggest that such interventions affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy. We discuss implications of our results on the forking paths problem and raise concerns on how visualization researchers train users to avoid unintentionally anchoring users and affecting the end result.},

Related work in this area has tended to focus on the human’s analytic and sensemaking processes.

Consequently, this source of error may have a negative impact on decision making.

In this paper, we present our approach (and ﬁndings) to answering these questions. First, we introduce Beagle, which mines the web for SVG-based visualizations and automatically classiﬁes them by type (i.e., bar, pie, etc.). With Beagle, we extract over 41,000 visualizations across ﬁve different tools and repositories, and classify them with 85\% accuracy, across 24 visualization types. Given this visualization collection, we study usage across tools. We ﬁnd that most visualizations fall under four types: bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, and geographic maps. Though controversial, pie charts are relatively rare for the visualization tools that were studied. Our ﬁndings also suggest that the total visualization types supported by a given tool could factor into its ease of use. However this effect appears to be mitigated by providing a variety of diverse expert visualization examples to users.},

We present Cicero, a declarative grammar for concisely specifying responsive visualization transformations which paves the way for more intelligent responsive visualization authoring tools. Cicero’s fexible specifer syntax allows authors to select visualization elements to transform, independent of the source view’s structure. Cicero encodes a concise set of actions to encode a diverse set of transformations in both desktop-frst and mobile-frst design processes. Authors can ultimately reuse design-agnostic transformations across diferent visualizations. To demonstrate the utility of Cicero, we develop a compiler to an extended version of Vega-Lite, and provide principles for our compiler. We further discuss the incorporation of Cicero into responsive visualization authoring tools, such as a design recommender.},

	abstract = {While seamful design has been part of discourses and work within HCI contexts for some time, it has not yet been fully explored in data visualization design. At the same time, critics of visualization have been arguing that the representation of data as contextual, contingent, relational, partial, heterogeneous, and situated is currently lacking in visualization. Seamful visualization promises a fresh perspective on visualization design as we seek to fnd more expressive encodings and novel approaches to representing data that acknowledge their wider qualities and limitations. By consulting seams in other realms and exploring existing seams and seamfulness in visualization, this paper ofers a foundation for conceptualizing seamful visualization, points towards the value of seams and seamfulness in critical visualization, and proposes principles for engaging with seamful visualization in practice and research.},

	abstract = {In remote collaboration, gaze visualizations are designed to display where collaborators are looking in a shared visual space. This type of gaze-based intervention can improve coordination, however researchers have yet to fully explore different gaze visualization techniques and develop a deeper understanding of the ways in which features of visualizations may interact with task attributes to inﬂuence collaborative performance. There are many ways to visualize characteristics of eye movements, such as a path connecting ﬁxation points or a heat map illustrating ﬁxation duration and coverage. In this study, we designed and evaluated three unique gaze visualizations in a remote search task. Our results suggest that the design of gaze visualizations affects performance, coordination, searching behavior, and perceived utility. Additionally, the degree of task coupling further inﬂuences the effect of gaze visualizations on performance and coordination. We then reﬂect on the value of gaze visualizations for remote work and discuss implications for the design of gaze-based interventions.},

	abstract = {Clinical practice is heavily reliant on the use of unstructured text to document patient stories due to its expressive and ﬂexible nature. However, a physician’s capacity to recover information from text for clinical overview is severely affected when records get longer and time pressure increases. Data visualization strategies have been explored to aid in information retrieval by replacing text with graphical summaries, though often at the cost of omitting important text features. This causes physician mistrust and limits real-world adoption. This work presents our investigation into the role and use of text in clinical practice, and reports on efforts to assess the best of both worlds—text and visualization—to facilitate clinical overview. We report on insights garnered from a ﬁeld study, and the lessons learned from an iterative design process and evaluation of a text-visualization prototype, MedStory, with 14 medical professionals. The results led to a number of grounded design recommendations to guide visualization design to support clinical text overview.},

However, little research to date has focused on what analysts value in the design of visualization recommendations. We interviewed 18 analysts in the public health sector and explored how they made sense of a popular in-domain dataset1 in service of generating visualizations to recommend to others. We also explored how they interacted with a corpus of both automaticallyand manually-generated visualization recommendations, with the goal of uncovering how the design values of these analysts are reflected in current visualization recommendation systems. We find that analysts champion simple charts with clear takeaways that are nonetheless connected with existing semantic information or domain hypotheses. We conclude by recommending that visualization recommendation designers explore ways of integrating context and expectation into their systems.},

In this user study, the domain for these activities is network intrusion detection (ID). User-centered design methods have been widely used for many years, however, innovative IV displays are often developed with limited consideration of user needs in the context of real-life problems. While it can be argued that this is required to generate creative new solutions, the resulting tools often do not support actual users in their daily work. Several IV tools have been developed to support ID, but there is little evidence that these solutions address the needs of the users. We studied ID analysts’ daily activities in order to understand their routine work practices and the need for designing IV tools. We developed a three-phase process model that frames corresponding requirements for IV tools. This model significantly extends the scope of contemporary IV for ID tools in novel ways.},

We contribute (1) a method for deriving transition costs via a partial ordering of edit operations and the solution of a resulting linear program, and (2) a global weighting term that rewards consistency across transition subsequences. In a controlled experiment, subjects rated visualization sequences covering a taxonomy of common transition types. In all but one case, GraphScape’s highest-ranked suggestion aligns with subjects’ top-rated sequences. Finally, we demonstrate applications of GraphScape to automatically sequence visualization presentations, elaborate transition paths between visualizations, and recommend design alternatives (e.g., to improve scalability while minimizing design changes).},

While prior work has explored generating quality feedback, our work helps a designer interpret that feedback. Through a formative study with professional designers (N=10), we discovered that the interpretation process includes categorizing feedback, identifying valuable feedback, and prioritizing which feedback to incorporate in a revision. We also found that designers leverage feedback topic and sentiment, and the status of the provider to aid interpretation. Based on the ﬁndings, we created a new tool (Decipher) that enables designers to visualize and navigate a collection of feedback using its topic and sentiment structure. In a preliminary evaluation (N=20), we found that Decipher helped users feel less overwhelmed during feedback interpretation tasks and better attend to critical issues and conﬂicting opinions compared to using a typical document-editing tool.},

In visualization pedagogy, design studies are often introduced but rarely practiced due to their large time requirements. This limits students to a classroom curriculum, often involving projects that may not have implications beyond the classroom. Thus we present the Design Study "Lite" Methodology, a novel framework for implementing design studies with novice students in 14 weeks. We utilized the Design Study "Lite" Methodology in conjunction with Service-Learning to teach ﬁve Data Visualization courses and demonstrate that it beneﬁts not only the students but also the community through service to non-proﬁt partners. In this paper, we provide a detailed breakdown of the methodology and how Service-Learning can be incorporated with it. We also include an extensive reﬂection on the methodology and provide recommendations for future applications of the framework for teaching visualization courses and research.},

However, across invocations such recommenders may lack the context of prior results, producing unstable outputs that override earlier design choices. To better balance automated suggestions with user intent, we contribute Dziban, a visualization API that supports both ambiguous speciﬁcation and a novel anchoring mechanism for conveying desired context. Dziban uses the Draco knowledge base to automatically complete partial speciﬁcations and suggest appropriate visualizations. In addition, it extends Draco with chart similarity logic, enabling recommendations that also remain perceptually similar to a provided “anchor” chart. Existing APIs for exploratory visualization, such as ggplot2 and Vega-Lite, require fully speciﬁed chart deﬁnitions. In contrast, Dziban provides a more concise and ﬂexible authoring experience through automated design, while preserving predictability and control through anchored recommendations.},

The framework augments graphic design tools with new concepts and operators, and describes the structure and generation of a variety of visualizations. Based on the framework, we design and implement a visualization authoring system. The system extends interaction techniques in modern vector design tools for direct manipulation of visualization conﬁgurations and parameters.

LightGuider takes predefined quality criteria and the current focus of the designer into account to visualize suggestions for lighting-design improvements via a specialized provenance tree. This provenance tree integrates snapshot visualizations of how well a design meets the given quality criteria weighted by the designer's preferences. This integration facilitates the analysis of quality improvements over the course of a modeling workflow as well as the comparison of alternative design solutions.

However, the actual use of VR learning environments in schools is still in its infancy. A major hurdle that hinders the use of immersive digital media in schools is the lack of guidelines for designing VR learning environments for practical use in schools. Such guidelines need to consider how students interact and learn in VR learning environments and how teachers can use such environments on a day-to-day basis. Using a design-based research approach, we explored the guidelines for creating VR learning content for tenth-grade students in a German secondary school and recreated a real-world, out-of-school VR learning space which can be used for hands-on instruction. This paper investigated how to maximise the experience of spatial presence by creating a VR learning environment in several microcycles. Furthermore, it took a closer look at the influence of the spatial situation model and cognitive involvement on this process. The results were evaluated with ANOVAs and path analyses, showing, for example, that involvement does not influence spatial presence in highly immersive and realistic VR learning environments.},

We propose $^{\textrm{3\$}}$C3 Assignment, a system providing diverse suggestions for interior color design while satisfying general global and local rules including color compatibility, color mood, contrast, and user preference. We extend these constraints from the image domain to \${\textbackslash}mathbb R{\textasciicircum}3\$R3, and formulate 3D interior color design as an optimization problem. The design is accomplished in an omnidirectional manner to ensure a comfortable experience when the inhabitant observes the interior scene from possible positions and directions. We design a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the highly nonlinear optimization problem for interactive applications, and investigate the system performance concerning problem complexity, solver convergence, and suggestion diversity.

The key motivation of this article is to devise a new hybrid, grid-based simulation that could inherit modeling and simulation advantages from both physically-correct simulation methods and powerful data-driven methods, while combating existing difficulties exhibited in both approaches. We first employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the physical parameters of gaseous phenomena in Eulerian settings, then we can use the just-learnt parameters to re-simulate (with or without artists' guidance) for specific scenes with flexible coupling effects. Next, a second CNN is adopted to reconstruct the high-resolution velocity field to guide a fast re-simulation on the finer grid, achieving richer and more realistic details with little extra computational expense. From the perspective of physics-based simulation, our trained networks respect temporal coherence and physical constraints. From the perspective of the data-driven machine-learning approaches, our network design aims at extracting a meaningful parameters and reconstructing visually realistic details. Additionally, our implementation based on parallel acceleration could significantly enhance the computational performance of every involved module. Our comprehensive experiments confirm the controllability, effectiveness, and accuracy of our novel approach when producing various gaseous scenes with rich details for widespread graphics applications.},

By controlling the states of these mechanisms, a designed multi-function furniture object can be reconfigured to approximate the shapes and functions of the given objects. To ensure the designed furniture easy to transform between different functions, we perform an optimization algorithm to choose a proper number of movable boards and determine their shapes and sizes, following a set of design guidelines.

We evaluate how much these two conditions determine the bivariate glyphs' effectiveness. The first experiment asks participants to perform three local tasks requiring reading no more than two glyphs. The second experiment scales up the search space in global tasks when participants must look at the entire scene of hundreds of vector glyphs to get an answer. Our results support that the first condition is necessary for local tasks when a few items are compared. But it is not enough for understanding a large amount of data. The second condition is necessary for perceiving global structures of examining very complex datasets. Participants' comments reveal that the categorical features in the bivariate glyphs trigger emergent optimal viewers' behaviors.

However, manually designing such a physically valid 2D paper pop-up plan is challenging since fold lines must jointly satisfy hard spatial constraints. Existing works on automatic OA-style paper pop-up design all focused on how to generate a pop-up structure that approximates a given target 3D model. This paper presents the first OA-style paper pop-up design framework that takes 2D images instead of 3D models as input. Our work is inspired by the fact that artists often use 2D profiles to guide the design process, thus benefited from the high availability of 2D image resources. Due to the lack of 3D geometry information, we perform novel theoretic analysis to ensure the foldability and stability of the resultant design. Based on a novel graph representation of the paper pop-up plan, we further propose a practical optimization algorithm via mixed-integer programming that jointly optimizes the topology and geometry of the 2D plan. We also allow the user to interactively explore the design space by specifying constraints on fold lines. Finally, we evaluate our framework on various images with interesting 2D shapes.

Our method is unique in that it works directly with shapes and patterns represented by functions, and can engrave patterns through simple function operations. By eliminating the need for remeshing in traditional FEM methods, our method is more computationally efficient in optimizing mechanical properties and can significantly increase the diversity of shell structure design. Quantitative evaluation confirms the convergence of the proposed method.

Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.},

In particular, we construct a reduced stress basis from a small set of shape exemplars and possible external forces. This stress basis is automatically adapted to the current user edited shape on the fly, and thereby offers reliable stress estimation. We then introduce a new finite element discretization scheme to use the reduced basis for fast stress analysis. Our method runs up to two orders of magnitude faster than the full-space finite element analysis, with average L2 estimation errors less than 2 percent and maximum L2 errors less than 6 percent. Furthermore, we build an interactive stress-aware shape editing tool to demonstrate its performance in practice.},

	abstract = {Genomic Epidemiology (genEpi) is a branch of public health that uses many different data types including tabular, network, genomic, and geographic, to identify and contain outbreaks of deadly diseases. Due to the volume and variety of data, it is challenging for genEpi domain experts to conduct data reconnaissance; that is, have an overview of the data they have and make assessments toward its quality, completeness, and suitability. We present an algorithm for data reconnaissance through automatic visualization recommendation, GEViTRec. Our approach handles a broad variety of dataset types and automatically generates visually coherent combinations of charts, in contrast to existing systems that primarily focus on singleton visual encodings of tabular datasets. We automatically detect linkages across multiple input datasets by analyzing non-numeric attribute fields, creating a data source graph within which we analyze and rank paths. For each high-ranking path, we specify chart combinations with positional and color alignments between shared fields, using a gradual binding approach to transform initial partial specifications of singleton charts to complete specifications that are aligned and oriented consistently. A novel aspect of our approach is its combination of domain-agnostic elements with domain-specific information that is captured through a domain-specific visualization prevalence design space. Our implementation is applied to both synthetic data and real Ebola outbreak data. We compare GEViTRec's output to what previous visualization recommendation systems would generate, and to manually crafted visualizations used by practitioners. We conducted formative evaluations with ten genEpi experts to assess the relevance and interpretability of our results.

	abstract = {Information visualization research has developed powerful systems that enable users to author custom data visualizations without textual programming. These systems can support graphics-driven practices by bridging lazy data-binding mechanisms with vector-graphics editing tools. Yet, despite their expressive power, visualization authoring systems often assume that users want to generate visual representations that they already have in mind rather than explore designs. They also impose a data-to-graphics workflow, where binding data dimensions to graphical properties is a necessary step for generating visualization layouts. In this paper, we introduce StructGraphics, an approach for creating data-agnostic and fully reusable visualization designs. StructGraphics enables designers to construct visualization designs by drawing graphics on a canvas and then structuring their visual properties without relying on a concrete dataset or data schema. In StructGraphics, tabular data structures are derived directly from the structure of the graphics. Later, designers can link these structures with real datasets through a spreadsheet user interface. StructGraphics supports the design and reuse of complex data visualizations by combining graphical property sharing, by-example design specification, and persistent layout constraints. We demonstrate the power of the approach through a gallery of visualization examples and reflect on its strengths and limitations in interaction with graphic designers and data visualization experts.},

Developed and applied during a four-year visual data analysis project in criminal intelligence, these documents enabled a series of visualization re-designs to be explored by crime analysts remotely - in a flexible and authentic way. The DExDs were found to engender a level of engagement that is qualitatively distinct from more traditional methods of feedback elicitation, supporting the kind of informed, iterative and design-led feedback that is core to applied visualization research. They also offered a solution to limited and intermittent contact between analyst and visualization researcher and began to address more intractable deficiencies, such as social desirability-bias, common to applied visualization projects. Crucially, DExDs conferred to domain experts greater agency over the design process - collaborators proposed design suggestions, justified with design knowledge, that directly influenced the re-redesigns.

In this article, we focus on the collection of tasks for tree visualizations, a common visual encoding in many domains ranging from biology to computer science to geography. In spite of their commonality, no prior efforts exist to collect and abstractly define tree visualization tasks. We present a literature review of tree visualization articles and generate a curated dataset of over 200 tasks. To enable effective task abstraction for trees, we also contribute a novel extension of the Multi-Level Task Typology to include more specificity to support tree-specific tasks as well as a systematic procedure to conduct task abstractions for tree visualizations. All tasks in the dataset were abstracted with the novel typology extension and analyzed to gain a better understanding of the state of tree visualizations. These abstracted tasks can benefit visualization researchers and practitioners as they design evaluation studies or compare their analytical tasks with ones previously studied in the literature to make informed decisions about their design. We also reflect on our novel methodology and advocate more broadly for the creation of task-based knowledge repositories for different types of visualizations.

This paper presents an intuitive sketching interface that allows the user to interactively place a 3D human character in a sitting position on a chair. Within our framework, the user sketches the target pose as a 2D stick figure and attaches the selected joints to the environment (e.g., the feet on the ground) with a pin tool. As reconstructing the 3D pose from a 2D stick figure is an ill-posed problem due to many possible solutions, the key idea in our paper is to reduce solution space by considering the interaction between the character and environment and adding physics constraints, such as balance and collision. Further, we formulated this reconstruction into a nonlinear optimization problem and solved it via the genetic algorithm (GA) and the quasi-Newton solver. With the GPU implementation, our system is able to generate the physically correct and visually pleasing pose at an interactive speed. The promising experimental results and user study demonstrates the efficacy of our method.},

We aim at planning the motion for the convertible layouts of a scene with the most efficient conversion process. To achieve this, our system first establishes object-level correspondences between the layout of a given source and that of a reference to compute a target layout, where the objects are re-arranged in the source layout with respect to the reference layout. After that, our system initializes the movement paths of objects between the source and target layouts based on various mechanical constraints. A joint space-time optimization is then performed to program a control stream of object translations, rotations, and stops, under which the movements of all objects are efficient and the potential object collisions are avoided. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through various design examples of multi-purpose, indoor scenes with convertible layouts.},

In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is “aligned” with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations.

The technique is flexible and simple to implement, and has the additional advantage that it explicitly enhances coordinated motion and can avoid crowding, which are both important factors to support object tracking in a scene.

Data visualization is a powerful tool for exploring these complex ‘solution spaces’, but there is limited research on its ability to support multi-objective decisions. In this article, we explore the effects of chart complexity and data volume on decision quality in multi-objective scenarios with complex trade-offs. We look at the impact of four common multidimensional chart types (scatter plot matrices, parallel coordinates plots, heat maps, radar charts), the number of options and dimensions and participant chart usage experience on decision time and accuracy when selecting the ‘optimal option’. As objectively evaluating the quality of multi-objective decisions and the trade-offs involved is challenging, we employ rank- and score-based accuracy metrics. While heat maps demonstrate a time advantage, our findings show no strong performance benefit for one chart type over another for accuracy. We find mixed evidence for the impact of chart complexity on performance, with our results suggesting the existence of a ‘ceiling’ in the number of dimensions considered by participants. This points to a potential limit to data complexity that is useful for decision making. Lastly, participants who use charts frequently performed better, suggesting that users can potentially be trained to effectively use complex visualizations in their decision-making.},

The attribute space is visualized as a function of the number of voxels, allowing the user to explore the data in terms of the attribute size/magnitude. However, such visualizations provide the user with no information on the relationship between various attribute spaces (e.g., density, temperature, pressure, x, y, z) within the multivariate data. In this work, we propose a modification to the attribute space visualization in which the user is no longer presented with the magnitude of the attribute; instead, the user is presented with an information metric detailing the relationship between attributes of the multivariate volumetric data. In this way, the user can guide their exploration based on the relationship between the attribute magnitude and user selected attribute information as opposed to being constrained by only visualizing the magnitude of the attribute. We refer to this modification to the traditional histogram widget as an abstract attribute space representation. Our system utilizes common one and two-dimensional histogram widgets where the bins of the abstract attribute space now correspond to an attribute relationship in terms of the mean, standard deviation, entropy, or skewness. In this manner, we exploit the relationships and correlations present in the underlying data with respect to the dimension(s) under examination. These relationships are often times key to insight and allow us to guide attribute discovery as opposed to automatic extraction schemes which try to calculate and extract distinct attributes a priori. In this way, our system aids in the knowledge discovery of the interaction of properties within volumetric data.},

Compared to local illumination, global illumination can produce realistic shading effects which are closer to real world scenes, and has proven useful for enhancing volume data visualization to enable better depth and shape perception. However, setting up optimal lighting could be a nontrivial task for average users. There were lighting design works for volume visualization but they did not consider global light transportation. In this paper, we present a lighting design method for volume visualization employing global illumination. The resulting system takes into account view and transfer-function dependent content of the volume data to automatically generate an optimized three-point lighting environment. Our method fully exploits the back light which is not used by previous volume visualization systems. By also including global shadow and multiple scattering, our lighting system can effectively enhance the depth and shape perception of volumetric features of interest. In addition, we propose an automatic tone mapping operator which recovers visual details from overexposed areas while maintaining sufficient contrast in the dark areas. We show that our method is effective for visualizing volume datasets with complex structures. The structural information is more clearly and correctly presented under the automatically generated light sources.},

The presented approach provides an interactive tool that aids users in exploring clusters and identifying features of interest (FOI). Second, our method automatically generates a TF by iteratively refining the optical properties for the selected features using a novel feature visibility measurement. The proposed visibility measurement leverages the similarities of features to enhance their visibilities in DVR images. Compared to the conventional visibility measurement, the proposed feature visibility is able to efficiently sense opacity changes and precisely evaluate the impact of selected features on resulting visualizations. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by demonstrating the advantages of integrating feature similarity into the visibility computations. We examine a number of datasets to establish the utility of our approach for semi-automatic TF design.},

	abstract = {Analysts often need to explore and identify coordinated relationships (e.g., four people who visited the same five cities on the same set of days) within some large datasets for sensemaking. Biclusters provide a potential solution to ease this process, because each computed bicluster bundles individual relationships into coordinated sets. By understanding such computed, structural, relations within biclusters, analysts can leverage their domain knowledge and intuition to determine the importance and relevance of the extracted relationships for making hypotheses. However, due to the lack of systematic design guidelines, it is still a challenge to design effective and usable visualizations of biclusters to enhance their perceptibility and interactivity for exploring coordinated relationships. In this paper, we present a five-level design framework for bicluster visualizations, with a survey of the state-of-the-art design considerations and applications that are related or that can be applied to bicluster visualizations. We summarize pros and cons of these design options to support user tasks at each of the five-level relationships. Finally, we discuss future research challenges for bicluster visualizations and their incorporation into visual analytics tools.},

However, these studies mainly focused on visualizations with a single view to a small number of views, and there are still unresolved questions about how to design responsive multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present a reusable and generalizable framework for designing responsive multi-view visualizations focused on genomics data. To gain a better understanding of existing design challenges, we review web-based genomics visualization tools in the wild. By characterizing tools based on a taxonomy of responsive designs, we find that responsiveness is rarely supported in existing tools. To distill insights from the survey results in a systematic way, we classify typical view composition patterns, such as “vertically long,” “horizontally wide,” “circular,” and “cross-shaped” compositions. We then identify their usability issues in different resolutions that stem from the composition patterns, as well as discussing approaches to address the issues and to make genomics visualizations responsive. By extending the Gosling visualization grammar to support responsive constructs, we show how these approaches can be supported. A valuable follow-up study would be taking different input modalities into account, such as mouse and touch interactions, which was not considered in our study.},

To explore related information across multiple views, current visual analysis tools heavily rely on brushing and linking techniques, which may require a significant amount of user effort (e.g., many trial-and-error attempts). There may be other efficient and effective ways of displaying cross-view data relationships to support data analysis with multiple views, but currently there are no guidelines to address this design challenge. In this article, we present systematic design considerations for visualizing cross-view data relationships, which leverages descriptive aspects of relationships and usable visual context of multi-view visualizations.

In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study. We offer this work as an example for implementing the rigor criteria to produce a diverse range of knowledge contributions.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art lighting design is based on physically accurate lighting simulations of scenes such as offices. The simulation results support lighting designers in the creation of lighting configurations, which must meet contradicting customer objectives regarding quality and price while conforming to industry standards. However, current tools for lighting design impede rapid feedback cycles. On the one side, they decouple analysis and simulation specification. On the other side, they lack capabilities for a detailed comparison of multiple configurations. The primary contribution of this paper is a design study of LiteVis, a system for efficient decision support in lighting design. LiteVis tightly integrates global illumination-based lighting simulation, a spatial representation of the scene, and non-spatial visualizations of parameters and result indicators. This enables an efficient iterative cycle of simulation parametrization and analysis. Specifically, a novel visualization supports decision making by ranking simulated lighting configurations with regard to a weight-based prioritization of objectives that considers both spatial and non-spatial characteristics. In the spatial domain, novel concepts support a detailed comparison of illumination scenarios. We demonstrate LiteVis using a real-world use case and report qualitative feedback of lighting designers. This feedback indicates that LiteVis successfully supports lighting designers to achieve key tasks more efficiently and with greater certainty.},

We found this to be the case in the domain of task parallel computing where such data and tooling is an open area of research. Despite these hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study methodology to the “moving target” of both the data and the domain experts' concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.},

To achieve interactive rendering rates, we use a hybrid rendering technique, leveraging radiosity to simulate the interreflectance between diffuse patches and shadow volumes to generate per-pixel direct illumination. The rendered images are then projected on the real model by four calibrated projectors to help users study the daylighting illumination. The virtual heliodon is a physical design environment in which multiple designers, a designer and a client, or a teacher and students can gather to experience animated visualizations of the natural illumination within a proposed design by controlling the time of day, season, and climate.

Our approach has the unique advantage of being human-centric, that is, the generated floorplans can be geometrically plausible, as well as topologically reasonable to enhance resident interaction with the environment. From the input boundary, we first synthesize a human-activity map that reflects both the spatial configuration and human-environment interaction in an architectural space. We propose to produce the human-activity map either automatically by a pre-trained generative adversarial network (GAN) model, or semi-automatically by synthesizing it with user manipulation of the furniture. Second, we feed the human-activity map into our deep framework ActFloor-GAN to guide a pixel-wise prediction of room types. We adopt a re-formulated cycle-consistency constraint in ActFloor-GAN to maximize the overall prediction performance, so that we can produce high-quality room layouts that are readily convertible to vectorized floorplans. Experimental results show several benefits of our approach. First, a quantitative comparison with prior methods shows superior performance of leveraging the human-activity map in predicting piecewise room types. Second, a subjective evaluation by architects shows that our results have compelling quality as professionally-designed floorplans and much better than those generated by existing methods in terms of the room layout topology. Last, our approach allows manipulating the furniture placement, considers the human activities in the environment, and enables the incorporation of user-design preferences.},

In an effort to assist architects in such a complex endeavour, we propose IDOME, an interactive system for computer-aided design optimization. Our approach balances automation and control by efficiently exploring, analyzing, and filtering space layouts to inform architects' decision-making better. At each design iteration, IDOME provides a set of alternative building layouts which satisfy user-defined constraints and optimality criteria concerning a user-defined space parametrization. When the user selects a design generated by IDOME, the system performs a similar optimization process with the same (or different) parameters and objectives. A user may iterate this exploration process as many times as needed. In this work, we focus on optimizing built environments using architectural metrics by improving the degree of visibility, accessibility, and information gaining for navigating a proposed space. This approach, however, can be extended to support other kinds of analysis as well. We demonstrate the capabilities of IDOME through a series of examples, performance analysis, user studies, and a usability test. The results indicate that IDOME successfully optimizes the proposed designs concerning the chosen metrics and offers a satisfactory experience for users with minimal training.},

In the first stage, architects usually sketch the overall 3D shape and the panel layout on a physical or digital paper briefly. In the second stage, a digital 3D model is created using the sketch as a reference. The digital model needs to incorporate geometric requirements for its components, such as the planarity of panels due to consideration of construction costs, which can make the modeling process more challenging. In this work, we present a novel sketch-based system to bridge the concept design and digital modeling of freeform roof-like shapes represented as planar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes. Our system allows the user to sketch the surface boundary and contour lines under axonometric projection and supports the sketching of occluded regions. In addition, the user can sketch feature lines to provide directional guidance to the PQ mesh layout. Given the 2D sketch input, we propose a deep neural network to infer in real-time the underlying surface shape along with a dense conjugate direction field, both of which are used to extract the final PQ mesh. To train and validate our network, we generate a large synthetic dataset that mimics architect sketching of freeform quadrilateral patches. The effectiveness and usability of our system are demonstrated with quantitative and qualitative evaluation as well as user studies.},

A game level is represented as an assembly of chunks characterized by the exercise intensity levels they impose on players. We formulate game level synthesis as an optimization problem, where the chunks are assembled in a way to achieve an optimized level of intensity. To allow the synthesis of game levels of varying lengths, we solve the trans-dimensional optimization problem with a Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. We demonstrate that our approach can be applied to generate game levels for s of motion-based virtual reality games.

Data that are mapped or otherwise visualized are also often emotive in nature, either inherently (e.g., climate change, disease mortality rates), or by design, such as can be found in visual storytelling. However, little is known about how the affective qualities of color interact with those of data context in visualization design. This article describes the results of a crowdsourced study on the influence of affectively congruent versus incongruent color schemes on categorical map-reading response. We report both objective (pattern detection; area comparison) and subjective (affective quality; appropriateness; preference) measures of map-reader response. Our results suggest that affectively congruent colors amplify perceptions of the affective qualities of maps with emotive topics, affective incongruence may cause confusion, and that affective congruence is particularly influential in maps of positive-leaning data topics. Finally, we offer preliminary design recommendations for balancing color congruence with other design factors, and for synthesizing color and affective context in thematic map design.},

To guarantee the high quality of such learning materials, question designers need to inspect how students' problem-solving processes unfold step by step to infer whether students' problem-solving logic matches their design intent. They also need to compare the behaviors of different groups (e.g., students from different grades) to distribute questions to students with the right level of knowledge. The availability of fine-grained interaction data, such as mouse movement trajectories from the online platforms, provides the opportunity to analyze problem-solving behaviors. However, it is still challenging to interpret, summarize, and compare the high dimensional problem-solving sequence data. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system, QLens, to help question designers inspect detailed problem-solving trajectories, compare different student groups, distill insights for design improvements. In particular, QLens models problem-solving behavior as a hybrid state transition graph and visualizes it through a novel glyph-embedded Sankey diagram, which reflects students' problem-solving logic, engagement, and encountered difficulties. We conduct three case studies and three expert interviews to demonstrate the usefulness of QLens on real-world datasets that consist of thousands of problem-solving traces.},

However, most of the existing surgery simulators can only provide limited immersive environments with a few pre-processed organ models, while ignoring the instant modeling of various personalized clinical cases, which brings substantive differences between training experiences and real surgery situations. To this end, we present a virtual reality (VR) based surgery simulation system for personalized percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The simulation system can directly take patient-specific clinical data as input and generate virtual 3D intervention scenarios. Specially, we introduce a fiber-based patient-specific cardiac dynamic model to simulate the nonlinear deformation among the multiple layers of the cardiac structure, which can well respect and correlate the atriums, ventricles and vessels, and thus gives rise to more effective visualization and interaction. Meanwhile, we design a tracking and haptic feedback hardware, which can enable users to manipulate physical intervention instruments and interact with virtual scenarios. We conduct quantitative analysis on deformation precision and modeling efficiency, and evaluate the simulation system based on the user studies from 16 cardiologists and 20 intervention trainees, comparing it to traditional desktop intervention simulators. The results confirm that our simulation system can provide a better user experience, and is a suitable platform for PCI surgery training and rehearsal.},

Conventionally, the wayfinding design of a virtual environment is created manually, so as the wayfinding design of a real-world architectural site. The many possible navigation scenarios, as well as the interplay between signs and human navigation, can make the manual design process overwhelming and non-trivial. As a result, creating a wayfinding design for a typical layout can take months to several years. In this paper, we introduce the Way to Go! approach for automatically generating a wayfinding design for a given layout. The designer simply has to specify some navigation scenarios; our approach will automatically generate an optimized wayfinding design with signs properly placed considering human agents' visibility and possibility of making mistakes during a navigation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating wayfinding designs for different layouts such as a train station, a downtown and a canyon. We evaluate our results by comparing different wayfinding designs and show that our optimized wayfinding design can guide pedestrians to their destinations effectively and efficiently. Our approach can also help the designer visualize the accessibility of a destination from different locations, and correct any “blind zone” with additional signs.},

	abstract = {This research explores the design and evaluation of visualization techniques of targets that reside outside of users' view and/or are occluded by other elements within a virtual reality environment (VE). We first compare four techniques (3DWedge, 3DArrow, 3DMinimap, and Radar) that use different types of visual elements to provide direction and distance information of targets. To give structure to their evaluation, we also develop a framework of four tasks (one for direction and three for distance) and their assessment criteria. The results of the first study show that 3DWedge is the best-performing and most usable technique. However, all techniques, including 3DWedge, have poor performance in dense scenarios with a large number of targets. To improve support in dense scenarios, a fifth technique, 3DWedge+, is developed by using 3DWedge as its foundation and including additional visual elements that are derived from the other three techniques which are shown to be useful. A second study is conducted to evaluate the performance of 3DWedge+ in relation to the other techniques. The results show that both 3DWedge and 3DWedge+ are significantly better in distinguishing user-to-target distance and that 3DWedge+ is particularly suitable for dense scenarios. Based on these results, we provide a set of recommendations for the design of visualization techniques of off-screen and occluded targets in 3D VE.},

Design study 1 identifies the promise of 3D interfaces for rapid VR design and also establishes limitations of the particular tools tested with respect to precision and support for animation. Design study 2 explores animating artist-created visualization designs with scientific 3D fluid flow data. While results captured an accurate sense of flow that was advantageous as compared to the results of study 1, the potential for visual exploration using the design tools tested was limited. Design study 3 reveals the importance of a new 3D interface that overcomes the precision limitation found in study 1 while remaining accessible to artist collaborators. Drawing upon previous results, design study 4 engages collaborative teams in a design process that begins with traditional paper sketching and moves to animated interactive VR prototypes "sketched" by designers in VR using interactive 3D tools. Conclusions from these four studies identify important characteristics of effective artist-accessible VR visualization design tools and lead to a proposed formalized methodology for successful collaborative design that we expect to be useful in guiding future collaborations. We call this proposed methodology scientific sketching.},

The goal of our research is to distill the results from previous studies into a consistent and reusable framework. We review 127 research papers, including 15 papers with quantitative user studies, which employed comparative layouts. We first alleviate the ambiguous boundaries in the design space of comparative layouts by suggesting lucid terminology (e.g., chart-wise and item-wise juxtaposition). We then identify the diverse aspects of comparative layouts, such as the advantages and concerns of using each layout in the real-world scenarios and researchers' approaches to overcome the concerns. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from the Gleicher et al.'s survey [19], we elaborate on relevant empirical evidence that we distilled from our survey (e.g., the actual effectiveness of the layouts in different study settings) and identify novel facets that the original work did not cover (e.g., the familiarity of the layouts to people). Finally, we show the consistent and contradictory results on the performance of comparative layouts and offer practical implications for using the layouts by suggesting trade-offs and seven actionable guidelines.},

Alternative methods from vision science offer a rich suite of tools for understanding visualizations, but no curated collection of these methods exists in either perception or visualization research. We introduce a design space of experimental methods for empirically investigating the perceptual processes involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms, adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science research, rooting each in visualization examples. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique. Researchers can use this design space to create innovative studies and progress scientific understanding of design choices and evaluations in visualization. We highlight a history of collaborative success between visualization and vision science research and advocate for a deeper relationship between the two fields that can elaborate on and extend the methodological design space for understanding visualization and vision.},

For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2D landscapes were superior to 3D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3D landscapes with no colour scale (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A colour scale was found to be better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only. These results suggest that point-based spatializations should be chosen over landscape representations, at least for tasks involving only point data itself rather than derived information about the data space.},

Users must be able to find content quickly, labels and indicators must not be invasive but still clearly noticeable, and the user interface should maximize search performance in a variety of conditions. To address these issues, we have set up a series of experiments to test the influence of virtual characteristics such as color, size, and leader lines on the performance of search tasks and noticeability in both real and simulated environments. We evaluate two primary areas, including 1) the effects of peripheral field of view (FOV) limitations and labeling techniques on target acquisition during outdoor mobile search, and 2) the influence of local characteristics such as color, size, and motion on text labels over dynamic backgrounds. The first experiment showed that limited FOV will severely limit search performance, but that appropriate placement of labels and leaders within the periphery can alleviate this problem without interfering with walking or decreasing user comfort. In the second experiment, we found that different types of motion are more noticeable in optical versus video see-through displays, but that blue coloration is most noticeable in both. Results can aid in designing more effective view management techniques, especially for wider field of view displays.},

We describe alternative placements that permit a wider range of word-scale graphics and more flexible integration with text layouts. These alternative placements include positioning visualizations between lines, within additional vertical and horizontal space in the document, and as interactive overlays on top of the text. Each strategy changes the dimensions of the space available to display the visualizations, as well as the degree to which the text must be adjusted or reflowed to accommodate them. We provide an illustrated design space of placement options for word-scale visualizations and identify six important variables that control the placement of the graphics and the level of disruption of the source text. We also contribute a quantitative analysis that highlights the effect of different placements on readability and text disruption.

In this paper, we opted to revisit the composite visualizations in IEEE VIS publications and answered what and how visualizations of different types are composed together. To achieve this, we first constructed a corpus of composite visualizations from the publications and analyzed common practices, such as the pattern distributions and co-occurrence of visualization types. From the analysis, we obtained insights into different design patterns on the utilities and their potential pros and cons. Furthermore, we discussed usage scenarios of our taxonomy and corpus and how future research on visualization composition can be conducted on the basis of this study.},

We identify each of these as `channels'-evolving relationships between producers and consumers of visualization-where traditional roles of the visualization expert and domain expert are blurred. In each case, we identify the different design decisions that were required to support each of these channels and the role played by the visualization process. Using chauffeured interaction with a flexible visual analytics system we demonstrate how insight was gained by policy makers into gendered spatio-temporal cycle behaviors, how this led to further insight into workplace commuting activity, group cycling behavior and explanations for street navigation choice. We demonstrate how this supported, and was supported by, the seemingly unrelated development of narrative-driven visualization via TEDx, of the creation and the setting of an art installation and the curating of digital and physical artefacts. We assert that existing models of visualization design, of tool/technique development and of insight generation do not adequately capture the richness of parallel engagement via these multiple channels of communication. We argue that developing multiple channels in parallel opens up opportunities for visualization design and analysis by building trust and authority and supporting creativity. This rich, non-sequential approach to visualization design is likely to foster serendipity, deepen insight and increase impact.},

This work introduces a rigorous and practical approach for automatic N-RoSy field design on arbitrary surfaces with user-defined field topologies. The user has full control of the number, positions, and indexes of the singularities (as long as they are compatible with necessary global constraints), the turning numbers of the loops, and is able to edit the field interactively. We formulate N-RoSy field construction as designing a Riemannian metric such that the holonomy along any loop is compatible with the local symmetry of N-RoSy fields. We prove the compatibility condition using discrete parallel transport. The complexity of N-RoSy field design is caused by curvatures. In our work, we propose to simplify the Riemannian metric to make it flat almost everywhere. This approach greatly simplifies the process and improves the flexibility such that it can design N-RoSy fields with single singularity and mixed-RoSy fields. This approach can also be generalized to construct regular remeshing on surfaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our design system to pen-and-ink sketching and geometry remeshing. Furthermore, based on our remeshing results with high global symmetry, we generate Celtic knots on surfaces directly.},

While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, little systematic and practical guidance is available on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for creating structured data stories. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid by analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through story creation.

We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat.

Prior literature offers guidelines for effective colormap design, such as emphasizing luminance variation while limiting changes in hue. However, empirical studies of color are largely focused on perceptual tasks. This narrow focus inhibits our understanding of how generalizable these guidelines are, particularly to tasks like visual inference that require synthesis and judgement across multiple percepts. Furthermore, the emphasis on traditional ramp designs (e.g., sequential or diverging) may sideline other key metrics or design strategies. We study how a cognitive metric-color name variation-impacts people's ability to make model-based judgments. In two graphical inference experiments, participants saw a series of color-coded scalar fields sampled from different models and assessed the relationships between these models. Contrary to conventional guidelines, participants were more accurate when viewing colormaps that cross a variety of uniquely nameable colors. We modeled participants' performance using this metric and found that it provides a better fit to the experimental data than do existing design principles. Our findings indicate cognitive advantages for colorful maps like rainbow, which exhibit high color categorization, despite their traditionally undesirable perceptual properties. We also found no evidence that color categorization would lead observers to infer false data features. Our results provide empirically grounded metrics for predicting a colormap's performance and suggest alternative guidelines for designing new quantitative colormaps to support inference.

The static dashboards were developed in nine iterations, to show 15 important attributes from the patients' histories. The final design was evaluated with five non-experts, five visualization experts and four medical experts, who successfully used it to gain an overview of a 2,000 patient dataset, and to make observations about longitudinal changes and differences between two cohorts.

These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies.

However, designing interactive visualizations for informal learning environments, such as museums, presents several challenges. First, visualizations must engage visitors on a personal level. Second, visitors often lack the background to interpret visualizations of scientific data. Third, visitors have very limited time at individual exhibits in museums. This paper examines these design considerations through the iterative development and evaluation of an interactive exhibit as a visualization tool that gives museumgoers access to scientific data generated and used by researchers. The exhibit prototype, Living Liquid, encourages visitors to ask and answer their own questions while exploring the time-varying global distribution of simulated marine microbes using a touchscreen interface. Iterative development proceeded through three rounds of formative evaluations using think-aloud protocols and interviews, each round informing a key visualization design decision: (1) what to visualize to initiate inquiry, (2) how to link data at the microscopic scale to global patterns, and (3) how to include additional data that allows visitors to pursue their own questions. Data from visitor evaluations suggests that, when designing visualizations for public audiences, one should (1) avoid distracting visitors from data that they should explore, (2) incorporate background information into the visualization, (3) favor understandability over scientific accuracy, and (4) layer data accessibility to structure inquiry. Lessons learned from this case study add to our growing understanding of how to use visualizations to actively engage learners with scientific data.},

The approach integrates forward design via direct manipulation of simulation inputs (e.g., geometric properties, applied forces) in the same visual space with inverse design via 'tugging' and reshaping simulation outputs (e.g., scalar fields from finite element analysis (FEA) or computational fluid dynamics (CFD)). The interface includes algorithms for interpreting the intent of users' drag operations relative to parameterized models, morphing arbitrary scalar fields output from FEA and CFD simulations, and in-place interactive ensemble visualization. The inverse design strategy can be extended to use multi-touch input in combination with an as-rigid-as-possible shape manipulation to support rich visual queries. The potential of this new design approach is confirmed via two applications: medical device engineering of a vacuum-assisted biopsy device and visual effects design using a physically based flame simulation.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that the available treatment options, including surgery and conservative treatment, result in a similar prognosis for most men with localized prostate cancer. However, approximately 90\% of patients choose surgery over conservative treatment, despite the risk of severe side effects like erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Recent medical research suggests that a key reason is the lack of patient-centered tools that can effectively communicate personalized risk information and enable them to make better health decisions. In this paper, we report the iterative design process and results of developing the PROgnosis Assessment for Conservative Treatment (PROACT) tool, a personalized health risk communication tool for localized prostate cancer patients. PROACT utilizes two published clinical prediction models to communicate the patients' personalized risk estimates and compare treatment options. In collaboration with the Maine Medical Center, we conducted two rounds of evaluations with prostate cancer survivors and urologists to identify the design elements and narrative structure that effectively facilitate patient comprehension under emotional distress. Our results indicate that visualization can be an effective means to communicate complex risk information to patients with low numeracy and visual literacy. However, the visualizations need to be carefully chosen to balance readability with ease of comprehension. In addition, due to patients' charged emotional state, an intuitive narrative structure that considers the patients' information need is critical to aid the patients' comprehension of their risk information.},

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30\% faster.},

Despite preliminary empirical work and a few web essays written by practitioners, there is a lack of clear language for thinking about and communicating about anthropographics. We address this gap by introducing a conceptual framework and a design space for anthropographics. Our design space consists of seven elementary design dimensions that can be reasonably hypothesized to have some effect on prosocial feelings or behavior. It extends a previous design space and is informed by an analysis of 105 visualizations collected from newspapers, websites, and research articles. We use our conceptual framework and design space to discuss trade-offs, common design strategies, as well as future opportunities for design and research in the area of anthropographics.},

In this work, the mechanical behavior of MSMs under tensile loads is analyzed before studying the spring stiffness estimation. In particular, the performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of the behavior of cubical MSMs shows that they have a nonlinear response similar to hyperelastic material models. According to this behavior, a new method for spring stiffness estimation valid for linear and nonlinear material models is proposed. This method adjusts the stress-strain and compressibility curves to a given reference behavior. The accuracy of the MSMs designed with this method is tested taking as reference some soft-tissue simulations based on nonlinear Finite Element Method (FEM). The obtained results show that MSMs can be designed to realistically model the behavior of hyperelastic materials such as soft tissues and can become an interesting alternative to other approaches such as nonlinear FEM.},

We achieve this by using the workflow of the analysis task as a trajectory through data, interactive views, and analytical processes. The benefits for the analysis session go well beyond the pure selection of appropriate data sets and range from providing orientation or even guidance along a preferred analysis path to a potential overall speedup, allowing data to be fetched ahead of time. We illustrate the design process for a biomedical use case that aims at determining a treatment plan for cancer patients from the visual analysis of a large, heterogeneous clinical data pool. As an example for how to apply the comprehensive design approach, we present Stack'n'flip, a sample implementation which tightly integrates visualizations of the actual data with a map of available data sets, views, and tasks, thus capturing and communicating the analytical workflow through the required data sets.},

While this is important in determining the effectiveness of the tools and advancing the state-of-the-art in visualization research, a key area that has mostly been overlooked is how well established visualization theories and principles are instantiated in practice. This is especially relevant when domain experts, and not visualization researchers, design visualizations for analysis of their data or for broader dissemination of scientific knowledge. There is very little research on exploring the synergistic capabilities of cross-domain collaboration between domain experts and visualization researchers. To fill this gap, in this paper we describe the results of an exploratory study of climate data visualizations conducted in tight collaboration with a pool of climate scientists. The study analyzes a large set of static climate data visualizations for identifying their shortcomings in terms of visualization design. The outcome of the study is a classification scheme that categorizes the design problems in the form of a descriptive taxonomy. The taxonomy is a first attempt for systematically categorizing the types, causes, and consequences of design problems in visualizations created by domain experts. We demonstrate the use of the taxonomy for a number of purposes, such as, improving the existing climate data visualizations, reflecting on the impact of the problems for enabling domain experts in designing better visualizations, and also learning about the gaps and opportunities for future visualization research. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy through a number of examples and discuss the lessons learnt and implications of our findings.},

Particularly, vehicles with augmented reality (AR) graphics delivered via head-up displays (HUDs) are nearing mainstream commercial feasibility and will be widely implemented over the next decade. Though AR graphics have been shown to provide tangible benefits to drivers in scenarios like forward collision warnings and navigation, they also create many new perceptual and sensory issues for drivers. For some time now, designers have focused on increasing the realism and quality of virtual graphics delivered via HUDs, and recently have begun testing more advanced 3D HUD systems that deliver volumetric spatial information to drivers. However, the realization of volumetric graphics adds further complexity to the design and delivery of AR cues, and moreover, parameters in this new design space must be clearly and operationally defined and explored. In this work, we present two user studies that examine how driver performance and visual attention are affected when using fixed and animated AR HUD interface design approaches in driving scenarios that require top-down and bottom-up cognitive processing. Results demonstrate that animated design approaches can produce some driving gains (e.g., in goal-directed navigation tasks) but often come at the cost of response time and distance. Our discussion yields AR HUD design recommendations and challenges some of the existing assumptions of world-fixed conformal graphic approaches to design.},

	abstract = {Data visualization design has a powerful effect on which patterns we see as salient and how quickly we see them. The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of visualization designers and practitioners.

In this paper we introduce and define a new methodological paradigm we call design by immersion, which provides an alternative perspective on problem-driven visualization work. Design by immersion embeds transdisciplinary experiences at the center of the visualization process by having visualization researchers participate in the work of the target domain (or domain experts participate in visualization research). Based on our own combined experiences of working on cross-disciplinary, problem-driven visualization projects, we present six case studies that expose the opportunities that design by immersion enables, including (1) exploring new domain-inspired visualization design spaces, (2) enriching domain understanding through personal experiences, and (3) building strong transdisciplinary relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate how the process of design by immersion opens up a diverse set of design activities that can be combined in different ways depending on the type of collaboration, project, and goals. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential pitfalls of design by immersion.},

As with icon designs, glyphs are usually created based on the designers' experience and intuition, often in a spontaneous manner. Such a process does not scale well with the requirements of applications where a large number of concepts are to be encoded using glyphs. To alleviate such limitations, we propose a new systematic process for glyph design by exploring the parallel between the hierarchy of concept categorization and the ordering of discriminative capacity of visual channels. We examine the feasibility of this approach in an application where there is a pressing need for an efficient and effective means to visualize workflows of biological experiments. By processing thousands of workflow records in a public archive of biological experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective glyph design can be obtained by following a process of formulating a taxonomy with the aid of computation, identifying visual channels hierarchically, and defining application-specific abstraction and metaphors.},

Alternative prototypes are tested in three user studies and compared with baseline conditions that use a mouse. Our aim is to gain empirical data on the usefulness of a range of design possibilities and to generate more ideas. Among other things, the results show promise for changing zoom level or visual representation with the user's physical distance to a large display.

We develop a model of design exposition characterised by four visualization designer architypes: the evaluator, the autonomist, the didacticist and the rationalist. The model is used to justify the key characteristics of literate visualization: ‘notebook’ documents that integrate live coding input, rendered output and textual narrative; low cost of authoring textual narrative; guidelines to encourage structured visualization design and its documentation. We propose narrative schemas for structuring and validating a wide range of visualization design approaches and models, and branching narratives for capturing alternative designs and design views. We describe a new open source literate visualization environment, litvis, based on a declarative interface to Vega and Vega-Lite through the functional programming language Elm combined with markdown for formatted narrative. We informally assess the approach, its implementation and potential by considering three examples spanning a range of design abstractions: new visualization idioms; validation though visualization algebra; and feminist data visualization. We argue that the rich documentation of the design process provided by literate visualization offers the potential to improve the validity of visualization design and so benefit both academic visualization and visualization practice.},

However, the problem of specifying the locations and sizes of design elements usually involves constraints with respect to element attributes, such as area, aspect ratio and reading-order. Automating attribute conditional graphic layouts remains a complex and unsolved problem. In this article, we introduce Attribute-conditioned Layout GAN to incorporate the attributes of design elements for graphic layout generation by forcing both the generator and the discriminator to meet attribute conditions. Due to the complexity of graphic designs, we further propose an element dropout method to make the discriminator look at partial lists of elements and learn their local patterns. In addition, we introduce various loss designs following different design principles for layout optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed method can synthesize graphic layouts conditioned on different element attributes. It can also adjust well-designed layouts to new sizes while retaining elements' original reading-orders. The effectiveness of our method is validated through a user study.},

For example, social scientists may want to investigate asymmetric relations in organizations with strict chains of command, or incorporate non-actors such as conferences and projects when analyzing coauthorship patterns. Multimodal social networks are those where actors and relations belong to different types, or modes, and multimodal social network analysis (mSNA) is accordingly SNA for such networks. In this paper, we present a design study that we conducted with several social scientist collaborators on how to support mSNA using visual analytics tools. Based on an openended, formative design process, we devised a visual representation called parallel node-link bands (PNLBs) that splits modes into separate bands and renders connections between adjacent ones, similar to the list view in Jigsaw. We then used the tool in a qualitative evaluation involving five social scientists whose feedback informed a second design phase that incorporated additional network metrics. Finally, we conducted a second qualitative evaluation with our social scientist collaborators that provided further insights on the utility of the PNLBs representation and the potential of visual analytics for mSNA.},

Existing abstract task classifications aim to provide support for this endeavour by providing a carefully delineated suite of actions. Our experience is that this bottom-up approach is part of the challenge: low-level actions are difficult to interpret without a higher-level context of analysis goals and the analysis process. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework based on analysis reports derived from open-coding 20 design study papers published at IEEE InfoVis 2009-2015, to build on the previous work of abstractions that collectively encompass a broad variety of domains. The framework is organized in two axes illustrated by nine analysis goals. It helps situate the analysis goals by placing each goal under axes of specificity (Explore, Describe, Explain, Confirm) and number of data populations (Single, Multiple). The single-population types are Discover Observation, Describe Observation, Identify Main Cause, and Collect Evidence. The multiple-population types are Compare Entities, Explain Differences, and Evaluate Hypothesis. Each analysis goal is scoped by an input and an output and is characterized by analysis steps reported in the design study papers. We provide examples of how we and others have used the framework in a top-down approach to abstracting domain problems: visualization designers or researchers first identify the analysis goals of each unit of analysis in an analysis stream, and then encode the individual steps using existing task classifications with the context of the goal, the level of specificity, and the number of populations involved in the analysis.},

A key consideration in this paper is the construction of a cost function to capture several relevant aspects of the human visual system, examining a scatterplot design for some data analysis task. We show how the cost function can be used in an optimizer to search for the optimal visual design for a user's dataset and task objectives (e.g., “reliable linear correlation estimation is more important than class separation”). The approach is extensible to different analysis tasks. To test its performance in a realistic setting, we pre-calibrated it for correlation estimation, class separation, and outlier detection. The optimizer was able to produce designs that achieved a level of speed and success comparable to that of those using human-designed presets (e.g., in R or MATLAB). Case studies demonstrate that the approach can adapt a design to the data, to reveal patterns without user intervention.},

This process can be difficult and time consuming for professional designers, not to mention non-expert users, leading to the demand for automated infographics design. As a first step, we focus on timeline infographics, which have been widely used for centuries. We contribute an end-to-end approach that automatically extracts an extensible timeline template from a bitmap image. Our approach adopts a deconstruction and reconstruction paradigm. At the deconstruction stage, we propose a multi-task deep neural network that simultaneously parses two kinds of information from a bitmap timeline: 1) the global information, i.e., the representation, scale, layout, and orientation of the timeline, and 2) the local information, i.e., the location, category, and pixels of each visual element on the timeline. At the reconstruction stage, we propose a pipeline with three techniques, i.e., Non-Maximum Merging, Redundancy Recover, and DL GrabCut, to extract an extensible template from the infographic, by utilizing the deconstruction results. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we synthesize a timeline dataset (4296 images) and collect a real-world timeline dataset (393 images) from the Internet. We first report quantitative evaluation results of our approach over the two datasets. Then, we present examples of automatically extracted templates and timelines automatically generated based on these templates to qualitatively demonstrate the performance. The results confirm that our approach can effectively extract extensible templates from real-world timeline infographics.},

Experimental results showed that a BCI and an OST-HMD equipment (EEG headset and Hololens in our case) are well compatible and that small movements of the head can be tolerated when using the BCI. Second, we introduced a design space for command display strategies based on BCI in AR, when exploiting a famous brain pattern called Steady-State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP). Our design space relies on five dimensions concerning the visual layout of the BCI menu; namely: orientation, frame-of-reference, anchorage, size and explicitness. We implemented various BCI-based display strategies and tested them within the context of mobile robot control in AR. Our findings were finally integrated within an operational prototype based on a real mobile robot that is controlled in AR using a BCI and a HoloLens headset.

	abstract = {Designing tensor fields in the plane and on surfaces is a necessary task in many graphics applications, such as painterly rendering, pen-and-ink sketching of smooth surfaces, and anisotropic remeshing. In this article, we present an interactive design system that allows a user to create a wide variety of symmetric tensor fields over 3D surfaces either from scratch or by modifying a meaningful input tensor field such as the curvature tensor. Our system converts each user specification into a basis tensor field and combines them with the input field to make an initial tensor field. However, such a field often contains unwanted degenerate points which cannot always be eliminated due to topological constraints of the underlying surface. To reduce the artifacts caused by these degenerate points, our system allows the user to move a degenerate point or to cancel a pair of degenerate points that have opposite tensor indices. These operations provide control over the number and location of the degenerate points in the field. We observe that a tensor field can be locally converted into a vector field so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of degenerate points in the tensor field and the set of singularities in the vector field. This conversion allows us to effectively perform degenerate point pair cancellation and movement by using similar operations for vector fields. In addition, we adapt the image-based flow visualization technique to tensor fields, therefore allowing interactive display of tensor fields on surfaces. We demonstrate the capabilities of our tensor field design system with painterly rendering, pen-and-ink sketching of surfaces, and anisotropic remeshing},

The deployment of DVR in everyday clinical work, however, has so far been limited. One contributing factor is that current transfer function (TF) models can encode only a small fraction of the user's domain knowledge. In this paper, we use histograms of local neighborhoods to capture tissue characteristics. This allows domain knowledge on spatial relations in the data set to be integrated into the TF. As a first example, we introduce partial range histograms in an automatic tissue detection scheme and present its effectiveness in a clinical evaluation. We then use local histogram analysis to perform a classification where the tissue-type certainty is treated as a second TF dimension. The result is an enhanced rendering where tissues with overlapping intensity ranges can be discerned without requiring the user to explicitly define a complex, multidimensional TF},

In this paper, we present Data-Driven Guides (DDG), a technique for designing expressive information graphics in a graphic design environment. Instead of being confined by predefined templates or marks, designers can generate guides from data and use the guides to draw, place and measure custom shapes. We provide guides to encode data using three fundamental visual encoding channels: length, area, and position. Users can combine more than one guide to construct complex visual structures and map these structures to data. When underlying data is changed, we use a deformation technique to transform custom shapes using the guides as the backbone of the shapes. Our evaluation shows that data-driven guides allow users to create expressive and more accurate custom data-driven graphics.},

Traditionally, however, NURBS have been viewed as purely geometric primitives, which require the designer to interactively adjust many degrees of freedom-control points and associated weights-to achieve the desired shapes. The conventional shape modification process can often be clumsy and laborious. D-NURBS are physics-based models that incorporate physical quantities into the NURBS geometric substrate. Their dynamic behavior, resulting from the numerical integration of a set of nonlinear differential equations, produces physically meaningful, and hence intuitive shape variation. Consequently, a modeler can interactively sculpt complex shapes to required specifications not only in the traditional indirect fashion, by adjusting control points and setting weights, but also through direct physical manipulation, by applying simulated forces and local and global shape constraints. We use Lagrangian mechanics to formulate the equations of motion for D-NURBS curves, tensor-product D-NURBS surfaces, swung D-NURBS surfaces and triangular D-NURBS surfaces. We apply finite element analysis to reduce these equations to efficient numerical algorithms computable at interactive rates on common graphics workstations. We implement a prototype modeling environment based on D-NURBS and demonstrate that D-NURBS can be effective tools in a wide range of computer-aided geometric design (CAGD) applications.},

We present Overview, an application for the systematic analysis of large document collections based on document clustering, visualization, and tagging. This work contributes to the small set of design studies which evaluate a visualization system “in the wild”, and we report on six case studies where Overview was voluntarily used by self-initiated journalists to produce published stories. We find that the frequently-used language of “exploring” a document collection is both too vague and too narrow to capture how journalists actually used our application. Our iterative process, including multiple rounds of deployment and observations of real world usage, led to a much more specific characterization of tasks.

These limitations may cause data misinterpretation in visualizations, which frequently use small, elongated marks. Our goal is to develop quantitative metrics to help people use color more effectively in visualizations. We present a series of crowdsourced studies measuring color difference perceptions for three common mark types: points, bars, and lines.

Our case study, undertaken over three years, draws attention to repeating trends: that generic approaches fail to elicit adequate requirements for geovis application design; that the use of real data is key to understanding needs and possibilities; that trust and knowledge must be built and developed with collaborators. These processes take time but modified human-centred approaches can be effective. A scenario developed through contextual inquiry but supplemented with domain data and graphics is useful to geovis designers. Wireframe, paper and digital prototypes enable successful communication between specialist and geovis domains when incorporating real and interesting data, prompting exploratory behaviour and eliciting previously unconsidered requirements. Paper prototypes are particularly successful at eliciting suggestions, especially for novel visualization. Enabling specialists to explore their data freely with a digital prototype is as effective as using a structured task protocol and is easier to administer. Autoethnography has potential for framing the design process. We conclude that a common understanding of context of use, domain data and visualization possibilities are essential to successful geovis design and develop as this progresses. HC approaches can make a significant contribution here. However, modified approaches, applied with flexibility, are most promising. We advise early, collaborative engagement with data - through simple, transient visual artefacts supported by data sketches and existing designs - before moving to successively more sophisticated data wireframes and data prototypes.},

In the field of visualization, however, the use of systematic rules embracing these aspects has received less attention. The situation is further complicated by the fact that visualization often uses semi-transparencies to reveal occluded objects, in which case the resulting color mixing effects add additional constraints to the choice of the color palette. Color design forms a crucial part in visual aesthetics. Thus, the consideration of these issues can be of great value in the emerging field of illustrative visualization. We describe a knowledge-based system that captures established color design rules into a comprehensive interactive framework, aimed to aid users in the selection of colors for scene objects and incorporating individual preferences, importance functions, and overall scene composition. Our framework also offers new knowledge and solutions for the mixing, ordering and choice of colors in the rendering of semi-transparent layers and surfaces. All design rules are evaluated via user studies, for which we extend the method of conjoint analysis to task-based testing scenarios. Our framework's use of principles rooted in color design with application for the illustration of features in pre-classified data distinguishes it from existing systems which target the exploration of continuous-range density data via perceptual color maps.},

As displays become larger, the scalability limit may shift away from the number of pixels and toward human perceptual abilities. This work explores the effect of using large, high resolution displays to scale up information visualizations beyond potential visual acuity limitations. Displays that are beyond visual acuity require physical navigation to see all of the pixels. Participants performed various information visualization tasks using display sizes with a sufficient number of pixels to be within, equal to, or beyond visual acuity. Results showed that performance on most tasks was more efficient and sometimes more accurate because of the additional data that could be displayed, despite the physical navigation that was required.

	abstract = {From a broad perspective, our research can be viewed as investigating the fit of technology to task, the user's view of the fit between technology and task, and the relative importance of each to problem-solving or decision-making performance.

The technology investigated in this research is the mode of information presentation. Although there has been a considerable amount of research into problem solving using graphs and tables, until recently the circumstances in which each is more effective have been largely unresolved. Recent research has suggested that performance benefits accrue when cognitive fit occurs, i.e., when factors such as the problem representation and problem solving tools match the characteristics of the task. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the basic paradigm of cognitive fit and extensions to the paradigm in a laboratory experiment that examined the nature of subjects' mental representations as well as problem-solving performance. The experiment, using 128 MBA students in two identical, repeated measures designs, produced the following results:

• Performance improved markedly for symbolic tasks when the problem representation matched the task.

Performance effects also resulted from matching specific problem-solving skills to the problem representation and the task, and to a lesser extent when the skills matched the task alone.

• The incremental effects of matching skills to the problem representation and/or the task were small compared with the primary effects of cognitive fit-that of matching problem representation to task.

• A large proportion of problem solvers have insight into the concept of supporting tasks with certain types of problem representation and vice versa.

• Participants preferred to use tables rather than graphs; they also preferred to solve symbolic rather than spatial problems.

Finally, the problem representation more significantly influenced the mental representation than did task conceptualization.

This research suggests that providing decision support systems to satisfy individual managers' desires will not have a large effect on either the efficiency or the effectiveness of problem solving. Designers should, instead, concentrate on determining the characteristics of the tasks that problem solvers must address, and on supporting those tasks with the appropriate problem representations and support tools. Sufficient evidence now exists to suggest that the notion of cognitive fit may be one aspect of a general theory of problem solving. Suggestions are made for extending the notion of fit to more complex problem-solving environments.},

Although most research to date assumes a single-user focus on perceptual and cognitive processes, in practice, sensemaking is often a social process involving parallelization of effort, discussion, and consensus building. Thus, to fully support sensemaking, interactive visualization should also support social interaction. However, the most appropriate collaboration mechanisms for supporting this interaction are not immediately clear. In this article, we present design considerations for asynchronous collaboration in visual analysis environments, highlighting issues of work parallelization, communication, and social organization.

In this paper, we report on a between-groups study comparing collaborations on image organisation tasks, in an immersive Virtual Reality (VR) environment to more conventional desktop conferencing. Collecting data from 40 subjects in groups of four, we measured task performance, user behaviours, collaboration engagement and awareness. Overall, the VR and desktop interface resulted in similar speed, accuracy and social presence rating, but we observed more conversations and interaction with objects, and more equal contributions to the interaction from participants within groups in VR. We also identified differences in coordination and collaborative awareness behaviours between VR and desktop platforms. We report on a set of systematic measures for assessing VR collaborative experience and a new analysis tool that we have developed to capture user behaviours in collaborative setting. Finally, we provide design considerations and directions for future work.},

This paper proposes a knowledge generation model for visual analytics that ties together these diverse frameworks, yet retains previously developed models (e.g., KDD process) to describe individual segments of the overall visual analytic processes. To test its utility, a real world visual analytics system is compared against the model, demonstrating that the knowledge generation process model provides a useful guideline when developing and evaluating such systems. The model is used to effectively compare different data analysis systems. Furthermore, the model provides a common language and description of visual analytic processes, which can be used for communication between researchers.

	abstract = {In visual analytics, sensemaking is facilitated through interactive visual exploration of data. Throughout this dynamic process, users combine their domain knowledge with the dataset to create insight. Therefore, visual analytic tools exist that aid sensemaking by providing various interaction techniques that focus on allowing users to change the visual representation through adjusting parameters of the underlying statistical model. However, we postulate that the process of sensemaking is not focused on a series of parameter adjustments, but instead, a series of perceived connections and patterns within the data. Thus, how can models for visual analytic tools be designed, so that users can express their reasoning on observations (the data), instead of directly on the model or tunable parameters? Observation level (and thus “observation”) in this paper refers to the data points within a visualization. In this paper, we explore two possible observation-level interactions, namely exploratory and expressive, within the context of three statistical methods, Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). We discuss the importance of these two types of observation level interactions, in terms of how they occur within the sensemaking process. Further, we present use cases for GTM, MDS, and PPCA, illustrating how observation level interaction can be incorporated into visual analytic tools.},

	abstract = {A large number of visualization tools have been created to help decision makers understand increasingly rich databases of product, customer, sales force, and other types of marketing information. This article presents a framework for thinking about how visual representations are likely to affect the decision processes or tasks that marketing managers and consumers commonly face, particularly those that involve the analysis or synthesis of substantial amounts of data. From this framework, the authors derive a set of testable propositions that serve as an agenda for further research. Although visual representations are likely to improve marketing manager efficiency, offer new insights, and increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, they may also bias decisions by focusing attention on a limited set of alternatives, increasing the salience and evaluability of less diagnostic information, and encouraging inaccurate comparisons. Given this, marketing managers are advised to subject insights from visual representations to more formal analysis.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach to visualization recommendation that monitors user behavior for implicit signals of user intent to provide more effective recommendation. This is in contrast to previous approaches which are either insensitive to user intent or require explicit, user specified task information. Our approach, called Behavior-Driven Visualization Recommendation (BDVR), consists of two distinct phases: (1) pattern detection, and (2) visualization recommendation. In the first phase, user behavior is analyzed dynamically to find semantically meaningful interaction patterns using a library of pattern definitions developed through observations of real-world visual analytic activity. In the second phase, our BDVR algorithm uses the detected patterns to infer a user's intended visual task. It then automatically suggests alternative visualizations that support the inferred visual task more directly than the user's current visualization. We present the details of BDVR and describe its implementation within our lab's prototype visual analysis system. We also present study results that demonstrate that our approach shortens task completion time and reduces error rates when compared to behavior-agnostic recommendation.},

Our analysis, supported by observations, system logs, questionnaires, and interview data, explores how pairs approached the problem around the table. We contribute a unique, rich understanding of how users worked together around the table and identify eight types of collaboration styles that can be used to identify how closely people work together while problem solving.

Less often discussed are the increasingly complex analytic and reasoning processes that must be applied in order to accomplish that goal. Success of the visual analytics approach will require us to develop new visualization models that predict how computational processes might facilitate human insight and guide the flow of human reasoning. In this paper, we seek to advance visualization methods by proposing a framework for human ?higher cognition? that extends more familiar perceptual models. Based on this approach, we suggest guidelines for the development of visual interfaces that better integrate complementary capabilities of humans and computers. Although many of these recommendations are novel, some can be found in existing visual analytics applications. In the latter case, much of the value of our contribution lies in the deeper rationale that the model provides for those principles. Lastly, we assess these visual analytics guidelines through the evaluation of several visualization examples.},

In a series of four experiments, participants were given different data visualizations and asked to choose between two treatment options - one with a higher survival rate and complications, or one with a lower survival rate and no complications. Broadly, results indicated most people preferred the latter and including visualizations led to some differences in medical decision-making. This finding was most evident when comparing decisions made with visualizations and decisions made without visualizations. The research also investigated if framing affected medical decision-making and found that across all framing conditions, decisions stayed consistent. However, when health complications were presented in a more or less approach rather than an all or none approach, regardless of visualization type, the majority of people opted for the higher survival rate with more complications. These findings contribute to the ongoing dialogue from previous studies examining the relationship between visualizations, risk communication, and medical decision-making.},

Across a wide variety of contexts, we show that when summarizing evidence, people exhibit a binary bias: a tendency to impose categorical distinctions on continuous data. Evidence is compressed into discrete bins, and the difference between categories forms the summary judgment. The binary bias distorts belief formation—such that when people aggregate conflicting scientific reports, they attend to valence and inaccurately weight the extremity of the evidence. The same effect occurs when people interpret popular forms of data visualization, and it cannot be explained by other statistical features of the stimuli. This effect is not confined to explicit statistical estimates; it also influences how people use data to make health, financial, and public-policy decisions.

We derive a design space comprised of 8 dimensions that can be manipulated to impact a user’s cognitive and analytic processes and describe them through an example hiring scenario.

	abstract = {Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.},

	abstract = {As datasets continue to grow in size and complexity, exploring multidimensional datasets remain challenging for analysts. A common operation during this exploration is drill-down—understanding the behavior of data subsets by progressively adding filters. While widely used, in the absence of careful attention towards confounding factors, drill-downs could lead to inductive fallacies. Specifically, an analyst may end up being “deceived” into thinking that a deviation in trend is attributable to a local change, when in fact it is a more general phenomenon; we term this the drill-down fallacy. One way to avoid falling prey to drill-down fallacies is to exhaustively explore all potential drill-down paths, which quickly becomes infeasible on complex datasets with many attributes. We present VisPilot, an accelerated visual data exploration tool that guides analysts through the key insights in a dataset, while avoiding drilldown fallacies. Our user study results show that VisPilot helps analysts discover interesting visualizations, understand attribute importance, and predict unseen visualizations better than other multidimensional data analysis baselines.},

Faced with a decision, subjects alone have a success rate of 72\%; Aided by a recommender that has a 75\% success rate, their success rate reaches 76\%. The human-system collaboration had thus a greater success rate than each taken alone. However, we noted a complacency/authority bias that degraded the quality of decisions by 5\% when the recommender was wrong. This suggests that any lingering algorithmic bias may be amplified by decision aids. In a second experiment, we evaluated the effectiveness of 5 presentation variants in reducing complacency bias. We found that optional presentation increases subjects' resistance to wrong recommendations. We conclude by arguing that our metrics, in real usage scenarios, where decision aids are embedded as system-wide features in Business Process Management software, can lead to enhanced benefits.},

Research into these biases has sparked a recent burst in interest, and more and more people are aware of possible pitfalls. In this paper, we argue that the consequences of biases during data analysis have to be considered rather than the occurrences themselves. In applying this, we distinguish between (visual) analysis for exploration and validation. Especially the latter turns out to be hard in some cases, indicated by a qualitative measure we call validation cost. Examples are provided of situations with a high validation cost and the role of visualization is discussed in these cases. For cases with a low validation cost, we argue that biases leading to false positives are far better than trying to avoid biases and ending up with false negatives.},

Our results replicated the patterns of biases that have been observed in prior studies oferror bar interpretation.

Therefore, one bedrock principle of science is to minimize that bias by testing the predictions of one's belief against objective data. But interpreting visualized data is a complex perceptual and cognitive process. Through two crowdsourced experiments, we demonstrate that supposedly objective assessments of the strength of a correlational relationship can be influenced by how strongly a viewer believes in the existence of that relationship. Participants viewed scatterplots depicting a relationship between meaningful variable pairs (e.g., number of environmental regulations and air quality) and estimated their correlations. They also estimated the correlation of the same scatterplots labeled instead with generic ‘X’ and ‘Y’ axes. In a separate section, they also reported how strongly they believed there to be a correlation between the meaningful variable pairs. Participants estimated correlations more accurately when they viewed scatterplots labeled with generic axes compared to scatterplots labeled with meaningful variable pairs. Furthermore, when viewers believed that two variables should have a strong relationship, they overestimated correlations between those variables by an r-value of about 0.1. When they believed that the variables should be unrelated, they underestimated the correlations by an r-value of about 0.1. While data visualizations are typically thought to present objective truths to the viewer, these results suggest that existing personal beliefs can bias even objective statistical values people extract from data.},

	abstract = {The collection of large, complex datasets has become common across a wide variety of domains. Visual analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g. tens of thousands of distinct codes in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias-when the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort provenance and visualization, including a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are compared against, and visual encoding of cohort “drift”, which indicates where selection bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization, to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus cohort. These techniques are integrated into a medical temporal event sequence visual analytics tool. We present example use cases and report findings from domain expert user interviews.},

To structure this knowledge, we have developed a typology of cognitive biases based on existing classiﬁcatory frameworks and an integrative literature analysis. This led to a two-dimensional typology combining the psychological view on cognitive biases with a decision process-oriented perspective. As a result, knowledge about 187 cognitive biases that affects decision-making is presented in a practice-oriented structure (viewable at bias.visual-literacy.org).},

In this work, we study whether such effects continue to exist when titles and visualizations exhibit greater degrees of misalignment: titles whose message differs from the visually cued message in the visualization, and titles whose message contradicts the visualization. We found that although titles with a contradictory slant triggered more people to identify bias compared to titles with a miscued slant, visualizations were persistently perceived as impartial by the majority. Further, people’s recall of the visualization’s message more frequently aligned with the titles than the visualization.

Both of these uncertainty-visualization types work well for applications with large amounts of data and with deﬁnite or measurable uncertainties. However, in this paper, we aim to shed light on decision-making applications involving relatively small amounts of data with non-speciﬁc, abstract uncertainties but complex cognitive processes. We present an approach to support decision making in such applications wherein the possible biases in their reasoning processes are directly identiﬁed and addressed using visualizations. We present an example application - the holistic review process in undergraduate admissions in the United States. We identify potential reviewer biases in the process by matching the descriptions of common biases and reasoning heuristics under uncertainty with reviewer tasks ascertained through interviews and observations. We list examples of the biases identiﬁed and provide visualization strategies to mitigate them. While our initial steps look promising, there are also many challenges with this approach that are both speciﬁc to the holistic review process as well as generally applicable.},

	abstract = {Recently, Wall et al. proposed a set of computational metrics for quantifying cognitive bias based on user interaction sequences. The metrics rely on a Markov model to predict a user’s next interaction based on the current interaction. The metrics characterize how a user’s actual interactive behavior deviates from a theoretical baseline, where “unbiased behavior” was previously deﬁned to be equal probabilities of all interactions. In this paper, we analyze the assumptions made of these metrics. We conduct a study in which participants, subject to anchoring bias, interact with a scatterplot to complete a categorization task. Our results indicate that, rather than equal probabilities of all interactions, unbiased behavior across both bias conditions can be better approximated by proximity of data points.},

It demonstrates that an inclusion of an alternative in the choice set can alter one’s preference among the other choices. Although this decoy effect has been universally observed in the real world and also studied by many economists and psychologists, little is known about how to mitigate the decoy effect and help consumers make informed decisions. In this study, we conducted two experiments: a quantitative experiment with crowdsourcing and a qualitative interview study—first, the crowdsourcing experiment to see if visual interfaces can help alleviate this cognitive bias. Four types of visualizations, one-sided bar chart, two-sided bar charts, scatterplots, and parallel-coordinate plots, were evaluated with four different types of scenarios. The results demonstrated that the two types of bar charts were effective in decreasing the decoy effect. Second, we conducted a semi-structured interview to gain a deeper understanding of the decision-making strategies while making a choice. We believe that the results have an implication on showing how visualizations can have an impact on the decision-making process in our everyday life.},

As these systems consider whether to take initiative towards achieving user goals, many current systems address the potential for cognitive bias in human initiatives statically, relying on fixed initiatives they can take instead of identifying, communicating and addressing the bias as it occurs. We argue that mixed-initiative design principles can and should incorporate cognitive bias mitigation strategies directly through development of mitigation techniques embedded in the system to address cognitive biases in situ. We identify domain experts in machine learning adopting visual analytics techniques and systems that incorporate existing mixed-initiative principles and examine their potential to support bias mitigation strategies. This examination considers the unique perspective these experts bring to visual analytics and is situated in existing user-centered systems that make exemplary use of design principles informed by cognitive theory. We then suggest informed opportunities for domain experts to take initiative toward addressing cognitive biases in light of their existing contributions to the field. Finally, we contribute open questions and research directions for designers seeking to adopt visual analytics techniques that incorporate bias-aware initiatives in future systems.},

Recent research has demonstrated that the effect of cognitive biases, anchoring bias in particular, transfers to information visualization and visual analytics. However, it is still unclear how users of visual interfaces can be anchored and the impact of anchoring on user performance and decision-making process. To investigate, we performed two rounds of between-subjects, in-laboratory experiments with 94 participants to analyze the effect of visual anchors and strategy cues in decision-making with a visual analytic system that employs coordinated multiple view design. The decision-making task is identifying misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned one of three treatment groups (including control) in which participant training processes were modified. Our findings reveal that strategy cues and visual anchors (scenario videos) can significantly affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy. We discuss the implications of our experiment results on training users how to use a newly developed visual interface. We call for more careful consideration into how visualization designers and researchers train users to avoid unintentionally anchoring users and thus affecting the end result.},

Here, we show that when people are primed to see one pattern in the data as visually salient, they believe that naïve viewers will experience the same visual salience. Participants were told one of multiple backstories about political events that affected public polling data, before viewing a graph that depicted those data. One pattern in the data was particularly visually salient to them given the backstory that they heard. They then predicted what naïve viewers would most visually salient on the visualization. They were strongly influenced by their own knowledge, despite explicit instructions to ignore it, predicting that others would find the same patterns to be most visually salient. This result reflects a psychological phenomenon known as the curse of knowledge, where an expert struggles to re-create the state of mind of a novice. The present findings show that the curse of knowledge also plagues the visual perception of data, explaining why people can fail to connect with audiences when they communicate patterns in data.},

Technical communicators need to understand cognitive biases and know how to tackle them accordingly. This article devises a framework of principles that provides technical communicators an operable affordance and a vocabulary to approach cognitive biases and to communicate empathetically.
Method: I review a vast body of literature in technical communication with a focus on problems caused by cognitive biases. This work reveals significant problems in information visualization that can provide for a nuanced discussion on cognitive biases in technical communication. Using these problems as a guide, I draw upon cognitive theories in how people use information, the prospect theory about how people make decisions, and the self-determination theory about how such decisions are influenced by the social context. I then assemble a framework of principles that illuminates the workings of cognitive biases. I extrapolate sample questions that technical communicators can use to examine cognitive biases in information visualization and technical communication.
Results: The framework of principles explains how cognitive biases affect technical communication. These principles are useful for gaining a deeper understanding of users from a cognitive bias perspective and optimizing for empathetic communication.
Conclusion: Technical communicators and users are prone to cognitive biases. The framework of principles, cognitive biases, and sample questions presented in this article provide technical communicators a new lens to examine their work and improve user experience.},

We argue that visualization requires a more nuanced perspective. Data are not ends in themselves, but means to an end (such as generating knowledge or assisting in decision-making). Focusing on the presentation of data per se can result in situations where these higher goals are ignored. This is especially the case for situations where cognitive or perceptual biases make the presentation of “just” the data as misleading as willful distortion. We argue that we need to de-sanctify data, and occasionally promote designs which distort or obscure data in service of understanding. We discuss examples of beneﬁcial embellishment, distortion, and obfuscation in visualization, and argue that these examples are representative of a wider class of techniques for going beyond simplistic presentations of data.},

Strategies for minimizing or mitigating these biases, however, remain largely non-technological (e.g., training courses). The growing use of visual analytic (VA) tools for analysis and decision making enables a new class of bias mitigation strategies. In this work, we explore the ways in which the design of visualizations (vis) may be used to mitigate cognitive biases. We derive a design space comprised of 8 dimensions that can be manipulated to impact a user’s cognitive and analytic processes and describe them through an example hiring scenario.

The results demonstrate that managerial cognitive bias plays an important role in inducing business transformation. The higher the degree of managerial overconfidence and overoptimism, the more the enterprise will tend to implement business transformation. An important contribution of the article is that it reveals the significant difference between overconfidence and overoptimism: The more overconfident the managers are, the more likely they are to adopt both internal cultivation and mergers and acquisitions (M\&A) to realize firm business transformation, whereas the more overoptimistic the managers are, the more likely they are to adopt M\&A rather than internal cultivation to realize firm business transformation. Furthermore, business transformation conducted by overconfident managers helps improve firm financial performance and market value, while transformation conducted by overoptimistic managers helps reduce both.},

Different cognitive biases can affect the accuracy of user insights gained during the visual analytics process. However, evaluating bias in visualization usage is challenging and difﬁcult to quantify. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference model based on cognitive science research to ﬁll this gap. We outline the details for this model and the evaluation steps, including an end-to-end demonstration experiment that we performed. The results provide initial validation for using a Bayesian inference model to quantitatively measure bias in visual analytics.},

Unfortunately, human judgment and decision making are imperfect and often plagued by cognitive biases. There is limited empirical research documenting how these biases affect visual data analysis activities. Existing taxonomies are organized by cognitive theories that are hard to associate with visualization tasks. Based on a survey of the literature we propose a task-based taxonomy of 154 cognitive biases organized in 7 main categories. We hope the taxonomy will help visualization researchers relate their design to the corresponding possible biases, and lead to new research that detects and addresses biased judgment and decision making in data visualization.},

However, concerns relating to methodological flaws and ecological validity attenuate how much the current body of knowledge can be applied to real-life operational settings. The current review takes a narrative approach to synthesizing the literature across forensic science. Further, the review considers three main issues: (i) primary research on contextual bias within forensic science; (ii) methodological criticisms of this research; (iii) an alternative perspective that task-irrelevant contextual information does not always lead to error. One suggestion for future research is outlined, which is that studies on contextual bias in forensic decisions should be conducted in collaboration between forensic scientists and cognitive psychologists. Only then can rigorous and ecological valid experiments be created that will be able to assess how task-irrelevant contextual information influences forensic analysis and judgments in operationally valid settings.},

Scientists in the ﬁeld of information visualization propose collaborations between designers and scientists in popular data visualization. They assume that designers put more emphasis on aesthetics than on clarity in their representation of data, and that they aim to convey subjective, rather than objective, information. We investigated designers’ criteria for good design for a broad audience by interviewing professional designers and by reviewing information design handbooks. Additionally, we investigated what might make a visualization aesthetically pleasing (attractive) in the view of the designers. Results show that, according to the information designers, clarity and aesthetics are the main criteria, with clarity being the most important. They aim to objectively inform the public, rather than conveying personal opinions. Furthermore, although aesthetics is considered important, design literature hardly addresses the characteristics of aesthetics, and designers ﬁnd it hard to deﬁne what makes a visualization attractive. The few statements found point at interesting directions for future research.},

For example, the rise and fall of stocks is processed and understood faster by examining the corresponding line graph than looking at the raw underlying numbers. For the effectiveness of this cognitive process several factors have been identiﬁed in research, like for example the background knowledge, as well as its inherent aesthetics qualities. This text focuses on the latter. It has been argued that the higher the aesthetic value of the visualization is, the more engaged the viewer is in trying to decode its meaning. But what does “aesthetics” mean? Does an informative graphic have to be artistic to be effective? Since the perception of aesthetics is a highly subjective matter, what kind of effort should be put into creating a visualization? What connections between aesthetics and information visualization exist anyway? These questions are the subject of the following text. It starts with an introduction to the relevant terms and subﬁelds of aesthetic information visualization research. It then proceeds with a discussion of several examples of information visualization that were created with a strong aesthetic concern. Since these results often resemble works of art, ﬁnally their artistic value is debated.},

Once this view takes shape, we look at how interaction is deﬁned in the ﬁeld of human-computer interaction (HCI). By extracting commonalities and differences between the views of interaction in visualization and in HCI, we synthesize a deﬁnition of interaction for visualization. Our deﬁnition is meant to be a thinking tool and inspire novel and bolder interaction design practices.

Every advance, or change of direction, in the design process is the result of the designer's judgement. But the notion o f judgement is somewhat elusive. What is it? How can we know whether a judgement is good or bad? Can judgement be taught and if so when and how? This paper attempts to answer at least in part these questions. It draws on the work of Sir Geoffrey Vickers, seeking to adapt and relate his ideas on judgement to engineering design. It constructs aframework for design in which judgements are made in three knowledge domains; the formative, the commercial and the instrumental. It then considers the efficacy of contemporary academe and industry in developing the capacity for judgement in the neophyte engineer. It concludes with a broad strategy for teaching design in engineering courses. 0 19917Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Data include audio/video records, field notes, interviews, and student work from a nineweek project. Interaction analysis was used to examine ownership and learning over time. Analysis suggests that providing a relevant yet revisable design problem, giving instruction about design process as iterative, and problematizing a model of design process supported students in taking ownership over the framing of the problem; students were motivated to pose questions and gathered information purposefully, thereby learning in the process.},

	abstract = {How organizations can use practices developed by expert designers to solve today's open, complex, dynamic, and networked problems. When organizations apply old methods of problem-solving to new kinds of problems, they may accomplish only temporary fixes or some ineffectual tinkering around the edges. Today's problems are a new breed—open, complex, dynamic, and networked—and require a radically different response. In this book, Kees Dorst describes a new, innovation-centered approach to problem-solving in organizations: frame creation. It applies “design thinking,” but it goes beyond the borrowed tricks and techniques that usually characterize that term. Frame creation focuses not on the generation of solutions but on the ability to create new approaches to the problem situation itself.The strategies Dorst presents are drawn from the unique, sophisticated, multilayered practices of top designers, and from insights that have emerged from fifty years of design research. Dorst describes the nine steps of the frame creation process and illustrates their application to real-world problems with a series of varied case studies. He maps innovative solutions that include rethinking a store layout so retail spaces encourage purchasing rather than stealing, applying the frame of a music festival to understand late-night problems of crime and congestion in a club district, and creative ways to attract young employees to a temporary staffing agency. Dorst provides tools and methods for implementing frame creation, offering not so much a how-to manual as a do-it-yourself handbook—a guide that will help practitioners develop their own approaches to problem-solving and creating innovation.},

We set out to recreate a commonly reported learning phenomenon within a trust acquisition environment: Users learning which algorithms can and cannot be trusted to reduce traffic in a city. We failed to replicate (after repeated efforts) the learning phenomena of ‘blocking’, resulting in a finding that people consistently make a very specific error in trust assignment to cues in conditions of uncertainty. This error can be seen as a cognitive bias and has important implications for HCI.},

	abstract = {Complex sustainability challenges may never be fully solved, rather requiring continuous, adaptive, and reﬂexive responses over time. Engagement of this nature departs from well-structured problems that entail expected solutions; here, focus shifts toward ill-structured or ill-deﬁned issues characterized by wickedness. In the context of complex challenges, inadequate or absent framing has performative implications on action. By overlooking the value of framing, eventual responses may not only fall short; they may even displace, prolong, or exacerbate situations by further entrenching unsustainability. In educational settings, we know little about how curriculum designs support challenge framing, and how students experience and learn framing processes. In this paper we explore a transdisciplinary “Challenge Lab” (C-Lab) curriculum from a perspective of challenge framing. When considering framing in higher education, we turn to the agenda in education for, as and with sustainable development to be problem-solving, solutions-seeking or challenge-driven. We introduce framing as a boundary object for transformative praxis, where sustainability is held to be complex and contextual. This study is qualitative and case-based, designed to illuminate processes of and experiences into sustainability challenge framing in a transdisciplinary learning setting. Methodologically, we draw from student reﬂective diaries that span the duration of a curriculum design. We structure our results with the support of three consecutive lenses for understanding “curriculum”: intended, enacted, and experienced curriculum. First, we present and describe a C-Lab approach at the level of ambition and design. Here it is positioned as a student-centered space, process, and institutional conﬁguration, working with framing and re-framing complex sustainability challenges in context. Second, we present a particular C-Lab curriculum design that unfolded in 2020. Third, we illustrate the lived experiences and practical realities of participating in C-Lab as students and as teachers. We reﬂect upon dilemmas that accompany challenge framing in C-Lab and discuss the methodological implications of this study. Finally, we point toward fruitful research avenues that may extend understandings of challenge framing in higher education.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examine how multiple and sometimes conﬂicting goals are prioritized and pursued in organizations. Theories of coalitions and political behavior address prioritization among goals and changes in goal emphasis over time but cannot accurately predict the behavior of organizations that pursue conﬂicting goals. By linking theories of performance feedback theory and variable risk preferences, we show that performance shortfalls relative to aspirations on multiple goals can trigger managerial concerns for organizational failure. In such situations, the goal perceived as more important for survival gets priority and triggers stronger reactions. Empirically, we examine how airlines’ dual focus on safety and proﬁtability affects decisions regarding ﬂeet changes. In the airline industry, safety and proﬁtability have clear conﬂicts (at least in the short term) owing to the costs of replacing aircraft models with poor safety records. We ﬁnd evidence that airlines pursue ﬂeet safety goals, but the nature and extent of that pursuit depend on whether the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability goals are being met. As predicted, the responsiveness to safety goals is strengthened by low proﬁtability because safety is associated more closely with survival. The study augments existing research on multiple goals by emphasizing the nature of goal interdependencies and its implications for behavior in organizations.},

Our analysis is intended both as a means of exemplifying how the approach can be applied to design, and as empirical groundwork for sketching out what a CA program of research in design studies could oﬀer the ﬁeld.

Yet recent work on visual integration and change direction reveals that we are surprisingly unaware of the details of our environment from one view to the next: we often do not detect large changes to objects and scenes (?change blindness?). Furthermore, without attention, we may not even perceive objects (?inattentional blindness?). Taken together, these findings suggest that we perceive and remember only those objects and details that receive focused attention. In this paper, we briefly review and discuss evidence for these cognitive forms of ?blindness?. We then present a new study that builds on classic studies of divided visual attention to examine inattentional blindness for complex objects and events in dynamic scenes. Our results suggest that the likelihood of noticing an unexpected object depends on the similarity of that object to other objects in the display and on how difficult the priming monitoring task is. Interestingly, spatial proximity of the critical unattended object to attended locations does not appear to affect detection, suggesting that observers attend to objects and events, not spatial positions. We discuss the implications of these results for visual representations and awareness of our visual environment.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce the main notions and first applications of a unified design theory. We call it “C-K theory” because it stands that a formal distinction between spaces of “Concepts” (C) and space of “Knowledge” (K) is a condition for design. This distinction has key properties: i) it identifies the oddness of “Design” when compared to problem solving approaches ; ii) it distinguishes C-K theory from existing design theories like German systematic as C-K theory offers a precise definition of design and builds creativity within such definition. It does not require the too restrictive assumptions of General Design Theory [1] or Universal Design Theory [2]. It establishes that design reasoning is linked to a fundamental issue in set theory: the “choice” axiom. It models the dynamics of design as a joint-expansion of a space of concepts and a space of Knowledge needing four operators C!K, K!C, C!C, K!K. They compose what can be imaged as a “design square”. These operators capture the variety of design situations and the dynamics of innovative design.},

	abstract = {Capitalizing on any new or unfamiliar manufacturing technology requires an ability to look beyond the manufacturing limitations that have constrained one’s design ideas in the past. For advanced manufacturing technology with unique capabilities such as additive manufacturing, this becomes critical for designing effective geometric features and parts. However, cognitive bias or fixation on familiar manufacturing processes may make it challenging for designers to determine how to take advantage of a new manufacturing technology. For example, a person that is used to generating design ideas for subtractive manufacturing may struggle when asked to use additive manufacturing. This research is the first to provide evidence that fixation on certain manufacturing types can impact designers’ ability to utilize new, and less familiar, technologies during idea generation. We call this new form of design fixation Manufacturing Fixation in Design (MFD), which we define as unconscious and often unintentional adherence to a limited set of manufacturing processes and/or constraints and capabilities during the design ideation process. A workshop-based study with industry practitioners confirms that MFD exists and introduces a method to assess its impact. Specifically, a Design for Additive Manufacturing workshop given at an aerospace technology company with professional engineering designers explores how MFD manifests and how it can be measured. Implications of the results on practice and education are discussed along with future studies to delineate the drivers of MFD in design professionals.},

The DPCM enables design teams to conduct various useful analyses, which enhance the understanding of DPC effects on process performance, support process execution through suggesting mitigating reactions to DPCs, and support process planning through identifying and prioritising the ‘right’ DPCs.

Whereas expert designers actively interrogate and reframe given problems, novice designers tend to solve them as given.

We found that innovative styles and framings corresponded to higher perceptions of idea diversity and creativity, whereas adaptive framings corresponded to lower perceptions of idea creativity and perceptions of greater diﬃculty generating ideas. Novice designers may hold implicit theories of creativity that undervalue adaptive creativity. However, problem frames that misalign with a novice’s preferred cognitive style can impact their ideation, and so hold promise for challenging their initial interpretations and approaches.

In so doing, we demonstrate that probes can facilitate the sharing of users’ tacit knowing and expertise (i) by making and explicating individual users’ perspectives, (ii) by enabling participants to take each other’s perspective and make a joint perspective and (iii) by subsequently enabling the making of a joint vision on the digital design outcome.

More recendy with the development of expert systems, considerable attention has been focussed on the representation and retrieval of expert knowledge. What has not been addressed however is whether or not an expert represents, accesses and utilises all knowledge equivalently. The design fixation effect, where pictures of design instances presented as part of a design problem result in the reproduction, by student and practicing designers, of aspects of the presented instance, would appear to indicate that certain types of knowledge are more privileged in the design process than others. The results of a preliminary experiment examining the role of pictures of different types of instances, verbal descriptions of these instances and variations in the familiarity of instances in the fixation effect are reported. Pictorial information was shown to have no effect if the instance was unfamiliar and equally familiar pictures were found to produce both design fixation and increased variety in design. Verbal descriptions of two of the pictured designs also produced effects although they were much reduced in comparison to the pictorial material that produced fixation effects. While preliminary, these results would appear to indicate a particularly important direction for research the results of which could be important for artificial intelligence, the study of design and the psychology of design processes.},

	abstract = {Design and technology (D\&T) educators have pointed to a ‘crisis’ in creativity within the subject. Creative cognition literature suggests lack of creativity in design work is at least partly the result of ‘fixation’ (difficulty in generating novel ideas due to imagination being ‘structured’ by pre-existing knowledge). This paper applies these ideas in the context of current practice in D\&T to shed light on how students generate design ideas and how a particular teaching approach, product analysis, influences these processes. Data are reported from the six schools involved in the preliminary phase of a Gatsby-funded ongoing research and intervention project1. A number of methods including interviews with D\&T teachers (N=14) and focus groups of students (N=126), lesson observations (N=10) and an analysis of documents and student work were utilised to address the question: ‘How does the use of product analysis contribute to fixation in secondary school students’ design work?’ Product analysis was found to be frequently used by teachers at different points in design and make projects, particularly during initial research work prior to the generation of design ideas and as a starting point for the generation of ideas during an idea generation lesson. Example of these different uses of product analysis are outlined, however the impact each has on students’ generation of design ideas was similar: current practice leads to fixation as thinking is constrained down a particular path. Implications for practice are noted.},

However, neuroimaging studies have recently demonstrated that exposure to examples did not systematically lead to fixation and could on the contrary have a stimulation effect on creativity. Our hypothesis is that there are two types of examples that C-K theory helps to characterize: (1) restrictive examples that do not change the definition or the attributes of the object, and (2) expansive examples that modify its identity by adding unexpected attributes. In two studies, we explored the impact of restrictive and expansive examples on a creative task. We then hypothesized that the introduction of an example during the task would provoke participants to propose solutions of a higher originality when the provided example was expansive. In contrast, when the provided example was restrictive, we hypothesized that the originality of the solutions would be reduced. Results confirmed that solutions proposed by the group exposed to restrictive example are less original than those given by groups exposed to expansive examples.},

	abstract = {Despite diverse studies grasping at different aspects of fixation in creativity and design reasoning, the underlying mechanisms of fixation, i.e. the processes that lead to being fixed on a small number of unvaried solutions, are still unclear. We propose a theoretical framework to model fixation based on C-K design theory, in which fixation is characterized as a set of restrictive heuristics activated in a creative reasoning. Thus, a restrictive heuristic is a design reasoning that uses only spontaneously activated knowledge in the K space and restrictive partitions in the C space. Any expansion in the design reasoning will then lead to explore solutions outside of fixation, characterizing expansive reasoning. We then use a creative task to test our framework. We apply our theoretical frame on this task to characterize the fixation effects that can occur and we confront this model with a set of experiments, where 142 participants where asked to generate solutions to this task. We show how different populations can be fixed in different ways and how the theoretical framework we propose allows making sense of this variety of fixation in design processes.},

The aim of the study is to analyse different modalities of examples, such as text, photograph, diagram, object as stimulation and to examine the impact of quantity, abstraction, proximity and method on each modality in design education. The paper reviews empirical studies of idea exposure from the existing literature and summarizes results relevant to understanding the effects of the design examples. Overall, to avoid the potential negative effect of using examples in different modalities, designers could pay attention quantity, abstraction, and proximity of examples for each modality.},

As part of the study, the participants were divided into three groups and asked to individually design a water kettle in 20 min. Participants from the first group were each given an identical patent document at the start of the experiment and were warned not to infringe the patented design. Participants from the second group were each given another patent document and the same warning. Participants from the third group were not given any patent documentation. The experiment results show that reviewing patent documents prior to ideation, even when done to avoid infringement, can fixate and lead to the inclusion of design features associated with the patent documents reviewed. In addition, reviewing patent documents can also cause distractions and result in the exclusion of design features that may otherwise be included. The findings of this work can contribute towards design pedagogy and the development of processes to handle patent documents in design projects.},

	title = {Design, meaning making and constructive fixation},
	abstract = {Current debates in design question the effects of “fixation.” On the one hand, to be creative, designers should avoid fixing the meaning of objects or proposals, On the other hand, positive effects of fixation have also been observed in various design practices. For instance, “early fixation” or “early crystallization” have been conceptualized as ways that significantly help starting the design work without limiting its creative potential. To understand these contrasting positions, we take a semiotic perspective on the phenomenon of fixation. Peirce’s triadic model of sign (representamen, object, interpretant), defines meaning making as an infinite process through the “interpretant” based on personal and social experience. Fixation is therefore a basic semiotic condition through which human beings make sense of the world. As pointed by Peirce, the “final” interpretant is the way by which we can actually communicate meaning to further expand it. Following on this model and the Peircean categories (firstness, secondness, thirdness) we identify three different ways in design that structure how meaning making can be stabilized, e.g.: the feeling of some potential (firstness); the combination of events or things (secondness); the establishment of a belief, habit or law (thirdness).},

The relationship between fixation and creativity within engineering is mixed, as engineers desire to be innovative, yet are usually working from their existing knowledge to redesign existing products.

We compared concepts for garbage collection systems generated by two groups – one provided with an example product (Example group), and another who did not receive an example product (No Example group). Using metrics established in prior publications, we found that seniors had higher levels of originality than freshmen whether an example product was received or not, reinforcing our previous findings. Fixation scores were higher for the group that did have an example. Receiving an example product was not a predictor of originality on its own, but did interact with curriculum and fixation level. Within the group that received an example product, there was a negative relationship between fixation and originality, particularly for the seniors. Within the group that did not receive an example product, there was no significant relationship between fixation and originality. Further analysis of our results are required to delineate how not receiving an example product influences design approach in freshmen and senior engineering students.},

Though, not much effort has been put in identifying of the factors disrupting creativity. One phenomenon that acts as an obstacle to creativity in design, or detracts from it, is the phenomenon of fixation. The term “design fixation” is often used interchangeably to refer to situations where designers limit their creative output because of an overreliance on features of preexisting designs, or more generally, an overreliance on a specific body of knowledge directly associated with a problem. It is understood as the inability to solve design problems by employing a typical or familiar method, ignoring new or better ones. In this research, an attempt has been made to investigate the factors that create fixation in design by examining how the previous knowledge of designers affects design. This way, a structure was presented to better understand the factors of fixation in the stages of the design process. Then it was explored what the differences and similarities in designers with different levels of expertise are. Finally, the formation of fixation in the design process stages, under the influence of the designers expertise level as an intervening variable, was explained. And so, the designers will be able to recognize the causes of their fixation and prevent fixation in design or at least reduce its amount. Also, design teachers, with awareness of these causes, will be able to guide students to stay away from this phenomenon.},

Students participating in the design experience were divided into two functional groups: laboratory sections where a prototype exemplar was present and laboratory sections where no example was provided. Assessment of the prototype exemplar impact was accomplished through a two-pronged approach. First, through photographs and performance data taken at multiple stages in the design experience and analyzed by the faculty, and second, through a twelve-statement survey given to all students. In addition to assigning numerical values (on a scale from 1 to 6) for their responses to the survey statements, students were asked to respond with short, written statements.},

Our goal is to find ways to improve the early mastering of DT (Diverging Thinking) and CT (Converging Thinking) skills, which in turn will help them to develop their creative abilities. The case study presented here indicates that the children showed adherence to the initial design idea and a lack of openness for divergent thinking at some points in the later stages of the design process, which led to little or no development of their design idea. Furthermore, we observed that the occurrence of design fixation in later stages of the design process has a negative influence on the creative development of the design idea. We grouped moments indicating design fixation into four categories that emerged from the data, which we named: “Band-aids”, “Already taken care of”, “Question not used for elaboration” and “It’s not possible”. We expect that these categories we found, which could be classified as indicators, will be helpful for a facilitator in identifying design fixation during the design process and adjusting the facilitation techniques accordingly. We expect these indicators to be present in sessions with students on different educational levels, which make these findings relevant to the education of future design professionals.},

One critical question these designers face is how these analogues should be represented in order to minimize design fixation and maximize idea generation. To address this question, an experiment is presented that compares various representations’ influence on creativity and design fixation. This experiment presents an effective example (analogue) as computer-aided design (CAD), sketch, or photograph representations. We found that all representations induced fixation, and the degree of fixation did not vary significantly. We also found that CAD representations encourage engineering designers to identify and copy the key effective features of the example. CAD and photo representations also produced a higher quality of design concepts. Results from this experiment offer insights into how these various representations may be used in examples during idea generation; CAD representations appear to offer the greatest advantages during the idea generation process. The results from this experiment also indicate that analogical databases of effective design examples should include CAD and photolike images of the analogue rather than sketches.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore the early indicators of design fixation occurring during the concept development stage of children’s design processes. This type of fixation, which we named: concept fixation, causes a blind adherence to the current (possibly unfavourable) state of a design idea. Its occurrence hampers the creative thinking processes present in a design process, which in turn stagnates the development of initial design ideas into final designs. Until now, research on design fixation has mainly focussed on creative idea generation in the early phases of the design process through analysing (intermediate) design ideas and completed artefacts. However, children’s fixation behaviours might be identified at an earlier moment through the conversations that take place in the classroom about their design ideas. To this end, we present a case study in which we explored early indicators of concept fixation of a group of 24 primary school children (ages 9–11) carrying out a co-design project. Fixation was observed through the manner in which the design teams responded to questions and comments from their peers and the client. Four categories of response behaviours indicating concept fixation emerged from the verbal data, namely: ‘band-aids’, ‘already-in-there’, ‘question-not-relevant’ and ‘it’s-not-possible’. We expect that the indicators will be helpful in identifying concept fixation during the design process, especially in an educational context. The process of identification of fixation, and reflecting on it, creates awareness. This is considered as an important step by professional designers towards guarding oneself from fixation episodes in future projects, and thus being more creative.},

Investigating expert architects’ sketches demonstrated that there is a stage in the inspiration design process that introduced the middle stage. The importance of this stage has been recognized by the literature of design by analogy method and the theory of structural mapping. In this study, the effect of educating designers with middle sketching stage on originality of design outcome was investigated. 95 undergraduate architecture students took part in an experiment and designed by inspiration from defined sources. The control group participants don’t receive middle stage training. The results indicated that the novice designers that have correct middle sketching stage, received better design outcome originality score.

	abstract = {As a solution to ambiguity and complexity within the idea generation stage, several structured idea generation methods have been developed. Though their usefulness in the idea generation phase has been veriﬁed in many studies, methods or techniques designed to help people generate ideas often lead to associations that hinder people’s free thinking. This phenomenon is called design ﬁxation. Many research studies on design ﬁxation has shown that it severely limits creativity. One of the reasons why design ﬁxation is difﬁcult to overcome is that designers are often unaware of its occurrence during ideation –in other words, designers lose situation awareness in the middle of a cognitively demanding ideation task. An ability to maintain situation awareness, and, thereby, detect and address design ﬁxation in a timely manner would greatly help designers effectively perform ideation. Surprisingly, little research has examined the inﬂuences of situation awareness on design ﬁxation and ideation outcomes, or, has developed systems for supporting such situation awareness. To bridge the gap, we developed a situation awareness support system which indicates the elapsed time during idea generation and how many times the user, who is generating ideas, has used each stimulus employed to inspire idea generation. The situation awareness support system helps designers easily and rapidly identify occurrences of design ﬁxation. Finally, an experimental method for examining the impacts of the situation awareness support system has been established.},

	abstract = {In the current competitive world, engineers must be innovative to be competitive and these skills must be taught. Physical representation is a likely tool to assist in being innovative. Guidelines do not exist for when physical representation should be implemented in the design process. Past studies provide conflicting results on the effects of physical representations on cognition. An observational study of an industrial team shows that physical representations could cause design fixation. In contract, a controlled lab study conducted by the authors failed to reproduce this result. One possible explanation is the sunk cost theory from behavioral economics, which states that people show the tendency to continue with the chosen path based on the amount of time, money and effort already put in. The controlled lab experiment used a fairly simple design problem whereas the other study contained a more complex design problem, thus the observed differences in apparent design fixation could be due to the sunk cost effect. This work in progress paper investigates sunk cost as an explanation for the result differences. This paper proposes an experiment to test the sunk cost effect with physical representation and discusses the future work along with possible implications of the results.},

	abstract = {Design fixation is often thought of only as a limiting factor when a designer is generating ideas, but design fixation is defined only as ‘sometimes counter-productive’ indicating that there may be room for good fixation. In addition, design fixation is defined as a ‘blind adherence’, meaning that the designer does not know that they are limiting their idea set. Prior work in fixation has focused on how introducing designers to bad examples can cause a negative adherence to a limited set of ideas, while work in design by analogy has focused on how introducing a designer to the right idea can positively impact the creative output of idea generation. In addition, product dissection has been investigated as a way to inspire creative design with positive results. While researchers have investigated good examples for their positive impact on the creativity of generated ideas, little work has investigated how these good examples are having a positive impact. Therefore, this study aims to understand how exposing designers to different types of products through a product dissection activity impacts how designers are reusing parts in their ideation. In addition, this study investigates if these reuses are unconscious through the use of eye tracking equipment. The results show that reuse of parts is positively related to an individual’s creativity during idea generation. In addition, they show that there is no relationship between eye fixations and design fixation, indicating that reuse might not be unconscious. Overall, the results shed a positive light on reuse and design fixation.},

	abstract = {Formal theories of design have described design as a quest for the fit between two spaces such as form-context, solution-problem, structure-function and presently Technology-Environment (T-E). On the contrary, existing methods tempt to focus on E; most engineering disciplines serve T; designers are consequently left barehanded to apply formal principles. More specifically a design method should help to overcome design fixations and enable to steer T-E double exploration. First we extend Concept-Knowledge formalism by defining the inverse C-K of a considered C-K, i.e. the knowledge base is put into question to formulate a new initial concept and the initial concept has an assumed logical status to become the new knowledge base concept. In this configuration, one C-K can benefit from expansions of the other. Second a method is deduced by applying this principle to the T-E framework: designers should steer their exploration by drawing simultaneously T C-K and E C-K. Four empirical cases are analysed. The results suggest that the method enables to identify a maximum of fits before converging on one when used from the start or can provide defixating knowledge expansions when not.},

	abstract = {It has been well established that introduction of physical artifacts early in the design process can limit the potential solution set in terms of diversity, innovation and number of ideas generated. This limiting effect is known as “design fixation.” While the potential for design fixation exists, concrete, tangible, and physical perceptions of the design task may also be very beneficial during the ideation process. For example, it may increase the feasibility of the concepts generated. Physical testing of preliminary ideas may enable such perceptions. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to understand, at least at the basic and preliminary levels, the role of physical testing and artifacts in the early stages of the design process. To this end, the contemporary design process was augmented with an Early Prototyping Experience (EPE), where the intent was to increase critical understanding of the design problem while maintaining the innovativeness and diversity of the concepts. An experiment was undertaken which included the use of a “control” group that did not participate in the EPE, as well as the “experimental” group that did develop an early prototype. The output from a concept generation exercise for the two groups was rated by experts to determine the level of innovation, diversity and feasibility of the ideas. Experts’ ratings for innovativeness and diversity were very similar between the control and experimental groups indicating that, in these two areas, design fixation was not evident. However, results indicated that the experimental group did experience some level of fixation based on the fact that they generated 30\% less unique ideas than did the control group. Feasibility of the ideas was, however, much higher for the experimental group. Because of these mixed results concerning design fixation and the fact that there are other potential benefits of early prototyping, it remains a point of discussion as to whether the EPE has an overall negative or positive effect on the design process.},

The first-step recognition model of body language using transfer learning based on a pretrained VGG-16 convolutional neural network was constructed. The average recognition rate achieved by the VGG-16 model was 92.03\%. Then, the frames of recognized body language were used as input vectors to the second-step fixation classification model based on support vector machine (SVM).

	abstract = {Design fixation has been described as a lack of flexibility in relation to a limited set of design ideas. This study empirically sought to use different strategies to overcome various forms of design fixation. As strategic approaches to negating design fixation, a digital world that has no physical limitations was selected as a thinking expansion motif and an abstract task was given as a design problem. It was anticipated that combining limitlessness of the digital world with an abstract design task would break design fixation, leading to a creative design process. The results supported the usefulness of the adopted strategies. The combination of the digital context and the design task overcame participants’ design fixation and encouraged the creative design process by generating thinking expansion. Further, combining ‘Team Based Learning’ and an ‘abstract design task in a digital context’ led to natural brainstorming and problem solving that exhibited co-evolution. In conclusion, the digital context is one of promising strategies that could be used as a thinking motif to expand students’ design thinking and promote ‘creativity’ in education.},

In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework to model fixation based on C-K design theory, which states that fixation is characterised as a set of restrictive heuristics activated in creative reasoning. We applied our framework in a set of experiments. We demonstrated how this framework makes sense of the varieties of fixation in design processes. We conclude by proposing three capabilities to understand fixation and overcome it: restrictive heuristics development, inhibitory control and expansion.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the use of heuristics as cognitive strategies invoked during the process of design. Heuristics are reasoning processes that do not guarantee the best solution, but often lead to potential solutions by providing a simple cognitive “shortcut.” We propose that designers use specific design heuristics to explore the problem space of potential designs, leading to the generation of creative solutions. We test whether design heuristics can be taught to novices, and suggest their use will facilitate the design process at multiple levels of instruction. In the present empirical study, we evaluate a set of six instructional heuristics and validate their effectiveness with product concepts generated by novice designers. Six hundred seventy-three drawings were created by 120 first-year college students under four instructional conditions. Drawings were coded according to their content, use of heuristics, creativity, and practicality. The most creative concepts emerged from the experimental conditions where heuristics were introduced. Heuristics appeared to help the participants “jump” to a new problem space, resulting in more varied designs, and a greater frequency of designs judged as more creative. Our findings suggest that simple demonstration of design heuristics may, at times, be sufficient to stimulate divergent thinking, perhaps because these heuristics are readily grasped and contextual application is not required. Based on these findings, a conceptual model for design education emphasizing the importance of using a variety of heuristics is proposed. This model suggests that learning can be enhanced through exposure to a variety of design heuristics, and can supplement formal education and foster personal development in design learning.},

	abstract = {Concept generation techniques can help to support designers in generating multiple ideas during design tasks. However, differences in the ways these techniques guide idea generation are not well understood. This study investigated the qualities of concepts generated by beginning engineering designers using one of three different idea generation techniques. Working individually on an open-ended engineering design problem, 102 first year engineering students learned and applied one of three different ideation techniques—design heuristics, morphological analysis, or individual brainstorming (using brainstorming rules to generate ideas working alone)—to a given design problem. Using the consensual assessment technique, all concepts were rated for creativity, elaboration, and practicality, and all participants' concept sets were rated for quantity and diversity. The simplest technique, individual brainstorming, led to the most concepts within the short (25 minute) ideation session. All three techniques produced creative concepts averaging near the scale midpoint. The elaboration of the concepts was significantly higher with design heuristics and morphological analysis techniques, and the practicality was significantly higher using design heuristics. Controlling for number of concepts generated, there were no significant differences in diversity of solution sets across groups. These results demonstrate that the use of design heuristics does not limit the creativity of ideation outcomes, and helps students to develop more elaborate and practical ideas. Design heuristics show advantages in the initial idea generation phase for beginning engineering students. These findings point to specific strengths in different ideation techniques, and the value of exposing beginning designers to multiple techniques for idea generation.},

As a critical step in this research program, this study showed that the generic-parts technique can help people unearth the types of obscure features that can be used to overcome functional fixedness, which is a classic inhibitor to problem solving. Subjects trained on this technique solved on average 67\% more problems than a control group did. By devising techniques that facilitate the noticing of obscure features in order to overcome impediments to problem solving (e.g., design fixation), researchers can systematically create a tool kit of innovationenhancing techniques.},

But how might these platforms best leverage the number and diversity of contributors to help each contributor generate even better ideas? Prior research suggests that seeing particularly creative or diverse ideas from others can inspire you, but few scalable mechanisms exist to assess diversity. We contribute a new scalable crowd-powered method for evaluating the diversity of sets of ideas. The method relies on similarity comparisons (is idea A more similar to B or C?) generated by non-experts to create an abstract spatial idea map. Our validation study reveals that human raters agree with the estimates of dissimilarity derived from our idea map as much or more than they agree with each other. People seeing the diverse sets of examples from our idea map generate more diverse ideas than those seeing randomly selected examples. Our results also corroborate ﬁndings from prior research showing that people presented with creative examples generated more creative ideas than those who saw a set of random examples. We see this work as a step toward building more effective online systems for supporting large scale collective ideation.},

	title = {Playing games with fixation: {Linking} psychology and design research to develop computer‐based tasks to study how designers are affected by mental set},
	abstract = {The term ‘fixation’ was originally used by psychologists to describe the variety of blocks that can impede insight, often resulting from the counterproductive effects of prior knowledge (Smith, 1995). In psychology research, fixation is studied through the use of creative problem-solving tasks in which performance is typically measured by assessing the participants’ ability to identify unusual or novel solutions or by assessing the time taken to accomplish the task. In design research, the term ‘design fixation’ is understood as a broader set of unfavorable phenomena; it describes how designers may unconsciously adhere to a limited set of ideas during concept generation (Jansson and Smith, 1991). In an attempt to study design fixation in a way that represents something of the nature of design practice, researchers typically set participants open-ended design problems and measure their performance through a variety of highly subjective metrics. This particular experimental approach to studying design fixation gives rise to various methodological problems, including limited opportunities for data capture and highly subjective assessment procedures. There is also variation in how these procedures are implemented, leading to difficulty in comparing the results of different studies. In order to overcome these methodological limitations, this position paper proposes studying design fixation with computer games inspired by experimental paradigms used in psychology research. This will permit better data capture, a more objective analysis of design behavior and will also allow for a better connection to be established between design fixation research and the broader set of psychological studies.},

One of the most common methods of tackling fixation is to warn people of fixation risks and instruct them to avoid constrained problem framing and solution search. However, such treatments are often ineffective. One possible explanation for this is that people typically believe that they (as individuals) are less vulnerable to a specified risk than other people are (in general). If we really want to motivate people to guard against a risk, we need to demonstrate that they, as individuals, are vulnerable to those risks. To study the effect of demonstrating individual vulnerability to fixation, we conducted an online experimental study using number and word tasks that both included a fixation 'trap.' The first task was used to provide a 'demonstrated vulnerability' treatment (revealing participants' own fixated behavior) to the experimental group. This group outperformed those who received a comparable 'asserted vulnerability' treatment (a warning about general fixation effects) and also those in a control group.

This reduced ‘idea fluency’ is generally explained as participants’ creativity being constrained by the example they have seen.

We investigated this hypothesis experimentally and found that whereas participants exposed to an example (in the form of an annotated sketch) generated less ideas in general, they produced more sketches and more detailed representations than those not exposed to the example.

Participants were asked to solve a design problem, having been exposed to either a concrete example design, an abstract system property, both, or no stimulus at all. Their design work was assessed according to four metrics: fluency, diversity, commonness, and conformity. Exposure to either the example design or the system property reduced the fluency and diversity of ideas, and exposure to both stimuli reduced these measures even further. Whilst there was no difference in the inspiration effects from the example and the property in terms of fluency, diversity, and commonness; results for conformity showed that each stimulus constrained participants differently: encouraging ideas similar to one type of stimulus while discouraging ideas similar to the other type. In combination with other work on inspiration and fixation, these findings can help shape how design is taught and how inspiration tools are developed.},

Metrics to evaluate design exploration are thus necessary to make conclusions and comparisons among idea generation methods. Metrics have previously been proposed, identifying novelty, variety, quantity, and quality to characterize sets of designs and the degree to which they describe design space exploration. This article describes ﬂaws in the variety metric and proposes a new metric to eliminate the ﬂaws. Additionally, a single metric is proposed to evaluate the quality of design space exploration during concept generation, enabling application of a single metric to compare idea generation processes and methodologies.

	abstract = {Advances in innovation processes are critically important as economic and business landscapes evolve. There are many concept generation techniques that can assist a designer in the initial phases of design. Unfortunately, few studies have examined these techniques that can provide evidence to suggest which techniques should be preferred or how to implement them in an optimal way. This study systematically investigates the underlying factors of four common and well-documented techniques: brainsketching, gallery, 6-3-5, and C-sketch. These techniques are resolved into their key parameters, and a rigorous factorial experiment is performed to understand how the key parameters affect the outcomes of the techniques. The factors chosen for this study with undergraduate mechanical engineers include how concepts are displayed to participants (all are viewed at once or subsets are exchanged between participants, i.e., “rotational viewing”) and the mode used to communicate ideas (written words only, sketches only, or a combination of written words and sketches). Four metrics are used to evaluate the data: quantity, quality, novelty, and variety. The data suggest that rotational viewing of sets of concepts described using sketches combined with words produces more ideas than having all concepts displayed in a “gallery view” form, but a gallery view results in more high quality concepts. These results suggest that a hybrid of methods should be used to maximize the quality and number of ideas. The study also shows that individuals gain a significant number of ideas from their teammates. Ideas, when shared, can foster new idea tracks, more complete layouts, and a diverse synthesis. Finally, as teams develop more concepts, the quality of the concepts improves. This result is a consequence of the team-sharing environment and, in conjunction with the quantity of ideas, validates the effectiveness of group idea generation. This finding suggests a way to go beyond the observation that some forms of brainstorming can actually hurt productivity.},

A further consistent theme to emerge in our review concerns the central role played by metacognitive monitoring and control processes in ensuring the eﬀective deployment of design strategies in response to designers’ ﬂuctuating feelings of uncertainty. We argue that a metacognitive perspective on design cognition is critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of strategic processing in design, additionally engendering many new avenues for important future research.

An experiment manipulated whether independent novice designers created graphic Web advertisements in parallel or in series. Serial participants received descriptive critique directly after each prototype. Parallel participants created multiple prototypes before receiving feedback. As measured by click-through data and expert ratings, ads created in the Parallel condition significantly outperformed those from the Serial condition. Moreover, independent raters found Parallel prototypes to be more diverse. Parallel participants also reported a larger increase in task-specific self-confidence.

Statistically based Design of Experiments (DOE) principles were used in developing the guidelines. Four classes of operating variables were considered to characterize the design problem and the environment. The effectiveness metrics proposed are based on outcome and consists of the quantity, quality, novelty, and variety of ideas generated. Two experimental approaches have been developed. In the Direct Method, the influence of the type of design problem and various parameters related to the procedure of an idea generation method is measured by using the method in its entirety. In the Indirect Method, each idea generation method is decomposed into key components and its overall effectiveness is predicted by experimentally studying the effectiveness of its components and their mutual interactions.

	abstract = {Background One of the goals of most undergraduate engineering curricula is to prepare students to solve openended design problems. Solving design problems requires applying technical knowledge to create original ideas and turn those into practical applications. However, the impact of engineering curricula on the innovation capabilities of undergraduate engineers is not well understood. Purpose (Hypothesis) This study seeks to provide insights into the research question of whether freshman undergraduate engineering students can be more innovative than seniors. Innovation is measured in terms of the originality of the solutions they propose for an open-ended design problem, as well as the technical feasibility of those solutions for practical application. Design/Method Freshman- and senior-level undergraduate engineering students were tasked with developing solutions to a specific design problem (a next-generation alarm clock). Both levels of students used a modified 6-3-5/C-sketch method for generating concepts. A fraction of both the freshman and the senior students also received innovation enhancement. Resulting concepts were analyzed for originality and technical feasibility. Results Freshman students generated concepts that were significantly more original than those of seniors, with no significant difference in quality or technical feasibility of the concepts generated by the two levels of students. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study, the findings suggest that freshman engineering students can be more innovative than their senior-level counterparts. This motivates the need for additional studies to investigate the effect of factors such as skill acquisition and design curricula on the innovation capabilities of students.},

Participants who continually alternated back and forth between two creativity tasks outperformed both participants who switched between the tasks at their discretion and participants who attempted one task for the ﬁrst half of the allotted time before switching to the other task for the second half. Importantly, Studies 3a–3d reveal that people overwhelmingly fail to adopt a continual-switch approach when incentivized to choose a task switching strategy that would maximize their creative performance.

We used a creative task in which participants were asked to design a solution that would prevent a hen's egg from breaking after being dropped from a height of 10 m. Our results show that engineers and industrial designers differ in their creative behaviors when they are asked to generate ideas in a creative task without any constraints. Industrial designers provide more answers and are less fixated than engineers. However, for both engineers and industrial designers, the introduction of an uncreative example reinforced the fixation effect and constrained participants' fluency. Specifically, industrial designers who were exposed to an uncreative example behaved similarly to engineers who were not exposed to this type of example.},

We utilized the egg task, in which participants design a method to drop a hen’s egg from a height of 10m to ensure that it does not break. First, we conducted a pilot study to confirm that the nature of the fixation effect in the egg task differs between children and adults, and we then explored the potential influence of examples on creative idea generation in a second study. The results revealed that exposure to the same example during a creative task has two opposite effects: adults were constrained in their ability to propose solutions, whereas this ability was enhanced in children. We explain this differing effect by noting that the same example can be within fixation for adults and outside fixation for children. The positive effect of examples allowed children to exhibit performance that was comparable to that of adults with regard to fluency and flexibility.},

	abstract = {Design educators often comment on the difficulties that result from a premature commitment by students to a solution to a design problem. Similarly practitioners can find it difficult to move away from an idea they have developed or precedents in a field. In the psychology of problem solving this effect is called functional fixedness or fixation. This refers to the observation that people find it very difficult to see, for example, that objects with well known uses or functions can be employed in new or unusual ways to develop an innovative solution to a problem or to solve a problem that requires innovation. Given that fixation refers to situations where innovation is blocked, it is not surprising that these effects should occur in design problem solving. Design problems are essentially ill-defined problems. As such they inherently contain the opportunity for innovation. However, while these types of issues have been discussed in the context of design, there has been little systematic evidence available about whether or not and under what conditions design fixation does occur. The paper reviews the results of a series of recent experiments which begin to addresses these issues. The results of the experiments will then be examined in terms of what insights they provide into the design process and what implications they have for design education and their relevance for the role that computers may play in the design process.},

This paper focuses on the secondary (students aged 11–16 years) design and technology (D\&T) context in the UK. Here we examine whether teacher practice can contribute to ﬁxation by focusing on one speciﬁc facet of teacher practice in D\&T; the use of product analysis to inform the generation of creative design ideas. Data is drawn from the preliminary phase of a research and intervention project from interviews with D\&T teachers (N = 14), students (N = 126) and lesson observations (N = 10) and an analysis of documents and student work. Product analysis is widely used at different points in design projects but, as is shown, in all cases current practice can lead to ﬁxation, as thinking is constrained down speciﬁc paths and tasks are at best at procedural rather than comprehension level. The implications of these ﬁndings and tentative ways forward for practitioners are discussed.},

While numerous research studies have gone into the study of design fixation, the experimental methods used were external to the cognitive process of designers; thus, there are some limitations. To address these limitations, the present study utilized electroencephalography (EEG) to explore the differences in neural activities between designers with different degrees of design fixation during creative idea generation. Fluency, flexibility, and the degree of copying were used to evaluate the design performance and fixation degrees of all participants; for the follow-up analyses on brain activity patterns, participants were then divided into the Higher Fixation Group and the Lower Fixation Group according to the evaluation of the degrees of copying. Next, participants in each group were contrasted separately against the task-related alpha power changes during creative idea generation. The comparison results revealed that participants with lower design fixation demonstrated stronger alpha synchronization in frontal, parietotemporal, and occipital regions during creative idea generation, while participants with higher design fixation showed stronger task-related alpha desynchronization in frontal, centroparietal, and parietotemporal regions. Such findings suggested that participants with higher fixation showed lower solution flexibility because of the inability to inhibit the solutions generated overrelying on intuition. These results could contribute to a deeper understanding of design fixation from the neuroscience perspective and provide essential theoretical supports for the subsequent defixation methods and tool development.},

To fully explore the influence of physical and pictorial examples on design novices, we investigated design fixation and design quality when they were provided with multiperspective pictures having information remarkably similar to physical objects. Specifically, two novice groups individually created their own designs after observing several examples by the way of the above two presentation modes. These designs were evaluated by two evaluators in terms of similarity, originality, and completeness. Statistical analysis showed that no significant difference was found in similarity and originality between the two groups, whereas the designs of the physical group outperformed those of the pictorial group in terms of completeness. This finding indicated that the two groups showed the same degree of design fixation, as multiperspective pictures presented most of the form information of the physical object. The results suggest that when instructing design novices, it is essential to control how to present design examples at different stages of the design process.},

However, subsequent attempts to replicate the effect were largely unsuccessful with what appeared to be fixation under some conditions being closely related to familiarity with existing examples of the design problem. There were, however, other differences between the two experiments, particularly in terms of the level of experience of the designers and the design discipline of the participants. In the experiment reported, familiarity with existing examples of solutions of a design problem was controlled by choosing an appropriate problem from the set of problems used in the original research and designers of the same discipline and level of experience were used together with designers from different disciplines. In addition to the pictorial representation of a design solution used in the original research, an additional pictorial example was included. The results demonstrated clear fixation effects when both the discipline of the designers and the pictorial example were the same as those used in the original experiment. However, no effect of the pictorial example occurred with designers of different disciplines or the other pictorial example for designers from any discipline. Possible reasons for these results are discussed, with particular reference to the effects of a match between the principles used in the design solution and the discipline of the designers.},

	abstract = {Rather than replacing a human problem solver, computers are increasingly seen as intelligent aids to problem solving. In this role the computer's capacity for storing and rapidly retrieving large amounts of information can potentially significantly augment human problem solving. In the specific context of design problem solving, this approach has particular attractions when associated with recent advances which allow the inclusion of graphic as well as textural material. Rather than simply providing information about principles and descriptions of examples of their use to solve problems, computers could generate sets of plans, perspective drawings and even sets of pictorial representations of actual design solutions to particular types of problems. However, while this may make such systems very attractive to designers, this very richness of information may produce a significant problem for design. Design fixation involves the reproduction of both appropriate and inappropriate aspects of an example design when the example solution is shown as part of the statement of the design problem. The results of the experiment to be reported indicate that the fixation effect does not simply depend on the pictorial representation of a possible solution to a problem. Rather fixation depends on the picture embodying principles which form a part of the knowledge base of the design discipline. It is likely that the cases representing previous solutions to a problem contained in an intelligent design aid would predominantly be of this form and could therefore establish the conditions for fixation to occur. While this could in fact be beneficial where routine design is involved, it places severe constraints on innovative or creative problem solving.},

In this paper, design fixation gets conceptually lifted to the levels of the organisation and the institution. We ask how the understanding of design fixation helps to achieve higher resource efficiency. Examples of organisational and institutional design fixations are presented. A System Dynamics model is used to simulate the impacts of design fixation on resource use of a sociotechnical laundry systems. Applying this lens suggests that in order to solve societal design fixations, systemic parameters like infrastructure, business models, or policies need to be considered design parameters.

            Jansson and Smith (1991, “Design Fixation,” Des. Stud., 12(1), pp. 3–11) demonstrated that design fixation occurs when an example solution is provided along with a design problem. After seeing an example concept—even with its flaws pointed out—new designs often share its features. In Jansson and Smith’s studies, a control group saw no example and showed less fixation to the example provided only in the other group. However, another source of fixation from an initial example may arise in the control group from the designer’s own first-generated concept. We conducted a large-scale experiment with beginning engineers to investigate whether design fixation occurs even without seeing a provided example. Half of the participants saw an example solution and half were given no example; instead, they generated their own initial design. Next, all students were individually brainstormed ideas for 30 min. We analyzed both groups’ concepts for fixation on the first solution they saw—either the example provided or their own initial concept. The results showed that the students provided with an example concept experienced less fixation on the initial example than those in the control group, whose concepts were evaluated for similarity to their own initial concept. To consider whether fixation on initial examples (provided or self-generated) might be mitigated, we asked these students to complete a second (30 min) idea generation phase using Design Heuristics for idea inspiration. The results showed that both groups experienced less fixation during the second-generation phase. These findings suggest that fixation on first solutions occurs in individual idea generation arising from both provided examples and self-generated concepts. However, more divergent idea generation can be facilitated through the use of design tools, such as Design Heuristics, to mitigate the consequences of design fixation.},

In an attempt to study this phenomenon experimentally, researchers typically set participants open-ended design problems, prime them with an example solution, and measure their performance through a variety of subjective metrics. This approach gives rise to various problems, including limited data capture and highly subjective evaluation of design behavior. To address these problems, we studied design fixation with a computer-based task inspired by psychological paradigms used to study “mental set” (also known as the “Einstellung effect”). The task consisted of a gamelike activity requiring participants to design a bridge within a specified budget. The use of a digital environment facilitated continuous data capture during the design activities. The constrained task (and direct quantitative measures) permitted a more objective analysis of design performance, including the occurrence of fixation. The results showed that participants who developed a mental set during the task failed to find alternative, more efficient solutions in trials admitting multiple solutions, compared to the participants who did not fall victim to this mental block. In addition, during the process of designing, the occurrence of mental set resulted in participants adopting a less efficient design behavior and reporting a different subjective experience of the task. The method used and the results obtained show an exciting alternative for studying design fixation experimentally and promote a wider exploration of the variety of design activities in which fixation might occur.},

	abstract = {Design fixation is a factor that negatively influences the generation of novel design concepts (Jansson \& Smith, 1991). When designers fixate, they tend to reproduce example features or features from their initial ideas. In order to mitigate design fixation, it is crucial to identify the factors that influence the extent of design fixation. This paper investigates two such factors: the modality of examples and the familiarity of designers with the example features. To investigate this, an experiment is conducted with mechanical engineering students who were asked to generate ideas to solve a peanut sheller design problem. The students generated ideas in five different experimental conditions: control, where no example was given; the first example given in a sketch form; the first example given as a nonfunctional prototype; a second example in sketch form; and the second example in a working prototype form. The first example was a nonfeasible solution, but it contained several features familiar to the participants. The second example was a feasible solution, but it contained less familiar features. In order to understand the extent of fixation triggered by the examples, three metrics were utilized to compare across the experimental conditions: the quantity of nonredundant ideas generated by the participants, the presence of example features in their solutions, and their fixation to the example’s energy source. The results showed that in the case of the familiar example, the example modality did play an important role in the extent of design fixation. Across the examples, it was found that the first example containing several familiar features caused more fixation than the second one. Overall, this paper shows that the modality in which the example was communicated and the presence of familiar features in an example influenced the fixation caused by those examples.},

	abstract = {Design fixation refers to blind adherence to a set of ideas, which can limit the output of conceptual design. Engineering designers tend to fixate on features of pre-existing solutions and consequently generate designs with similar features. The objective of this study is to leverage functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain activity of engineering designers during conceptual design in order to understand whether/where design fixation can be detected in a person’s brain when solving design problems. Design solutions indicated that fixation eﬀects were detectable at a statistically significant level. fMRI results show increased activation in areas associated with visuospatial processing when comparing ideation activities using an Example solution to No Example solution. Activation was found in the right inferior temporal gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, and right superior parietal lobule regions. The left lingual and superior frontal gyri were found to be less active in the example condition; these gyri are close in proximity to the prefrontal cortex, associated with creative output. The spatial patterns of activation provide evidence that a shift in mental resources can occur when a designer becomes fixated. For designers, the timing of ideation relative to the timing of benchmarking existing solutions should be considered.},

	abstract = {The term design fixation refers to the designer’s reluctance (or inability, in some cases) to consider multiple strategies to formulate and solve a design need. The design fixation phenomenon severely limits creativity and results in pedestrian design solutions. Design fixation is the direct result of knowledge representation, with human knowledge argued to be organized categorically. These categories are defined by prototypes that exemplify the category. Humans tend to rely upon and use prototypes in their initial approach to design solutions because access to the prototype requires significantly less cognitive effort than does the processing of individual exemplars. The preliminary experimental results support the effects of prototypes in the design process. In the preliminary experiment, engineering students as well as practicing engineers were asked to design a toy for blind children. The results reveal a strong design fixation wherein the subjects failed to consider crucial issues such as non-visual senses (such as hearing), the age and gender of the customer, desired size of the toy, methods of retrieving the toy, and colour. The results also show that the design fixation can occur even during the problem formulation way prior to creating alternative design solutions.},

Professional and academic educational offerings typically focus on the computational literacies required, but professionals in the field employ many non-technical methods; sketching by hand on paper is a common practice. This paper introduces and classifies a corpus of 101 data sketches produced by participants as part of a guided learning activity in informal and formal settings. We manually code each sketch against 12 metrics related to visual encodings, representations, and story structure. We find evidence for preferential use of positional and shape-based encodings, frequent use of symbolic and textual representations, and a high prevalence of stories comparing subsets of data. These findings contribute to our understanding of how learners sketch with data. This case study can inform tool design for learners, and help create educational programs that introduce novices to sketching practices used by experts.},

	abstract = {Bio-inspired design in recent years has been used successfully as a methodology in disciplines such as engineering, architecture, product design, and business. While still in an infant stage in terms of adoption in universities, those who have embraced the methodology have experienced promising design outcomes, enthusiasm from students, and an enrichment in research and teaching. One of the issues is that while bio-inspired design has been around for a very long time semantic disconnect between disciplines keeps the methodology undefined and at times, unrecognized. In this dissertation, I explore the potential of bio-inspired design for information visualization and seek to help fulfill information visualization’s goal of ‘amplifying cognition’ using design inspired by nature. I will directly investigate the different kinds of ways bio-inspired design might be useful. Of interest is where along the information visualization pipeline bio-inspiration is considered and in what capacity: is it used as metaphor, analogy, concept, form, function, process, system, or other? There are examples of bio-inspired algorithms in information visualization but are there direct inspirations from nature that could also be useful? How does the bio-inspired design community think about its field? How do they define it? Where do they think biomimics should focus their efforts? How do students work with this methodology? How do instructors best introduce the material in the context of information visualization? What was my own experience trying to implement this approach to my own data set? I present three approaches to explore this potential. I investigate the state of the art in both computational media design and bio-inspired design through a journalistic and design-oriented approach to create an active survey of these fields. I summerize ideas and opinions from a large set of interviews and design tools providing insights into the world of bio-inspiration. Experiential teaching is my second approach to investigate how students processed and worked with the idea of bio-inspiration for design and information visualization. This provided useful concepts for developing teaching and design approaches. Third was a research creation approach where I take a bio-inspired design lens to an online dataset in the hopes of creating a useful tool for the community. Challenges and observations gave new insights into bio-inspiration for information visualization. The dissertation ends with a reflection about the role of bio-inspired design for information visualization. The insights gained from the three approaches suggest further challenges for research and design.},

	abstract = {Engineering idea generation plays a vital role in developing new products. Recent research has focused on the development of methods to make designers more innovative and creative. In this regard, design fixation acts as a major constraint in idea generation. This paper analyzes how design experience influences design fixation. We hypothesize that people store a greater magnitude of design ideas into their memory set as they gain experience in design. The extent of this set provides for both a greater set of solutions to draw from, resulting in more ideas, and determine the extent to which the engineers fixate. A controlled laboratory experiment replicates the environment described in the study by Linsey et al. [1] with novices rather than experts, and compares the results to this prior study. The results support the increased number of ideas with experience hypothesis but not the reduced fixation. It is observed that experts create significantly more ideas but fixate more as well. While the experts fixate on the example, they still outperform novices. These findings shed light on the importance of exposing students to solving a variety of engineering problems in the curricula.},

[2010, “A Study of Design Fixation, Its Mitigation and Perception in Engineering Design Faculty,” ASME Trans. J. Mech. Des., 132, 041003], this study hypothesizes that designers fixate to example features and this fixation can be mitigated using certain defixation materials including alternate representations of the design problem. To investigate this, the experiment conducted by Linsey et al. [2010] with engineering design faculty is replicated with novice designers. Participants generate ideas for a design problem in three groups: one group working with a fixating example, a second group working with the same example along with alternate representations of the design problem and a control group. The obtained results show that both the novice designers and design faculty fixate to the same extent, whereas the defixation materials have differential effect on the two groups. This result indicates that design researchers need to be very careful in developing methods and guidelines that are formulated and tested with studies on novice designers. The effectiveness of such measures may vary with the level of expertise of the designer.},

In this paper, we argue that interdisciplinary interest in design fixation has led to increasingly broad definitions of the phenomenon that may be undermining empirical research efforts, educational efforts to minimize fixation, and the acquisition and dissemination of transdisciplinary knowledge about fixation effects. To address these issues, we recommend that researchers consider categorizing fixation phenomena into one of three classifications: unconscious adherence to the influence of prior designs, conscious blocks to change, and intentional resistance to new ideas. Next, we distinguish between concept-based design fixation, fixation to a specific class of known design concepts, and knowledge-based design fixation, fixation to a problem-specific knowledge base. With these distinctions in place, we propose a system of orders of design fixation, recommend methods for reducing fixation in inventive design, and recommend areas that are in need of further research within the field of design science.},

	abstract = {Design fixation describes a phenomenon in which designers fail to solve a design problem due to their strong mental attachment to an internal or external inspiring source. A number of empirical research studies aimed at identifying the causes behind design fixation and developing approaches for overcoming it. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model of design fixation in which the concepts of perceived fitness and expected fitness are introduced. Interpretation of existing findings on fixation and hypotheses are derived to show the applications of the model. In addition, a method of evaluation of design fixation is introduced and demonstrated with an example.},

This experiment presents designers with an example solution represented as a function tree and a sketch, we compare how these different external representations influence design fixation as they complete a design task. Results show that function trees do not cause fixation to ideas compared to a control group, and that function trees reduce fixation when compared to sketches. Results from this experiment show that function tree representations offer advantages for reducing fixation during idea generation.},

	abstract = {The term design fixation is often used interchangeably to refer to situations where designers limit their creative output because of an overreliance on features of preexisting designs, or more generally, an overreliance on a specific body of knowledge directly associated with a problem. In this paper, we argue that interdisciplinary interest in design fixation has led to increasingly broad definitions of the phenomenon which may be undermining empirical research efforts, educational efforts to minimize fixation, and the transdisciplinary distribution of knowledge about fixation effects. To address these issues, the authors recommend that researchers consider categorizing fixation phenomena into one of three classifications: unconscious adherence to the influence of prior designs, conscious blocks to change, and intentional resistance to new ideas. Next, we distinguish between concept-based design fixation, fixation to a specific class of known design concepts, and knowledge-based design fixation, fixation to a problem-specific knowledge base. With these distinctions in place, we propose a system of orders of design fixation, recommend methods for reducing fixation in inventive design, and recommend areas that are in need of further research within the field of design science.},

Previous studies have focused on using qualitative methods to examine trader understanding of Type 1 decision-making (intuition and ‘gut feeling’). No published study has investigated how traders view Type 2 decisions. Findings from semi-structured interviews with 14 traders revealed two overarching themes derived from four subthemes. The first overarching theme (‘Knowledge gap’) demonstrated that traders do not find their analytical decision-making processes as accessible as dual-process theory predicts. In particular, traders failed to label processes such as reading research or evaluating data as analytical. In contrast, they viewed Type 2 decisions in a ‘saviour’ role where these processes offered traders psychological or emotional support during loss making periods. The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the decision-training of traders, their management, and practice.},

	abstract = {Background. The role of cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making is of growing interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whether studies on cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making are based on actual or hypothetical decisions and are conducted with populations that are representative of those who typically make the medical decision; to categorize the types of cognitive biases and heuristics found and whether they are found in patients or in medical personnel; and to critically review the studies based on standard methodological quality criteria. Method. Data sources were original, peer-reviewed, empirical studies on cognitive biases and heuristics in medical decision making found in Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, and the CINAHL databases published in 1980?2013. Predefined exclusion criteria were used to identify 213 studies. During data extraction, information was collected on type of bias or heuristic studied, respondent population, decision type, study type (actual or hypothetical), study method, and study conclusion. Results. Of the 213 studies analyzed, 164 (77\%) were based on hypothetical vignettes, and 175 (82\%) were conducted with representative populations. Nineteen types of cognitive biases and heuristics were found. Only 34\% of studies (n = 73) investigated medical personnel, and 68\% (n = 145) confirmed the presence of a bias or heuristic. Each methodological quality criterion was satisfied by more than 50\% of the studies, except for sample size and validated instruments/questions. Limitations are that existing terms were used to inform search terms, and study inclusion criteria focused strictly on decision making. Conclusions. Most of the studies on biases and heuristics in medical decision making are based on hypothetical vignettes, raising concerns about applicability of these findings to actual decision making. Biases and heuristics have been underinvestigated in medical personnel compared with patients.},

Providing adequate decision support for individuals and teams in anesthesia emergencies is important because emergencies are infrequent and complex. Current designs of decision support in airway management are not context specific and lack a consideration of how decisions are made under time pressure. To fill this gap, this study used frameworks from cognitive systems engineering to explore decisions of experienced anesthesia providers. The goal was to identify the decision pathways used in challenging airway management situations. The critical decision method was employed to interview anesthesia providers about a challenging incident they had experienced. Results illustrated that decisions were based on prior experience and made through a process of recognition. The vast majority of decisions were recognition primed, characterized by a direct link between cue familiarity and action generation. A few decisions involved concurrent option comparison, which was still based on situation recognition. Different cues received through teamwork, technologies, and patients contributed to the decisions. As different cognitive pathways may require different design solutions, the findings of this study are being used to help develop decision support tools in anesthesia.},

There are many algorithms designed to address this problem, but all are subject to uncertainty. The extent of this solution uncertainty can be expressed in several ways, including a table of locations (course, speed, range) or a graphical area of uncertainty.Method:To test the hypothesis that the representation of uncertainty that more closely matches the experts? preferred representation of the problem would better support performance, even for the nonexpert., performance data were collected using displays that were either stripped of the spatial or the tabular representation.Results:Performance was more accurate when uncertainty was displayed spatially. This effect was only significant for the nonexperts for whom the spatial displays supported almost expert-like performance. This effect appears to be due to reduced mental effort.Conclusion:These results suggest that when the representation of uncertainty for this spatial task better matches the expert?s preferred representation of the problem even a nonexpert can show expert-like performance.Application:These results could apply to any domain where performance requires working with highly uncertain information.},

To form our recommendations, in addition to reviewing relevant literature, we undertook at-sea observations and interviews, and also conducted interviews with 19 additional COs using cognitive task analysis elicitation methods. Through thematic analysis of the data collected, we identified six major cognitive challenges that COs face. We developed design directions addressing each of these cognitive challenges.

We reviewed 47 studies on architectural design, engineering design and product design engineering. This paper reports 24 cognitive processes investigated in a subset of 33 studies aligning with two viewpoints on the nature of designing: (V1) design as search (10 processes, 41.7\%); and (V2) design as exploration (14 processes, 58.3\%). Studies on search focused on solution search and problem structuring, involving: long-term memory retrieval; working memory; operators and reasoning processes. Studies on exploration investigated: co-evolutionary design; visual reasoning; cognitive actions; and unexpected discovery and situated requirements invention. Overall, considerable conceptual and terminological diﬀerences were observed among the studies. Nonetheless, a common focus on memory, semantic, associative, visual perceptual and mental imagery processes was observed to an extent. We suggest three challenges for future research to advance the field: (i) developing general models/theories; (ii) testing protocol study findings using objective methods conducive to larger samples and (iii) developing a shared ontology of cognitive processes in design.},

	abstract = {How a research team deﬁnes their study sample can be decisive in shaping impact on both practice and theory. However, sampling in design research faces several major challenges, including diverse terminology, limited prior literature, and lack of common framework for discussing sampling decisions. We address these challenges by bringing together guidance from across related research ﬁelds as well as cross-referring to examples from published design research. We oﬀer a structured process for sample development and present eight key sampling considerations. The paper contributes to research method selection, development, and use, as well as extending discussions surrounding knowledge construction, standards of reporting, and design research impact.

	abstract = {Design cognition’ refers to the mental processes and representations involved in designing, and has been a significant area of interest since the emergence of design research in the 1960s. The field now faces significant challenges moving into the future, with major change required to overcome stagnation in research topics and methodologies. Tackling these challenges requires us to understand the past and present of design cognition research, and open fresh discussions on its future. This thematic collection aims to address this need by taking stock of current approaches, exploring emerging topics and methodologies, and identifying future directions for enquiry. In this editorial, we examine key issues regarding both what we investigate and how we conduct this research. We present a vision formed from a structured literature review, the work of authors in the collection, and the views of a broad cross-section of the design cognition community. This vision is formalized in a roadmap from the present to the near and far future, highlighting key topics and research questions for the field. Ultimately, ecological measurement, new applications of artificial intelligence, and a move towards theory construction and research maturation constitute key long term challenges for the design cognition community.},

The four strategies span a range of data collection and analysis methods. More substantial differences, however, are found to exist in the theoretical biases each entails. Think-aloud protocols assume that design can be described as search; content analysis assumes that the structure and content of internal representations is critical to understanding problem solving behavior; process isolation assumes that design can be cognitively decomposed; and, finally, situated studies assume that a better understanding of design involves the study of designers and their environments as integrated systems. Despite their sometimes competing claims, these four strategies can potentially work together in complementary ways to provide insights into design behavior.},

Further, by extending the established idea of diaries, the use of a diary-based process documentation technique in several prototyping projects is evaluated. This is done in order to examine the extent to which the documentation techniques influence the quality of the system. Projects in which these aspects were tested are described. Decision diaries were used in order to manage and improve the decision making process and in order to make the decisions related to the design more transparent The underlying asmmption was that transparency would improve the quality of the decisions and thus, the system. User satisfaction reports are analyzed. They indicare that decision diaries make decision making more explicit and thus increase the quality of the system design process and the product.},

We identify a high level of consistency in empirical ﬁndings, including good evidence for core design strategies such as conjecture-based problem formulation, problemesolution coevolution, analogical reasoning, mental simulation and ﬁxated solution generation. A further consistent theme to emerge in our review concerns the central role played by metacognitive monitoring and control processes in ensuring the eﬀective deployment of design strategies in response to designers’ ﬂuctuating feelings of uncertainty. We argue that a metacognitive perspective on design cognition is critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of strategic processing in design, additionally engendering many new avenues for important future research.

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the generation mechanism of pairwise associated sketches and different associated types through the experimental analysis of the cognitive processes of the designers in conceptual design process. The verbal protocol analysis (VPA) was carried out on three groups of participants (designers). The first group consisted of eight university students majoring in industrial design, the second consisted of eight university students majoring in mechanical design, and the third consisted of six product designers with degrees in industrial design and over 5 years of work experience. Their cognitive processes revealed by the think-aloud protocol and outcome sketches during a specific design task were recorded. Following a content-oriented encoding scheme, the verbal data were encoded into cognitive actions, and according to the generation sequence of the sketches, the encoding results were postprocessed for the further analysis of associated sketches. First, we identified which cognitive actions played important roles in the generation of associated sketches. Next, based on the encoding results and the analyses of all associated sketches, we found that all associations can be categorized into three types (in order from low to high association levels): shape association, behavior association, and function association. Finally, we found that the differences in major background had no significant effect on the number of associated sketches but did have some influence on the diversity of association types, the differences in experience background mainly influenced the number of associated sketches in each type of association. Meanwhile, by analyzing the key cognitive actions, we also found the advantages and disadvantages of each group in the generation of different types of associations. The findings of this study can help designers with different backgrounds to choose suitable strategies to stimulate the important actions at the right time, conceive appropriate association types, and ultimately generate diverse concept sketches with high quality.},

Based on research from psychology, behavioral economics, and cognitive science, we design five experiments to measure the role of anchoring bias, confirmation bias, belief bias, and myopic loss aversion under different uncertain decision tasks like social media event detection, misinformation identification, and financial portfolio allocation. This thesis makes three major contributions. First, we find evidence of cognitive biases in data visualization through multiple behavioral trace data including user decisions, user hover and click interactions, qualitative feedback, and belief elicitation techniques. Second, we design multiple experiments with interactive data visualization systems across different design complexities (coordinated multiple views to single plot), data types (social network, linguistic, geospatial, temporal, statistical), and evaluate them on user populations that range from novice to expert (crowdsourced, undergraduate, data scientist, domain expert). Third, we evaluate the experiments using multiple statistical and probabilistic techniques to measure the effects of cognitive biases including classical statistical tests, (Bayesian) mixed effects modeling, hierarchical clustering, natural language processing, and Bayesian cognitive modeling. These experiments show the promising role data visualizations and human-computer techniques could mitigate such biases and lead to better decision-making under uncertainty.},

In this article, surprise situations in cockpit operations are examined by investigating the re-framing process. The results show difﬁculties that pilots have in re-framing following surprise, including the identiﬁcation of subtle cues and managing uncertainties regarding automated systems, coping with multiple goals, tasks and narrow time frames and identifying an appropriate action. A crew-aircraft sensemaking model is presented, outlining core concepts of re-framing processes and sensemaking activities. Based on the ﬁndings, three critical areas are identiﬁed that deserve further attention to improve pilot abilities to cope with unexpected events; (1) identiﬁcation of what enables and obstructs re-framing, (2) training to build frames and develop re-framing strategies and (3) control strategies as part of the reframing process.},

Designing resilient systems that support adaptive behavior requires a deepened understanding of the context in which adaptations take place, of conditions and enablers to implement these adaptations, and of their effects on the overall system. Also, it requires a focus on how people actually perform, not how they are presumed to perform according to textbook situations. In this paper, a framework to analyze adaptive behavior in everyday situations in which systems are working near the margins of safety is presented. Further, the variety space diagram has been developed as a means to illustrate how system variability, disturbances, and constraints affect work performance. The examples that underlie the framework and the diagram are derived from nine focus groups with representatives working with safety-related issues in different work domains, including health care, nuclear power, transportation, and emergency services.},

We present a series of cognitive field studies that illustrate one response to this challenge. Our focus was on how nuclear power plant (NPP) operators monitor plant state during normal operating conditions. We studied operators at two NPPs with different control room interfaces. We identified strong consistencies with respect to factors that made monitoring difficult and the strategies that operators have developed to facilitate monitoring. We found that what makes monitoring difficult is not the need to identify subtle abnormal indications against a quiescent background, but rather the need to identify and pursue relevant findings against a noisy background. Operators devised proactive strategies to make important information more salient or reduce meaningless change, create new information, and off-load some cognitive processing onto the interface. These findings emphasize the active problem-solving nature of monitoring, and highlight the use of strategies for knowledge-driven monitoring and the proactive adaptation of the interface to support monitoring. Potential applications of this research include control room design for process control and alarm systems and user interfaces for complex systems.},

They support synchronous communication on multiple channels among groups of people who are spatially distributed. In this paper, we suggest reasons for why the voice loop system is a successful medium for supporting coordination in space shuttle mission control based on over 130 hours of direct observation. Voice loops allow practitioners to listen in on relevant communications without disrupting their own activities or the activities of others. In addition, the voice loop system is structured around the mission control organization, and therefore directly supports the demands of the domain. By understanding how voice loops meet the particular demands of the mission control environment, insight can be gained for the design of groupware tools to support cooperative activity in other event-driven domains.},

Targeted ﬁeld observations were conducted to investigate what it means to update a supervisory controller on the status of a continuous, anomaly-driven process in a complex, distributed environment. Sixteen shift changes, or handovers, at the NASA Johnson Space Center were observed during the STS-76 Space Shuttle mission. The ﬁndings from this observational study highlight the importance of prior knowledge in the updates and demonstrate how missing updates can leave ﬂight controllers vulnerable to being unprepared.

To improve resilience in medication delivery, we propose immediately incorporating 3 key levers: (1) scenario-based design and evaluation of interventions, (2) advanced information visualization techniques to reduce data overload in the electronic medical record, and (3) explicit consideration and documentation of asynchronous, interdisciplinary teamwork support during software requirements analysis, including a workload shifting analysis. For long-term progress, we recommend investing in research to better understand technical work in health care, speciﬁcally task requirements in work domains and the trade-offs and strategies that workers use to meet these demands.},

This paper details our experiences applying resilience engineering to submarine decision support.

	abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the critical decisions surgeons need to make regarding laparoscopic surgery, the information these decisions are based on, the strategies employed by surgeons to reach their objectives, and the difficulties experienced by novices.
Background: Laparoscopic training focuses on the development of technical skills. However, successful surgical outcomes are also dependent on appropriate decisions made during surgery, which are influenced by critical cues and the use of appropriate strategies. Novices might not be as adept at cue detection and strategy use.
Method: Participants were eight attending surgeons. The authors employed task-analytic techniques to identify critical decisions inherent in laparoscopy and the cues, strategies, and novice traps associated with these decisions.
Results: The authors used decision requirements tables to organize the data into the key decisions made during the preoperative, operative, and postoperative phases as well as the cues, strategies, and novice traps associated with these decisions. Key decisions identified for the preoperative phase included but were not limited to the decision of performing a laparoscopic versus open surgery, necessity to review the literature, practicing the procedure, and trocar placement. Some key decisions identified for the operative phase included converting to open surgery, performing angiograms, cutting tissue or organs, and reevaluation of the approach. Only one key decision was identified for the postoperative phrase: whether the surgeon’s technique needs to be evaluated and revised.
Conclusion: The laparoscopic environment requires complex decision making, and novices are prone to errors in their decisions.},

	abstract = {Two studies demonstrated that attempts to debias hindsight by thinking about alternative outcomes may backfire and traced this to the influence of subjective accessibility experiences. Participants listed either few (2) or many (10) thoughts about how an event might have turned out otherwise. Listing many counterfactual thoughts was experienced as difficult and consistently increased the hindsight bias, presumably because the experienced difficulty suggested that there were not many ways in which the event might have turned out otherwise. No significant hindsight effects were obtained when participants listed only a few counterfactual thoughts, a task subjectively experienced as easy. The interplay of accessible content and subjective accessibility experiences in the hindsight bias is discussed. After the outcome of an event is known, people “tend to view what has happened as having been inevitable ” (Fischhoff, 1982a, p. 428) and assume that they could have predicted the outcome all along. Initially documented by Fischhoff (1975), this hindsight bias has been observed in many domains of judgment (for reviews see Christensen-Szalanski \& Willham, 1991; Hawkins \& Hastie, 1990).

While breadth-oriented data exploration presents a promising solution to rectifying a biased exploration path, how to design breadth-oriented systems is yet to be explored. In this paper, we propose three considerations in designing systems which support breadth-oriented data exploration. To demonstrate the utility of these design considerations, we illustrate a hypothetical breadth-oriented system.

	abstract = {The authors participated in a Mars planetary science research analog that included simulated extravehicular activity (EVA) and intravehicular (IV) crewmembers with delayed communications with Earth. Within the analog context, the authors considered which information streams and sources were monitored by IV crewmembers throughout the simulated EVAs. The capabilities of IV crewmember monitoring were compared to information considered critical for the successful completion of EVA on Mars, suggesting gaps for improved human-automation function allocation. The authors’ findings support available literature that indicate that new mission architectures for planetary exploration mandate increased autonomy from Earth-based controllers. This autonomy will result in too many mission-critical data streams for the attentional capabilities of relatively small crew. Results of this work can inform further investigation into evolving concepts of mission operations that incorporate effective human-automation teaming to support dynamic function allocation for spaceflight exploration tasks.},

From these observations, we generated design recommendations and criteria for evaluating the usefulness of any effort aimed at reducing data overload.

A supervisory control architecture that includes the actions of both a human pilot and an autopilot is proposed to ensure resilient tracking performance in the presence of anomalies. The pilot is tasked with supervisory, higher level decision-making tasks, such as anomaly detection, estimation, and command regulation. The autopilot is assigned a lower level task of accurate command following based on an adaptive control design. The main innovations in the proposed architecture are the use of human pilot in utilizing the concepts of capacity for maneuver (CfM) and graceful command degradation (GCD), both of which originate in cognitive sciences and a judicious combination of the pilot inputs and the autopilot control action. Together, they provide guidelines for a system to be resilient, which corresponds to the system’s readiness to respond to unforeseen events. The supervisory control architecture is shown to be capable of achieving maximum CfM while allowing minimal GCD, as well as satisfactory command following postanomaly, resulting in resilient ﬂight capabilities. The proposed controller is analyzed in a simulation study of a nonlinear F-16 aircraft model under actuator anomalies. It is shown through numerical studies that under suitable inputs from the pilot, the overall controller is able to deliver resilient ﬂight.},

	abstract = {Background. Numeracy, how facile people are with basic probability and mathematical concepts, is associated with how people perceive health risks. Performance on simple numeracy problems has been poor among populations with little as well as more formal education. Here, we examine how highly educated participants performed on a general and an expanded numeracy scale. The latter was designed within the context of health risks. Method. A total of 463 men and women aged 40 and older completed a 3-item general and an expanded 7-item numeracy scale. The expanded scale assessed how well people 1) differentiate and perform simple mathematical operations on risk magnitudes using percentages and proportions, 2) convert percentages to proportions, 3) convert proportions to percentages, and 4) convert probabilities to proportions. Results. On average, 18\% and 32\% of participants correctly answered all of the general and expanded numeracy scale items. Approximately 16\% to 20\% incorrectly answered the most straightforward questions pertaining to risk magnitudes (e.g., Which represents the larger risk: 1\%, 5\%, or 10\%?). A factor analysis revealed that the general and expanded risk numeracy items tapped the construct of global numeracy. Conclusions. These results suggest that even highly educated participants have difficulty with relatively simple numeracy questions, thus replicating in part earlier studies. The implication is that usual strategies for communicating numerical risk may be flawed. Methods and consequences of communicating health risk information tailored to a person?s level of numeracy should be explored further.},

We found that many non-expert drawings illustrated a strong divide between public and private physical spaces, while experts were more likely to draw nuanced data privacy spaces. Young children’s drawings focused on bedrooms, bathrooms, or cheating on schoolwork, and seldom addressed data privacy.

To examine how COVID-19 visualizations inﬂuence risk perception, we conducted two experiments (N = 2,549) during the height of COVID-19 where we presented participants with 34 visualizations from the CDC of the same COVID-19 mortality data. We found that visualizing data using a cumulative scale consistently led to participants believing that they and others were at more risk than before viewing the visualizations. In contrast, visualizing the same data with a weekly incident scale led to variable changes in risk perceptions. Further, uncertainty forecast visualizations also affected risk perceptions, with visualizations showing six or more models increasing risk estimates more than the others tested. Differences between COVID-19 visualizations of the same data produce different risk perceptions, fundamentally changing viewers’ interpretation of information.},

In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist.

To investigate, we performed two rounds of between-subjects, in-laboratory experiments with 94 participants to analyze the effect of visual anchors and strategy cues in decision-making with a visual analytic system that employs coordinated multiple view design. The decision-making task is identifying misinformation from Twitter news accounts. Participants were randomly assigned one of three treatment groups (including control) in which participant training processes were modified. Our findings reveal that strategy cues and visual anchors (scenario videos) can significantly affect user activity, speed, confidence, and, under certain circumstances, accuracy.

We argue that mixed-initiative design principles can and should incorporate cognitive bias mitigation strategies directly through development of mitigation techniques embedded in the system to address cognitive biases in situ. We identify domain experts in machine learning adopting visual analytics techniques and systems that incorporate existing mixed-initiative principles and examine their potential to support bias mitigation strategies. This examination considers the unique perspective these experts bring to visual analytics and is situated in existing user-centered systems that make exemplary use of design principles informed by cognitive theory. We then suggest informed opportunities for domain experts to take initiative toward addressing cognitive biases in light of their existing contributions to the field.

          Almost all drowning accidents in Japan are caused by rip currents. To reduce these accidents, a new technology that can detect rip currents and notify beachgoers by using the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) was proposed. However, studies on the effect of visualizing rip currents or considering the effect of optimism bias have not been conducted. This study investigates if visualization of rip currents might help in preventing drowning accidents, while considering the effect of optimism bias. The participants were 90 Japanese beachgoers. They were asked to answer questions based on their knowledge of the beach and rip currents, their optimism bias regarding rip currents, and awareness with or without visualization. The results of the analyses suggest that despite optimism bias, the visualization of rip currents increases the tendency of beachgoers to perceive and avoid rip currents. As described above, it found that by visualizing rip currents, beachgoers can avoid. Additionally, an understanding of rip currents is positively related to the intent to avoid rip currents with visualization. Therefore, it is necessary not only to enhance the avoidance tendency by visualizing rip currents, but also to further enhance knowledge of beachgoers to deepen the understanding of rip currents including the danger associated and methods to avoid them.},

	abstract = {This article explores psychological science on race bias and its implications in several domains of public policy, with special attention paid to biased policing as an illustrative example. Race bias arises from normal mental processes, many outside our conscious awareness and control. This research directly applies to public policy, especially where concerned with regulating behavior and managing uncertainty. Research links both implicit and explicit racial bias to behavior, and uncertainty exacerbates the influence of bias in decision-making. Sample policy domains—where psychological research, race bias, and public policy intersect—include education, employment, immigration, health care, politics/representation, and criminal justice. Psychological research informs policy by documenting causes and processes, by expert testimony in court, and by generating and evaluating interventions to reduce race bias.},

Based on the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) of information processing, a serious training game (called MACBETH) was designed to address and mitigate cognitive biases that interfere with the analysis of evidence and the generation of hypotheses. Two biases are the focus of this paper—fundamental attribution error and confirmation bias. The efficacy of the serious game on knowledge and mitigation of biases was examined using an experiment in which participants (N=703) either played the MACBETH game or watched an instructional video about the biases. Results demonstrate the game to be more effective than the video at mitigating cognitive biases when explicit training methods are combined with repetitive play. Moreover, explicit instruction within the game provided greater familiarity and knowledge of the biases relative to implicit instruction. Suggestions for game development for purposes of enhancing cognitive processing and bias mitigation based on the MACBETH game design are discussed.},

The fixation or the blocks are specific to Students domain which varies according to the content and Pedagogical approach. Hence the typology of fixation is kept constant and mapped according to the three years of architecture and in three zones for different pedagogical approach.

	abstract = {Design fixation plays an important role in design idea generation, and has been found to be complex in its definition and implications. Identifying the factors that influence fixation is crucial in understanding how to improve design pedagogy and mitigate fixation effects. One way to potentially mitigate fixation is through product dissection activities as this activity has been shown to increase creativity and design exploration in engineering design. However, since product dissection has not been studied in terms of design fixation, it is unclear if, or how, this type of activity influences fixation. In addition, although prior work studied product dissection in a team environment, it did not study how individual factors such as personality attributes influence one’s involvement, or exposure to the dissection. This is an important factor to study in order to understand how team-based dissection activities influence design fixation because the participation of each team member can be affected by factors such as personality traits. Therefore, this study explores the interaction between product dissection, personality traits, and design fixation in an engineering design class setting. It was found that design fixation was indeed impacted by extraversion and conscientiousness personality traits when adjusting for semester standing and exposure to the dissection activity. These findings implicate personality in the product dissection activity, as well as suggest product dissection as a way to mitigate design fixation. By understanding these interactions, the overall design process can be enhanced, as well as our understanding of design cognition.},

Such a result constitutes incubation in problem solving. "Unconscious work" on a problem, commonly assumed to be responsible for incubation effects, may not be necessary to observe the phenomenon. We hypothesize that fixation, a block to successful problem solving, may develop during initial solution attempts and persist, interfering with immediate extra work more than with delayed extra work. Five experiments are reported in which fixation was induced to prevent optimal performance on the initial test of Remote Associates Test (RAT) problems (e.g., Mednick, 1962). After the fixation manipulation in three of the experiments, the effects of incubation intervals were examined by retesting the fixated problems. Both fixation (poorer initial problem-solving performance) and incubation (more improvement after a delayed retest than an immediate retest) were found in all the experiments which tested for the effects. In Experiments 1, 2, and 3, misleading distractors were presented alongside the RAT problems during the initial test of the problems to cause fixation. In Experiment 4, a block of paired associates--pairing the RAT words with the misleading distractors prior to problem solving--successfully induced fixation, indicating that the distractors affected memory retrieval. In Experiment 5, a trial-by-trial technique allowed fixation and incubation to be induced and tested separately for each item. All of our findings of incubation effects appear to have depended upon the initial induction of fixation. Although the experiments may not be representative of all naturally occurring cases of incubation, they provide a methodology for the study of fixation and incubation effects in problem solving in the laboratory.},

In particular, the paper asks whether the abstract domain of time gets its relational structure from the more concrete domain of space. Relational similarities between space and time are outlined along with several explanations of how these similarities may have arisen. Three experiments designed to distinguish between these explanations are described. The results indicate that (1) the domains of space and time do share conceptual structure, (2) spatial relational information is just as useful for thinking about time as temporal information, and (3) with frequent use, mappings between space and time come to be stored in the domain of time and so thinking about time does not necessarily require access to spatial schemas. These findings provide some of the first empirical evidence for Metaphoric Structuring. It appears that abstract domains such as time are indeed shaped by metaphorical mappings from more concrete and experiential domains such as space.},

English and Mandarin talk about time differently—English predominantly talks about time as if it were horizontal, while Mandarin also commonly describes time as vertical. This difference between the two languages is reflected in the way their speakers think about time. In one study, Mandarin speakers tended to think about time vertically even when they were thinking for English (Mandarin speakers were faster to confirm that March comes earlier than April if they had just seen a vertical array of objects than if they had just seen a horizontal array, and the reverse was true for English speakers). Another study showed that the extent to which Mandarin–English bilinguals think about time vertically is related to how old they were when they first began to learn English. In another experiment native English speakers were taught to talk about time using vertical spatial terms in a way similar to Mandarin. On a subsequent test, this group of English speakers showed the same bias to think about time vertically as was observed with Mandarin speakers. It is concluded that (1) language is a powerful tool in shaping thought about abstract domains and (2) one's native language plays an important role in shaping habitual thought (e.g., how one tends to think about time) but does not entirely determine one's thinking in the strong Whorfian sense.},

Failing to understand diagrams can hinder success in STEM because scientific practice requires understanding and creating diagrammatic representations. We explore a new approach to improving student understanding of diagrams that convey 3D relations that is based on students generating their own predictive diagrams. Participants’ comprehension of 3D spatial diagrams was measured in a pre‐ and post‐design where students selected the correct 2D slice through 3D geologic block diagrams. Generating sketches that predicated the internal structure of a model led to greater improvement in diagram understanding than visualizing the interior of the model without sketching, or sketching the model without attempting to predict unseen spatial relations. In addition, we found a positive correlation between sketched diagram accuracy and improvement on the diagram comprehension measure. Results suggest that generating a predictive diagram facilitates students’ abilities to make inferences about spatial relationships in diagrams. Implications for use of sketching in supporting STEM learning are discussed.
Sketching has been hypothesized to have many potential benefits for students in STEM disciplines. In Gagnier et al.'s paper, “Comprehending 3D Diagrams: Sketching to Support Spatial Reasoning,‐ the authors explore whether it can help students understand diagrams that involve 3D relations. Their results suggest that generating a sketch that predicts these depicted relations is a particularly helpful, certain more than copying without making predictions or making predictions without sketching. Given the prevalence of these diagrams across STEM, this has wide reaching positive implications.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To describe a clock drawing task (CLOX) designed to elicit executive impairment and discriminate it from non-executive constructional failure.
SUBJECTS 90 elderly subjects were studied (45 elderly and well persons from the independent living apartments of a continuing care retirement community and 45 patients with probable Alzheimer’s disease). The clock drawing performance of elderly patients was compared with that of 62 young adult controls.
METHODS Subjects received the CLOX, an executive test (EXIT25), and the mini mental state examination (MMSE). The CLOX is divided into an unprompted task that is sensitive to executive control (CLOX1) and a copied version that is not (CLOX2). Between rater reliability (27 subjects) was high for both subtests.
RESULTS In elderly subjects, CLOX subscores correlated strongly with cognitive severity (CLOX1:r=−0.83 v the EXIT25; CLOX2:r=0.85 v the MMSE). EXIT25 and MMSE scores predicted CLOX1 scores independently of age or education (F(4,82)=50.7, p{\textless}0.001;R 2=0.71). The EXIT25 accounted for 68\% of CLOX1 variance. Only the MMSE significantly contributed to CLOX2 scores (F(4,72)= 57.2, p{\textless}0.001;R 2=0.74). CLOX subscales discriminated between patients with Alzheimer’s disease and elderly controls (83.1\% of cases correctly classified; Wilkes’ lambda=0.48, p{\textless}0.001), and between Alzheimer’s disease subgroups with and without constructional impairment (91.9\% of cases correctly classified; Wilkes’ lambda=0.31, p{\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSIONS The CLOX is an internally consistent measure that is easy to administer and displays good inter-rater reliability. It is strongly associated with cognitive test scores. The pattern of CLOX failures may discriminate clinical dementia subgroups.},

	abstract = {Recent science educational reforms in the United States have prompted increased efforts to teach engineering design as an approach to improve STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) learning in K-12 classrooms. Teaching design in early grades is a new endeavor for teachers in the United States. Much can be learned from design teaching and research on K-12 design education outside of the US. The purpose of this study was to explore how students learn and use design sketching to support their learning of science and design practices. Researchers provided a treatment of design sketching instruction based on best practices of prior research finding (Hope in Des Technol Educ Int J 10: 43–53, 2005; Gustafson et al. J Technol Educ 19(1):19–34, 2007). A delayed treatment model was used to provide a two-group counterbalanced quasi-experimental design to compare an experimental group and comparison (delayed treatment) group results from (6) grade 3 classrooms. Researchers employed Hope’s Des Technol Educ Int J 10: 43–53, (2005) frame to organize sketching data for analysis. Findings from this study indicated that design instruction treatment did improve student’s design and communication practices, moving from using sketching as a container of ideas to the use of sketching as a form of design communication and to refine design ideas. Both the treatment and comparison groups improved sketching skills after treatment was provided to both groups. Sketching is a design practice that can also help student learn science concepts through the generation of mental models of conceptual understanding.},

Due to limited information requirements of this representation, that is concepts and relationships, the users are required to articulate only the mental models, without invoking the corresponding experiential knowledge stored in associative memory. The elicitation of mental models without being endorsed by experiential knowledge may lead to inaccurate, invalidated or biased mental models, and espoused theories, being stored for decision making. We introduce SDA articulation/ elicitation cycle, which invokes a user’s associative memory during the articulation/elicitation process to validate mental models. It is argued in this paper that by engaging associative memory during the mental model articulation/elicitation process, the accuracy and validity of mental models can be improved, the biases can be reduced, and the theories-in-use can be elicited rather than the espoused theories. A case study is presented to demonstrate the working and contributions of the SDA articulation/elicitation cycle.},

The purpose of this study was the investigation of the mental models that high school students form of the Internet in the beginning of the Informatics curriculum. The study involved 340 Greek high school students who completed a written questionnaire and a drawing task. The results suggest that students form simplistic, utilitarian rather than structural mental models of the Internet, which would provide them with an adequate explanatory system of what the Internet actually is and the processes underlying its use. The students’ mental models also involve particular misconceptions. The didactical implications of the ﬁndings for Informatics education at high school level are considered.},

Four types of mental models of the Web were identiﬁed based on the drawings and the associated descriptions: technical view, functional view, process view, and connection view. In the study, subjects were required to ﬁnish two search tasks. Searching behavior was measured from four aspects: navigation and performance, subjects’ feelings about tasks and their own performances, query construction, and search patterns. The four mental model groups showed diﬀerent navigation and querying behaviors, but the diﬀerences were not signiﬁcant. Subjects’ satisfaction with their own performances was found to be signiﬁcantly correlated with the time to complete the task. The results also showed that the familiarity of the task to subjects had a major eﬀect on their ways to start interaction, query construction, and search patterns.},

	abstract = {Signiﬁcant research has provided robust task and evaluation languages for the analysis of exploratory visualizations. Unfortunately, these taxonomies fail when applied to communicative visualizations. Instead, designers often resort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efﬁciency perspective: “can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?” However, designers are unlikely to be satisﬁed if the message went ‘in one ear and out the other.’ The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difﬁcult to design or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we address is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe their intent, and the language they have. We argue that visualization designers can address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a student and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can better deﬁne, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate how the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide array of communicative goals. To understand how the framework can be applied (and its limitations), we surveyed and interviewed members of the Data Visualization Society using their own visualizations as a probe. Through this study we identiﬁed the broad range of objectives in communicative visualizations and the prevalence of certain objective types.},

On a problem solving posttest, both supported drawing groups scored higher than the non-drawing Control group. Although the grade by condition interaction was not signiﬁcant, there was a strong trend in this direction. When sixth grade participants were considered independently, participants in the most supported drawing condition also obtained higher problem solving scores than those who drew without support. There were no signiﬁcant condition eﬀects for fourth grade nor were there any signiﬁcant eﬀects on a multiple-choice recognition posttest.

As a result of the research, it is found that the questions prepared by students are teachers are at lower cognitive level and teachers do not enough studies to improve their asking question skills. In the light of the findings, some suggestions are developed both to improve asking question skills of students in primary school Turkish Lessons and for the later studies.},

	abstract = {Background There is a growing interest in identifying strategies to achieve safer primary health-care provision. However, most of the research conducted so far in this area relies on information supplied by health-care providers, and limited attention has been paid to patients’ perspectives. Objective To explore patients’ experiences and perceptions of patient safety in English general practices with the aim of eliciting patient-centred recommendations for improving patient safety. Methods The Patient Reported Experiences and Outcomes of Safety in Primary Care questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 6736 primary care users registered in 45 English practices. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of responses to seven open-ended items addressing patients’ experiences of safety problems, lessons learnt as a result of such experiences and recommendations for safer health care. Results A total of 1244 (18.4\%) participants returned completed questionnaires. Of those, 678 (54.5\%) responded to at least one open-ended question. Two main themes emerged as follows: (i) experiences of safety problems and (ii) good practices and recommendations to improve patient safety in primary care. Most frequent experiences of safety problems were related to appointments, coordination between providers, tests, medication and diagnosis. Patients’ responses to these problems included increased patient activation (eg speaking up about concerns with their health care) and avoidance of unnecessary health care. Recommendations for safer health care included improvements in patient-centred communication, continuity of care, timely appointments, technical quality of care, active monitoring, teamwork, health records and practice environment. Conclusion This study identified a number of patient-centred recommendations for improving patient safety in English general practices.},

In two experiments, 8th-grade students (Exp. 1: N = 48; Exp. 2: N = 164) read a scientiﬁc text explaining the biological process of inﬂuenza and then took two learning outcome tests. In Experiment 1, students who were asked to draw pictures during reading (learnergenerated drawing group), scored higher than students who only read (control group) on a multiplechoice comprehension test (d = 0.85) and on a drawing test (d = 1.15). In Experiment 2, students in the learner-generated drawing group scored signiﬁcantly higher than the control group on both a multiplechoice comprehension test (d = 0.52) and on a drawing test (d = 1.89), but students who received authorgenerated pictures in addition to drawing or author-generated pictures only did not. Additionally, the drawing-accuracy scores during reading correlated with comprehension test scores (r = .623, r = .470) and drawing scores (r = .620, r = .615) in each experiment, respectively. These results provide further evidence for the generative drawing effect and the prognostic drawing effect, thereby conﬁrming the beneﬁts of the learner-generated drawing strategy.},

Results showed that students given diagrams performed signiﬁcantly better on post-tests than students given text. Diagrams students also generated signiﬁcantly more self-explanations that text students. Furthermore, the beneﬁts of self-explaining were much greater in the diagrams condition.

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore two accounts for why sketching during learning from text is helpful: (1) sketching acts like other constructive strategies such as self-explanation because it helps learners to identify relevant information and generate inferences; or (2) that in addition to these general effects, sketching has more speciﬁc beneﬁts due to the pictorial representation that is constructed. Seventy-three seventh-graders (32 girls, M = 12.82 years) were ﬁrst taught how to either create sketches or self-explain while studying science texts. During a subsequent learning phase, all students were asked to read an expository text about the greenhouse effect. Finally, they were asked to write down everything they remembered and then answer transfer questions. Strategy quality during learning was assessed as the number of key concepts that had either been sketched or mentioned in the self-explanations. The results showed that at an overall performance level there were only marginal group differences. However, a more in-depth analysis revealed that whereas no group differences emerged for students implementing either strategy poorly, the sketching group clearly outperformed the self-explanation group for students who applied the strategies with higher quality. Furthermore, higher sketching quality was strongly related to better learning outcomes. Thus, the study’s results are more in line with the second account: Sketching can have a beneﬁcial effect on learning above and beyond generating written explanations; at least, if well deployed.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the availability of massive amounts of personal data, the role of Information Visualization is getting more and more important. There are a lot of visualization and visual analytics tools to help people to make sense of their personal data in their everyday lives. There is a consensus in the visualization community about the importance of user engagement for personal visual analytics. However, there are many challenges associated with this topic. As of yet, there is no clear and widely accepted deﬁnition for user engagement. Consequently and despite some recent efforts, there are no systematic and uniﬁed methods for evaluating different aspects of user engagement. In this paper, we bring attention to some fundamental open issues in the context of Information Visualization: What is the deﬁnition of engagement? What are the levels of engagement? How to measure engagement? How to improve user engagement level? This research is an initial attempt towards addressing some of these issues. Our main goal is to enable visualization researchers to more accurately measure and evaluate user engagement with visualizations. To this end, we reviewed deﬁnitions, measures, and frameworks from various other disciplines and speciﬁed the gap in the visualization community. We propose a ﬁve level taxonomy for engagement which is deeply inspired by Boloom’s Taxonomy. In addition, we address some important open questions that require further exploration. This paper establishes a groundwork for future research in user engagement with visualizations.},

Frequently, such systems utilize levels of abstraction to improve the application development process, for instance by providing a data flow network editor. Unfortunately, these abstractions result in several issues, which need to be circumvented through an abstraction-centered system design. Often, a high level of abstraction hides low level details, which makes it difficult to directly access the underlying computing platform, which would be important to achieve an optimal performance. Therefore, we propose a layer structure developed for modern and sustainable visualization systems allowing developers to interact with all contained abstraction levels. We refer to this interaction capabilities as usage abstraction levels, since we target application developers with various levels of experience. We formulate the requirements for such a system, derive the desired architecture, and present how the concepts have been exemplary realized within the Inviwo visualization system. Furthermore, we address several specific challenges that arise during the realization of such a layered architecture, such as communication between different computing platforms, performance centered encapsulation, as well as layer-independent development by supporting cross layer documentation and debugging capabilities.},

Pros and cons of eye tracking methods are discussed here, including common analysis metrics. One example metric is the initial time at which all elements of a visualization that are required to complete a task have been viewed. An illustrative eye tracking study was conducted to compare how radial and linear graphs support value lookup tasks for both one and two data-dimensions. Linear and radial versions of bar, line, area, and scatter graphs were presented to 32 participants, who each completed a counterbalanced series of tasks. Tasks were completed more quickly on linear graphs than on those with a radial layout. Scanpath analysis revealed that a three-stage processing model was supported: (1) find desired data dimension, (2) find its datapoint, and (3) map the datapoint to its value. Mapping a datapoint to its value was slower on radial than linear graphs, probably because eyes need to follow a circular, as opposed to a linear path. Finding a datapoint within a dimension was harder using line and area graphs than bar and scatter graphs, possibly due to visual confusion of the line representing a data series. Although few errors were made, eye tracking was also used here to classify error strategies. As a result of these analyses, guidelines are proposed for the design of radial and linear graphs.},

We argue that inconsistencies across studies are caused by variance in participants’ strategies. The task employed here was specifically designed to bring these strategies and thereby the direction of rotation under experimental control. From the EEG recorded during the rotation period, we extracted an event-related slow potential whose amplitude is sensitive to the amount of mental rotation. In both strategy conditions, the slow potential’s amplitude was lower for clockwise than for counterclockwise rotations. We take this as evidence that mental rotation of alphanumeric characters is easier in a clockwise than in a counterclockwise direction.},

We analyzed the research findings for a wide range of visuospatial tasks, showing that there are two major directionality trends in perceptual preference: clockwise versus anticlockwise. It appears these preferences are combinatorial, such that a majority of people fall in the first category demonstrating a preference for stimuli/objects arranged from left-to-right rather than from right-to-left, while people in the second category show an opposite trend. These perceptual biases can guide sensorimotor integration and action, creating two corresponding turner groups in the population. In support of PAL, we propose another model explaining the origins of the biases – how the neurogenetic factors and the cultural factors interact in a biased competition framework to determine the direction and extent of biases. This dynamic model can explain not only the two major categories of biases in terms of direction and strength, but also the unbiased, unreliably biased or mildly biased cases in visuosptial functioning.},

Metaphoric mapping theory assumes that abstract concepts such as time are represented in terms of concrete, readily available dimensions. Consistent with this, many languages employ spatial metaphors to describe temporal relations. Here we investigate whether the timeis-space metaphor also affects visuospatial attention. In a first experiment, subjects categorized the names of actors in a manner compatible or incompatible with the orientation of a timeline. In two further experiments, subjects categorized or detected left- or right-side targets following prospective or retrospective time words. All three experiments show compatibility effects between the dimensions of space (left-right) and time (earlier-later) and indicate that the concept of time does indeed evoke spatial associations that facilitate responses to targets at spatially compatible locations.},

The spiral version of the GLCM is represented by the repeated spirals with variants, and is characterized by the multiple time concepts and the generative processes of life and death. The linear time concept, represented as a horizontal arrow, reflects an individual?s life characterized by a single stream of time from birth to death. Certainly, each individual is unique and can never be reproduced. Nevertheless, people can image and narrate stories in which their lives are regarded as being reproducible. These life stories based on repetition, reproduction, recovery and renewal have significant meanings for generative connections from past generations to future generations, and for the imaginations of continuities of multiple human lives within different historical eras},

Human beings differ from nonhuman animals in entertaining and communicating elaborate detached (as opposed to cued) event representations and temporal relational schemas. We distinguish deictically based (D-time) from sequentially based (S-time) representations, identifying these with the philosophical categories of A-series and B-series time. On the basis of cross-linguistic data, we claim that all cultures employ both D-time and S-time representations. We outline a cognitive model of event structure, emphasizing that this does not entail an explicit, separate representation of a time dimension. We propose that the notion of an event-independent, metric “time as such” is not universal, but a cultural and historical construction based on cognitive technologies for measuring time intervals. We critically examine claims that time is universally conceptualized in terms of spatial metaphors, and hypothesize that systematic space–time metaphor is only found in languages and cultures that have constructed the notion of time as a separate dimension. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing what is universal from what is variable in cultural and linguistic representations of time, and speculate on the general implications of an event-based understanding of time.},

	abstract = {As has been widely discussed, the National Research Council's (NRC) current policy in United States education advocates supporting students toward acquiring skills to engage in scientific practices. NRC policy also suggests that supporting students in the practices of science may require different approaches than what is required for supporting student engagement with scientific content. Further, acquiring skills in scientific practices is not limited to gaining proficiency in utilizing tools that support scientific inquiry: students must also understand how to interpret information generated from such tools. These tools of scientific practices are embedded within scientific culture, which from Sewell's perspective, is comprised of both practice and semiotic code (symbols and meanings). To become scientifically literate students must learn to utilize this code in practice. Author Germà Garcia-Belmonte identified one example of learning to utilize the semiotic code in scientific practice and considers challenges faced by undergraduate physics and engineering students within that context. Garcia-Belmonte observes students struggle to interpret symbols and meaning (the visual display generated) while engaging in practice (utilizing an oscilloscope) and posits that two, culturally bound, competing, linguistic metaphors of time may be the cause. Ultimately, however, the author does not explore beyond hypotheses. Although his theory may be correct, the paper serves as a reminder of the responsibility we have to students. As educators, it is useful and beneficial to make observations and develop theories surrounding why our students struggle. However, in addition to theorizing on why, for example, a particular scientific norm might present challenges for our students, we must remain mindful that challenges may not be uniform and may vary considerably according to students' culture(s). Engaging with students and soliciting specific information regarding the challenges they face allows us, as educators, to both examine whether students' reported challenges align or conflict with our own perceptions of those challenges, and subsequently devise and test methods toward supporting students in overcoming their challenges.},

This research considers their semiosic development across western cultures using cases from the earliest extant copies of the eighth century to current online versions. Cases are taken from the fields of religion, genealogy, history, anthropology, genetics, and popular culture. The paper begins with a general model of tree design based upon the linguistic representation of time, or tense, and then discusses in case study fashion, how each design was composed to support its use. Composition is discussed using the visual variables of the direction of time on the page, the key reference point, scale, alphanumeric and pictorial symbols, symbol positions, and the size, colour, tone, and texture of symbols and graphic elements. The paper argues that choices for the direction of time flow in a tree (e.g. left-to-right, right-to-left, top-down, etc.) depend upon many factors, which are the use of the diagram, the amount of information that needs to fit onto the page, patterns of reading and writing, aesthetic needs, the linguistic metaphor of descent, cultural values, and the "ideal-real" continuum that exists along the vertical axis for some types of graphics.

	abstract = {Spatial visualization is a well-established topic of education research that has allowed improving science and engineering students' skills on spatial relations. Connections have been established between visualization as a comprehension tool and instruction in several scientific fields. Learning about dynamic processes mainly relies upon static spatial representations or images. Visualization of time is inherently problematic because time can be conceptualized in terms of two opposite conceptual metaphors based on spatial relations as inferred from conventional linguistic patterns. The situation is particularly demanding when time-varying signals are recorded using displaying electronic instruments, and the image should be properly interpreted. This work deals with the interplay between linguistic metaphors, visual thinking and scientific instrument mediation in the process of interpreting time-varying signals displayed by electronic instruments. The analysis draws on a simplified version of a communication system as example of practical signal recording and image visualization in a physics and engineering laboratory experience. Instrumentation delivers meaningful signal representations because it is designed to incorporate a specific and culturally favored time view. It is suggested that difficulties in interpreting time-varying signals are linked with the existing dual perception of conflicting time metaphors. The activation of specific space-time conceptual mapping might allow for a proper signal interpretation. Instruments play then a central role as visualization mediators by yielding an image that matches specific perception abilities and practical purposes. Here I have identified two ways of understanding time as used in different trajectories through which students are located. Interestingly specific displaying instruments belonging to different cultural traditions incorporate contrasting time views. One of them sees time in terms of a dynamic metaphor consisting of a static observer looking at passing events. This is a general and widespread practice common in the contemporary mass culture, which lies behind the process of making sense to moving images usually visualized by means of movie shots. In contrast scientific culture favored another way of time conceptualization (static time metaphor) that historically fostered the construction of graphs and the incorporation of time-dependent functions, as represented on the Cartesian plane, into displaying instruments. Both types of cultures, scientific and mass, are considered highly technological in the sense that complex instruments, apparatus or machines participate in their visual practices.},

	abstract = {Time is generally conceptualized in terms of space as reﬂected in temporal-spatial metaphors. Two observation perspectives have been proposed in the front-back axis of the temporal-spatial metaphor. One is called “ego-moving perspective” and the other “time-moving perspective.” They are used to represent different relative motion between time and the observer. Previous studies have demonstrated the psychological reality of both perspectives. They also provided evidence that emotion can inﬂuence a perspective choice. In general, a positive emotion tends to facilitate the adoption of ego-moving perspective, whereas, a negative emotion tends to promote the adoption of time-moving perspective. However, it is unclear how the motivational dimension of emotion might inﬂuence the preference. The current study aimed to address the question by identifying conditions in which emotional valence or motivational attribute affects the choice of time movement perspective. An ambiguous temporal question and a visualized time motion schema were adopted to probe participants’ metaphorical representation of time when they were affected by emotion. Study 1 investigated how a future emotional event would affect participants’ choice of the time movement perspective. The results showed that positive future events led to a higher propensity to adopt an ego-moving perspective compared with negative future events. Study 2 explored participants’ tendency to choose time movement perspective for a vague or neutral future event, after they were induced into a particular emotional state. The results showed that when being in an emotional state of approach-motivation individuals were more likely to adopt an ego-moving perspective. In contrast, being in an emotional state of avoidance-motivation, individuals were more likely to take a time-moving perspective. Taken together, these results suggest that the emotional valence of future events can inﬂuence the choice of time movement perspectives; and the motivational dimension of present emotional states plays an important role when contemplating a neutral future event.},

A similar relationship occurred for March, where most respondents chose a position ranging from 2:30 to 3:00 o’clock but a group of respondents chose positions around 9:00 o’clock. About half of the respondents (N = 39,797) continued to fill out an online questionnaire probing their mental images related to the “year” concept. This clarified that 75\% of respondents “saw” the months unfolding in a clockwise direction versus 19\% in a counter clockwise fashion. Moreover, while a majority (70\%) stated that they imagined the year as a “circle,” the rest indicated the use of other mental images (e.g., ellipses and spirals, lines and squares, idiosyncratic or synesthetic spatial forms).

Visualization of daily patterns, as a special case, has not been systematically evaluated using radial charts. In contrast to yearly or weekly recurrent trends, the analysis of daily patterns on a radial chart may beneﬁt from our trained skill on reading radial clocks that are ubiquitous in our culture. In a crowd-sourced experiment with 92 non-expert users, we evaluated the accuracy, efﬁciency, and subjective ratings of radial and linear charts for visualizing daily trafﬁc accident patterns. We systematically compared juxtaposed 12-hours variants and single 24-hours variants for both layouts in four low-level tasks and one high-level interpretation task. Our results show that over all tasks, the most elementary 24-hours linear bar chart is most accurate and efﬁcient and is also preferred by the users.

This paper contrasts two analytical approaches, configural similarity comparison and Procrustes comparison, emphasizing the latter as a more rigorous and appropriate technique for facilitating such comparisons. As demonstrated in this study, Procrustes analysis provides a solid statistical and interpretative foundation to measuring the similarity of MDS configurations found in concept mapping output. Paired with a permutation strategy for assessing significance and examination of residual values, Procrustes analysis offers an objective means to evaluate the general concordance of multivariate patterns generated through group concept mapping. Statistical and visual techniques are also used to further explore the specific patterns of residual values generated in the Procrustes comparison. From this demonstration, a procedure for testing the correspondence between multiple two-dimensional concept maps where the same content is considered by independent groups is suggested.},

	abstract = {What is the role of language in constructing knowledge? In this article, we ask whether learning new relational language can create new ways of thinking. In Experiment 1, we taught English speakers to talk about time using new vertical linguistic metaphors, saying things like “breakfast is above dinner” or “breakfast is below dinner” (depending on condition). In Experiment 2, rather than teaching people new metaphors, we relied on the left–right representations of time that our American college student participants have already internalized through a lifetime of visuospatial experience reading and writing text from left to right. In both experiments, we asked whether the representations (whether newly acquired from metaphor or acquired over many years of visuospatial experience) are susceptible to verbal interference. We found that (a) learning new metaphors created new space–time associations that could be detected in a nonlinguistic implicit association task; (b) these newly learned representations were not susceptible to verbal interference; and (c) with respect to both verbal and visual interference, representations newly learned from linguistic metaphor behaved just like those on the left–right axis that our participants had acquired through years of visuospatial experience. Taken together, these results suggest that learning new relational language can be a powerful tool in constructing new representations and expanding our cognitive repertoire.},

In the paper we would like to apply this idea of framing one domain through conceptual settings of another domain to rough set theory (RST). The main goal is to construe rough sets in terms of the following mathematical metaphor: RST is a modular set-arithmetic. That is, we would like to map/project modular arithmetic onto rough sets, and, as a consequence, to redefine the fundamental concepts/objects of RST. Specifically, we introduce new topological operators (which play a similar role as remainders in modular arithmetic), discuss their formal properties, and finally apply them to the problem of vagueness (which has been intertwined with RST since the 1980’s).},

	abstract = {Purpose Two time metaphors are often adopted to express the passage of time: the ego-moving metaphor that conceptualizes the ego as moving toward the stationary event (e.g. we are approaching the holiday) or the event-moving metaphor that conceptualizes the event as moving toward the stationary ego (e.g. the holiday is approaching us). This paper aims to investigate the influence of the time metaphor on regulatory focus, as well as its downstream marketing implications.Design/methodology/approach Five studies were conducted. Studies 1a–1c examined the moderating effect of the valence of events on the relationship between time metaphors and regulatory focus. Studies 2–3 investigated the downstream marketing implications of the above effects.Findings The findings indicated that compared to the event-moving metaphor, the ego-moving metaphor is more likely to evoke a promotion focus when consumers anticipate a positive event. However, when the event is negative, the ego-moving metaphor is more likely to evoke a prevention focus compared to the event-moving metaphor.Research limitations/implications This research extends the previous literature on regulatory focus activation by showing that time metaphors affect regulatory focus, and that event valence plays a critical moderating role in the relationship.Practical implications Many companies rely on positive events (e.g. holidays, anniversaries) to market their products. The findings of this research suggest that companies promoting products with promotion-related benefits or products with higher risks should adopt an ego-moving metaphor to describe the coming of the event. In contrast, companies promoting products with prevention-related benefits or products with low risks should adopt an event-moving metaphor to describe the coming of the event.Originality/value This research showed that the effects of time metaphors on consumers’ regulatory focus depend on the valence of the events. It also demonstrated the downstream implications of time metaphors by showing that time metaphors influence consumer product choices and financial decisions.},

	abstract = {The present paper discusses the conceptual demands of an apparently straightforward task set to secondary‐level students—completing chemical word equations with a single omitted term. Chemical equations are of considerable importance in chemistry, and school students are expected to learn to be able to write and interpret them. However, it is recognised that many students find them challenging. The present paper explores students’ accounts of their attempts to identify the missing terms, to illuminate why working with chemical word equations is so challenging from the learner’s perspective. Three hundred secondary‐age students responded to a five‐item exercise based on chemicals and types of reactions commonly met at school level. For each item they were asked to identify the missing term in a word equation, and to explain their answers. This provided a database containing more than 1,000 student accounts of their rationales. Analysis of the data led to the identification of seven main classes of strategy used to answer the questions. Most approaches required the coordination of chemical knowledge at several different levels for a successful outcome; and there was much evidence both for correct answers based on flawed chemical thinking, and appropriate chemical thinking being insufficient to lead to the correct answer. It is suggested that the model reported here should be tested by more in‐depth methods, but could help chemistry teachers appreciate learners’ difficulties and offer them explicit support in selection and application of strategies when working with chemical equations.},

Although there is broad consensus that conceptual knowledge supports procedural knowledge, there is controversy over whether procedural knowledge supports conceptual knowledge and how instruction on the two types of knowledge should be sequenced. A review of the empirical evidence for mathematics learning indicates that procedural knowledge supports conceptual knowledge, as well as vice versa, and thus that the relations between the two types of knowledge are bidirectional. However, alternative orderings of instruction on concepts and procedures have rarely been compared, with limited empirical support for one ordering of instruction over another. We consider possible reasons for why mathematics education researchers often believe that a conceptual-to-procedural ordering of instruction is optimal and why so little research has evaluated this claim. Future empirical research on the effectiveness of different ways to sequence instruction on concepts and procedures is greatly needed.},

However, research on the developmental relations between these different types of knowledge has yielded unclear results, in part because little attention has been paid to the validity of the measures or to the effects of prior knowledge on the relations. To overcome these problems, we modeled the three constructs in the domain of equation solving as latent factors and tested (a) whether the predictive relations between conceptual and procedural knowledge were bidirectional, (b) whether these interrelations were moderated by prior knowledge, and (c) how both constructs contributed to procedural flexibility. We analyzed data from 2 measurement points each from two samples (Ns = 228 and 304) of middle school students who differed in prior knowledge. Conceptual and procedural knowledge had stable bidirectional relations that were not moderated by prior knowledge. Both kinds of knowledge contributed independently to procedural flexibility. The results demonstrate how changes in complex knowledge structures contribute to competence development. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, after decades of research, these interrelations are still under debate, and empirical results are inconclusive. The authors point out a source of these problems. Different kinds of knowledge and competencies only show up intertwined in behavior, making it hard to measure them validly and independently of each other. A multimethod approach was used to investigate the extent of these problems. A total of 289 fifth and sixth graders’ conceptual and procedural knowledge about decimal fractions was measured by 4 common hypothetical measures of each kind of knowledge. Study 1 tested whether treatments affected the 2 groups of measures in consistent ways. Study 2 assessed, across 3 measurement points, whether conceptual and procedural knowledge could be modeled as latent factors underlying the measures. The results reveal substantial problems with the validities of the measures, which might have been present but gone undetected in previous studies. A solution to these problems is essential for theoretical and practical progress in the field. The potential of the multimethod approach for this enterprise is discussed.

To effectively support transparent and explainable data systems, it is important for researchers and designers to know how users understand the system. We discuss the evaluation of users’ mental models of system logic. Mental models are challenging to capture and analyze. While common evaluation methods aim to approximate the user’s ﬁnal mental model after a period of system usage, user understanding continuously evolves as users interact with a system over time. In this paper, we review many common mental model measurement techniques, discuss tradeoffs, and recommend methods for deeper, more meaningful evaluation of mental models when using interactive data analysis and visualization systems. We present guidelines for evaluating mental models over time that reveal the evolution of speciﬁc model updates and how they may map to the particular use of interface features and data queries. By asking users to describe what they know and how they know it, researchers can collect structured, time-ordered insight into a user’s conceptualization process while also helping guide users to their own discoveries.},

Pairs of fractions were presented either simultaneously or sequentially. Results showed that participants only accessed the representation of the global magnitude of fractions in the numerical matching task.

	abstract = {Research summary: Managers' mental representations affect the perceived payoffs and alternatives that managers consider. Thus, mental representations affect how managers search for profitable strategies as well as the quality of strategies they discover. To study how mental representation and search interact, we formally model the dual search over possible representations and over policy choices of a strategy “landscape.” We analyze when it is preferable to emphasize searching for the best policies rather than the best mental representation, and vice versa. We show that, in the long run, a balance between the two search modes not only results in better expected performance, but also reduces the variation in performance. Additionally, the article describes conditions under which increased accuracy of mental representations can actually worsen firm performance. Managerial summary: Managers' mental representations affect the perceived payoffs and alternatives that managers consider. Thus, mental representations affect the quality of strategies managers can discover. We analyze a computer simulation of how managers use mental representations to search for strategies. This sheds light on how managers should deal with the trade-off between searching for policies and searching for representations; that is, whether managers should think creatively about how to represent a strategy problem or whether they should just stick to the current problem understanding, and try to find ways to improve performance as suggested by the current representation. We provide insight regarding the balance between the two search modes and describe conditions under which increasingly accurate mental representations can worsen firm performance.

	abstract = {Recent research on mental representation of complex action has revealed distinct differences in the structure of representational frameworks between experts and novices. More recently, research on the development of mental representation structure has elicited functional changes in novices’ representations as a result of practice. However, research investigating if and how mental practice adds to this adaptation process is lacking. In the present study, we examined the influence of mental practice (i.e., motor imagery rehearsal) on both putting performance and the development of one’s representation of the golf putt during early skill acquisition. Novice golfers (N = 52) practiced the task of golf putting under one of four different practice conditions: mental, physical, mental-physical combined, and no practice. Participants were tested prior to and after a practice phase, as well as after a three day retention interval. Mental representation structures of the putt were measured, using the structural dimensional analysis of mental representation. This method provides psychometric data on the distances and groupings of basic action concepts in long-term memory. Additionally, putting accuracy and putting consistency were measured using two-dimensional error scores of each putt. Findings revealed significant performance improvements over the course of practice together with functional adaptations in mental representation structure. Interestingly, after three days of practice, the mental representations of participants who incorporated mental practice into their practice regime displayed representation structures that were more similar to a functional structure than did participants who did not incorporate mental practice. The findings of the present study suggest that mental practice promotes the cognitive adaptation process during motor learning, leading to more elaborate representations than physical practice only.},

	abstract = {We propose a principled way to construct an internal representation of the temporal stimulus history leading up to the present moment. A set of leaky integrators performs a Laplace transform on the stimulus function, and a linear operator approximates the inversion of the Laplace transform. The result is a representation of stimulus history that retains information about the temporal sequence of stimuli. This procedure naturally represents more recent stimuli more accurately than less recent stimuli; the decrement in accuracy is precisely scale invariant. This procedure also yields time cells that fire at specific latencies following the stimulus with a scale-invariant temporal spread. Combined with a simple associative memory, this representation gives rise to a moment-to-moment prediction that is also scale invariant in time. We propose that this scale-invariant representation of temporal stimulus history could serve as an underlying representation accessible to higher-level behavioral and cognitive mechanisms. In order to illustrate the potential utility of this scale-invariant representation in a variety of fields, we sketch applications using minimal performance functions to problems in classical conditioning, interval timing, scale-invariant learning in autoshaping, and the persistence of the recency effect in episodic memory across timescales.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the mental representation of music notation. Notational audiation is the ability to internally 'hear' the music one is reading before physically hearing it performed on an instrument. In earlier studies, the authors claimed that this process engages music imagery contingent on subvocal silent singing. This study refines the previously developed embedded melody task and further explores the phonatory nature of notational audiation with throat-audio and larynx-electromyography measurement. Experiment 1 corroborates previous findings and confirms that notational audiation is a process engaging kinesthetic-like covert excitation of the vocal folds linked to phonatory resources. Experiment 2 explores whether covert rehearsal with the mind's voice also involves actual motor processing systems and suggests that the mental representation of music notation cues manual motor imagery. Experiment 3 verifies findings of both Experiments 1 and 2 with a sample of professional drummers. The study points to the profound reliance on phonatory and manual motor processing--a dual-route stratagem--used during music reading. Further implications concern the integration of auditory and motor imagery in the brain and cross-modal encoding of a unisensory input. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, this issue could not be addressed rigorously until late in the 20th century. Initial empirical findings spurred a debate about the heterogeneity of mental representation: Is all information stored in propositional, language-like, symbolic internal representations, or can humans use at least two different types of representations (and possibly many more)? Here, in historical context, we describe recent evidence that humans do not always rely on propositional internal representations but, instead, can also rely on at least one other format: depictive representation. We propose that the debate should now move on to characterizing all of the different forms of human mental representation.},

It also describes knowledge structures that show the relationships among these knowledge components and among other knowledge objects. It suggests that a knowledge structure is a form of schema such as those that leamers use to represent knowledge in memory. A mental model is a schema plus cognitive processes for manipulating and modifying the knowledge stored in a schema. We suggested processes that enable learners to manipulate the knowledge components of conceptual network knowledge structures for purposes of classification, generalization, and concept elaboration. We further suggested processes that enable learners to manipulate the knowledge components of process knowledge structures (PEAnets) for purposes of explanation, prediction, and trouble shooting. The hypothesis of this paper is that knowledge components and knowledge structures, such as those described in this paper, could serve as meta mental models that would enable learners to more easily acquire conceptual and causal networks and their associated processes. The resulting specific mental models would facilitate their ability to solve problems of conceptualization and interpretation.},

We present the results of a multimodal image-schematic microanalysis of three interactive infant-directed performances (the composition of movement, touch, speech, and vocalization that adults produce for-and-with the infants). The microanalyses show that adults aesthetically highlight the image-schematic structures embedded in the multimodal composition of the performance, and that primary metaphors are also lived as embedded in these inter-enactive experiences. The findings allow corroborating that the psychological domains of cognition and affection are not in rivalry or conflict but rather intertwined in meaningful experiences.},

For each group both congruent and incongruent alarms were used to represent different driving task scenarios. Once sounded, participants were required to respond to each alarm by selecting a corresponding driving scenario. User performance for all sound types improved over time, however even with experience a decrement in speed of response remained for the incongruent iconic sounds and in accuracy of performance for the abstract warning sounds when compared to the congruent auditory icons.

Highly collaborative human-robot teams promise to maximize the capabilities of humans and machines. While a great deal of progress has been made toward developing efficient spatial path planning algorithms for robots, comparatively less attention has been paid to developing reliable means by which to assess the similarities and differences in path planning decisions and associated behaviors of humans and robots in these teams. This paper discusses a tool, the Algorithm for finding the Least Cost Areal Mapping between Paths (ALCAMP), which can be used to compare paths planned by humans and algorithms in order to quantify the differences between them, and understand the user's mental models underlying those decisions. In addition, this paper discusses prior and proposed future research related to human-robot collaborative teams. Prior studies using ALCAMP have measured path divergence in order to quantify error, infer decision-making processes, assess path memory, and assess team communication performance. Future research related to human-robot teaming includes measuring formation and path adherence, testing the repeatability of navigation algorithms and the clarity of communicated navigation instructions, inferring shared mental models for navigation among members of a group, and detecting anomalous movement.},

When luminance had to be compared under specific task conditions, we revealed, for the first time, a true influence of number on luminance judgments: Darker stimuli were consistently associated with numerically larger stimuli. However, when number had to be compared, luminance contrast, not luminance, influenced number judgments. Apparently, associations exist between number and luminance, as well as luminance contrast, of which the latter is probably stronger. Therefore, similar tasks, comprising exactly the same stimuli, can lead to distinct interference effects.},

At the briefest prime durations (14 and 28 ms), we failed to find any evidence for unattended priming effects, consistent with Lachter et al., but there were some small priming (i.e., congruency) effects at the attended location. The 14 ms primes could not be discriminated above chance, but could be detected. Our results support the claim that perceptual processing is strongest with focal attention. For the 14 ms primes at the attended location, results could support an unconscious perception claim, but the effect was weak and awareness of the primes was unlikely to have been completely eliminated.},

Research on knowledge structures suggests that people conceive of events as goal-directed partonomic hierarchies. Here, participants segmented videos of events into coarse and fine units on separate viewings; some described the activity of each unit as well. Both segmentation and descriptions support the hierarchical bias hypothesis in event perception: observers spontaneously encoded the events in terms of partonomic hierarchies. Hierarchical organization was strengthened by simultaneous description, and to a weaker extent, by familiarity. Describing from memory rather than perception yielded fewer units but did not alter the qualitative nature of the descriptions. Although the descriptions were telegraphic and without communicative intent, their hierarchical structure was evident to naive readers. The data suggest that cognitive schemata mediate between perceptual and functional information about events, and indicate that these knowledge structures may be organized around object/action units.},

	abstract = {We investigated human understanding of different network visualizations in a large-scale online experiment. Three types of network visualizations were examined: node-link and two different sorting variants of matrix representations on a representative social network of either 20 or 50 nodes. Understanding of the network was quantiﬁed using task time and accuracy metrics on questions that were derived from an established task taxonomy. The sample size in our experiment was more than an order of magnitude larger (N = 600) than in previous research, leading to high statistical power and thus more precise estimation of detailed effects. Speciﬁcally, high statistical power allowed us to consider modern interaction capabilities (e.g., mouse-over highlighting and pen-stroke annotations) as part of the evaluated visualizations, and to evaluate overall learning rates as well as ambient (implicit) learning. Findings indicate that participant understanding was best for the nodelink visualization, with higher accuracy and faster task times than the two matrix visualizations. However, this performance advantage for node-link over matrix was attenuated in the larger (50node) network. Analysis of participant learning indicated a large initial difference in task time between the node-link and matrix visualizations, with matrix performance steadily approaching that of the node-link visualization over the course of the experiment. We also report an exploratory analysis of participants’ mouse movements and annotations.

	abstract = {Comprehension of graphics can be considered as a process of schema-mediated structure mapping from external graphics on internal mental models. Two experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that graphics possess a perceptible surface structure as well as a semantic deep structure both of which affect mental model construction. The same content was presented to different groups of learners by graphics from different perspectives with different surface structures but the same deep structure. Deep structures were complementary: major features of the learning content in one experiment became minor features in the other experiment, and vice versa. Text was held constant. Participants were asked to read, understand, and memorize the learning material. Furthermore, they were either instructed to process the material from the perspective supported by the graphic or from an alternative perspective, or they received no further instruction. After learning, they were asked to recall the learning content from different perspectives by completing graphs of different formats as accurately as possible. Learners’ recall was more accurate if the format of recall was the same as the learning format which indicates surface structure influences. However, participants also showed more accurate recall when they remembered the content from a perspective emphasizing the deep structure, regardless of the graphics format presented before. This included better recall of what they had not seen than of what they really had seen before. That is, deep structure effects overrode surface effects. Depending on context conditions, stimulation of additional cognitive processing by instruction had partially positive and partially negative effects.},

These mental models are in part constituted by an underlying structure of associated concepts that are modified as a person gains experience with a system or domain. Video games provide a context that encourages the development of sophisticated mental models. The current research sought to understand how mental model structures differ between video game players of varying experience levels. Participants were recruited both over internet forums and through Mechanical Turk. Mental model structures were measured using relatedness ratings between pairs of concepts that were derived from players with high levels of experience playing League of Legends. Relatedness ratings were transformed into Pathfinder networks that were used to analyze mental model structures. Results revealed structural differences in mental models between experience levels. A three-stage model of mental model structure development is proposed to explain the results, which suggest that some structural characteristics appear earlier in mental model development than others. The role of mental model structural characteristics is discussed in light of both the design of training programs and video games.},

Therefore, mental models constitute a valu­ able source of information, making it imperative to document them in detail, while preserving the integrity of stakeholders’ beliefs. We propose a methodology, the Rich Elicitation Approach (REA), which combines direct and indirect elicitation techniques to meet these goals. We describe the approach in the context of the effects of climate change on Baltic salmon. The REA produced holistic depictions of mental models, with more variables and causal relationships per diagram than direct elicitation alone, thus providing a solid knowledge base on which to begin PM studies. The REA was well received by stakeholders and fulfilled the substantive, normative, instrumental, and educational functions of PM. However, motivating stakeholders to confirm the accuracy of their models during the verification stage of the REA was challenging.},

A total of 80 university students learned from an illustrated text different day times and different dates exist simultaneously on the earth. One half of the participants received the text combined with pictures visualizing the earth as a kind of carpet (carpet pictures), whereas the other half received the text combined with pictures visualizing the earth surface as a circle (circle pictures). After learning, the participants received a test including different kinds of tasks. In both visualization groups, one half of the participants solved the tasks with an additional external representation, whereas the other half solved the tasks without an external representation. The ﬁndings indicate that the form of visualization affects the structure of mental models. Different structures of mental models result in different patterns of performance, when individuals solve tasks based only on their mental representations acquired during their previous learning. However, these effects decrease, when further external representations are made available to the learners. The ﬁndings are discussed within a broader framework of learning with multiple external representations.},

	abstract = {Knowledge intensive processes are often driven and constrained by the mental models of experts acting as direct participants or managers. Descriptions of these relationships are not generally available from traditional data sources but are stored in the mental models of experts. Often the knowledge is not explicit but tacit, so it is dicult to describe, examine, and use. Consequently, improvement of complex processes is plagued by false starts, failures, institutional and interpersonal con¯ict, and policy resistance. Modelers face diculties in eliciting and representing the knowledge of experts so that useful models can be developed. We describe and illustrate an elicitation method that uses formal modeling and three description format transformations to help experts explicate their tacit knowledge. We use the method to elicit detailed process knowledge describing the development of a new semiconductor chip. The method improved model accuracy and credibility and provided tools for development team mental model improvement. *c 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	title = {Mental {Models}: {An} {Interdisciplinary} {Synthesis} of {Theory} and {Methods}},
	abstract = {Mental models are personal, internal representations of external reality that people use to interact with the world around them. They are constructed by individuals based on their unique life experiences, perceptions, and understandings of the world. Mental models are used to reason and make decisions and can be the basis of individual behaviors. They provide the mechanism through which new information is filtered and stored. Recognizing and dealing with the plurality of stakeholder’s perceptions, values, and goals is currently considered a key aspect of effective natural resource management (NRM) practice. Therefore, gaining a better understanding of how mental models internally represent complex, dynamic systems and how these representations change over time will allow us to develop mechanisms to enhance effective management and use of natural resources. Realizing this potential, however, relies on developing and testing adequate tools and techniques to elicit these internal representations of the world effectively. This paper provides an interdisciplinary synthesis of the literature that has contributed to the theoretical development and practical application of the mental model construct. It explores the utility and applicability of the construct in the context of NRM and includes a review of elicitation techniques used within the field. The major theoretical and practical challenges that arise in drawing on the construct to provide a cognitive dimension to NRM are also addressed.},

	abstract = {Comics is cinema without motion or sound. Like films, comics tell stories through a sequence of images. Likewise, they incorporate sound effects, spoken dialogue, and voice-over narration, all rendered as text so that the sound emerges in the reader’s mind rather than from sound waves impinging on the ear. Unlike film, comics present images simultaneously, in durable form, rather than in rapid succession, to produce the illusion of moving images. This means that the comics reader must add motion and dynamics to the story conceptually, mentally animating the narrated events. The static, soundless nature of comics poses problems of representation for the comics artist and of interpretation for the comics reader. These problems are acute in the popular genre of superhero comics — with characters like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, Green Lantern, Captain America, Iron Man, X-Men, and so on — where complex, fast-paced action is central to the story. How do the static images of action comics become dynamic events in the mind of the reader? What representational conventions prompt these interpretations, and what is the conceptual basis for these representations and their functions? The present chapter addresses these questions of depiction and meaning-making from the perspective of cognitive linguistics.},

Starting from the theoretical background on multimodal metaphors and comics studies, and using a corpus comprising comics and graphic novels published by both mainstream and independent American houses, the authors propose the following three types of relations which occur in multimodal metaphors in this medium: (1) image-dominant metaphors, (2) text-dominant metaphors, and (3) complementary metaphors.},

	abstract = {Moving towards a place and manipulating objects are probably the most important manifestations of goal-oriented actions. Both SELF-PROPELLED MOTION TOWARD A DESTINATION and MAKING AN OBJECT are thus profoundly embodied source domains for the metaphorical conceptualization of PURPOSIVE ACTIVITY. Of these metaphors, only the former—popularly known as LIFE IS A JOURNEY— has received a large amount of attention. Focusing especially on the role of the various FORCE schemas (Johnson 1987), this chapter investigates metaphors from both source domains in three short wordless animation films. Animation provides a perfect medium to express these metaphors in a condensed, aesthetically appealing, and emotion-generating manner. In line with Conceptual Metaphor Theory, it is argued that viewers’ understanding and appreciation of these metaphors critically depends on image schemas. Stressing that the body is the beginning but not the end of meaning-making, the chapter also shows that this understanding cannot be reduced to them and that cultural and contextual factors qualify and fine-tune embodied schemas.},

To understand the potential of comics as a storytelling medium, we ﬁrst created a variety of comics during a 3 month structured design process, involving domain experts from public education and neuroscience. This process led to the deﬁnition of 8 design factors for creating graph comics and propose design solutions for each. Results from a qualitative study suggest that a general audience is quickly able understand complex temporal changes through graph comics, provided with minimal textual annotations and no training.},

Likelihood ratio estimates can be used to generate the post-test probability of bias, and correcting effect estimates for bias is possible in theory, but may not necessarily be reliable.},

	abstract = {We compared designs of guidance to support students while interacting with dynamic visualizations of complex scientific phenomena in inquiry instruction. Three hundred thirty-two 7th-grade students were randomly assigned to either a reading or a generating condition and completed a web-based inquiry unit focusing on energy concepts in photosynthesis. When students interacted with a dynamic visualization of energy transformation, typical guidance provided text explanations while inquiry-oriented guidance asked students to generate their own explanations about three key energy transformation concepts. The results showed that both reading and generating explanations helped students interpret the visualization, but generating explanations was more beneficial. Students who generated explanations were better able to extract salient information and distinguish among multiple ideas. In particular, they made more connections between their understanding of energy transformation learned from the visualization to other energy concepts to articulate the process of photosynthesis than those who read instructional explanations. Analyses of log data revealed that students in each condition spent similar amounts of time learning from the visualization but navigated the activities in distinct ways and engaged in different kinds of collaborative discourse. This study builds on previous research showing the value of prompting students to generate explanations by clarifying the effective timing for such guidance and characterizing how it helps students make sense of visualizations. These results show that well-designed guidance enables students working in pairs to generate useful explanations for learning from visualizations and suggest promising designs for online instruction featuring dynamic visualizations. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we begin to address this challenge by identifying components of science infographics that can be focused on in instructional settings. Using six infographics developed by professionals and published online, we gained insight from 10 individuals with expertise in science, graphic/information design, and learning sciences on their thinking about graphic and information design related to science. Each participant was provided with two infographics and was asked to critically appraise by interpreting and evaluating the quality of each artifact. Inductive analysis of transcripts using constant comparison method resulted in five super-ordinate categories, some with subcategories, representing aspects of infographics these experts attend to. The identified categories can be used as inputs in teaching and learning about the use and creation of science infographics and broadly visual representations. Connections to the literature on science education, science communication, and science and technology studies are made, and directions for future research described. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The process of understanding a visualization therefore involves an interaction between these external visual metaphors and the user's internal knowledge representations. To investigate this claim, we conducted an experiment to test the effects of visual metaphor and verbal metaphor on the understanding of tree visualizations. Participants answered simple data comprehension questions while viewing either a treemap or a node-link diagram. Questions were worded to reflect a verbal metaphor that was either compatible or incompatible with the visualization a participant was using. The results suggest that the visual metaphor indeed affects how a user derives information from a visualization. Additionally, we found that the degree to which a user is affected by the metaphor is strongly correlated with the user's ability to answer task questions correctly. These findings are a first step towards illuminating how visual metaphors shape user understanding, and have significant implications for the evaluation, application, and theory of visualization.},

They describe a process in which students develop a research question within a domain, investigate a variety of claims and evidence wherever they lead, play with connections and assess contradictions, and wonder about the possible significance of their findings. Abilock and Williams are sure that cultivating an open-minded disposition and thoughtful inquiry strategies will benefit students' civic literacy and creativity, and that students' thinking about the interaction between a complex text and images in the service of a purpose and audience will improve their reading comprehension.},

	abstract = {While information visualization frameworks and heuristics have traditionally been reluctant to include acquired codes of meaning, designers are making use of them in a wide variety of ways. Acquired codes leverage a user's experience to understand the meaning of a visualization. They range from figurative visualizations which rely on the reader's recognition of shapes, to conventional arrangements of graphic elements which represent particular subjects. In this study, we used content analysis to codify acquired meaning in visualization. We applied the content analysis to a set of infographics and data visualizations which are exemplars of innovative and effective design. 88\% of the infographics and 71\% of data visualizations in the sample contain at least one use of figurative visualization. Conventions on the arrangement of graphics are also widespread in the sample. In particular, a comparison of representations of time and other quantitative data showed that conventions can be specific to a subject. These results suggest that there is a need for information visualization research to expand its scope beyond perceptual channels, to include social and culturally constructed meaning. Our paper demonstrates a viable method for identifying figurative techniques and graphic conventions and integrating them into heuristics for visualization design.},

	abstract = {The entity and relation recognition, i.e. (1) assigning semantic classes (e.g., person, organization and location) to entities in a sentence, and (2) determining the relations (e.g., born-in and employee-of) held between the corresponding entities, is an important task in areas such as information extraction and question answering. Subtasks (1) and (2) are typically carried out sequentially, and this procedure is problematic: errors made during subtask (1) are propagated to subtask (2) with an accumulative effect; and in many cases information that becomes available only during subtask (2) (e.g., the class of an entity corresponds to the first argument of relation born-in (X, China)) would be helpful for subtask (1) (e.g., the class of the entity cannot be a location but a person). To address problems of this kind, this paper develops a novel method, which allows subtasks (1) and (2) to be linked more closely together. The procedure is separated to three stages. Firstly, employ two classifiers to perform subtasks (1) and (2) independently. Secondly, the semantic class of each entity is determined by taking into account the classes of all the entities in the sentence, as computed during the previous step. This is achieved using a special model dubbed 'entity relation propagation diagram' and 'entity relation propagation tree'. Thirdly, each relation is then assigned a class by considering the semantic classes of the entities produced at the previous step. Our experimental results show that the method improves not only relation recognition but also entity recognition in some degree. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Furthermore, the researchers are interested in understanding and interpreting variability in treatment effects through moderation analysis as an approach to exploring the sources of the treatment effect variability. This study develops formulas for power analyses to detect the moderator effects in designing three-level cluster randomized trials (CRTs). We develop the statistical formulas for calculating statistical power, minimum detectable effect size difference, and 95\% confidence intervals for cluster or cross-level moderation, nonrandomly varying or random slopes, binary or continuous moderators, and designs with or without covariates.

	abstract = {This practical guide on conducting power analyses using PASW/SPSS was written for students and researchers with limited quantitative backgrounds. Readers will appreciate the coverage of topics that are not well described in competing books such as estimating effect sizes, power analyses for complex designs, detailed coverage of popular multiple regression and multi-factor ANOVA approaches, and power for multiple comparisons and simple effects. Practical issues such as how to increase power without increasing sample size, how to report findings, how to derive effect size expectations, and how to support null hypotheses, are also addressed. Unlike other texts, this book focuses on the statistical and methodological aspects of the analyses. Performing analyses using software applications rather than via complex hand calculations is demonstrated throughout. Ready-to-use PASW/SPSS syntax for conducting analyses are included to perform calculations and power analyses at www.psypress.com/applied-power-analysis. Detailed annotations for each syntax protocol review the minor modifications necessary for researchers to adapt the syntax to their own analyses. As such, the text reviews both power analysis techniques and provides tools for conducting analyses. Numerous examples enhance accessibility by demonstrating specific issues that must be addressed at all stages of the power analysis and providing detailed interpretations of PASW/SPSS output. Several examples address techniques for estimation of power and hand calculations as well. Chapter summaries and key statistics sections also aid in understanding the material. Chapter 1 reviews significance testing and introduces power. Chapters 2 through 9 cover power analysis strategies for a variety of common designs. Precision analysis for confidence intervals around mean difference, correlations, and effect sizes is the focus of chapter 10. The book concludes with a review of how to report power analyses, a review of freeware and commercial software for power analyses, and how to increase power without increasing sample size. Chapters focusing on simpler analyses such as t-tests present detailed formulae and calculation examples. Chapters focusing on more complex topics such as mixed model ANOVA/MANOVA present primarily computer-based analyses. Intended as a supplementary text for graduate-level research methods, experimental design, quasi-experimental methods, psychometrics, statistics, and/or advanced/multivariate statistics taught in the behavioral, social, biological, and medical sciences, researchers in these fields also appreciate this book's practical emphasis.

The macro is designed to estimate statistical parameters for multiple school subjects and multiple grades in a single computer run. Among other convenient features, the macro calculates intraclass correlation coefficient confidence intervals, which are essential for planning studies conservatively. We also provide a SAS macro for calculating benchmarks–again, using locally-based–data for interpreting the feasibility of achieving the minimum detectable effect sizes that are calculated in statistical power analyses. The benchmarks are potentially useful for interpreting the meaning of the effect sizes that are achieved in completed studies, as well. We describe the macros, describe how we verified their accuracy, show how they can be useful to education evaluators, and give examples of their use with statewide educational assessment data.

The goal of this work is to strengthen the interaction side of visualization. Based on a brief review of general aspects of interaction, we develop an interaction-oriented view on visualization. This view comprises five key aspects: the data, the tasks, the technology, the human, as well as the implementation. Picking up these aspects individually, we elaborate several interaction methods for visualization. We introduce a multi-threading architecture for efficient interactive exploration.

For sample and effect sizes common to experimental psychology, v suggests that OLS produces estimates that are insufficiently accurate for the type of hypotheses being tested.

One reason is that interaction is an intangible concept that is difficult to design, quantify, and evaluate. Unlike for visual design, there are few examples that show visualization practitioners and researchers how to design the interaction for a new visualization in the best manner. In this article, we attempt to address this issue by collecting examples of visualizations with ‘best-in-class’ interaction and using them to extract practical design guidelines for future designers and researchers.

However, one fundamental requirement of any interactive experience is the desire to continue the experience, and this study is concerned with investigating engagement in interactive narratives by focusing on this aspect. In the present approach, engagement is described as the user’s desire to continue an activity in order to accomplish an objective while experiencing affect. In order to investigate engagement during run time, this description is used as a foundation for formulating an intrusive method and the Engagement Sampling Questionnaire. The application of the method and the questionnaire is exemplified by an investigation of continuation desire in the experiential learning scenario, “The First Person Victim”, where participants experience a non-pleasant emergent narrative concerned with being a victim of war.},

During the last decade, a number of books addressing major questions in the study of emotion have been published in response to a rapidly increasing demand that has been fueled by an increasing number of psychologists whose research either focuses on or involves the study of emotion. Very few of these books, however, have presented an explicit discussion of the tools for conducting research, despite the facts that the study of emotion frequently requires highly specialized procedures, instruments, and coding strategies, and that the field has reached a point where a large number of excellent elicitation procedures and assessment instruments have been developed and validated. Handbook of Emotion Elicitation and Assessment corrects this oversight in the literature by organizing and detailing all the major approaches and instruments for the study of emotion. It is the most complete reference for methods and resources in the field, and will serve as a practical resource for emotion researchers by providing easy access to a host of scales, stimuli, coding systems, assessment tools, and innovative methodologies. This handbook will help to advance research in emotion by encouraging researchers to take greater advantage of standard and well-researched approaches, which will increase both the productivity in the field and the speed and accuracy with which research can be communicated.},

	abstract = {In statistics, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is a special form of factor analysis, most commonly used in social research. It is used to test whether measures of a construct are consistent with a researcher's understanding of the nature of that construct (or factor). As such, the objective of confirmatory factor analysis is to test whether the data fit a hypothesized measurement model. This hypothesized model is based on theory and/or previous analytic research. CFA was first developed by Jöreskog and has built upon and replaced older methods of analyzing construct validity such as the MTMM Matrix as described in Campbell \& Fiske (1959).
In confirmatory factor analysis, the researcher first develops a hypothesis about what factors he believes are underlying the measures he has used (e.g., "Depression" being the factor underlying the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression) and may impose constraints on the model based on these a priori hypotheses. By imposing these constraints, the researcher is forcing the model to be consistent with his theory. For example, if it is posited that there are two factors accounting for the covariance in the measures, and that these factors are unrelated to one another, the researcher can create a model where the correlation between factor A and factor B is constrained to zero. Model fit measures could then be obtained to assess how well the proposed model captured the covariance between all the items or measures in the model. If the constraints the researcher has imposed on the model are inconsistent with the sample data, then the results of statistical tests of model fit will indicate a poor fit, and the model will be rejected. If the fit is poor, it may be due to some items measuring multiple factors. It might also be that some items within a factor are more related to each other than others.
For some applications, the requirement of "zero loadings" (for indicators not supposed to load on a certain factor) has been regarded as too strict. A newly developed analysis method, "exploratory structural equation modeling", specifies hypotheses about the relation between observed indicators and their supposed primary latent factors while allowing for estimation of loadings with other latent factors as well.},

	abstract = {In statistics, latent variables (from Latin: present participle of lateo (“lie hidden”), as opposed to observable variables), are variables that are not directly observed but are rather inferred (through a mathematical model) from other variables that are observed (directly measured). Mathematical models that aim to explain observed variables in terms of latent variables are called latent variable models. Latent variable models are used in many disciplines, including psychology, economics, medicine, physics, machine learning/artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, natural language processing, econometrics, management and the social sciences.
Sometimes latent variables correspond to aspects of physical reality, which could in principle be measured, but may not be for practical reasons. In this situation, the term hidden variables is commonly used (reflecting the fact that the variables are "really there", but hidden). Other times, latent variables correspond to abstract concepts, like categories, behavioral or mental states, or data structures. The terms hypothetical variables or hypothetical constructs may be used in these situations.
One advantage of using latent variables is that it reduces the dimensionality of data. A large number of observable variables can be aggregated in a model to represent an underlying concept, making it easier to understand the data. In this sense, they serve a function similar to that of scientific theories. At the same time, latent variables link observable ("sub-symbolic") data in the real world to symbolic data in the modeled world.
Latent variables, as created by factor analytic methods, generally represent "shared" variance, or the degree to which variables "move" together. Variables that have no correlation cannot result in a latent construct based on the common factor model.},

For those involved in creating self-report measures, the completely updated Third Edition of Instrument Development in the Affective Domain balances the art and science of instrument development and evaluation, covering both its conceptual and technical aspects. The book is written to be accessible with the minimum of statistical background, and reviews affective constructs from a measurement standpoint. Examples are drawn from academic and business settings for insights into design as well as the relevance of affective measures to educational and corporate testing. This systematic analysis of all phases of the design process includes: Measurement, scaling, and item-writing techniques.Validity issues: collecting evidence based on instrument content.Testing the internal structure of an instrument: exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Measurement invariance and other advanced methods for examining internal structure.Strengthening the validity argument: relationships to external variables. Addressing reliability issues.

In this chapter, we introduce the most fundamental concept in instrument development: validity. While validity has no single agreed definition in the larger scientific community, in the area of instrument development it does refer to a very specific evidence gathering process for inferences made about latent quantities of latent constructs. As a result, Chapter 3 can be seen as an extension of the latent construct operationism started in Chapter 2. This evidence gathering process is a recurring one with elements discussed also in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. The test content validity discussed in this chapter is part of a non-statistical judgmental process done by content experts before it is present to respondents. As a result, the chapter is devoted to the methods involved in helping instrument developers translate their conceptual understanding of the affective characteristic into a well-functioning operational construct. This chapter introduces the researchers to the most commonly employed approaches to the process of establishing validity through the test content},

	abstract = {Traditionally, evaluation studies in information visualization have measured effectiveness by assessing performance time and accuracy. More recently, there has been a concerted effort to understand aspects beyond time and errors. In this paper we study enjoyment, which, while arguably not the primary goal of visualization, has been shown to impact performance and memorability. Different models of enjoyment have been proposed in psychology, education and gaming; yet there is no standard approach to evaluate and measure enjoyment in visualization. In this paper we relate the flow model of Csikszentmihalyi to Munzner's nested model of visualization evaluation and previous work in the area. We suggest that, even though previous papers tackled individual elements of flow, in order to understand what specifically makes a visualization enjoyable, it might be necessary to measure all specific elements.},

	abstract = {The importance of the affective domain in school and corporate environments is discussed. The research literature supporting the theoretical base and importance of the following affective characteristics is presented: attitudes, self-efficacy, values, self-concept, and interests. Allport’s (1935) early work identifying attitudes as “the most distinctive and indispensable concept in contemporary social psychology” (p. 798), defined an attitude as “a mental and neural state of readiness, organized through experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon the individual’s response to all objects and situations with which it is related” (Allport 1935, p. 810) is presented. Of all the constructs described in this chapter, self-efficacy is perhaps the most important: it connects human motivation, thought processes, and behavior. As discussed by Bandura (1989), social cognitive theory recognizes the social origins of our thoughts and actions and the important role that cognition and thought play in human motivation, affect, and action. Rokeach’s (1973) extensive work with the construct of values is presented in which he clarifies the difference between an attitude and a value by stating that an attitude refers to an organization of several beliefs around a specific object or situation, whereas a value refers to a simple belief of a very specific kind. Aiken’s work is reviewed, which refers to a value as “the importance or worth attached to particular activities and objects” (Aiken 1980, p. 2). Coopersmith’s work (1967, 1989) with self-concept or self-esteem is reviewed, where he referred to “the evaluation which the individual makes and customarily maintains with regard to himself; it expresses an attitude of approval or disapproval, and indicates the extent to which the individual believes himself to be capable, significant, successful, and worthy” (Coopersmith 1967, pp. 4–5). The early work of Strong and Kuder, where interests were defined as “preferences for particular work activities” (Nunnally and Bernstein 1994), is reviewed. Sample instruments developed to measure each of the constructs are identified.},

In addition, we describe the operationalization of a latent construct, the process where instrument developers make both substantive and methodological decisions about the treatment of the observed variables that they are using to model the affective characteristic. This chapter aims to aid the instrument developer in the question or item construction process by highlighting the numerous theoretical and empirical implications of construct definition, measurement, and scaling choices available.

	abstract = {In psychometrics, reliability is used to describe the consistency of a measure. Reliability can be understood in the terms when describing its meaning in the instrument development process. The goal of reliability becomes the determination of how much variability in the instrument score is due to “measurement error” and how much is due to variability in “true score” of the respondent. This chapter approaches reliability from the classical test theory (CTT) model. Most importantly in this chapter, however, the focus is on the concept of correlation and how to index it for purpose of understanding the “reliability” or consistency of the instrument under the CTT framework. This chapter discusses a variety of ways that reliability can be understood and how each represent distinct quantifications of consistency. Through several examples, different types of reliability are illustrated along with “acceptable” levels of consistency that should be expected from their measurement of characteristics in the affective domain. One of the central limitations of true score theory is that only one type of error can be addressed at a time. This chapter provides brief introduction to the conceptual framework of Generalizability theory (G-theory), which provides one potential solution to this issue. The chapter concludes with a discussion that links validity and reliability, the two central concepts that frame all the work behind the development of instruments for measuring affective characteristics.},

The purpose of Chapter 4 is to introduce the most effective and accepted methods for understanding the internal structure of instruments developed to measure affective characteristics. The internal structure of an instrument is the empirically defined mathematical relationship between the proposed latent construct(s) and the items observed variables in the instrument. This mathematical relationship is commonly understood as dimensionality—and the empirical evidence needed to understand the dimensionality of the proposed instrument can only be supplied by a sample of “real” subjects. Chapter 4 largely addresses with a family of techniques known as factor analysis. The chapter specifically discusses two techniques commonly employed in the process of understanding the internal structure of an instrument. The chapter provides an overview of both exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis and explains their utility and usage within the instrument development process.},

In this chapter, we introduce two common instrument development situations where discrete mathematical structures are encountered: latent class analysis (LCA) and item response theory (IRT). In LCA, both the latent variable and the indicator variable are best represented by a categorical structure. In IRT, the latent trait is continuous, but the items are the items are categorical. IRT has historically been used in educational achievement applications, however, it is gaining popularity in some affective characteristic measurement scenarios. The last section of the chapter is devoted to the topic of measurement invariance and the analytic techniques that allow instrument developers to explore whether the scale functions in the same manner (exhibits the same internal structure) across subgroups. If the items that reflect their latent constructs and the connections between the constructs operate in a fundamentally different way depending on group membership, cross group comparisons become difficult, if not impossible. This chapter discusses the most common statistical techniques (along with examples) for establishing invariance for both scenarios where the indicators are either continuous or categorical.},

This study investigated how students developed an understanding of chemical representations with the aid of a computer-based visualizing tool, eChem, that allowed them to build molecular models and view multiple representations simultaneously. Multiple sources of data were collected with the participation of 71 eleventh graders at a small public high school over a 6-week period. The results of pre- and posttests showed that students' understanding of chemical representations improved substantially (p \{{\textless}\} .001, effect size = 2.68-. The analysis of video recordings revealed that several features in eChem helped students construct models and translate representations. Students who were highly engaged in discussions while using eChem made referential linkages between visual and conceptual aspects of representations. This in turn may have deepened their understanding of chemical representations and concepts. The findings also suggest that computerized models can serve as a vehicle for students to generate mental images. Finally, students demonstrated their preferences of certain types of representations and did not use all types of three-dimensional models interchangeably. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one’s tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.},

Earlier work has identified possible barriers to immersion including a lack of coherence between different aspects of the game. Building on this work, we designed an experiment to examine people's expectations of how a game should behave and what would happen if that behaviour was deliberately made to be incoherent. The idea then is to understand immersion through seeing how immersion can be broken. The main manipulation was to alter the behaviour and realism of the graphics in the course of a simple game situation. Surprisingly, results indicated that participants could be so immersed within a simple environment such that even significant changes in behaviour had little effect on the level of immersion. In some cases, the attempted disruptions went completely unnoticed. These results suggest that immersion within an application can overcome effects which are completely against user expectations.},

An investigation of the procedures by which we make sense of lexical items in utterances by fitting prototypes into schemata is followed by an examination of how schemata are instantiated across conversational sequences by means of topics. In interaction, conflicts over meaning illuminate the decisive role of social and cultural factors in understanding. Overall, understanding is seen to be critically dependent on principles of categorisation and contrast, which form the basis of both cognitive and sociocultural means of organisation.},

The fault, argues this ingenious—even liberating—book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time.In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how—and why—some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

While digital games clearly provide highly engaging activities, the nature of this engagement is not well understood. The current study aims to advance our understanding by reporting a systematic review of recent literature addressing engagement in computer games. The papers in the review comprise a sub-sample of papers relating to engagement in digital games that was selected from a broader literature search carried out on the outcomes and impacts of playing computer games. A diverse range of studies was identified that examined varied aspects of engagement in games including subjective experiences while playing games, the physiological concomitants of these experiences, motives for playing games, game usage and time spent playing games and the impact of playing on life satisfaction. A narrative review was carried out to capture these diverse aspects of engagement and to develop a more coherent understanding of engagement in computer games.},

User engagement is a multifaceted, complex phenomenon; this gives rise to a number of potential approaches for its measurement. Common ways of measuring user engagement include: self-reporting (e.g., questionnaires); observational methods (e.g., facial expression analysis, speech analysis, desktop actions); and web analytics using online behavior metrics that assess users’ depth of engagement with a site. These methods represent various tradeoffs between the scale of data analyzed and the depth of understanding. For instance, surveys are small-scale but deep, whereas clicks can be collected on a large-scale but provide shallow understanding. However, little is known in validating and relating these types of measurement. This talk will present various efforts aiming at combining techniques from web analytics (in particular clicks) and existing works on user engagement coming from the domains of information science, multimodal human computer interaction and cognitive psychology.

	abstract = {The effectiveness of virtual environments (VEs) has often been linked to the sense of presence reported by users of those VEs. (Presence is defined as the subjective experience of being in one place or environment, even when one is physically situated in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness phenomenon that requires directed attention and is based in the interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal tendencies to become involved. Factors believed to underlie presence were described in the premier issue of Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive tendencies questionnaire (ITQ) to measure differences in the tendencies of individuals to experience presence. These questionnaires are being used to evaluate relationships among reported presence and other research variables. Combined results from four experiments lead to the following conclusions: (1) the PQ and ITQ are internally consistent measures with high reliability; (2) there is a weak but consistent positive relation between presence and task performance in VEs; (3) individual tendencies as measured by the ITQ predict presence as measured by the PQ; and (4) individuals who report more simulator sickness symptoms in VE report less presence than those who report fewer symptoms.},

The prime lesson, it is hypothesized, is that an information visualization tool may be fruitfully viewed not as a tool but as part of an online social environment. In other words, to design a successful exploratory data analysis tool, one good strategy is to create a system that enables "social" data analysis},

Cognitive load, that is, working memory demands during problem solving, reasoning, or thinking, may affect users\&\#39; general satisfaction and performance when completing complex tasks. Whereas in design guidelines numerous ways of reducing cognitive load in interactive systems are described, not many attempts have been made to measure cognitive load in Web applications, and few techniques exist. In this study participants\&\#39; cognitive load was measured while they were engaged in searching for several products in four different online book stores. NASA-TLX and dual-task methodology were used to measure subjective and objective mental workload. The dual-task methodology involved searching for books as the primary task and a visual monitoring task as the secondary task. NASA-TLX scores differed significantly among the shops. Secondary task reaction times showed no significant differences between the four shops. Strong correlations between NASA-TLX, primary task completion time, and general satisfaction suggest that NASA-TLX can be used as a valuable additional measure of efficiency. Furthermore, strong correlations were found between browse/search preference and NASA-TLX as well as between search/browse preference and user satisfaction. Thus we suggest browse/search preference as a promising heuristic assessment method of cognitive load.},

These studies assess performance-related metrics such as time and correctness of participants complet-ing analytic tasks. Alternatively, several studies in InfoVis recently have evaluated visualizations by investigating user experience goals such as memorability, engagement, enjoyment and fun. These stud-ies employ somewhat different evaluation methodologies to assess these other goals. The growing number of these studies, their alterna-tive methodologies, and disagreements concerning their importance have motivated us to more carefully examine them. In this article, we review this growing collection of visualization evaluations that examine user experience goals and we discuss multiple issues re-garding the studies including questions about their motivation and utility. Our aim is to provide a resource for future work that plans to evaluate visualizations using these goals.},

The question is not so mysterious for nonhuman organisms, which presumably have built-in genetic programs instructing them to live as long as their physical machinery is able to function. But our species has a choice: With the development of consciousness, we have the ability to second-guess and occasionally override the instructions coded in our chromosomes. This evolutionary development has added a great deal of flexibility to the human repertoire of behaviors. But the freedom gained has its downside—too many possibilities can have a paralyzing effect on action (Schwartz 2000). Among the options we are able to entertain is that of ending our lives; thus, as the existential philosophers remarked, the question of why one should not commit suicide is fundamental to the understanding of human life.},

This article aims to (a) present an example of a program of research on infertility whereby a grounded theory of identity of self as an infertile person was developed and elaborated on, and (b) raise theoretical questions about grounded theory methodology in an effort to advance our thinking about this methodology and how it can contribute to theory generation through linked studies in a program of research.},

	abstract = {This chapter introduces in chronological order the three main measurement methods–the flow questionnaire, the experience sampling method, and the standardized scales of the componential approach–that researchers developed and used in conducting research on the flow state. Each measurement method and underlying conceptualization is explained, and its strengths and limitations are then discussed in relation to the other measurement methods and associated conceptualizations. The analysis reveals that, although the concept of flow remained stable since its inception, the models of flow that researchers developed in conjunction with the measurement methods changed substantially over time. Moreover, the findings obtained by applying the various measurement methods led to corroborations and disconfirmations of the underlying models and hence provided indications on how to interpret and possibly modify flow theory. The final section outlines new directions for developing more valid and useful measurement methods that can help to advance the understanding of flow, its antecedents, and its consequences.},

We should not speak of one main approach to measure user engagement – e.g. through one fixed set of metrics – because engagement depends on the online services at hand. Instead, we should be talking of models of user engagement. As a first step, we analysed a number of online services, and show that it is possible to derive effectively simple models of user engagement, for example, accounting for user types and temporal aspects. This paper provides initial insights into engagement patterns, allowing for a better understanding of the important characteristics of how users repeatedly interact with a service or group of services.},

To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the composition of this construct and how to evaluate it. Building on previous work that posited a theory of engagement and identified a core set of attributes that operationalized this construct, we constructed and evaluated a multidimensional scale to measure user engagement. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, as well as two large-scale studies (N=440 and N=802) that were undertaken to assess its reliability and validity in online shopping environments. In the first we used Reliability Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify six attributes of engagement: Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Felt Involvement, Novelty, and Endurability. In the second we tested the validity of and relationships among those attributes using Structural Equation Modeling. The result of this research is a multidimensional scale that may be used to test the engagement of software applications. In addition, findings indicate that attributes of engagement are highly intertwined, a complex interplay of user-system interaction variables. Notably, Perceived Usability played a mediating role in the relationship between Endurability and Novelty, Aesthetics, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention.},

Response times were significantly different between the two usage conditions but the direction of this difference did not conform to the prediction. Shorter response time was associated with fewer errors. The conclusion describes some implications for human-computer interaction research.},

	abstract = {Information visualization has often focused on providing deep insight for expert user populations and on techniques for amplifying cognition through complicated interactive visual models. This paper proposes a new subdomain for infovis research that complements the focus on analytic tasks and expert use. Instead of work-related and analytically driven infovis, we propose Casual Information Visualization (or Casual Infovis) as a complement to more traditional infovis domains. Traditional infovis systems, techniques, and methods do not easily lend themselves to the broad range of user populations, from expert to novices, or from work tasks to more everyday situations. We propose definitions, perspectives, and research directions for further investigations of this emerging subfield. These perspectives build from ambient information visualization [32], social visualization, and also from artistic work that visualizes information [41]. We seek to provide a perspective on infovis that integrates these research agendas under a coherent vocabulary and framework for design. We enumerate the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how blurry the boundary of infovis is by examining systems that exhibit many of the putative proper ties of infovis systems, but perhaps would not be considered so. Second, we explore the notion of insight and how, instead of a monolithic definition of insight, there may be multiple types, each with particular characteristics. Third, we discuss design challenges for systems intended for casual audiences. Finally we conclude with challenges for system evaluation in this emerging subfield.},

Drawing on a review of experimental studies of visualization effectiveness, we motivate this position against the backdrop of current attitudes and best practices with respect to visualization use. We suggest a new taxonomy of learner engagement with visualization technology. Grounded in Bloom's well-recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest metrics for assessing the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead. Based on these taxonomies of engagement and effectiveness metrics, we present a framework for experimental studies of visualization effectiveness. Interested computer science educators are invited to collaborate with us by carrying out studies within this framework.},

The doctor/patient dialogue has been extensively researched from different perspectives, with findings emphasising a range of behaviours that lead to effective communication. Much research involves self-reports, however, so that behavioural engagement cannot be disentangled from patients’ ratings of effectiveness. In this study we used a highly efficient and time economic automated computer visualisation measurement technique called Discursis to analyse conversational behaviour in consultations. Discursis automatically builds an internal language model from a transcript, mines the transcript for its conceptual content, and generates an interactive visual account of the discourse. The resultant visual account of the whole consultation can be analysed for patterns of engagement between interactants. The findings from this study show that Discursis is effective at highlighting a range of consultation techniques, including communication accommodation, engagement and repetition.},

Design methods and guidelines were developed in work contexts and so are mainly concerned with ease-of-learning, low level ease-of-use and task fit. These are all issues in the home but there are other important components of usability. How do we make the product enjoyable to use? How do we design for effective human-human communication? How doe we make these systems dependable? The paper illustrates these issues through two design problems, the Virtual Pub and Mavis’ smart home. Drawing on the history of HCI, suggestions are made about how these new conceptions of usability could be further developed for design for the home, and more widely.},

This first part of the chapter is dedicated to discussing the methodological framework (correlations and multitrait-multimethod matrices) and statistical techniques [structural equation modeling (SEM)] needed to quantify these relationships. The second half of the chapter discusses what has commonly been referred to as criterion validity and includes evidence with external variables that is often predictive in nature. The final section discusses the complex tasks of gathering incremental validity evidence and gathering evidence for use of the instrument with other populations.},

However, one fundamental requirement of any interactive experience is the desire to continue the experience, and this study is concerned with investigating engagement in interactive narratives by focusing on this aspect. In the present approach, engagement is described as the user’s desire to continue an activity in order to accomplish an objective while experiencing affect. In order to investigate engagement during run time, this description is used as a foundation for formulating an intrusive method and the Engagement Sampling Questionnaire. The application of the method and the questionnaire is exemplified by an investigation of continuation desire in the experiential learning scenario, “The First Person Victim”, where participants experience a non-pleasant emergent narrative concerned with being a victim of war.},

These informal terms require scientific explanation, which amounts to providing measurable criteria for different experiential states. This paper reports the results of an experimental psychophysiological study investigating different traits of gameplay experience using subjective and objective measures. Participants played three Half-Life 2 game modifications while being measured with electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electromyography, galvanic skin response and eye tracking equipment. In addition, questionnaire responses were collected after each play session. A level designed for combat-oriented flow experience demonstrated measurable high-arousal positive affect emotions. The positive correlation between subjective and objective indicators of gameplay experience shows the great potential of the method presented here for providing real-time emotional profiles of gameplay that may be correlated with self-reported subjective descriptions.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on a between-subject, comparative online study of three information visualization demonstrators that each displayed the same dataset by way of an identical scatterplot technique, yet were different in style in terms of visual and interactive embellishment. We validated stylistic adherence and integrity through a separate experiment in which a small cohort of participants assigned our three demonstrators to predefined groups of stylistic examples, after which they described the styles with their own words. From the online study, we discovered significant differences in how participants execute specific interaction operations, and the types of insights that followed from them. However, in spite of significant differences in apparent usability, enjoyability and usefulness between the style demonstrators, no variation was found on the self-reported depth, expert-rated depth, confidence or difficulty of the resulting insights. Three different methods of insight analysis have been applied, revealing how style impacts the creation of insights, ranging from higher-level pattern seeking to a more reflective and interpretative engagement with content, which is what underlies the patterns. As this study only forms the first step in determining how the impact of style in information visualization could be best evaluated, we propose several guidelines and tips on how to gather, compare and categorize insights through an online evaluation study, particularly in terms of analyzing the concise, yet wide variety of insights and observations in a trustworthy and reproducable manner.},

When stimuli are used for this purpose, usually provided at the onset of the design process, these stimuli, or sources, may have one of two effects: they may enhance the design search and contribute to a high-quality, creative design, or they may cause fixation, when the designer is unable to divorce him or herself from properties of the stimulus. This paper argues that to avoid fixation stimuli should not be within-domain and task examples, and in mapping from source to target it is essential to abstract relations among source objects, and to perform transformations in conjunction with transfer actions.},

It also aims to ﬁnd out the evolution and future trends of design research. Employing a bibliometrics and network analysis, the paper analyses citations and co-citations from Design Studies. Instead of using the standard analysis method of aggregating author co-citations, this study conducts the analysis at the individual publication level. Due to the limitation of the Scopus database, this study only managed to extract articles with full citations in Design Studies from 1996 to 2010. Further studies could also include articles from 1979 to 1995 by either using some character recognition software or manually extracting them. The study identiﬁes the core themes centered on design process and design cognition. In addition, it also reveals that the research method protocol analysis has become more popular in recent years among researchers. The main contribution of this paper is the use of a network analysis technique to analyse 12 107 citations in the 459 articles published in Design Studies between 1996 and 2010. Unlike previous review papers which relied heavily on the qualitative observations and reﬂections of the authors, this paper is the ﬁrst comprehensive quantitative analysis in this ﬁeld.

Often (78\% of the time), designing the behavior requires collaborating with developers, but 76\% of designers reported that communicating the behavior to developers was more difficult than the appearance. Other results include that annotations such as arrows and paragraphs of text are used on top of sketches and storyboards to explain behaviors, and designers want to explore multiple versions of behaviors, but today’s tools make this difficult. The results provide new ideas for future tools.},

Practitioners and researchers from a wide range of disciplines are daily working with this concept. However, despite many attempts to understand, deﬁne and scope UX, one may still wonder whether a consensus has been reached on this concept. In a willingness to address the complexity of this research topic and bring the concept of UX to maturity, a replication of an international survey has been conducted. The main goal of the present study is to get a better understanding of practitioners’ viewpoints on the notion of UX and to analyze potential evolutions over time in the understanding and practical use of the concept. As both practical and theoretical implications of UX are of the greatest importance for whoever designs interactive systems, the exploration of practitioners’ perspectives is a valuable step toward continual improvement of UX activities. The present survey has been conducted amongst 758 practitioners and researchers from 35 nationalities. It allows to better understand how this concept is understood and used throughout the world. Amongst interesting results, important differences were observed according to the geographical location and background of the respondents.},

Recently researchers have begun to look at how fluency impacts judgment through more subtle and indirect routes. Fluency impacts whether information is represented in working memory and what aspects of that information are attended to. Additionally, fluency has an impact in strategy selection; depending on how fluent information is, people engage in qualitatively different cognitive operations. This suggests that the role of fluency is more nuanced than previously believed and that understanding fluency could be of critical importance to understanding cognition more generally.},

	abstract = {This paper offers theoretical support for research through design (RtD) by arguing that to legitimize and make use of research through design as research, HCI researchers need to explore and clarify how RtD objects contribute to knowledge. One way to pursue this goal is to leverage knowledge-producing tactics of the arts and humanities traditions of aesthetics, key among which is a communitywide and ongoing critical analysis of aesthetic objects. Along these lines, we argue that while the intentions of the object’s designer are important and annotations are a good mechanism to articulate them, the critical reception of objects can be equally generative of RtD’s knowledge impacts. Such a scholarly critical reception is needed because of the potential inexhaustibility of design objects’ meanings, their inability to be paraphrased adequately. Offering a multilevel analysis of the (critical) design fiction Menstruation Machine by Sputniko!, the paper explores how design objects co-produce knowledge, by working through complex design problem spaces in non-reductive ways, proposing new connections and distinctions, and embodying design ideas and processes across time and minds.},

In this paper, we discuss opportunities and challenges for documentation in design processes to support the transformation of design knowledge across different levels of abstraction. We argue for an activity-centred approach to underscore the construction of intermediate forms of knowledge, where immediate responses to design activities inform mediated representations of design work. The relation between immediate and mediated knowledge is explored through a case study of Co-notate, a research prototype enabling automatic synthesis of audio/video recordings and textual annotations simultaneously captured during design activities. We argue that real-time annotated design documentation limits the risk of recorded activities being misinterpreted, or simply disregarded, and we identify and discuss potentials for employing real-time technology to inform retrospective analysis.},

	abstract = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception—the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs—and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms—dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

In this paper, we use physical attributes and spatial properties of objects as source domains for conceptual metaphors. We present an empirical study where twenty participants matched physical representations of image schemas to metaphorically paired adjectives. Based on our findings, we suggest twenty pairings that are easily identified, suggest groups of image schemas that can serve as source domains for a variety of metaphors, and provide guidelines for structuring physicalabstract mappings in abstract domains. These guidelines can help designers apply metaphor theory to design problems in abstract domains, resulting in effective interaction.},

This kind of analysis has already been applied, with some success, both to musical concepts and, separately, to user interface design. The present work appears to be the first to combine these hitherto distinct bodies of research, with the aim of devising a general method for improving user interfaces for music.

	abstract = {In a recent issue of this magazine, Bill Gaver and John Bowers address the role of design practice in academic research and provide a concrete suggestion: “We propose the notion of annotated portfolios as a way to communicate design research. In part, we do this to provide an alternative to accounts that suggest for design to become productive as research, it should engage in some sort of theory formation. While what exactly is meant by theory is not always clear, writers usually have in mind some conceptual machinery that can explain and predict”. Briefly, the notion of annotated portfolios entails selecting a collection of designs, rpresenting them in an appropriate medium, and combining the design re-presentations with brief textual annotations. Gaver and Bowers characterize their proposal as a methodology for communicating design research, and more specifically, a methodology that is very familiar to designers as well as artists.},

A concept-driven approach aims at manifesting theoretical concepts in concrete designs. A good con- cept design is both conceptually and historically grounded, bearing signs of the intended theoretical considerations. In the area of human–computer inter- action and interaction design research, this approach has been quite popu- lar but not necessarily explicitly recognized and developed as a proper re- search methodology. In this article, we demonstrate how a concept-driven approach can coexist, and be integrated with, common user-centered ap- proaches to interaction design through the development of a model that makes explicit the existing cycle of prototyping, theory development, and user studies.We also present a set of basic principles that could constitute a foundation for concept driven interaction research, and we have consid- ered and described themethodological implications given these principles. For the field of interaction design research we find this as an important point of departure for taking the next step toward the construction and verification of theoretical constructs that can help informand guide future design research projects on novel interaction technologies.},

We focus on two popular UX frameworks – i.e., Hassenzahl’s hedonic-pragmatic model and McCarthy \& Wright’s sense-making experience – and inquire into their influence on design practice through the study of “Strong Concepts” (SC), one form of intermediatelevel knowledge in interaction design. However, due to the problem of ‘fading traceability’, which arguably reflects the quintessential nature of theory-assimilated design, the number of SC candidates identified is limited. Based on the reviews of some research-through-design experts on those candidates, Randomness is deemed as a promising SC; some design cases appropriating Randomness are presented. There are reservations that the notion of SC is viable for resolving the tenacious issues between theory and design, given critical issues such as process malleability.},

	abstract = {This study identiﬁes a population of students who have an intermediate amount of relevant content knowledge and skill for working with data, and characterizes their approach to interpreting a challenging data-based visualization. Thirty-three undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory environmental science course reasoned about salinity data as shown in map and vertical proﬁles from the Mediterranean while thinking aloud and being eye-tracked. Students reasoned about 2D and 3D interpretations in the context of two hypothesis arrays (a suite of potential interpretations about a set of data). Findings suggest the students have some effective strategies in reading data: They look at cartographic elements, correctly identify the image as a salinity map, and draw inferences from the data. Common looking strategies include scanning along the salinity gradient, comparing areas of interest, and aligning the color bar with the map. Individual differences emerge in the interpretation of the data, with no interpretations being fully aligned with the scientiﬁcally normative explanation. Post hoc analyses identify reasoning tasks and spontaneous behaviors related to a construct we refer to as “data expertise,” which is intended to capture the degree of conceptual sophistication and resourcefulness in reasoning about data. A data expertise scale was developed, with scores ranging from zero (weak) to six (strong) that were normally distributed. Our ﬁndings suggest that appropriately coordinating data with a model, comparing and contrasting across data representations from different times or places, and extracting 3D structure from 2D representations are associated with data expertise.},

The main data source for the paper is findings from in-depth interviews with six practicing service designers from some of the more well-known design agencies. The informants consider service prototyping to be a very important part of their work that allows them to learn and communicate about design ideas. The practitioners’ account of how they work with prototypes indicates that service prototyping has different meanings and that the practice of prototyping is very diverse. The interviews also uncover a number of areas that, according to the designers, might prove extra challenging for service prototyping to be successful. This research shows that there is much potential in the not yet fully formed practice of service prototyping.},

These constituents specify how bridging concepts, as a form of knowledge, are accountable to both theory and practice.

Based on this foundation we provide definitions, propose a methodological framework, and provide practical guidance for conducting design studies. We define a design study as a project in which visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts, design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design, and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines. We characterize two axes - a task clarity axis from fuzzy to crisp and an information location axis from the domain expert's head to the computer - and use these axes to reason about design study contributions, their suitability, and uniqueness from other approaches. The proposed methodological framework consists of 9 stages: learn, winnow, cast, discover, design, implement, deploy, reflect, and write. For each stage we provide practical guidance and outline potential pitfalls. We also conducted an extensive literature survey of related methodological approaches that involve a significant amount of qualitative field work, and compare design study methodology to that of ethnography, grounded theory, and action research.},

By use of the qualitative research interview technique of thematizing the dialogue as explicit, implicit and constructive conversations about users, these differences are explored. The research shows that the traditional usability engineering approach to user description produce person descriptions that are ﬁlled with idiosyncratic information about the individual in the particular test situation. Less traditional approaches to user modelling give other kinds of schematic user typiﬁcation in terms of the users’ roles, users’ social events or users’ self-concepts. Despite the obvious fallacies in these approaches, typiﬁcation of users appears unproblematic for the experienced HCI professional, because in practice user types are rich conceptual structures that support professional user modelling. Accordingly, we suggest that it might not be that important to discuss why user types exist, but rather to study their application and change and under which conditions they become user stereotypes, and how we may counteract the negative effects of user stereotypes on design.},

A significant development of importing new theories into the field has been much insightful explication of HCI phenomena, together with extending the fields discourse.

In two experiments, we tested naïve subjects' intuitions about such image schemas for concrete action verbs as well as abstract action verbs and psychological predicates. A substantial agreement across subjects was observed in both a forced choice task and a free form computer-based drawing task, for both concrete verbs and abstract verbs. In addition to providing support for the generality of image schemas, the data provide a set of norms for future online studies of spatial representations underlying real-time language processing.},

For example, participants tended to ascribe a horizontal image schema to push, and a vertical image schema to respect. This consistency in offline data is preliminary evidence that language invokes spatial forms of representation. It also provided norms that were used in the present research to investigate the activation of spatial image schemas during online language comprehension. We predicted that if comprehending a verb activates a spatial representation that is extended along a particular horizontal or vertical axis, it will affect other forms of spatial processing along that axis. Participants listened to short sentences while engaged in a visual discrimination task (Experiment 1) and a picture memory task (Experiment 2). In both cases, reaction times showed an interaction between the horizontal/vertical nature of the verb's image schema, and the horizontal/vertical position of the visual stimuli. We argue that such spatial effects of verb comprehension provide evidence for the perceptual–motor character of linguistic representations.},

	abstract = {Demand for interactive products that are intuitive to use is high. Intuitive use in this paper is understood as the subconscious application of prior knowledge by the user. This definition is explicated by a continuum model of prior knowledge. Theories from several disciplines of application are surveyed whether they can contribute to the field of ‘Design for Intuitive Use’. Two sets of requirements are posed against which candidate theories have to be validated: (1) the claims the theory makes about intuitive use must be shown to be valid within the context of user interface design, and (2) the application of the theory has to support the user interface design process. Image schema theory which draws on knowledge on the sensorimotor stage of the knowledge continuum was put to the test by using rigorous psychological experimentation and by analysing user interfaces in different domains of application. These analyses showed that the application of image schema theory as a design language may be a powerful tool for the evaluation and improvement phases of a human-centred design process. By collecting the results of these analyses in an online catalogue, designers are provided with a tool that helps them with producing design solutions. Ongoing studies are investigating whether image schemas are also useful for the early phases of the design process such as requirements gathering.

All human beings based on their unique characteristics have access to a universal collection of image schemas, such as containment, path and force schemas. But, culturally image schemas are represented differently in languages. This fact considered by Lakoff in forming conceptual metaphors and cultural differences in Metaphors We Live By. Obviously, poem is rhymed words and suitable to image conceptual structures such as metaphors and image schemas.

The few existing formal theories of metaphor have been developed in the context of natural language understanding, learning, or reasoning. We propose to formalize interface metaphors by algebraic specifications. This approach provides a comprehensive formalization for the essential aspects of metaphorical user interfaces. Specifically, metaphor domains are being formalized by algebras, metaphorical mappings by morphisms, and image-schemas by categories. The paper explains these concepts and the approach, using examples of spatial and spatializing metaphors.},

@article{lund_massification_nodate,
	title = {Massification of the {Intangible}},
	abstract = {The thesis addresses two related problems. Drawing on several theoretical strands, it is argued that the materiality of physical artifacts serves the purpose of expressing abstract information. In contrast, the intangible materiality of information technology artifacts is of such a kind that it poses different, sometimes limited, conditions for expressing abstract information. The background problem of the thesis concerns conditions and possibilities of designing information visualization artifacts that retain the experiential qualities typically associated with physical artifacts. By way of addressing the background problem, massification design is introduced as a design ideal that explicitly aims towards a design of information visualization artifacts that cater to the need of intersubjective understanding of abstract and intangible information, mediated through concrete user interface representations. The ideal of massification design is further articulated as a kind of design where the designed artifact as such bears witness of its own meaning. This ideal is put in contrast to design that depends on arbitrary, interpretative conventions for people's understanding of visualization artifacts. It is argued that visualization design striving towards this ideal should be theoretically informed. In this context, an argumentation is presented that suggest that the notion of artifacts as embodiment of theory is problematic and that the notion of artifacts as expression of theory is a more feasible stance. The main problem of the thesis concerns to what extent the theory of embodied realism can serve as an informing theory for realization of massification design. In order to investigate embodied realism as a candidate for informing massification design, two design projects are presented. The first aims at expressing abstract information of web page collections. A prototypical virtual reality interface was designed and informed by embodied realism, followed by an evaluation with respect to the prototype's theory expression. The second aims at expressing temporal data through two different kinds of theory informed design that also were evaluated. Based on the design projects and the evaluations, it is suggested that an embodied realist foundation for massification design has the capacity to structure the design process by means of constraining and suggesting form for expressions of abstract information. It is suggested that embodied realism may also inform design in such a way that it affects the experience of using the artifacts. The evaluations also suggest that design that draws on embodied meaning may come in conflict with expected and conventional ways of expressing abstract information. In order to further investigate a theoretical foundation for massification design it is suggested that there is a need to investigate theoretical outsets that also stays sensitive to entrenched, conventional expressions. Additionally, by way of reflecting on the general outlook permeating the thesis, it is suggested that massification design can be understood as striving towards authentic experiences of IT.},

	shorttitle = {From {Perception} to {Meaning}},
	abstract = {The 1987 landmark publications by G. Lakoff and M. Johnson made image schema one of the cornerstone concepts of the emerging experientialist paradigm of Cognitive Linguistics, a framework founded upon the rejection of the mind-body dichotomy and stressing the fundamentally embodied nature of meaning, imagination and reason - hence language. Conceived of as the pre-linguistic, dynamic and highly schematic gestalts arising directly from motor movement, object manipulation, and perceptual interaction, image schemas served to anchor abstract reasoning and imagination to sensori-motor patterns in the conceptual theory of metaphor. Being itself informed by preceding crosslinguistic work on semantic primitives in the linguistic representations of spatial relations (carried out by L. Talmy, R. Langacker, and others), the notion has inspired a large amount of subsequent research and debate on diverse issues ranging from the meaning, structure and acquisition of natural languages to the embodied mind itself. From Perception to Meaning is the first survey of current image-schema theory and offers a collection of original and innovative essays by leading scholars, many of whom have shaped the theory from the very beginning. The edition unites essays on major issues in recent research on image-schemas - from aspects of their definition and linguistic formalization, their psychological status and neural grounding to their role as semantic universals and primitives in language acquisition. The book will thus not only be welcomed by linguists of a cognitive orientation, but will prove relevant to philosophers, psychologists, and anthropologists interested in language, and indeed to anyone studying the embodied mind.},

A brief account of Johnson’s own intellectual journey, through which we track some of the most important discoveries in the field over the past forty years, sets the stage. Subsequent chapters set out Johnson’s important role in embodied cognition theory, including his cofounding (with George Lakoff) of conceptual metaphor theory and, later, their theory of bodily structures and processes that underlie all meaning, conceptualization, and reasoning. A detailed account of how meaning arises from our physical engagement with our environments provides the basis for a nondualistic, nonreductive view of mind that he sees as most congruous with the latest cognitive science.

This discipline is of interest to human–computer interaction (HCI) specialists concerned with finding out about users’ mental models and representing these in user interfaces. Central to cognitive linguistics are the theories of conceptual metaphor and image schemas. These theories have been influential in two areas of HCI: generating population stereotypes of physical-to-abstract mappings and inspiring user interface designs. The article reviews the theory and research into the application of image schemas and image-schematic metaphors in HCI. Special emphasis is put on strategies of image-schema sourcing. The theory and the available evidence suggest that the application of image schemas can contribute to user interfaces that are innovative, inclusive, and intuitive to use. The claim for inclusiveness currently has the weakest empirical s...},

The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, 1987.] and other “conceptual metaphor” theorists have argued that our use and understanding of figurative language is mediated by unconscious metaphoric correspondences that structure human concepts. Communication scholars have employed the conceptual metaphor framework to infer attitudes and beliefs from the figurative expressions people use to describe their personal experiences. However, these scholars rarely scrutinize the framework’s assumptions, many of which have been vigorously challenged in other disciplines. In this article, I critically assess the explanatory value of the “conceptual metaphor” construct and review the empirical evidence for and against it. Based on this assessment, I conclude that despite its important atmospheric influence, the conceptual metaphor framework has not fared well as an account of conceptual structure or a model of figurative language understanding.},

We know a lot about what human ideas are like from research in Cognitive Science. Most ideas are unconscious, and that is no less true of the mathematical ones. Abstract ideas, for the most part, arise via conceptual metaphor-a mechanism for projecting embodied (that is, sensory-motor) reasoning to abstract reasoning. This book argues that conceptual metaphor plays a central, defining role in mathematical ideas within the cognitive unconscious-from arithmetic and algebra to sets and logic to infinity in all of its forms: transfinite numbers, points at infinity, infinitesimals, and so on. Even the real numbers, the imaginary numbers, trigonometry, and calculus are based on metaphorical ideas coming out of the way we function in the everyday physical world.This book is about mathematical ideas, about what mathematics means-and why. The authors believe that understanding the metaphors implicit in mathematics will make mathematics make more sense. Moreover, understanding mathematical ideas and how they arise from our bodies and brains will make it clear that the brain's mathematics is mathematics, the only mathematics we know or can know.},

The analysis shows that although all three representational forms serve to externalize mental content, they do so in radically different ways, and consequently they have qualitatively different functions in mathematical cognition. Symbols represent by convention and allow mental computations to be replaced by epistemic actions. Figures and diagrams both serve as material anchors for conceptual structures. However, ﬁgures do so by having a direct likeness to the objects they represent, whereas diagrams have a metaphorical likeness. Thus, I claim that diagrams can be seen as material anchors for conceptual mappings. This classiﬁcation of diagrams is of theoretical importance as it sheds light on the functional role played by conceptual mappings in the production of new mathematical knowledge.},

We created 4 variants of this system, manipulating 2 distinct properties of metaphor. We conducted a between-subjects experimental study with 80 participants to compare understanding and engagement when working with each version. We found that building on known image schemas improved response time on look-up tasks, while contextual detail predicted increases in persistence and the number of inferences drawn from the data. Schema-congruency combined with contextual detail produced the highest gains in comprehension.

The current paper is part of a larger project that wishes to explore whether computer programs that automate the creation of data visualisations – such as pie charts, bar graphs and time series plots – can be enhanced by artificial intelligence methods that model human creative processes. One objective of the larger project is to explore and describe conceptual blending –and the techniques used to implement conceptual blending – in the context of applicability to visualisation.

	abstract = {The landscape metaphor was one of the first methods used by the information visualization community to reorganize and depict document archives that are not inherently spatial. The motivation for the use of the landscape metaphor is that everyone intuitively understands landscapes. We critically examine the information visualization designer's ontologies for implementing spatialized landscapes with ontologies of the geographic domain held by lay people. In the second half of the article, we report on a qualitative study where we empirically assessed whether the landscape metaphor has explanatory power for users trying to make sense of spatialized views, and if so, in what ways. Specifically, we are interested in uncovering how lay people interpret hills and valleys in an information landscape, and whether their interpretation is congruent with the current scientific understanding of geomorphologic processes. Our empirical results suggest that neither developers' nor lay users' understanding of terrain visualizations is based on universal understanding of the true process that has shaped a natural landscape into hills and valleys, mountains, and canyons. Our findings also suggest that the information landscape metaphor for sense making of a document collection is not self-evident to lay users, as claimed by information landscape designers. While a deep understanding of geomorphology will probably not be required to successfully use an information landscape, we do suggest that a coherent theory on how people use space will be necessary to produce cognitively useful information visualizations.},

	abstract = {One of the most broadly investigated topics in the conceptual metaphor literature is the importance of spatial construals for thinking and talking about time. We address the relationship between conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) and conceptual integration theory (CIT) by exploring how people understand timelines - both as graphical objects, in discourse about timelines taken from newspapers and the web, and in poetic examples. The inferential structure of the timeline is well captured by the conceptual metaphors TIME IS SPACE and EVENTS ARE OBJECTS. Instantiated graphically, the timeline serves as a material anchor for a conceptual integration network representing partial cognitive models of time, lines, objects, and a hybrid model known as a ‘blend’. Understood in respect to this network, the analogue properties of the line give it novel computational properties facilitating inferences about the events that the timeline represents. The history of the modern timeline suggests that it reflects a distributed cognitive process, involving multiple individuals over a large span of time and illustrating the importance of cultural evolution in the development of conceptual integration networks. Analysis of both poetry and everyday discourse about timelines suggests that conventional mapping schemas are best viewed not as determining the interpretation of timelines but as providing soft constraints that help guide interpretation. Future metaphor research will best proceed via a merger of techniques from CMT and CIT, characterizing metaphor as involving complex networks of mappings that can be updated flexibly as a function of context and goals},

However, the benefits of using rhetorical illustrations or embellishments in visualization have so far been inconclusive. In this work, we report an empirical study to evaluate hypotheses that visual embellishments may aid memorization, visual search and concept comprehension. One major departure from related experiments in the literature is that we make use of a dual-task methodology in our experiment. This design offers an abstraction of typical situations where viewers do not have their full attention focused on visualization (e.g., in meetings and lectures). The secondary task introduces “divided attention”, and makes the effects of visual embellishments more observable. In addition, it also serves as additional masking in memory-based trials. The results of this study show that visual embellishments can help participants better remember the information depicted in visualization. On the other hand, visual embellishments can have a negative impact on the speed of visual search. The results show a complex pattern as to the benefits of visual embellishments in helping participants grasp key concepts from visualization.},

	abstract = {This design paper presents new guidance for creating map legends in a dynamic environment. Our contribution is a set of guidelines for legend design in a visualization context and a series of illustrative themes through which they may be expressed. These are demonstrated in an applications context through interactive software prototypes. The guidelines are derived from cartographic literature and in liaison with EDINA who provide digital mapping services for UK tertiary education. They enhance approaches to legend design that have evolved for static media with visualization by considering: selection, layout, symbols, position, dynamism and design and process. Broad visualization legend themes include: The Ground Truth Legend, The Legend as Statistical Graphic and The Map is the Legend. Together, these concepts enable us to augment legends with dynamic properties that address speciﬁc needs, rethink their nature and role and contribute to a wider re-evaluation of maps as artifacts of usage rather than statements of fact. EDINA has acquired funding to enhance their clients with visualization legends that use these concepts as a consequence of this work. The guidance applies to the design of a wide range of legends and keys used in cartography and information visualization. Index Terms—Cartography, design, Digimap service, legend, online web mapping, visualization.},

	abstract = {Despite diering theoretical views within cognitive semantics there appears to be a consensus on certain fundamental theoretical constructs: (i) the basic semantic unit is a mental concept; (ii) concepts cannot be understood independent of the domain in which they are embedded; (iii) conceptual structures represent a construal of experience, that is, an active mental operation; and (iv) concept categories involve prototypes and are organized by (at least) taxonomic relations. Although the basic constructs of ``concept'', ``domain'', ``construal'', and ``category structure'' go by dierent names, they are essentially the same among researchers in cognitive linguistics. We examine a ®fth theoretical construct, that of ``image schemas'' (recurring basic conceptual structures), and argue that image schemas are a subtype of domain. We begin with the theory of domains proposed by Langacker, which is similar to Fillmore's theory of frame semantics. Langacker distinguishes two types of domains, locational and con®gurational; we argue that it is concepts in domains that are locational or con®gurational, not the domains themselves. We then analyze image schemas and show how they function like domains, in which are found both locational and con®gurational concepts.},

	abstract = {The metaphorical components of two cognitive models of moral/political systems, presented in Lakoff (1996 [2002]), were tested empirically, using a set of televised debates between two candidates for US president as data. Few verbal metaphoric expressions were found in the data which directly reﬂected the conceptual metaphors proposed in the models. However, a large number of mostly non-metaphoric expressions were found which constitute entailments of the models. This suggests a form of reasoning according to the logic of the proposed metaphors. The speakers’ metaphoric gestures in one of the debates were then coded and analyzed. Quantitative analysis produced results similar to the linguistic analysis, but qualitative analysis highlighted signiﬁcant differences between the models, both in terms of their composition and how they can be expressed. The study raises methodological issues for metaphor research, and theoretical questions about the ways of identifying and labeling conceptual metaphors and about the status of cognitive and cultural models.},
