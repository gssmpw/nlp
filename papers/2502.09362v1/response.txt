Ever since the discipline's inception as a response to technological advancement **Kaptelinin, "Human-Technology Relationship"**, HCI has been evolving, in waves **Hutchby, "Technologies Below"** , with its approach to futures adapting accordingly.  
Recent development suggests that the field is starting to take a more active and political stance to the futures addressed **Biesta, "The Beautiful Risk of Education"** . 
Increasingly often, HCI researchers step beyond user studies, into co-creation of futures with overlooked communities  **Dourish, "What We Talk About When We Talk About Context"** and non-human actors  **Galloway, "Protocol: How Control Exists After Decentralization"**.
Below, we review the vast expanse of both conventional and emergent approaches to considering the future in HCI. Against this backdrop, we can paint a picture of dovetailing and divergences between HCI and futures studies, the branch of social science most directly tackling systematic explorations of alternative futures **Huxley, "Brave New World"**.


\subsection{Conventional Approaches to Examining the Future in HCI}
To study futures, one needs to study possibilities. Scholars of HCI tackle this in various ways, among which are prototyping  **Norman, "The Design of Everyday Things"** , scenario-building (either by the researchers themselves or with possible future users  **Visser, "Design and Ethics: Reflections on Practice"**) , observing (potentially opportunity-exposing) ways in which users make use of technologies  **Suchman, "Plans and Situated Actions"**, and reflecting on implications for future technologies' development on the basis of user studies  **Beyer, "Contextual Design: Defining Customer-Centered Systems"** . 

Despite the work's future-orientation, HCI researchers rarely reflect comprehensively on the complexity of developing futures. This leaves room for improvement in several areas. One issue that rises to prominence is \emph{techno-centrism}: HCI scenarios often are informed by the goal of suggesting new technologies or uses, and the studies typically present prototypes without deeper considerations of how their adoption might develop or of various contingencies' potential influences  **Winner, "Autonomous Technology: Technics-Out-of-Control as a Theme for Social Theory"**. A few scholars have acknowledged the pressing need to consider futures more broadly. Among the most prominent has been  **Rushkoff, "Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now"**, whose book \emph{Making Use}  **Brey, "From Technology Transfer to Technology Assessment"** discusses the history of scenario-building by referencing the work of  **Mintzberg, "The Rise and Fall of Strategic Planning"**, a pioneer of scenario-based methods' use in strategic planning; however, even  **Rittel, "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning"** narrowed his attention to possible human interactions with technologies, as opposed to broader socio-political considerations or environmental contexts.



While HCI studies may give superficial attention to ethics factors, many fail to integrate corresponding perspectives, political sensitivity, or justice considerations meaningfully into the design of futures. For example, surveillance issues often get sidelined via brief mentions of the pervasive rise of technologies that monitor/track user behavior  **Gandy, "The Panoptic Sort: A Political Economy of Personal Information"** . Likewise, disparities in access to future technologies and the costs of unintended consequences remain under examined  **Bogost, "Alien Phenomenology, or What It's Like to Be a Thing"**. As automation and AI-based systems threaten to reshape entire industries, often at the expense of vulnerable workers  **Katz, "The Price of Citizenship: Redefining the American Welfare State"**, the shadow of labor displacement has taken on especially large dimensions. Yet the ethics implications of adopting new technologies at scale -- from environmental and sustainability domains to mechanisms for data governance and prevention of misuse -- often receive only surface-level treatment, if any at all  **Zuboff, "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power"**.


Even in work attuned to ``far-future'' scenarios and active honing of visions, the scenarios' plausibility is seldom scrutinized. In contrast, researchers often approach long-time-horizon studies as thought experiments, seeds for speculative responses to the present  **Kern, "The Culture of Time and Space: 1880-1918"**. In such cases, the visions become \emph{leaps into the future}, in that the work glosses over the intermediate steps needed for their realization. Neglecting the pathways to the future leaves gulfs in understanding of how such futures might materialize.      

In summary, the promise of rapid technological advancements and their implications for society has made the study of possible futures an inherent aspect of HCI research **Kern, "The Culture of Time and Space: 1880-1918"**.


\subsection{HCI's Future-Orientation in Light of Futures Studies}

HCI scholars are not the only ones interested in studying possible futures and exerting effects on them. Perhaps more than for any other field of research, this enterprise is the territory of futures studies, a branch of the social sciences devoted to forecasting, foresight, and anticipation of probable and possible futures alike **Bell, "The Coming of Post-Industrial Society"**. Correspondingly, it employs both probabilistic forecasting (e.g., trend analyses) and qualitative methods that explore plausible futures (e.g., Delphi studies, which involve distributed expert-based scenario-building  **Mankoff, "Looking Yesterday, Tomorrow: The Role of the Designer in a Future-Oriented Discipline"** and various scenario-development processes  **Van der Meer, "Futures Research Methodology Version 3.0"**).


Futures studies has gone through various phases and turns, just as HCI has. An outgrowth from strategic planning **Bryson, "Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations"**, it later experienced a critical turn** **Inayatullah, "Theories of International Futures: The Futurist Alternative"**. By shifting its focus to how systems connect with social reality, this continuously developing field highlighted how futures get differentially built conceptually and acted, varying with cultures, ways of knowing, and how people care for others  **Slaughter, "New World Order: Save or Destroy the Earth?"**.
Current work in futures studies concentrates on \textit{futures literacy} **Bell, "The Coming of Post-Industrial Society"** and \textit{futures consciousness} **Tushman, "Co-evolutionary Dynamics Within and Among Organizations"}, in aims of illuminating how individuals and groups, respectively, engage in futuring. This encompasses their ways of seizing active agency in shaping the futures that affect them. Other streams of futures studies focus on the concept of \textit{postnormality} **Rotmans, "Futures: The Future of Nature and the Nature of Our Future"** bound up with how volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity are pressing us toward urgent decisions with pivotal consequences amid a marked lack of knowledge.


The stress on examining possible futures does not imply that futures studies confines itself to studying the future. To explore alternative futures, futures studies researchers also take into account possible pasts  **Braudel, "A History of Civilizations"**, the present  **Simmel, "The Philosophy of Money"**, and the manifold futures that can open out from the exploration. These examinations require approaching the future as mutable and open-ended **Kern, "The Culture of Time and Space: 1880-1918"**.


One commonplace conceptual technique that futures studies employs to understand the web of relations and consequences among numerous factors in the face of alternative futures is use of the STEEPLE framework (the acronym refers to social, technological, environmental, economic, political, legal, and ethics factors) **Inayatullah, "Theories of International Futures: The Futurist Alternative"**. Digging into future alternatives unveils uncertainty patterns that have escaped our notice or that we have been consciously ignoring, and it assists in tending to the consequences of the decisions made in the present  **Rotmans, "Futures: The Future of Nature and the Nature of Our Future"**.


In spite of obvious thematic linkages due to their interest in futures, HCI and futures studies have not interacted extensively with each other. They have reached their closest in the area of scenario-based methods, with HCI studies having applied such techniques from futures studies as Delphi scenario-building **Mankoff, "Looking Yesterday, Tomorrow: The Role of the Designer in a Future-Oriented Discipline"** and the Futures Wheel **Van der Meer, "Futures Research Methodology Version 3.0"**, a lightweight workshop-based method wherein a seed scenario stimulates envisioning of waves of first-order, second-order, and further consequences. Overlap is evident from the other side also: **Bj√∂rn, "Visualizing Foresight: Using Futures Scenarios to Elicit Stakeholder Views"** introduced the futures cone in the HCI field as a visualization of how the present can develop toward preferred, probable, plausible, and possible futures. 
Beyond these arenas and envisioning (as employed in user studies), futures studies and HCI research have engaged in little collaboration, notwithstanding suggestions for joint work on speculative studies of interaction for in-the-wild studies **Mankoff, "Looking Yesterday, Tomorrow: The Role of the Designer in a Future-Oriented Discipline"** and VR simulations  **Dodge, "The Rise of the Eutopian City: Urban Visionaries in America, Britain, and Continental Europe"**.
