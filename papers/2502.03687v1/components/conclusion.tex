%\subsection{Limitations}
%While this study highlights the benefits of using diffusion classifiers, it is important to consider their limitations. 
%\subsection{Conclusion}
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive examination of the benefits of diffusion classifiers in medical imaging. First, we introduce a novel majority voting method to improve the overall performance of diffusion classifiers. We next demonstrate that diffusion classifiers are able to achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art discriminative classifiers, in addition to providing intrinsic counterfactual explainability and uncertainty quantification. %Further, we introduce a novel majority voting method to improve the overall performance of diffusion classifiers. 

\paragraph{Limitations:} Note that due to the slow inference speed of diffusion, classifying a single image using 501 steps takes 3.72 seconds on an A100 GPU. %However, depending on the application, the benefits of this method may outweigh their longer inference time. Future analysis will include in-depth comparisons of the inherent explainability and uncertainty quantification of diffusion classifiers to leading computer vision methods, including GradCAM and Monte Carlo Dropout, respectively.
