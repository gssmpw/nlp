Algorithms for the problem of finding Tarski fixed points on the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$ have only recently been considered. Bakhshanden, "Tarski Fixed Point Algorithms" gave an $O(\log^k (n))$ divide-and-conquer algorithm. Fournel and Koutsoupias, "A Fast Algorithm for Finding Tarski Fixed Points on the 3D Grid" gave an $O(\log^2 (n))$ algorithm for the 3D grid and used it to construct an $O(\log^{2 \lceil k/3 \rceil} (n))$ algorithm for the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$. Bakhshanden et al., "Optimal Tarski Fixed Point Algorithms" extended their ideas to get an $O(\log^{\lceil (k+1)/2 \rceil}(n))$ algorithm.

 Papadimitriou, "Lower Bounds for Tarski Fixed Points on the 2D Grid" showed a lower bound of $\Omega(\log^2(n))$ for the 2D grid, implying the same lower bound for the $k$-dimensional grid of side length $n$. This bound is tight for $k = 2$ and $k=3$, but there is an exponential gap for larger $k$. They also showed that the problem is in both PLS and PPAD, which by the results of Chen et al., "The Complexity of Tarski Fixed Points" implies it is in CLS.

 Daskalakis et al., "Black-Box Reductions from Tarski to Unique Tarski" give a black-box reduction from the Tarski problem to the same problem with an additional promise that the input function has a unique fixed point. This result  implies that the Tarski problem and the unique Tarski problem have the same query complexity.

Two problems related conceptually to that of finding a Tarski fixed point are finding a Brouwer fixed pointBouw and finding a local minimum (i.e. local search)Duchi et al.. The query complexity lower bounds for Brouwer and local search also rely on hidden path (``spine'') constructions. However, the monotonicity condition of the function in the Tarski setting poses an extra challenge.
