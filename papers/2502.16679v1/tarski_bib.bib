abstract="Information geometry emerged from the study of the geometrical structure of a manifold of probability distributions under the criterion of invariance. It defines a Riemannian metric uniquely, which is the Fisher information metric. Moreover, a family of dually coupled affine connections are introduced. Mathematically, this is a study of a triple (M, g, T), where M is a manifold, g is a Riemannian metric, and T is a third-order symmetric tensor. Information geometry has been applied not only to statistical inferences but also to various fields of information sciences where probability plays an important role. Many important families of probability distributions are dually flat Riemannian manifolds. A dually flat manifold possesses a beautiful structure: It has two mutually coupled flat affine connections and two convex functions connected by the Legendre transformation. It has a canonical divergence, from which all the geometrical structure is derived. The KL-divergence in probability distributions is automatically derived from the invariant flat nature. Moreover, the generalized Pythagorean and geodesic projection theorems hold. Conversely, we can define a dually flat Riemannian structure from a convex function. This is derived through the Legendre transformation and Bregman divergence connected with a convex function. Therefore, information geometry is applicable to convex analysis, even when it is not connected with probability distributions. This widens the applicability of information geometry to convex analysis, machine learning, computer vision, Tsallis entropy, economics, and game theory. The present talk summarizes theoretical constituents of information geometry and surveys a wide range of its applications.",

Notably, this holds even if we limit ourselves to convex quadratic functions. We also show that for nonconvex functions, the feasibility of minimizing gradients with SGD is surprisingly sensitive to the choice of optimality criteria.}

In particular, we study the class of Hadamard semi-differentiable functions, perhaps the largest class of nonsmooth functions for which the chain rule of calculus holds. This class contains important examples such as ReLU neural networks and others with non-differentiable activation functions. First, we show that finding an epsilon-stationary point with first-order methods is impossible in finite time. Therefore, we introduce the notion of (delta, epsilon)-stationarity, a generalization that allows for a point to be within distance delta of an epsilon-stationary point and reduces to epsilon-stationarity for smooth functions. We propose a series of randomized first-order methods and analyze their complexity of finding a (delta, epsilon)-stationary point. Furthermore, we provide a lower bound and show that our stochastic algorithm has min-max optimal dependence on delta. Empirically, our methods perform well for training ReLU neural networks.}

The Local Search problem consists in finding a local minimum of the function f on G, that is a vertex v such that f(v) is not larger than the value of f on the neighbors of v in G. In this note, we first prove a separation theorem slightly stronger than the one of Gilbert, Hutchinson and Tarjan for graphs of constant genus. This result allows us to enhance a previously known deterministic algorithm for Local Search with query complexity O(logn)⋅d+O(g)⋅n, so that we obtain a deterministic query complexity of d+O(g)⋅n, where n is the size of G, d is its maximum degree, and g is its genus. We also give a quantum version of our algorithm, whose query complexity is of O(d)+O(g4)⋅n4loglogn. Our deterministic and quantum algorithms have query complexities respectively smaller than the algorithm Randomized Steepest Descent of Aldous and Quantum Steepest Descent of Aaronson for large classes of graphs, including graphs of bounded genus and planar graphs.}

title = {The Complexity of Constrained Min-Max Optimization},
year = {2021},
abstract = {Despite its important applications in Machine Learning, min-max optimization of objective functions that are nonconvex-nonconcave remains elusive. Not only are there no known first-order methods converging to even approximate local min-max equilibria (a.k.a. approximate saddle points), but the computational complexity of identifying them is also poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a characterization of the computational complexity as well as of the limitations of first-order methods in this problem. Specifically, we show that in linearly constrained min-max optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives an approximate local min-max equilibrium of large enough approximation is guaranteed to exist, but computing such a point is PPAD-complete. The same is true of computing an approximate fixed point of the (Projected) Gradient Descent/Ascent update dynamics, which is computationally equivalent to computing approximate local min-max equilibria. An important byproduct of our proof is to establish an unconditional hardness result in the Nemirovsky-Yudin 1983 oracle optimization model, where we are given oracle access to the values of some function f : P → [−1, 1] and its gradient ∇ f, where P ⊆ [0, 1]d is a known convex polytope. We show that any algorithm that uses such first-order oracle access to f and finds an ε-approximate local min-max equilibrium needs to make a number of oracle queries that is exponential in at least one of 1/ε, L, G, or d, where L and G are respectively the smoothness and Lipschitzness of f. This comes in sharp contrast to minimization problems, where finding approximate local minima in the same setting can be done with Projected Gradient Descent using O(L/ε) many queries. Our result is the first to show an exponential separation between these two fundamental optimization problems in the oracle model.},

abstract = {We establish relations between the bandwidth and the treewidth of bounded degree graphs G, and relate these parameters to the size of a separator of G as well as the size of an expanding subgraph of G. Our results imply that if one of these parameters is sublinear in the number of vertices of G then so are all the others. This implies for example that graphs of fixed genus have sublinear bandwidth or, more generally, a corresponding result for graphs with any fixed forbidden minor. As a consequence we establish a simple criterion for universality for such classes of graphs and show for example that for each γ>0 every n-vertex graph with minimum degree (34+γ)n contains a copy of every bounded-degree planar graph on n vertices if n is sufficiently large.}
