% \subsection{Live-Streaming Recommendation}
\textbf{Live-streaming recommendation}Chen et al., "Personalized Live Streaming Recommendation" has been widely explored in many online platforms, such as Kuaishou and TikTok. 
Compared to short-video recommendationWang et al., "Short-Video Recommendation System" , live-streaming recommendation is more challenging due to its real-time and interactive nature.
One representative early study Zhang et al., "LiveRec: A Self-Attentive Model for Live Streaming Recommendation" proposes a self-attentive model to personalize item ranking by exploiting historical interactions and current availability. ADARMWang et al., "ADARM: Modeling Matching Patterns in Live Streaming" models matching patterns by capturing changes in user and author preferences. 
Some studies also consider the live-streaming multi-modal information. Specifically, ContentCTRChen et al., "ContentCTR: A Multi-Modal Transformer for Highlight Moment Detection" and KuaiHLZhang et al., "KuaiHL: A Hybrid Model for Live Streaming Recommendation" adopt the multi-modal transformer, which combines real-time visual, acoustic and textual information to identify the highlight moment of authors. Besides, some studies further utilize GNN to capture the dynamic relationship between users and authors.  
For instance, MMBeeWang et al., "MMBee: A Graph-Based Model for Live Streaming Recommendation" constructs user-to-author and author-to-author graphs to combine adjacency and multi-hop relationships to guide interest expansion. 
However, all these methods above only model user preference within the live-streaming domains, leading to the serious data-sparsity issue. On the contrary, FARM considers to transfer user preference across the short-video and live-streaming domains, thus alleviating the data-sparsity issue.






% \subsection{Cross-Domain Recommendation}
\textbf{Cross-domain recommendation} (CDR)Wang et al., "Cross-Domain Recommendation: A Survey" aims at leveraging user interactions in the source domain to improve the recommendation performance in the target domain, which is a valid direction to solve the cold-start and the data-sparsity issues in industry. 
As our FARM aim to solve the latter issue, we only focus on CDR methods that alleviate the data-sparsity issue. 
Specifically, some methods focus on capturing the domain-shared information across domains. PEPNetWang et al., "PEPNet: A Parameter-Efficient Model for Cross-Domain Recommendation" designs shared and separate parameter networks to capture the domain-shared information and achieve the balance of personalization tasks in each domain. 
CDAnetZhang et al., "CDAnet: A Translation Network for Cross-Domain Recommendation" develops a translation network to explicitly transfer domain-shared knowledge across domains.
The others focus on combating negative transfer. For instance, DDCDRWang et al., "DDCDR: Disentangling Distillation of Cross-Domain Teacher Models" leverages the disentangling distillation of cross-domain teacher models to achieve multi-domain knowledge sharing of student models.  
ADSNetZhang et al., "ADSNet: A Gain Evaluation Strategy for Cross-Domain Recommendation" introduces a gain evaluation strategy to calculate information gain, which is used for the rejection of noisy samples.
More recently, some studies apply CDR in live-streaming recommendation. Moment\&CrossWang et al., "Moment\&Cross: A Search-Based Interest Modeling Approach" follows the search-based interest modeling idea to extract user preference in both the short-video and live-streaming domains. LCNWang et al., "LCN: A Lifelong Attention Pyramid for Live Streaming Recommendation" achieves noise filtering through a lifelong attention pyramid containing three cascading attention levels. Compared to them, FARM has important design differences that can perceive user's sparse yet valuable behaviors.






% \subsection{Fourier Transform in Recommendation}
\textbf{Fourier transform}Wang et al., "Fourier Transform for Time-Series Analysis" is a mathematical tool that converts time-domain signals into frequency-domain signals, and has recently been widely employed in recommendation systemsWang et al., "Fourier Transform in Recommendation Systems: A Survey" due to its advantages in capturing periodic patterns and reducing dimensionality.  
These methods have two main concerns, one is the periodic high-order modeling of user sequences. Specifically, FARIMAWang et al., "FARIMA: Fourier-Assisted Auto-Regressive Approach for User Sequences" develops the Fourier-assisted Auto-Regressive approach to analyze the periodicity and randomness of user interactions. KDAZhang et al., "KDA: Temporal Drift Modeling via Fourier Transform with Learnable Frequency Domain Embedding" models the temporal drift of relations between users and items via Fourier transform with learnable frequency domain embedding. BSARecWang et al., "BSARec: Fourier-Based Low- and High-Frequency Integration for Recommendation" leverages the Fourier transform to integrate low and high frequency information to mitigate oversmoothing and address the limitations of self-attention. Some studies also focus on denoising by filtering in frequency domain. For instance, FMLP-RecWang et al., "FMLP-Rec: Fast Fourier Transform-Based Sequence Representation for Denoising" applies fast Fourier transform to sequence representation and achieves noise attenuation through learnable filters. END4RecZhang et al., "END4Rec: Chunked Diagonal Mechanism and Token Sparsity in Frequency Domain for Noise Signal Separation" obtains the soft noise signal and the filtered signal through chunked diagonal mechanism and token sparsity in the frequency domain. Different from prior methods, we propose a frequency-aware model in this paper, which innovatively adopts the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) theory into cross-domain live-streaming recommendation to perceive user's sparse yet valuable behaviors in both domains.
