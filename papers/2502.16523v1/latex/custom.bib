abstract = {As Transfer Learning from large-scale pre-trained models becomes more prevalent in Natural Language Processing (NLP), operating these large models in on-the-edge and/or under constrained computational training or inference budgets remains challenging. In this work, we propose a method to pre-train a smaller general-purpose language representation model, called DistilBERT, which can then be fine-tuned with good performances on a wide range of tasks like its larger counterparts. While most prior work investigated the use of distillation for building task-specific models, we leverage knowledge distillation during the pre-training phase and show that it is possible to reduce the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster. To leverage the inductive biases learned by larger models during pre-training, we introduce a triple loss combining language modeling, distillation and cosine-distance losses. Our smaller, faster and lighter model is cheaper to pre-train and we demonstrate its capabilities for on-device computations in a proof-of-concept experiment and a comparative on-device study.},

However, the capabilities of datasets are not assessed for benchmarking language understanding precisely. We propose a semi-automated, ablation-based methodology for this challenge; By checking whether questions can be solved even after removing features associated with a skill requisite for language understanding, we evaluate to what degree the questions do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require the skill. Experiments on 10 datasets (e.g., CoQA, SQuAD v2.0, and RACE) with a strong baseline model show that, for example, the relative scores of the baseline model provided with &lt;em&gt;content words only&lt;/em&gt; and with &lt;em&gt;shuffled sentence words&lt;/em&gt; in the context are on average 89.2% and 78.5% of the original scores, respectively. These results suggest that most of the questions already answered correctly by the model do not necessarily require grammatical and complex reasoning. For precise benchmarking, MRC datasets will need to take extra care in their design to ensure that questions can correctly evaluate the intended skills.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={05}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Sugawara, Saku and Stenetorp, Pontus and Inui, Kentaro and Aizawa, Akiko}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={8918-8927} }

In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art MRC models are able to correctly process Semantics Altering Modifications (SAM): linguistically-motivated phenomena that alter the semantics of a sentence while preserving most of its lexical surface form. We present a method to automatically generate and align challenge sets featuring original and altered examples. We further propose a novel evaluation methodology to correctly assess the capability of MRC systems to process these examples independent of the data they were optimised on, by discounting for effects introduced by domain shift. In a large-scale empirical study, we apply the methodology in order to evaluate extractive MRC models with regard to their capability to correctly process SAM-enriched data. We comprehensively cover 12 different state-of-the-art neural architecture configurations and four training datasets and find that -- despite their well-known remarkable performance -- optimised models consistently struggle to correctly process semantically altered data.}, number={15}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Schlegel, Viktor and Nenadic, Goran and Batista-Navarro, Riza}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={13762-13770} }

The traditional entity-centered methods can only generate word-level or phrase-level distractors. Although recently proposed neural-based methods like sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model show great potential in generating creative text, the previous neural methods for distractor generation ignore two important aspects. First, they didn’t model the interactions between the article and question, making the generated distractors tend to be too general or not relevant to question context. Second, they didn’t emphasize the relationship between the distractor and article, making the generated distractors not semantically relevant to the article and thus fail to form a set of meaningful options. To solve the first problem, we propose a co-attention enhanced hierarchical architecture to better capture the interactions between the article and question, thus guide the decoder to generate more coherent distractors. To alleviate the second problem, we add an additional semantic similarity loss to push the generated distractors more relevant to the article. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several strong baselines on automatic metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Further human evaluation indicates that our generated distractors are more coherent and more educative compared with those distractors generated by baselines.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={05}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Zhou, Xiaorui and Luo, Senlin and Wu, Yunfang}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={9725-9732} }

abstract="Natural Language Processing models lack a unified approach to robustness testing. In this paper we introduce WildNLP - a framework for testing model stability in a natural setting where text corruptions such as keyboard errors or misspelling occur. We compare robustness of deep learning models from 4 popular NLP tasks: Q{\&}A, NLI, NER and Sentiment Analysis by testing their performance on aspects introduced in the framework. In particular, we focus on a comparison between recent state-of-the-art text representations and non-contextualized word embeddings. In order to improve robustness, we perform adversarial training on selected aspects and check its transferability to the improvement of models with various corruption types. We find that the high performance of models does not ensure sufficient robustness, although modern embedding techniques help to improve it. We release the code of WildNLP framework for the community.",

  abstract = "The phenomenon of Adversarial Examples has become one of the most
              intriguing topics associated to deep learning. The so-called
              adversarial attacks have the ability to fool deep neural networks
              with inappreciable perturbations. While the effect is striking,
              it has been suggested that such carefully selected injected noise
              does not necessarily appear in real-world scenarios. In contrast
              to this, some authors have looked for ways to generate
              adversarial noise in physical scenarios (traffic signs, shirts,
              etc.), thus showing that attackers can indeed fool the networks.
              In this paper we go beyond that and show that adversarial
              examples also appear in the real-world without any attacker or
              maliciously selected noise involved. We show this by using images
              from tasks related to microscopy and also general object
              recognition with the well-known ImageNet dataset. A comparison
              between these natural and the artificially generated adversarial
              examples is performed using distance metrics and image quality
              metrics. We also show that the natural adversarial examples are
              in fact at a higher distance from the originals that in the case
              of artificially generated adversarial examples.",

A Strong Baseline for Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment}, volume={34}, url={https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6311}, DOI={10.1609/aaai.v34i05.6311}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms are often vulnerable to adversarial examples that have imperceptible alterations from the original counterparts but can fool the state-of-the-art models. It is helpful to evaluate or even improve the robustness of these models by exposing the maliciously crafted adversarial examples. In this paper, we present &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;ext&lt;/span&gt;F&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;ooler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a simple but strong baseline to generate adversarial text. By applying it to two fundamental natural language tasks, text classification and textual entailment, we successfully attacked three target models, including the powerful pre-trained BERT, and the widely used convolutional and recurrent neural networks. We demonstrate three advantages of this framework: (1) effective—it outperforms previous attacks by success rate and perturbation rate, (2) utility-preserving—it preserves semantic content, grammaticality, and correct types classified by humans, and (3) efficient—it generates adversarial text with computational complexity linear to the text length.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;}, number={05}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Jin, Di and Jin, Zhijing and Zhou, Joey Tianyi and Szolovits, Peter}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={8018-8025} }

However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2--4\texttimes{} with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 29th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles}, pages = {611–626}, numpages = {16}, location = {Koblenz, Germany}, series = {SOSP '23} }
