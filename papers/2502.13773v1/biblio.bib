  abstract={Coverage path planning (CPP) is the task of computing an optimal path within a region to completely scan or survey the area of interest by using robotic sensor footprints. In this work, we propose a novel approach to find the multi-robot optimal coverage path of an agricultural field using motion dynamics while minimizing the mission time. Our approach consists of three steps: (i) divide the agricultural field into convex polygonal areas to optimally distribute them among the robots, (ii) generate an optimal coverage path to ensure minimum coverage time for each of the polygonal areas, and (iii) generate the trajectory for each coverage path using Dubins motion dynamics. Several experiments and simulations were performed to check the validity and feasibility of our approach, and the results and limitations are discussed.},

  abstract={In the paper, we address wireless communication infrastructure building by relay placement based on approaches utilized in wireless network sensors. The problem is motivated by search and inspection missions with mobile robots, where known sensing ranges may be exploited. We investigate the relay placement, establishing network connectivity to support robust food-based communication routing. The proposed method decomposes the given area into Open space and Corridor space where specific deployment patterns allow for guaranteed k-connectivity, making the resulting network redundant while keeping channel utilization bounded. In particular, a hexagonal tesselation coverage pattern with 3-connectivity is investigated in Open space and a linear 4-connectivity pattern in Corridor space, respectively. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated in a realistic scenario, and based on the reported results, it is found superior compared to the existing stochastic randomized dual sampling schema.},

  abstract={We present and compare numerically three methods to determine the optimal configurations of a network of agents for the joint tasks of communication and target tracking. The first two methods, “Tracking first”(TF) and “Communication first”(CF), rely on an iterative procedure where the two tasks take turns in individually optimizing the network and differ in the choice of the startup task. The third method, “Simultaneous optimization”(SO), accounts for optimization constraints of both tasks and satisfies them simultaneously. Method TF yields the best results in terms of cost, while method SO is the fastest.},
