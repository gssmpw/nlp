This thesis is dedicated to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Anna M., I am profoundly grateful for her endless patience, support, and belief in me;
    \item my family, whose unwavering encouragement has always been unconditional;
    \item friends and colleagues, being part of a group of wonderful people has given me extra motivation and lots of smiles. To future PhD students, try to exchange and share ideas, do not isolate yourself.
\end{itemize}
