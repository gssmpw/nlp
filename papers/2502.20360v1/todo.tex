% \subsubsection{Assumptions to mention}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item We focus on strategies in which all miners use all the hashrate available to them at all times (no ``gap game'' style strategies)
%     \item we assume the rewards available to miners are independent of the identity of the miner
%     \item block reward is fixed for duration of game (no halvening)
%     \item linear, deterministic transaction arrivals for initial model
%     \item infinite block size
%     \item zero network latency
%     \item transactions are ordered based on fee
%     \item no predictablility of bernoulli rewards
%     \item difficulty adjustment
%     \item discretized time for integrability 
% \end{itemize}
