\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method to enhance the analysis of the movement trend and object tracking in the animation process. 
By analogizing animation paths to bus routes and the object layout to the seat allocation, RouteFlow offers clear and smooth animations of moving objects along their trajectories.
The key feature of RouteFlow lies in its balanced depiction of the global trend and local hotspots, coupled with its ability to minimize occlusion.
This balance improves users' capability to track movements and understand complex interactions within the objects.
The quantitative evaluation and user study further validate that RouteFlow performs better than existing methods in identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots.
