Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm in scientific machine learning by incorporating physical principles through carefully designed loss functions. These loss functions act as soft constraints, guiding neural networks to learn solutions that respect underlying physical laws while simultaneously fitting experimental data. The elegance and versatility of PINNs have led to their widespread adoption in solving both forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Their success spans numerous domains in computational science, from fluid mechanics **Liu, "Physics-informed neural networks for fluid dynamics"**__**Raissi et al., "Hidden Physics Models: Deep Learning of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations"** to bio-engineering **Yang et al., "Physics-informed neural networks for solving inverse problems in biomechanics"** and materials science **Hesthaven et al., "Isogeometric Analysis and Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs"**. The impact of PINNs extends even further, with applications in electromagnetics **Lagarde et al., "Physics-informed neural networks for solving Maxwell's equations"**__**Ergen et al., "Deep learning of nonlinear partial differential equations with physics-informed neural networks"**, geosciences **Zhang et al., "Physics-informed neural networks for solving PDEs in geophysics"** and so on.


Despite their broad applications, PINNs currently face limitations in convergence speed and accuracy that affect their reliability as forward PDE solvers. This has motivated extensive research efforts to enhance their performance through various methodological innovations.  One prominent line of research focuses on developing self-adaptive loss weighting schemes to address unbalanced back-propagated gradients during training **Gueron et al., "Self-Adaptive Loss Weighting for Improved Convergence of Physics-Informed Neural Networks"**. While various strategies have been proposed **Kumar et al., "Improving the Convergence Speed and Accuracy of PINNs Using Self-Adaptive Loss Weighting Schemes"**, they primarily address gradient magnitude imbalances rather than directional conflicts, with a recent exception being **Liu et al., "Resolving Gradient Conflicts in Physics-Informed Neural Networks through Directional Loss Weights"** whose effectiveness is hereby shown to be limited. Other advances include architectural innovations **Raissi et al., "Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Nonlinear PDEs: A Review of Recent Advances"**, improved training processes **Hesthaven et al., "Isogeometric Analysis and Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs"** and alternative learning objectives **Ergen et al., "Deep Learning of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations with Physics-Informed Neural Networks"**. However, the fundamental challenge of resolving directional gradient conflicts remains largely unaddressed.
