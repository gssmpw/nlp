	Standpoint linear temporal logic ($\StpLTL$) is a recently introduced extension of classical linear temporal logic (LTL) with standpoint modalities. Intuitively, these modalities allow to express that, from agent $a$'s standpoint, it is conceivable that a given formula holds. 
	%
	Besides the standard interpretation of the standpoint modalities  we introduce four  new semantics, which differ in the information an agent can extract from the  history. We provide a general model checking algorithm applicable to $\StpLTL$ under any of the five semantics. Furthermore we analyze the computational complexity of the corresponding model checking problems, obtaining PSPACE-completeness in three cases, which stands in contrast to the known EXPSPACE-completeness of the $\StpLTL$ satisfiability problem.
