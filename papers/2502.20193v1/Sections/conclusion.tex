\section{Conclusion}

We considered five different semantics for $\StpLTL$ that differ in the amount of information the agents can extract from the history, and presented a generic model-checking algorithm applicable to all five semantics.
The computational complexity of the algorithm, however, varies between the semantics due to the different numbers of necessary applications of the powerset construction.
More precisely,
the generic $\StpLTL^*$ model checking algorithm 
is $m$-fold exponentially time-bounded
with $m=1$ for $* \in \{\step,\public,\decr\}$, $m = |\Ag|$ for $* = \incr$,
and $m = \ad(\phi)$ for $*=\pobs$. 

Algorithms with improved space complexity for $\stepmodels$, $\publicmodels$,
$\pobsmodels$, and $\incrmodels{}$ are obtained via embeddings into LTLK.
To match the space bounds,
the model-checking algorithm of Section 5 can be adapted 
by combining classical on-the-fly
automata-based LTL model checking techniques with an on-the-fly
construction of history-DFA, 
similar to the
techniques proposed in \cite{MC-LTLK-and-beyond-2024} for CTL*K (for more details, see Appendix \ref{sec:m-minus-1-EXPSPACE}).
Analyzing if analogous techniques are applicable to obtain
a polynomially space-bounded algorithm for $\decrmodels{}$, 
providing lower bounds beyond PSPACE for $\incrmodels{}$ and $\probsmodels$, as well as an experimental evaluation of the presented algorithm remain as future work.
