\section{Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work}

This paper introduces FLoRA, a framework for learning interpretable scoring rules expressed in temporal logic for autonomous driving planning systems. FLoRA addresses key challenges by developing a learnable logic structure to capture nuanced relationships among driving predicates; proposing a data-driven method to optimize rule structure and parameters from demonstrations; and presenting an optimization framework for learning from driving demonstration data. Experimental results on the NuPlan dataset show that FLoRA outperforms both expert-crafted rules and neural network approaches across various scenarios, with different proposer types. This work thus represents a significant step towards creating more adaptable, interpretable, and effective scoring mechanisms for autonomous driving systems, bridging the gap between data-driven approaches and rule-based systems. A current limitation of FLoRA is that it can only discover relationships between provided predicates, which are manually designed. Future work will focus on extending FLoRA with LLM-aided predicate discovery and incorporating accident data as they become available through real-world autonomous driving deployments.
