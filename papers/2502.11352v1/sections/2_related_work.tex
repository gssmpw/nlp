\section{Related Work}
Scoring models are widely used in autonomous driving systems to evaluate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of planned trajectories \cite{Dauner2023CORL,Karnchanachari2024TowardsLP,hu2023planning,xiao2021rule,wishart2020driving,junietz2018criticality,hekmatnejad2019encoding,Deng2023TARGETAS,Zhou2023SpecificationBasedAD,houston2021one,riedmaier2020survey,weng2020model,vasudevan2024planningadaptiveworldmodels,phan2022driving,huang2021driving,kuderer2015learning,wulfmeier2017large,silver2012learning,jiang2022efficient}. This evaluation becomes particularly crucial in end-to-end autonomous driving systems, where behavioral uncertainties arise from multiple sources: neural network stochasticity (e.g., dropout, distributional sampling)~\cite{hu2023planning}, environmental condition variations~\cite{hu2023planning}, and complex multi-agent interaction modeling~\cite{chen2024end}.

Existing scoring models can be broadly categorized into rule-based and learning-based models. Rule-based scoring models \cite{Dauner2023CORL,Karnchanachari2024TowardsLP,hu2023planning,xiao2021rule,wishart2020driving,junietz2018criticality,hekmatnejad2019encoding,Deng2023TARGETAS,Zhou2023SpecificationBasedAD,houston2021one,riedmaier2020survey} leverage expert knowledge and domain-specific rules, offering interpretability but lacking data-driven adaptability. In contrast, learning-based scoring models, typically approximated with deep neural network, \cite{weng2020model,vasudevan2024planningadaptiveworldmodels,phan2022driving,huang2021driving,kuderer2015learning,wulfmeier2017large,silver2012learning,jiang2022efficient} are data-driven and can capture complex patterns, but often sacrifice interpretability, which can be intimidating for safety-critical applications.

In the broader context of temporal logic rule learning \cite{bartocci2022survey}, some researchers have explored learning interpretable rules from demonstrations. However, the current literature has not explored the potential of learning interpretable rules directly from driving data, in the context of autonomous driving systems.
