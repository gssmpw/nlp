\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Hateful meme detection presents a significant challenge as a multimodal task due to the complexity of interpreting implicit hate messages and contextual cues within memes. Previous approaches have fine-tuned pre-trained vision-language models (PT-VLMs), leveraging the knowledge they gained during pre-training and their attention mechanisms to understand meme content. However, the reliance of these models on implicit knowledge and complex attention mechanisms renders their decisions difficult to explain, which is crucial for building trust in meme classification. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{IntMeme}, a novel framework that leverages Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for hateful meme classification with explainable decisions. \textsf{IntMeme} addresses the dual challenges of improving both accuracy and explainability in meme moderation. The framework uses LMMs to generate human-like, interpretive analyses of memes, providing deeper insights into multimodal content and context. Additionally, it uses independent encoding modules for both memes and their interpretations, which are then combined to enhance classification performance. Our approach addresses the opacity and misclassification issues associated with PT-VLMs, optimizing the use of LMMs for hateful meme detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of \textsf{IntMeme} through comprehensive experiments across three datasets, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art models.

\section{Ethical Considerations and Limitations}

\paragraph{Content Hallucinations and Inaccuracies.} One critical concern is that the model might generate irrelevant or inaccurate interpretations of memes \cite{maynez2020faithfulness, ji2023survey}, which could inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or biases about certain social groups. This issue is inherent in the use of LMMs in a zero-shot manner, where the model operates without specific training on the task at hand. In our work, we address this challenge by focusing on enhancing explainability behind model decisions, aiming to provide more transparent reasoning for the outputs generated. However, the limitations associated with hallucinations highlight the need for future research to explore more robust approaches, such as retrieval-augmented generation, which could improve the accuracy and relevance of generated interpretations. This would not only enhance the model's performance but also mitigate potential ethical risks associated with the propagation of harmful stereotypes.

\paragraph{Generalisability to New Unseen Memes.} When deploying fine-tuned models for hateful meme detection, a primary ethical concern is their ability to generalize effectively to unseen memes, which can lead to the transfer of domain-specific biases and subsequent misclassification \cite{cao2024modularized}. To address this challenge, our framework employs LMMs to generate meme interpretations in a zero-shot manner. By avoiding fine-tuning for specific domains, these LMMs are less prone to overfitting and perpetuating biases against particular social groups. This approach allows our framework to leverage the strengths of generalized LMMs while minimizing the risk of bias. However, we acknowledge that these generalized models may still harbor inherent biases, presenting ethical risks in the context of automated hateful meme detection. Therefore, ongoing vigilance and evaluation are necessary to ensure that our framework operates equitably and responsibly in real-world applications.

\paragraph{Misuse of Meme Interpretations.} While these interpretations are designed to enhance understanding and assist in content moderation, we acknowledge the risk that they could be misused to create more hateful memes and reinforce social stereotypes. We strongly condemn such actions and want to clarify that we intend to use these interpretations to improve content moderation. We believe that the benefits of generating meme interpretations for this purpose far outweigh any potential risks of misuse. By providing content moderators with deeper insights, we aim to empower them to identify and flag potentially hateful content more effectively, thereby contributing to a more informed and responsible digital environment.
