\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
In RQ1, we consider the following statistics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy of Environment information
\item Accuracy of the Road Network
\item Accuracy of the Actor Types
\item Consistency of survey results (from the `Trajectory Visualization Evaluation Survey')
\item The proportion of each rating level (from the `Trajectory Visualization Evaluation Survey')
\end{itemize}

%In RQ2, we report the performance of {\tool} including the consistency of survey results and the proportion of each rating level from the 'Scenario Construction Results Evaluation Survey'.
In RQ2, we present the performance of {\tool}, including the consistency of survey results and the distribution of ratings across different levels from the ``Scenario Construction Results Evaluation Survey''. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of the performance of LCTGen scenario generation.

In RQ3, we consider the following statistics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of scenarios generated by {\tool} and LCTGen
\item Number of crashes detected by {\tool} and LCTGen
\item Scenario generation time of {\tool}
\item Number of scenarios used to find the Top-k bugs of {\tool} (where $k$ is set to 1, 2, or 3 in this paper).
\item Average ratio of finding bugs of {\tool}
\end{itemize}
% Please do not use 'we will' in the paper except for future work.
 In RQ4, we consider the following statistics:(1) Accuracy of extracted scenario representations after removing the prompts selection process; (2)Accuracy of extracted scenario representations after removing self-validation process.
