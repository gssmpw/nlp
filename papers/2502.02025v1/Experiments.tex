\subsection{Research Questions}
We propose four research questions (RQs) along with related experiments to assess the effectiveness of {\tool}. The RQs are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item RQ1: How accurate is {\tool} in extracting scenario representations during the Information Extraction stage?

\item RQ2: How accurately do the critical scenarios constructed by {\tool} reflect the original crash report?

\item RQ3: How effectively can {\tool} construct scenarios from existing data and uncover ADS bugs?

\item RQ4: Are the proposed prompt engineering and validation methods effective?
\end{itemize}
