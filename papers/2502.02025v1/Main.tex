\begin{abstract}
    The rapid advancements in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) have necessitated robust software testing to ensure safety and reliability. However, automating the generation of scalable and concrete test scenarios remains a significant challenge. Current scenario-based test case generation methods often face limitations, such as unrealistic scenes and inaccurate vehicle trajectories. These challenges largely result from the loss of map information during data extraction and the lack of an effective verification mechanism to mitigate hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces \textbf{{\tool}}, a scenario-based ADS \textbf{T}est case gene\textbf{RA}tion framework for \textbf{C}ritical sc\textbf{E}narios. By leveraging multimodal data to extract challenging scenarios from real-world car crash reports, {\tool} constructs numerous critical test cases with less data, significantly enhancing ADS bug detection efficiency. Using in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and self-validation approaches, we use LLMs to extract environmental and road network information from crash reports. For vehicle trajectory planning, data containing map information and vehicle coordinates serves as a knowledge base to build a Chat-GPT-based LLM with path-planning capabilities, which we named \textbf{{\tooltwo}}. Based on 50 existing crash reports, our approach successfully tested three ADS models across two simulation platforms, MetaDrive and BeamNG. Of the 290 constructed test scenarios, 127 are identified as critical, as they resulted in vehicle collisions. Additionally, user feedback reveals that {\tool} demonstrates superior scenario reconstruction accuracy, with 77.5\% of the scenarios being rated as `mostly' or `totally' consistent, compared to only 27\% for the most related SOTA-LCTGen.
