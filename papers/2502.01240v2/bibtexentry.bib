abstract = {Logic locking has been conceived as a promising proactive defense strategy against intellectual property (IP) piracy, counterfeiting, hardware Trojans, reverse engineering, and overbuilding attacks. Yet, various attacks that use a working chip as an oracle have been launched on logic locking to successfully retrieve its secret key, undermining the defense of all existing locking techniques. In this paper, we propose stripped-functionality logic locking (SFLL), which strips some of the functionality of the design and hides it in the form of a secret key(s), thereby rendering on-chip implementation functionally different from the original one. When loaded onto an on-chip memory, the secret keys restore the original functionality of the design. Through security-aware synthesis that creates a controllable mismatch between the reverse-engineered netlist and original design, SFLL provides a quantifiable and provable resilience trade-off between all known and anticipated attacks. We demonstrate the application of SFLL to large designs (>100K gates) using a computer-aided design (CAD) framework that ensures attaining the desired security level at minimal implementation cost, 8%, 5%, and 0.5% for area, power, and delay, respectively. In addition to theoretical proofs and simulation confirmation of SFLL's security, we also report results from the silicon implementation of SFLL on an ARM Cortex-M0 microprocessor in 65nm technology.},

abstract = {Logic locking has been proposed to safeguard intellectual property (IP) during chip fabrication. Logic locking techniques protect hardware IP by making a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural accelerator it protects. Specifically, we show how the deterministic errors caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on several locked accelerators. In our largest benchmark accelerator, our attack identified a trojan key that caused a 74\% decrease in classification accuracy for attacker-specified trigger inputs, while degrading accuracy by only 1.7\% for other inputs on average.},

The security of the platform is built on top of two pillars: a secured hardware design flow and a secure microkernel. The hardware design is protected against the insertion of hardware Trojans during the production phase through netlist obfuscation provided by logic locking. The software stack is based on a trustworthy and verified microkernel. Moreover, the system is expected to work in an environment which does not allow physical access to the device. Therefore, on-the-field attacks are only possible via software. We present a solution whose security has been achieved by relying on simple and open hardware and software solutions, namely a RISC-V processor core, open-source peripherals and an seL4--based operating system.},

abstract = {Due to the globalization of semiconductor manufacturing and test processes, the system-on-a-chip (SoC) designers no longer design the complete SoC and manufacture chips on their own. This outsourcing of the design and manufacturing of Integrated Circuits (ICs) has resulted in several threats, such as overproduction of ICs, sale of out-of-specification/rejected ICs, and piracy of Intellectual Properties (IPs). Logic locking has emerged as a promising defense strategy against these threats. However, various attacks about the extraction of secret keys have undermined the security of logic locking techniques. Over the years, researchers have proposed different techniques to prevent existing attacks. In this article, we propose a novel attack that can break any logic locking techniques that rely on the stored secret key. This proposed TAAL attack is based on implanting a hardware Trojan in the netlist, which leaks the secret key to an adversary once activated. As an untrusted foundry can extract the netlist of a design from the layout/mask information, it is feasible to implement such a hardware Trojan. All three proposed types of TAAL attacks can be used for extracting secret keys. We have introduced the models for both the combinational and sequential hardware Trojans that evade manufacturing tests. An adversary only needs to choose one hardware Trojan out of a large set of all possible Trojans to launch the TAAL attack.},

The SAT attack is an oracle-guided attack that utilizes a SAT solver to compute attack patterns that refine the key search space iteratively. The SAT attack has changed the direction of logic locking research; developing efficient countermeasures against the attack is still an active area of research. This chapter presents the SAT attack, which breaks all pre-SAT logic locking techniques. The SAT attack forms the most potent variant of key recovery attacks mounted to break basic combinational logic locking techniques [10]. The attack and its variants apply to both logic locking [10] and camouflaging [4, 5]. The attack uses the notion of Boolean satisfiability. Section 4.1 reviews the fundamental concepts of Boolean satisfiability. Section 4.2 presents the SAT attack algorithm. Section 4.3 elaborates on the effectiveness of the SAT attack against the pre-SAT logic locking techniques. Section 4.4 discusses the potential approaches to thwart the SAT attack. Section 4.5 presents a formal security analysis framework to quantify security of logic locking techniques against different classes of attacks including the SAT attack.",
