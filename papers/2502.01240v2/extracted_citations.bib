abstract = {Logic locking has been proposed to safeguard intellectual property (IP) during chip fabrication. Logic locking techniques protect hardware IP by making a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural accelerator it protects. Specifically, we show how the deterministic errors caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on several locked accelerators. In our largest benchmark accelerator, our attack identified a trojan key that caused a 74\% decrease in classification accuracy for attacker-specified trigger inputs, while degrading accuracy by only 1.7\% for other inputs on average.},

title = "The SAT Attack",
abstract = "This chapter elaborates on the SAT attack, which breaks all pre-SAT logic locking techniques. The SAT attack is an oracle-guided attack that utilizes a SAT solver to compute attack patterns that refine the key search space iteratively. The SAT attack has changed the direction of logic locking research; developing efficient countermeasures against the attack is still an active area of research. This chapter presents the SAT attack, which breaks all pre-SAT logic locking techniques. The SAT attack forms the most potent variant of key recovery attacks mounted to break basic combinational logic locking techniques [10]. The attack and its variants apply to both logic locking [10] and camouflaging [4, 5]. The attack uses the notion of Boolean satisfiability. Section 4.1 reviews the fundamental concepts of Boolean satisfiability. Section 4.2 presents the SAT attack algorithm. Section 4.3 elaborates on the effectiveness of the SAT attack against the pre-SAT logic locking techniques. Section 4.4 discusses the potential approaches to thwart the SAT attack. Section 4.5 presents a formal security analysis framework to quantify security of logic locking techniques against different classes of attacks including the SAT attack.",
