\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose an LLM-empowered agent-based modular mobility generation framework, TrajLLM. It utilizes iterative activity simulation and hybrid models destination selection mechanisms to allow memory-guided LLM agents to simulate effective human activity trajectories. Key contributions include the development of a modular framework that seamlessly integrates human behavioral and spatial-temporal dynamics into mobility simulation, significantly enhancing the realism and adaptability of generated long-term human movement patterns, while reducing the reliance on real-world data. 
In addition, our interactive web interface allows users to flexibly configure simulation parameters to visualise the daily trajectories of different numbers of agents at different times.
