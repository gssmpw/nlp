This work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human mobility, addressing challenges like high costs and privacy concerns in traditional models. Our hierarchical framework integrates persona generation, activity selection, and destination prediction, using real-world demographic and psychological data to create realistic movement patterns. Both physical models and language models are employed to explore and demonstrate different methodologies for human mobility simulation. By structuring data with summarization and weighted density metrics, the system ensures scalable memory management while retaining actionable insights. Preliminary results indicate that LLM-driven simulations align with observed real-world patterns, offering scalable, interpretable insights for social problems such as urban planning, traffic management, and public health. The frameworkâ€™s ability to dynamically generate personas and activities enables it to provide adaptable and realistic daily routines. This study demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in advancing mobility modeling for societal and urban applications. The source code and interactive demo for our framework are available at \url{https://github.com/cju0/TrajLLM}.
