\item **Bansal, R., et al., "Pollinator-pollinator interactions: a study on resource availability and pesticide influence"** presents an analysis of experimental data on behavior of four pollinator species in controlled conditions. The main focus is the influence of resource availability and presence of pesticide on pollinator-pollinator interactions, both between species and within one. Statistical tools show that out of the three presented possible models, one accounting for these environmental conditions is by far the best. Their influence differs between species but is clearly present. The authors stress that the environmental context in which pollinators interact with plants and with each other is the crucial part of the interactions. \\
I think this is a good example of an ecological paper describing a higher-order interaction, since the influence of other species is impacted by the environment (available amount of flowers and pesticide presence).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item adding effects from a distinct type of objects calls for a multilayer network formulation more than for a hypergraph 
    \item binary/discrete case, like presence/absence of a pesticide can be modelled through a multiplex network (with two/more copies of the underlying bipartite graph plant-pollinator)
    \item  continuous case can be modeled using a multilayer network with three layers
\end{enumerate}
\item **Forte, S., et al., "Hypergraphs and hypernetworks: an overview"** introduces a concept of complex hyperhraphs (chygraphs). The main idea is to generalize the concept of hypergraphs beyond ubergraphs. Please note that the paper is not yet reviewed or published.
\begin{definition}[Complex hypergraph]
    A complex hypergraph (chygraph) $\chi(A,C)$ is a set of vertices $A$ and hypergraphs $C$ with vertex sets in $A \cup C$.
\end{definition}
The author gives several examples. For a graph the hypergraphs are said to be edges (which I understand as hypergraphs containing only one pairwise edge each, since they are meant to be actual hyperpgraphs?).
An ubergraph is a chygraph where the hypergraphs contain only one edge. \\
Another example is the system of scientific publications, which is represented by a chygraph $\chi(A, \{ \mathcal{H}_i(A_i \cup R_i, \{A_i, R_i\})\}) $. A publication is represented by a single hypergraph $\mathcal{H}_i$ with two edges $A_i$ (authors) and $R_i$ (references), which do not overlap. Here the difference between a chygraph and an ubergraph is visible: for an ubergraph the way to represent both references and authors would probably be similar, with two edges containing references and authors respectively. However the connection between those edges is important and the chygraph structure allows to include them in one hypergraph, which also has a clear meaning, as it represents a single publication. \\

The author also defines a matrix for chygraphs, which he decides to call the chy-adjacency matrix (although is seems more like an incidence matrix if anything):
\begin{definition}[Chy-adjacency matrix]
    Let $\chi(A, C=\{ \mathcal{H}_i(V_i, E_i)\})$ be a chygraph. Then the chy-adjacency matrix $\alpha$ is a  $|A\cup C| \times |A \cup C|$ matrix with 
    \begin{equation*}
        \alpha_{ij}=\begin{cases}
            1, \quad \text{if} \ i \in V_j ,& \\
            0, \quad \text{otherwise}
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    for $i,j \in A \cup C$.
    \end{definition}
    (to me this does not seem correct for several reasons, but maybe I'm missing something) \\
    There is also a definition of the length of the chygraph:
    \begin{definition}[Chygraph length]
        Let $\chi(A, C=\{ \mathcal{H}_i(V_i, E_i)\})$ be a chygraph and let $\Pi = \Pi_1 \cup \dots \cup \Pi_l$ be a partition of $C$ such that $\Pi_i \cap \Pi_j = \emptyset \text{ for } i \neq j$ and if $\mathcal{H}_i \in \Pi_j$, then $V_i \subset A \cup (\bigcup_{k \leq j} \Pi_k)$. The chygraph length $L(\chi)$ is the maximum $l$ between such partitions. 
        \end{definition}
    The second condition means the partition is hierarchical. The author then proceeds to analyze the mean component size. \\ 
    I think the paper seems to contains inaccuracies and does not provide much theory about chygraphs (and does not justify the need to define them).
