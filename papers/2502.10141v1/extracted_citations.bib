   abstract = {Hypergraphs naturally represent higher-order interactions, which persistently appear in social interactions, neural networks, and other natural systems. Although their importance is well recognized, a theoretical framework to describe general dynamical processes on hypergraphs is not available yet. In this paper, we derive expressions for the stability of dynamical systems defined on an arbitrary hypergraph. The framework allows us to reveal that, near the fixed point, the relevant structure is a weighted graph-projection of the hypergraph and that it is possible to identify the role of each structural order for a given process. We analytically solve two dynamics of general interest, namely, social contagion and diffusion processes, and show that the stability conditions can be decoupled in structural and dynamical components. Our results show that in social contagion process, only pairwise interactions play a role in the stability of the absorbing state, while for the diffusion dynamics, the order of the interactions plays a differential role. Our work provides a general framework for further exploration of dynamical processes on hypergraphs.},

   abstract = {Classical theory shows that large communities are destabilized by random interactions among species pairs, creating an upper bound on ecosystem diversity. However, species interactions often occur in high-order combinations, whereby the interaction between two species is modulated by one or more other species. Here, by simulating the dynamics of communities with random interactions, we find that the classical relationship between diversity and stability is inverted for high-order interactions. More specifically, while a community becomes more sensitive to pairwise interactions as its number of species increases, its sensitivity to three-way interactions remains unchanged, and its sensitivity to four-way interactions actually decreases. Therefore, while pairwise interactions lead to sensitivity to the addition of species, four-way interactions lead to sensitivity to species removal, and their combination creates both a lower and an upper bound on the number of species. These findings highlight the importance of high-order species interactions in determining the diversity of natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {Networks are a widely used and efficient paradigm to model real-world systems where basic units interact pairwise. Many body interactions are often at play, and cannot be modelled by resorting to binary exchanges. In this work, we consider a general class of dynamical systems anchored on hypergraphs. Hyperedges of arbitrary size ideally encircle individual units so as to account for multiple, simultaneous interactions. These latter are mediated by a combinatorial Laplacian, that is here introduced and characterised. The formalism of the master stability function is adapted to the present setting. Turing patterns and the synchronisation of non linear (regular and chaotic) oscillators are studied, for a general class of systems evolving on hypergraphs. The response to externally imposed perturbations bears the imprint of the higher order nature of the interactions.}

   abstract = {Animals often change their behaviour in the presence of other species and the environmental context they experience, and these changes can substantially modify the course their populations follow. In the case of animals involved in mutualistic interactions, it is still unclear how to incorporate the effects of these behavioural changes into population dynamics. We propose a framework for using pollinator functional responses to examine the roles of pollinator–pollinator interactions and abiotic conditions in altering the times between floral visits of a focal pollinator. We then apply this framework to a unique foraging experiment with different models that allow resource availability and sublethal exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide to modify how pollinators forage alone and with co-foragers. We found that all co-foragers interfere with the focal pollinator under at least one set of abiotic conditions; for most species, interference was strongest at higher levels of resource availability and with pesticide exposure. Overall our results highlight that density-dependent responses are often context-dependent themselves.},

@article{Grilli2017,
   abstract = {Ecologists have long sought a way to explain how the remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot produce the stable persistence of very large ecological communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which species do not interact and diversity is maintained by immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust persistence of large communities of interacting competitors are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order interactions, in which the presence of a species influences the interaction between other species. Although higher-order interactions have been studied for decades, their role in shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion of higher-order interactions in competitive network models stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the perturbation of both population abundance and parameter values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as of open communities in which new species are constantly introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating empirical parameterization and validation of our models.},

   abstract = {Networks can describe the structure of a wide variety of complex systems by specifying which pairs of entities in the system are connected. While such pairwise representations are flexible, they are not necessarily appropriate when the fundamental interactions involve more than two entities at the same time. Pairwise representations nonetheless remain ubiquitous, because higher-order interactions are often not recorded explicitly in network data. Here, we introduce a Bayesian approach to reconstruct latent higher-order interactions from ordinary pairwise network data. Our method is based on the principle of parsimony and only includes higher-order structures when there is sufficient statistical evidence for them. We demonstrate its applicability to a wide range of datasets, both synthetic and empirical.},
