\begin{abstract}
  
  The problem of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in knowledge bases (KBs) is a prominent topic in Artificial Intelligence (AI). While there is some work on this problem, the explanations provided by existing approaches often lack critical information or fail to be expressive enough for non-binary conflicts. In this paper, we identify structural weaknesses of the state-of-the-art and propose a generic argumentation-based approach to address these problems. This approach is defined for logics involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets and shows how any such logic can be translated to argumentation. Our work provides dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures to compute and explain a query answer wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics. This allows us to construct dialectical proof trees as explanations, which are more expressive and arguably more intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}%, in view of related work}
We introduce a generic framework to provide a flexible environment for logic argumentation, and to address the challenges of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning. 
Particularly, we studied how deductive arguments, DeLP, ASPIC/ ASPIC+ without preferences, flat or non-flat ABAs and sequent-based argumentation are instances of P-SAF frameworks. 
 (Detailed discussions can be found after Definition~\ref{def:ab-arg} and~\ref{def:ab-att}).
However, different perspectives were considered as follows.
 
%
Regarding deductive arguments and DeLP, our work extends these approaches in several ways. First, the usual conditions of minimality and consistency of supports are dropped. This offers a simpler way of producing arguments and identifying them. Second, like ABAs, the P-SAF arguments are in the form of tree derivations to show the structure of the arguments. This offer aims to (1) clarify the argument structure, and (2) enhance understanding of intermediate reasoning steps in inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in,  for instance, \datalogPM and DL.

Similar to ”non-flat” ABAs, the P-SAF framework uses the notion of $\cn$ to allow the inferred assumptions being conflicting. In contrast, "flat" ABAs ignore the case of the inferred assumptions being conflicting. Moreover, by using collective attacks, the P-SAF framework is sufficiently general to model n-ary constraints, which are not yet addressed in ”non-flat” ABAs and ASPIC/ ASPIC+ without preferences. 
Like our approach, contrapositive ABAs in~\cite{HEYNINCK2020103,ArieliH24} provide an abstract view for logical argumentation, in which attacks are defined on the level assumptions. However, since a substantial part of the development of the theory of contrapositive ABA is focused on contrapositive propositional logic, we have considered the logic of ABA as being given by $\cnb_s$ and these contrapositive ABAs being simulated in our setting, see  Section~\ref{subsec:relation-framework}.
In Section~\ref{subsec:relation-framework}, we showed how sequent-based argumentation can fit in the P-SAF setting. While our work can be applied to first-order logic, sequent-based argumentation leaves the study of first-order formalisms for further research.

The work of~\cite{Amgoud2009} proposed the use of Tarski abstract logic in argumentation that is characterized simply by a consequence operator.
However, many logics underlying argumentation systems, like ABA or ASPIC systems, do not always impose the absurdity axiom. 
A similar idea of using consequence operators can be found in the work of~\cite{loanho_2024}.
When a consequence operation is defined by means of "\emph{models}", inference rule steps are implicit within it. If arguments are defined by consequence operators, then the structure of arguments is often ignored, which makes it difficult to clearly explain the acceptability of the arguments. These observations motivate the slight generalizations of Tarski's abstract logic, in which we defined consequence operators in a proof-theoretic manner, inspired by the approach of~\cite{Stephen1975}, with minimal properties.



As we have studied here, we introduced an alternative abstract approach for logical argumentation and showed the connections between our framework and the state-of-the-art argumentation frameworks.
%Our proposal goes beyond these in that we provide a comprehensive coverage of differnt types of argument and of different types of support and attack relationships. 
However, we should not claim any framework as better than those, or vice versa. Rather, the choice of an argumentation framework using specific logic should depend on the needs of the application.

Finally, this paper is the first investigation of dialectical proof procedures to compute and explain the acceptance wrt argumentation semantics in the case of collective attacks.
%and explain the internal structure of arguments and the reasoning progress
The dialectical proof procedures address the limits of the paper~\cite{loanho_2024}, i.e., it is not easy to understand intermediate reasoning steps in reasoning progress with (inconsistent) KBs.



%This paper investigates the challenge of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in knowledge bases (KBs). We pinpoint the weaknesses of the state-of-the-art and introduce a generic framework to address these problems. This approach is defined for any logic involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets. It shows how such logic can be translated to argumentation. To clarify and explain the acceptance of a sentence wrt inconsistency-tolerant semantics, we provide dialogue models as dialectic-proof procedures and connect the dialogues with argumentation semantics. The results allow us to work out explanations based on dialectical proof trees, which are more expressive and intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.

 The primary message of this paper is that we introduce a generic argumentation framework to address the challenge of explaining inconsistency-tolerant reasoning in KBs. This approach is defined for any logic involving reasoning with maximal consistent subsets, therefore, it provides a flexible environment for logical argumentation. To clarify and explain the acceptance of a sentence with respect to inconsistency-tolerant semantics, we present explanatory dialogue models that can be viewed as dialectic-proof procedures and connect the dialogues with argumentation semantics. The results allow us to provide dialogical explanations with graphical representations of dialectical proof trees. The dialogical explanations are more expressive and intuitive than existing explanation formalisms.
 
 Our approach has been studied from a theoretical viewpoint.
 %We have focused on soundness results only. Completeness results for dispute derivations for ABA in~\cite{ThangDP22} are a useful starting point for studying the completeness of our dialogues. 
 From practice, especially, from a human-computer interaction perspective, we will perform experiments with our approach in real-data applications. We then qualitatively evaluate our explanation by human evaluation. It would be interesting to analyze the complexity of computing the explanations empirically and theoretically.
