This work introduced the Snowball Adversarial Attack, an iterative approach that progressively applies perturbations, referred to as ``snowballs,'' to traffic sign images. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that optimize a single global perturbation, the Snowball Attack amplifies its effects incrementally over successive iterations, exploiting layer-wise vulnerabilities within the system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in significantly degrading the performance of traffic sign recognition systems. At the 25\% threshold, the attack resulted in up to 90\% performance improvement for certain traffic signs, while the 50\% and 75\% thresholds showed substantial, though slightly less severe, performance improvements. These findings reveal the ability of the Snowball Attack to compound perturbations across layers, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of traffic sign recognition systems to such adversarial perturbations. Given the importance of reliable traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving and other safety-critical applications, these results highlight the need for stronger defenses against such adversarial strategies. Future work should focus on developing more robust models and effective defense mechanisms to mitigate the impact of compounded adversarial attacks.
