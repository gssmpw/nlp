    \caption{\textbf{Overview of our proposed method.} From a single input human image, our approach leverages a generalizable human NeRF to map the subject to canonical space, followed by reposing and rendering to obtain the appearance cue (\textit{i.e.}, NeRF renderings). Paired with the geometry cue (\textit{i.e.}, SMPL normal maps), they provide comprehensive conditions for the video diffusion model, enabling multi-view consistent novel view synthesis or temporally consistent pose animation, effectively disentangled by a switcher module.}
