In this work we conduct a comprehensive mining study and analysis of the ML supply chain on Hugging Face. We construct a reusable dataset of over 750,000 models and 175,000 datasets, which we make freely available in our replication package \cite{anonymous_repo}.  Using this data we create a supply chain graph that models the relationships between ML models and the models they depend on, describe the notable features and properties of this supply chain, analyze the current state of documentation on Hugging Face, and consider the current state of licensing and license compliance in the ecosystem.  We offer a rich discussion of the challenges that not just Hugging Face but any sizable model hub will encounter.  Lastly, we offer concrete and actionable recommendations that can be adopted by any model hosting platform to facilitate better supply chain management.

\section*{Data availability}
We provide an anonymized replication package containing the raw mined data, our cleaned and normalized dataset, scripts for data cleaning, mining utilities, analysis scripts, and other data required for verifiability~\cite{anonymous_repo}. %
