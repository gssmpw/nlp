\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Reconstruction-oriented communications are designed to recover the transmitted information at the receiver sides, often involving traditional source and channel coding techniques. This approach is commonly used in systems where the fidelity of the information is paramount, such as in audio or video streaming services. The structure of separate source and channel coding, a cornerstone in the design of communication systems, has been shown to be theoretically optimal via \gls{aep} with infinitely long source and channel blocks \cite{Cover_1991_EoI}. However, in practical scenarios, this separation often leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance, particularly for \gls{ai} driven applications \cite{Bourtsoulatze_2019_DJS}.

The pervasive advancement of AI technologies, particularly in the context of deep learning, presents novel challenges for future communication systems, where the throughput required by AI agents could be much higher than that of human users.

Recent developments in deep learning have shown that \gls{jscc} can potentially address some of these inefficiencies and outperform traditional separate coding designs. This approach is especially potent in environments where traditional methods struggle to keep pace with the data demands of \gls{ai}-driven applications. However, \gls{jscc}-based reconstruction-oriented communications, which focus on accurately reconstructing a signal on receiver sides, often waste communication resources by transmitting task-agnostic information \cite{Kurka_2020_DfD}.

To address these issues, task-oriented communication has emerged as a key technology and has attracted significant research interests \cite{Shao_2022_LTO, Shao_2023_TOC, Stavrou_2022_ARD, Shi_2023_TOC}. Using the capabilities of deep learning, task-oriented \gls{jscc} focuses on transmitting task-specific information, thus improving efficiency and reducing the data rate in critical applications. This requires joint optimization of the \gls{jscc} and inference network, which must be co-designed for effective task-oriented communication \cite{Shao_2022_LTO}. Note that existing \gls{jscc} designs are mainly based on analog communication principles \cite{Bourtsoulatze_2019_DJS} and cannot be integrated with existing digital communication infrastructures.

Furthermore, cloud-based services introduce unacceptable latency for real-time applications, such as autonomous driving \cite{Zhang_2020_MEI, Liu_2019_ECf}. To mitigate this issue, \textit{edge inference} \cite{Li_2018_EIO, Shao_2022_LTO, Jankowski_2021_WIR} has become a promising approach, enabling quick response to real-time AI applications. However, widely deployed AI agents bring significant communication loads to communication systems. Emergent methods based on \gls{jscc} have shown great potential to solve this problem \cite{Jankowski_2021_WIR, Shao_2020_BAE, Jankowski_2020_JDE}.

Recognizing these multifaceted challenges, there is a growing interest in developing communication systems that are not only task-oriented but also aligned with reconstruction-oriented communication frameworks. This has led to the proposition of what we refer to as \gls{atroc}, which aims to bridge the gap between the efficiency of task-specific data transmission and the robustness of reconstruction-oriented communications, enabling the seamless integration of \gls{ai} technologies with existing network infrastructures.

\subsection{Contributions}
This paper introduces a novel communication framework compatible with reconstruction-oriented communication, especially for edge inference, termed \glsreset{atroc}\gls{atroc}. By extending \gls{ib} theory \cite{Tishby_1999_TIB} and incorporating \gls{jscc} modulation, this framework is designed to enhance AI-driven applications. It prioritizes task relevance in data transmission strategies, shifting focus from traditional signal reconstruction fidelity to operational efficiency and effectiveness in real-world applications. The key contributions of this research are summarized as follows:




\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Development of an \gls{atroc} Framework:} Based on \gls{ib} theory, we develop a framework that aligns task-oriented communications with reconstruction-oriented communications. The framework focuses on maximizing mutual information between inference results and encoded features, minimizing mutual information between the encoded features and the input data, and preserving task-specific information through the information reshaper. This reshaper is expert at transforming received symbols into task-specific data, maintaining the same data structure as the input while ensuring the preservation of task-specific information.

    \item \textbf{Innovation of an Information Reshaper:} We introduce an information reshaper within our extended \gls{ib} theory, laying a foundational aspect of \gls{atroc}. This component is crucial for adapting the communication to the specific needs of the task without compromising the integrity of the transmitted data.

    \item \textbf{Variational Approximation for Tractable Information Estimation:} Due to the intractability of mutual information in the training and inference of deep neural networks, we employ a variational approximation approach, known as \gls{vib}. This approach allows us to establish a tractable upper bound for these terms, enabling training and inference of deep neural networks.

    \item \textbf{Adaptation of a \gls{jscc} Modulation Scheme:} We design a \gls{jscc} modulation scheme that aligns \gls{jscc} symbols with a predefined constellation scheme. This scheme ensures compatibility of our framework with classic modulation techniques, making it more adaptable to existing communication infrastructures.

    \item \textbf{Performance Enhancement in Edge-Based Autonomous Driving:} In our simulation, we validate that the \gls{atroc} framework outperforms reconstruction-oriented methods for edge-based autonomous driving \cite{Wu_2022_TgC}. 
    Specifically, our method reduced 99.19\% communication load, in terms of bits per service, compared to existing methods, without compromising the driving score of the autonomous driving agent.
