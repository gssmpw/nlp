\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper has investigated an \gls{atroc} framework for edge intelligence, aimed at improving the integration of AI technologies within existing communication infrastructures. By extending the \gls{ib} theory and incorporating \gls{jscc} modulation, our framework shifts the focus from traditional signal reconstruction fidelity to task relevance, thus optimizing the performance of AI-driven applications in bandwidth-constrained and noise-interference environments.

Our evaluations conducted within the CARLA simulator highlight the robustness of the proposed \gls{atroc} framework. Particularly in low \gls{snr} conditions, our framework demonstrated significant superiority over traditional reconstruction-oriented communication methods by achieving a reduction of up to 99.19\% bits per service without sacrificing the effectiveness of task execution. 

The qualitative analysis revealed that while reconstruction-oriented communication methods are effective for human visual perception, they often fail to satisfy the specific requirements of machine vision. This observation emphasizes the need for communication designs that align more closely with the specific information needs of AI systems rather than human interpretation.
