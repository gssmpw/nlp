\begin{abstract}
Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit biases toward specific demographic groups, such as generating more males than females when prompted to generate images of engineers, raising ethical concerns and limiting their adoption. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of mitigating generation bias towards any target attribute value (e.g., ``male'' for ``gender'') in diffusion models while preserving generation quality. We propose \method, an adaptive latent guidance mechanism which controls the generation distribution during inference. In \method, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Further, given the limitations of existing datasets in comprehensively assessing bias in diffusion models, we introduce a holistic bias evaluation benchmark HBE, covering diverse domains and incorporating complex prompts across various applications. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that \method outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., $68.5\%$ gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2). Ablation studies highlight \method's ability to flexibly and precisely control generation distribution at any user-specified granularity, ensuring adaptive and targeted bias mitigation.

\section{Introduction}

Text-to-image diffusion models \citep{nichol2021glide,saharia2022photorealistic} have shown remarkable capabilities when generating photorealistic images from text input, leading to new real-world applications. Notably, stable diffusion models \citep{rombach2022high,podell2023sdxl,esser2024scaling} and DALL-E models \citep{ramesh2022hierarchical,betker2023improving} have gained widespread popularity, attracting millions of users and being utilized in a wide range of contexts such as reinforcement-learning based control \citep{pearce2023imitating,chi2023diffusion} and life-science \citep{chung2022mr,cao2024high}. 

However, the widespread application of diffusion models has raised concerns regarding social biases that are embedded in their generations. %
Specifically, a series of recent studies \citep{bakr2023hrs,lee2024holistic,cui2023holistic,wan2024male,wan2024survey,luccioni2023stable,naik2023social} have identified demographic biases (e.g., gender, race, etc.) in diffusion models when generating images of people from various occupations, making the generation process unfair.




Furthermore, our insight is that the definition of ``fair'' generation depends on the use cases and is often subjective. For example, someone may consider the generation fair when images of males and females are generated with equal probability, however, others may expect the generation distribution to mirror the true distribution of males and females in society. Recent study by \citealp{luccioni2023stable} has shown that existing bias mitigation techniques do not mirror the societal distribution of different attributes in generated outputs. Additionally, our experiments reveal that they exhibit significant limitations in flexibly controlling the generation distribution (Section \ref{sec:flex}). These findings raise a key research question: \textit{How can text-to-image diffusion models generate images that adhere to a target (or fair) distribution of attributes while preserving generation quality?}

The Latent Guidance Module then computes the effective latent direction to steer the selected attribute, given the input prompt and the chosen attribute.

Existing methods for bias mitigation in diffusion models such as prompt intervention methods alter user input prompts, however, often result in a considerable degradation of generation quality \citep{bansal2022well,fraser2023diversity,bianchi2023easily}. Model finetuning-based approaches \citep{orgad2023editing,shen2023finetuning,zhang2023iti} typically involve finetuning the model within a specific subdomain, compromise the overall generation quality, and lack flexibility. Latent intervention techniques such as FairDiffusion \citep{friedrich2023fair} introduces static vectors into the latent space for attribute control, however, are limited by their inability to dynamically adjust to varying inputs. For example, in Section \ref{sec:bias-eval-pf-fairgen}, we find that FairDiffusion is not robust to prompt complexity. 




  




To this end, we propose \method, a novel inference time algorithm for text-to-image diffusion models. \method allows precise control of the generation distribution to meet the desired target distribution. \method consists of an adaptive latent guidance module and an indicator guidance module. The latent guidance module computes the effective latent direction to enforce guidance towards the high-density region of target sensitive attributes (e.g., gender), conditioned on the current input prompt. %
The indicator guidance module determines the target attribute value (e.g., ``female'') to enforce during the current generation based on the generation statistics stored in a memory module. The memory module ensures that the generation statistics is consistent with the target fair distribution as defined by the user. In this manner, the adaptive latent guidance module, guidance indicator module, and the memory module jointly determine the adaptive guidance direction, leading to a flexible and effective fair generation paradigm. We explain \method in details in Section \ref{sec:method}.







Additionally, we find that current bias evaluation benchmarks \citep{bakr2023hrs,lee2024holistic,cui2023holistic,wan2024male,wan2024survey,luccioni2023stable,naik2023social} exhibit three major limitations: a narrow range of domains, overly simplistic input prompt structures, and a limited set of attributes.
To address these shortcomings, we propose a holistic bias evaluation benchmark \data (in Section \ref{sec:data}) that encompasses a wider array of domains, prompt structures, and sensitive attributes compared to previous benchmarks. Our experiments reveal that while state of the art bias-mitigation approaches excel in widely used bias evaluation benchmarks (e.g., Stable Bias \cite{luccioni2023stable}), their performance drop significantly in \data, proving the rigor of the \data dataset (\Cref{sec:bias-eval-pf-fairgen}). %

We evaluate \method against several state of the art baselines on the \data and Stable Bias datasets and find that \method outperforms all baselines in both datasets in bias reduction and quality preservation. In summary, our major contributions and findings are as follows -- \textbf{(a)} We define the novel problem of generating images by adhering to a target fair distribution of attributes. \textbf{(b)} We propose \method, a novel inference time approach for generating high quality images by adhering to the target distribution of attributes. \textbf{(c)} We propose \data, a novel and comprehensive benchmark for assessing bias in diffusion models. \textbf{(d)} Extensive experimental evaluations show that \method outperforms SOTA bias-mitigation methods in terms of bias reduction and demonstrates greater effectiveness in scenarios involving the interplay of multiple attributes (\Cref{tab:exp_main}). \textbf{(e)} \method provides an adaptable mechanism for controlling generation distributions at different target distribution levels compared to SOTA methods (Tables \ref{tab:different_target_dist}).











\section{\method}
\label{sec:method}



We first introduce our fair diffusion model generation pipeline \method in \Cref{subsec:over}, which consists of a latent guidance module and an indicator guidance module. In \Cref{subsec:model}, we describe the functionality and training process of the latent guidance module, which generates adaptive guidance for specific attributes in the latent space. \Cref{subsec:model2} details the indicator guidance module, which produces scalar guidance directions to enforce attribute values and achieve the target generation distribution.




\subsection{Overview of \method}
\label{subsec:over}
In this paper, we study the problem of generating high quality images by preserving a target distribution of different attributes present in the image (e.g., generating images of males and females with equal probability with a particular occupation). Existing bias mitigation methods using prompt intervention tend to degrade generation quality due to modification of the input prompts \citep{bakr2023hrs,lee2024holistic,cui2023holistic,wan2024male,wan2024survey,luccioni2023stable,naik2023social} and finetuning-based methods \citep{orgad2023editing,shen2023finetuning,zhang2023iti} degrade image quality due to fitting to subdomains. We experimentally verify this phenomenon in such approaches in Section \ref{sec:bias-eval-pf-fairgen}. Moreover, finetuning based approaches require additional training to adapt to different target distribution of attributes. Therefore, we propose \method to impose fair generations via guidance in diffusion latent space and to flexibly control the target generation distributions at inference time.




In order to control the distribution of an attribute over several inferences of the model, we regulate the attribute values on individual generations. Specifically, if we can control the attribute value of each generated instance, we should also be able to shape the overall distribution of that attribute in the outputs by leveraging the generation statistics over all previous generations. Our insight is that, in diffusion models, attribute control for each instance can be achieved by modifying the estimated diffusion noise during the sampling process. The \textit{diffusion noise direction} steers the generation towards high-density regions containing realistic images aligned to input prompts. Additionally, we introduce an \textit{attribute guidance direction} to steer the generation towards regions with the target attributes, while preserving the generation quality. Further, we leverage a \textit{memory module} to control the generation statistics of the attributes. 



Formally, at diffusion sampling step $t$, the \textit{diffusion noise direction} $\bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c})$ is given by a noise estimation network $\epsilon_\theta$, parameterized by $\theta$, and conditioned on the latent state $\bm{x}_t$ at step $t$ and the input prompt $\bm{c}$.
The \textit{attribute guidance direction} consists of two components:  
(1) a \textit{scalar guidance direction} $I(\bm{c}, \mathcal{M}, (a_1, a_2)) \in \{-1,1\}$, which depends on the input prompt $\bm{c}$, an auxiliary memory module $\mathcal{M}$ containing generation statistics, and the potential attribute values for manipulation $a_1, a_2$ (assuming binary value attribute for brevity here); and  
(2) an \textit{adaptive latent guidance direction} $f_{\text{ALD}}(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}, (a_1,a_2))$, produced by a trained guidance network $f_{\text{ALD}}$, which depends on the latent state $\bm{x}_t$, the input prompt $\bm{c}$, and the potential attributes. %
The final \textit{attribute-aware noise direction} is defined as follows.
\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{aligned}
    &\bm{\epsilon}_{\text{\method}}(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c},\gM,(a_1,a_2)) = \gamma * \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}) \\ &+ (1-\gamma) \underbrace{I( \bm{c}, \mathcal{M}, (a_1, a_2))}_{\text{Scalor Guidance Direction}} \cdot \underbrace{f_{\text{ALD}}(\bm{x}_t,  \bm{c}, (a_1,a_2))}_{\text{Adaptive Latent Guidance Direction}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This formulation represents a convex combination of the original diffusion noise direction and the attribute guidance direction, controlled by the parameter $\gamma \in [0,1]$. Here, $\bm{c}$ denotes the input prompt as a textual condition, while $a_1$ and $a_2$ represent two feasible attribute values (e.g., ``male'' and ``female'' for the gender attribute). 


The scalar guidance direction $I( \bm{c}, \mathcal{M}, (a_1, a_2))$ acts as an indicator guidance model that determines the scalar for the guidance direction (e.g., assigning $1$ for male guidance and $-1$ for female guidance) based on the memory module $\mathcal{M}$. The adaptive latent guidance direction $f_{\text{ALD}}(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}, (a_1, a_2))$ provides the noise estimate required to modify attribute value $a_1$ towards $a_2$, conditioned on the latent variable $\bm{x}_t$ and the prompt $\bm{c}$.


This formulation extends to multiple multi-dimensional attributes as follows.
\begin{equation}
\small
\begin{aligned}
     &\bm{\epsilon}_{\text{\method}}(\bm{x}_t, t, \bm{c},\gM,(a_1,a_2)) =  \gamma \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, t, \bm{c}) + (1-\gamma) * \\ &  \sum_{\mathcal{A} \in \boldsymbol{\mathcal{A}}} \sum_{a_i, a_j \in \mathcal{A}} \underbrace{I(\bm{c}, \mathcal{M}, (a_i, a_j))}_{\text{Scalar Guidance Direction}} \cdot \underbrace{f_{\text{ALD}}(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}, (a_i,a_j))}_{\text{Adaptive Latent Guidance Direction}}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{A}}$ represents a set of multi-dimensional attributes (e.g., gender, race, age), and $a_i$ and $a_j$ are attribute values within the attribute $\mathcal{A}$. \Cref{fig:pipeline} shows the overview of the proposed method.



\subsection{Adaptive Latent Guidance Module}
\label{subsec:model}

In this section, we explain how \method generates the adaptive latent guidance direction $f_{\text{ALD}}(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}, (a_i,a_j))$, which effectively steers the generation towards the desired attribute space. A straightforward approach is to impose classifier guidance at each time step \cite{NEURIPS2021_49ad23d1}, however, it requires additional training of a high-quality attribute-specific classifier, increasing computational costs. Instead, we adopt a more flexible classifier-free approach. Specifically, we define the adaptive latent guidance direction as the vector difference between the directions toward attributes $a_i$ and $a_j$. This can be formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
     & f_{\text{ALD}}(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}, (a_i,a_j)) = \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, K(\bm{c}, a_i)) \\ &  - \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, K(\bm{c}, a_j))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here, $K(\bm{c}, a_i)$ and $K(\bm{c}, a_j)$ are the \textit{attribute-aware guidance text} derived from the input text prompt and target attribute $a_i$ or $a_j$. For example, if the input prompt $\bm{c}$ is ``A computer programmer works hard in office'', the expected attribute-aware guidance text $K(\bm{c}, \text{female})$ would be ``A female computer programmer works hard in office'' or ``A computer programmer works hard in office. The person is a woman''. 

To effectively generate attribute-aware guidance texts, we train an attribute-aware generator \( L \). Since guidance is required for both attributes \( a_i \) and \( a_j \) simultaneously, we use a single generator \( L \) to produce the corresponding guidance texts \( K(\bm{c}, a_i) \) and \( K(\bm{c}, a_j) \) in parallel.
\begin{equation}
    K(\bm{c}, a_i), K(\bm{c}, a_j) \gets L(\bm{c}, a_i, a_j)
\end{equation}
This paradigm ensures that the attribute-aware guidance prompts \( K(\bm{c}, a_i) \) and \( K(\bm{c}, a_j) \) share similar patterns while differing only in their target attributes. As a result, the corresponding noise predictions \( \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, K(\bm{c}, a_i)) \) and \( \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, K(\bm{c}, a_j)) \) reside in the same space, and their difference aligns orthogonally to the diffusion noise estimate direction \( \bm{\epsilon}_\theta(\bm{x}_t, \bm{c}) \). 
This idea is inspired by findings in multi-task learning, where enforcing orthogonality between task-specific directions has been shown to enhance generalization and improve task adaptation \cite{wang2023orthogonal}. %
We fine-tune an LLM as the attribute-aware generator \( L \) in two steps. 

\textbf{(1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT):} For SFT, we design an attribute editing task for the LLM. As input prompt we provide a sentence (that can be used as a prompt for text-to-image models) and the target attribute to edit in the sentence. Then we instruct the model to generate pair of guidance prompts by editing the attribute values to $a_i$ or $a_j$ in the sentence. SFT is performed on a pretrained LLM using such input-output pairs. %

\textbf{(2) Direct Policy Optimization (DPO):} 
Since SFT only enables the model to generate format-correct guidance prompts, it may not be effective for diffusion model guidance in practice. %
Hence, we further refine \( L \) using a DPO step \cite{rafailov2024direct}. We first generate a collection of output guidance prompts using the SFT endpoint of \( L \) and evaluate them on the validation split of HBE dataset introduced in \Cref{sec:data}. 
Each candidate guidance prompt sampled from SFT endpoint is assigned a utility score which is a convex combination of bias score and image quality score on a surrogate model, Stable Diffusion 2 (details in \Cref{sec:setting}).
Using these rewards, we label the outputs based on the 50\% quantile, distinguishing positive and negative samples and use the positive-negative pairs for performing DPO on $L$. This enables the generator to discern nuanced differences among format-correct guidance prompts, thereby enhancing attribute control and image quality. 







\subsection{Indicator Guidance Module}
\label{subsec:model2}
In this section, we describe how \method generates the scalar guidance direction \( I(\bm{c}, \mathcal{M}, (a_i, a_j)) \in \{+1, -1\} \), which determines the target attribute value to enforce (i.e., \( a_i \) or \( a_j \)). Specifically, it dictates the direction of the current generation, where $+1$ steers towards attribute value \( a_i \) and $-1$ towards attribute value \( a_j \).  
This decision process is adaptively influenced by the input text prompt \( \bm{c} \) and the memory \( \mathcal{M} \), which maintains generation statistics.




\textbf{Baseline Scalar Indicator Direction in a Probabilistic Manner.} Prior bias mitigation methods \citep{bansal2022well, fraser2023diversity, bianchi2023easily, friedrich2023fair} adopt a probabilistic generation paradigm to enforce the target attribute distribution.  
Specifically, if the desired proportion of female-generated samples is \( P_t \), then with probability \( P_t \), the model enforces the female generation in the current round; otherwise, it enforces male generation. 
However, this approach results in the subgroup proportions following a Binomial distribution, leading to high variance, particularly when attribute enforcement is imprecise.

\textbf{Scalar Indicator Direction in \method.}  
We introduce a structured memory module \( \mathcal{M} \) to track the attribute distributions in generated outputs. \( \mathcal{M} \) stores key-value pairs, where the key is the sentence embedding of an input prompt \( \bm{c} \), extracted using a feature extractor \( E \), and the value represents the proportion of each attribute value in past generations (e.g., male vs. female ratios). 

The memory operates within a fixed budget \( B \), storing up to \( B \) clusters. When a new prompt \( \bm{c} \) arrives, its feature representation \( E(\bm{c}) \) is compared against existing clusters. If a match is found (i.e., the \( \ell_2 \) distance is below a threshold \( \tau \)), generation is conditioned on the cluster’s attribute distribution. For example, if the ``computer programmer'' cluster has historically male-dominated outputs, the system may prioritize female generation for balance.  
If no matching cluster exists and space allows, a new cluster is created. When the memory reaches capacity, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) clustering redistributes resources, retaining the most informative clusters.  
































\section{Holistic Bias Evaluation Benchmark}
\label{sec:data}


To fairly evaluate bias in diffusion models, it is essential to ensure that the benchmark is comprehensive and aligns with real-world scenarios. 
However, existing bias evaluation benchmarks suffer from three major limitations -- (1) They predominantly focus on a narrow range of domains by ignoring many crucial ones. For instance, benchmarks like HRS \citep{bakr2023hrs} and PST \citep{wan2024male} primarily assess occupation-based biases, however, do not study some crucial domains such as healthcare, finance, and daily activities. (2) They rely on overly simplistic input prompt structures (e.g., ``Photo portrait of a \texttt{<objective>}''), failing to capture the complexity of real-world user inputs, which often involve nuanced and context-rich descriptions. Benchmarks such as HEIM \citep{lee2024holistic} and StableBias \citep{luccioni2023stable} focus predominantly on basic phrases, offering little challenge in interpreting prompts with more intricate, scenario-based descriptions. (3) Many benchmarks \citep{wan2024male,lee2024holistic} consider only a limited set of sensitive attributes, focusing primarily on gender and race while neglecting other crucial attributes such as age. 
These limitations raise concerns that diffusion models deemed fair by existing benchmarks may still produce unintended biases and stereotypes when deployed in diverse real-world scenarios and user queries.

To address these shortcomings, we introduce the ``Holistic Bias Evaluation Benchmark'' (\data). \data expands the scope of domains, prompt structures, and sensitive attributes beyond existing benchmarks. Specifically, we develop a set of $2000$ prompts covering diverse domains, including occupations, education, healthcare, criminal justice, finance, politics, technology, sports, daily activities, and personality traits. Notably, \data incorporates underexplored domains such as criminal justice, technology, and finance, ensuring a more holistic assessment of bias across societal structures. Additionally, \data features complex prompt structures, including scenario-based descriptions, which provide a more rigorous evaluation compared to static prompts that merely describe individuals (examples in \Cref{app:ex}). Hence, unlike prior benchmarks that rely primarily on simplistic prompts, \data integrates both simple and complex input structures to better reflect real-world user interactions.  

We construct the dataset through the following steps --  
(1) We use the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model to identify key objectives within different domains (e.g., various diseases in healthcare or political positions in the politics domain).  
(2) The same model is then used to generate scenario-based prompts incorporating these objectives. 
(3) We conduct careful human checks to ensure the prompts are of high-quality and diverse.
(4) Finally, we partition the 2,000 prompts into training (40\%), validation (10\%), and test (50\%) sets.  
We provide prompt structure for the above process in \Cref{app:prompt}.

To highlight the advantages of \data over existing benchmarks, we provide a comparative analysis in \Cref{tab:benchmark}, showcasing its broader domain coverage and richer prompt structures. We present examples from the \data benchmark in \Cref{app:ex}.






\section{Experimental Setting}
\label{sec:setting}



\textbf{Evaluation Metrics.} We use the bias score ($B$) to assess the generation bias of diffusion models and the quality score ($Q$) to evaluate the visual quality of generated images. The bias score $B$ quantifies the absolute difference between the actual and target proportions of a specific group in the generated images (e.g., the proportion of generated images of males versus the target proportion). The quality score $Q$ measures how well the generated images align with the user input prompt. Specifically, we compute $Q$ using the CLIP score between the generated images and the corresponding prompt, following \cite{luccioni2023stable}.
More formally, we define the text-to-image model as a mapping $M: \gV \to \gY$, where $\gV$ represents the input text space and $\gY$ denotes the generated image space. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all possible values for a sensitive attribute (e.g., $\mathcal{A} = \{\text{male}, \text{female}\}$ for gender). 
We denote the test set of $N$ input prompts as $\{v_n\}_{n=1}^{N}$, where $v_n \in \gV$. A discriminator $D: \gY \to \gA$ is used to identify the sensitive attributes in the generated images. 
The bias score $B$ is then defined as:
\begin{equation}
    B = \dfrac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \E\left[ \left| \sP\left[D(M(v_n))=a_i\right] - P_t \right| \right]
\end{equation}
Here, $P_t$ is the target proportion of attribute $a_i$.
The probability $\sP[\cdot]$ is estimated by Monte-Carlo methods with $T$ times of sampling ($T=10$ across the evaluations).
In the multi-attribute controlling case, we further take the expectation over the set of sensitive attributes that we want to control.

\textbf{Training the Attribute-Aware Generator \( L \).} We use the training and validation sets of the \data dataset to train Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\footnote{https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2} as \( L \). We use LoRA \citep{hu2021lora} during SFT and DPO.

\textbf{Dataset and Models.} We evaluate \method and other bias mitigation baselines on \data and the Stable Bias \citep{luccioni2023stable} datasets. We consider two text-to-image diffusion models: stable diffusion 2 (SD2) \citep{rombach2022high} and stable diffusion XL (SDXL) \citep{podell2023sdxl}.
We implement the attribute discrimination model $D(\cdot)$ following \citep{luccioni2023stable,bakr2023hrs}, where the attributes are discriminated by question-answering using the vision-language model InstructBLIP-2\footnote{https://huggingface.co/nnpy/Instruct-blip-v2}. We validate the efficacy of $D(\cdot)$ through human evaluation (\Cref{app:meta}).

\section{Results and Ablations}
\label{sec:results-and-ablation}

\subsection{Bias Evaluation of \method}
\label{sec:bias-eval-pf-fairgen}

We compare \method with the following baselines: (1) \textbf{vanilla generation} via classifier-free guidance \citep{nichol2021glide}, (2) \textbf{prompt intervention} \citep{bansal2022well}, (3) \textbf{finetuning-based} method with distribution alignment loss \citep{shen2023finetuning}, and (4) latent intervention-based method \textbf{FairDiffusion} \citep{friedrich2023fair}. 
The prompt intervention methods modify the input prompts with attribute specification and adopt probabilistic generation to achieve target distribution. The finetuning-based methods fine-tune the diffusion model on a fair distribution with distribution-alignment loss. The latent intervention methods impose a static global attribute direction for controlling.


\Cref{tab:exp_main} demonstrates the bias scores $B$ (lower is better) and quality scores $Q$ (higher is better) for \method and the baselines on the \data dataset on two types of text-to-image diffusion models, \textbf{Stable Diffusion 2 (SD2)} and \textbf{Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)}, across sensitive attributes \textit{gender}, \textit{race}, \textit{age}, and \textit{their combination}. Across all sensitive attributes and their combinations, \method consistently achieves the lowest bias scores, indicating its superior ability to mitigate multi-attribute bias \textit{without additional training}. For instance, in case of gender, \method achieves a bias score of $0.231$ for SD2 and $0.267$ for SDXL, significantly outperforming all baselines. Similarly, when considering the combination of gender, race, and age, \method achieves the lowest bias scores of 0.601 on SD2 and 0.658 on SDXL.
Notably, \method also sustains high generation quality in most of the cases compared to the baselines, with $Q$ scores that are competitive with or superior to vanilla generation (soft upper bound for quality scores without any interventions). These results underline \method's ability to balance bias mitigation with image generation quality, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple intersecting sensitive attributes.


We also evaluate the effectiveness of \method and the baselines on the standard Stable Bias \cite{luccioni2023stable} benchmark (for the occupation split and attribute ``gender'') in \Cref{app:stablebias}. First, we observe that \method outperforms all baselines both in bias reduction and quality preservation in Stable Bias. Second, we observe that in Stable Bias, the performance delta of the baselines with vanilla generation is significantly higher compared to their performance delta in HBE. For example, FairDiffusion method results in $34.5\%$ gender bias reduction in the Stable Bias benchmark, however, its gender bias reduction ($2.72\%$) is significantly lower in \data where the prompts are more complex (Table \ref{tab:exp_main}). In contrast, \method achieves significant gender bias reduction in both Stable Bias ($79.95\%$) and \data ($68.52\%$) datasets. This proves that our proposed \method is significantly more robust to prompt complexity compared to the baselines.









\subsection{Effectiveness of \method with Different Target Generation Distributions}
\label{sec:flex}

It is important to note that the target fair generation distribution may not always be perfectly balanced. In different use cases, users may expect their model outputs to follow predefined or real-world distributions. Thus, bias mitigation methods should offer flexibility in controlling generation proportions at predefined levels. To assess this capability, we evaluate \method alongside other strong bias mitigation baselines under various target generation distributions.

The results in \Cref{tab:different_target_dist} demonstrate that \method provides a robust and adaptable mechanism for controlling generation distributions to achieve targeted levels since the average bias is lower than other baselines at all levels.
Specifically, \method demonstrates both the lowest average bias score and the smallest standard deviation, which indicates that it consistently maintains low bias across different target portions. This stability is critical, as it suggests that \method is not only effective at minimizing bias on average but also performs reliably across a wide range of scenarios. In contrast, while the finetune-based approach achieves relatively low bias scores among the baselines, its standard deviation is notably higher than that of \method. This higher variability implies that the finetune-based approach may be less predictable or stable when applied across different target portions. Methods like Vanilla generation and FairDiffusion also exhibit higher standard deviations, indicating a less consistent ability to manage bias across different target proportions.

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:abl_time}
\end{table}

\subsection{\method with Different Diffusion Steps}
\label{subsec:abl_d}
In this part, we explore the impact of diffusion time steps to apply \method guidance on the effectiveness of bias mitigation and generation quality. The results in \Cref{tab:abl_time} demonstrate that applying latent guidance at the early diffusion stage (within the first $25\%$ time steps) does not effectively guide fair generations since later denoising downplays the early guidance, hence, it results in higher bias, however, with higher quality. Applying guidance at a later stage (last 25\% time steps) degrades the alignment between generated images and input text resulting in lower quality. Therefore, we adopt guidance at the intermediate stage (middle 25\% time steps) which ensures a desired balance between bias mitigation and generation quality. 

\subsection{Runtime Analysis and Other Ablations} 
We find that \method leads to marginal runtime overhead compared to the baselines while reducing the bias significantly (\Cref{app:runtime}). We perform an ablation for the SFT and DPO steps for training the attribute-aware generator \( L \) (Appendix \ref{appx:sec:effectiveness-of-sft-dpo}) and find that SFT+DPO version performs the best. We provide visualization examples in \Cref{app:vis}.



\section{Related Work}


\textbf{Bias Evaluation in Diffusion Models.} Evaluation of bias in text-to-image diffusion models has gained much interest recently. Numerous works have studied demographic biases (e.g., gender, race, etc.) in different domains such as occupation, physical characteristics, and so on \citep{bakr2023hrs,lee2024holistic,cui2023holistic,wan2024male,wan2024survey,luccioni2023stable,naik2023social}. These studies focus on constructing attributed prompts (e.g., photo of a \texttt{<objective>}) to probe the text-to-image models for any bias towards a specific attribute value (e.g., towards ``male'' when generating images of engineers). However, current studies overlook many domains such as healthcare, finance, and everyday activities and they rely on simplistic prompts for probing the models, hence, fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world user inputs. We address the two limitations and propose the \data benchmark which covers a broader range of sensitive attributes and domains, sampled from realistic statistical distribution of user prompts and rigorously filtered.   










\textbf{Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models.}
Different approaches have been proposed to mitigate bias in diffusion models, such as by refining model weights \citep{orgad2023editing,shen2023finetuning,zhang2023iti}, intervening input prompts \citep{bansal2022well,fraser2023diversity,bianchi2023easily} or by employing guidance generation to control attributes \cite{friedrich2023fair}. These methods often compromise generation quality and lack flexibility to adapt them to any target distribution that is considered fair. Therefore, we introduce an adaptive latent guidance method that allows for more effective and flexible bias mitigation.





\section{Conclusion}
\method presents a significant advancement in addressing the challenge of generative bias in diffusion models. By integrating adaptive latent guidance with a global memory, \method not only mitigates bias but also maintains high-quality image generation. The dynamic adjustment of latent space attributes and the use of generation statistics make it controllable in multi-attribute scenarios and adaptive to different target distributions. Extensive evaluations and ablations demonstrate \method's superior performance in reducing bias compared to state of the art techniques, while also offering precise and flexible control over targeted distributions. This work paves the way for more socially responsible applications of diffusion models in real-world use cases.

\section*{Limitations}
We identify the following limitations of our work.

\textbf{Privacy Concerns.} FairGen requires storing the embedding of user queries in the global memory module for attribute analysis. This may violate specific privacy terms. However, it is viable to release the privacy agreements or add noises to the query embeddings for maintaining privacy. We leave privacy preservation for the process such as applying differential privacy to certify the privacy of generation process for future work.

\textbf{Initialization of the Memory Module \( \mathcal{M} \).} The initialization of the memory module \( \mathcal{M} \) for the very first generation as described in Section \ref{subsec:model2}, is an open question. Note that, the global generation distribution is maintained aligned to the target distribution through the memory module \( \mathcal{M} \). However, \( \mathcal{M} \) is supposed to be empty during the very first generation. In that case, either the user can decide what should be the target attribute value in the first generation or it can be determined through a coin toss.


\section*{Ethics Statement}
In this paper, we study the problem of generating images using a text-to-image diffusion model by preserving a predefined distribution of target attribute values. Note that, the definition of what is meant by a fair distribution is out of scope for our study, as the definition of a fair distribution may depend on the specific use case. Hence, we propose an approach that enables maintaining any target distribution in text-to-image generation that is considered as fair. 

We presented all experimental details and performed an extensive ablation study to provide the readers an idea about the risks and advantages associated to using our proposed model. As a part of our study, we performed human evaluation where humans were provided with necessary disclaimers and were compensated sufficiently. We provided all details related to the human evaluation in the Appendix. All the datasets and models used in this paper are publicly available and permitted for scientific research.

\section{Preliminaries}

\revise{Score-based diffusion models \citep{song2021maximum} use stochastic differential equations (SDEs). }
The diffusion process $\{\rvx_t\}_{t=0}^T$ is indexed by a continuous time variable $t \in [0,1]$. The diffusion process can be formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diffusion}
    d\rvx = f(\rvx,t)dt + g(t)d\mathbf{w}
\end{equation}
where $f(\rvx,t): \sR^n \mapsto \sR^n$ is the drift coefficient characterizing the shift of the distribution, $g(t)$ is the diffusion coefficient controlling the noise scales, and $\mathbf{w}$ is the standard Wiener process. The reverse process is characterized via the reverse time SDE of \Cref{eq:diffusion}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diffusion_rev}
    d\rvx = [f(\rvx,t) - g(t)^2\nabla_\rvx\log{p_t}(\rvx)]dt + g(t)d\mathbf{w}
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_\rvx\log{p_t}(\rvx)$ is the time-dependent score function that can be approximated with neural networks $\rvs_\theta$ parameterized with $\theta$, which is trained via the score matching loss $\gL_s$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:score_matching}
\footnotesize
    \gL_s = \E_t \left[\lambda(t) \E_{\rvx_t|\rvx_0} \| \rvs_\theta(\rvx_t,t) - \nabla_{\rvx_t}\log(p(\rvx_t|\rvx_0)) \|_2^2 \right]
\end{equation}
where $\lambda: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a weighting function and $t$ is uniformly sampled over $[0,1]$.

Since the SDE formulation in \Cref{eq:diffusion} is typically discretized for numerical computations, we basically consider the discrete process formulation.


\section{Efficacy of Model Judge}
\label{app:meta}
Across the evaluations, we detect the attributes of persons in generated images by performing question-answering with the InstructBLIP-2 model. Specifically, we directly ask the vision-language model to do a classification task for gender, race, or age. In this part, we evaluate the alignment between the model judge and the human judge. Using Amazon Sagemaker GroundTruth platform, we invited Amazon Mechnical Turk workers to annotate the gender, race, and age for $100$ images. For each of the $100$ images, we obtained the labels across different sensitive attributes. We then computed the efficacy of model judge in \Cref{tab:meta}. The results show that model judge by InstructBLIP-2 shows overall desirable attribute detection performance. The human evaluators were compensated according to California minimum hourly pay rate. Demographically, they were English speaking and 18+ in age. They were warned that the generations are from a machine learning model and may contain sensitive or unexpected components.

\section{Additional Evaluations}


\subsection{Evaluation on the Stable Bias Dataset}
\label{app:stablebias}

\Cref{tab:exp1} presents the bias score $B$ and quality score $Q$ for various bias mitigation methods evaluated on the stable bias occupation dataset \citep{luccioni2023stable} for the attribute ``gender''. Among all methods, \method demonstrates the most significant bias reduction, achieving a bias score of 0.160, which is substantially lower than the other baselines. This again indicates its superior performance in mitigating bias in various datasets. While the fine-tune-based method also shows notable bias reduction with a score of 0.392, \method surpasses it by a large margin and is also more flexible to the change of target portions. Additionally, \method maintains a high generation quality score ($Q = 0.297$), which is competitive with vanilla generation ($Q = 0.303$) and higher than most other approaches. This indicates that \method strikes an effective balance between minimizing bias and preserving image quality.

\begin{table}[h]

\end{table}

\subsection{Effectiveness of SFT and DPO}
\label{appx:sec:effectiveness-of-sft-dpo}

During the training of guidance prompt generation model in \Cref{subsec:model}, we leverage a dual-phase mechanism: SFT which imposes attribute-aware prompt generation and DPO which further refines model with fairness generation utility feedback.
In this part, we directly verify the effectiveness of SFT and DPO. We prompt LLM to add attribute specification as a baseline and compare it with \method (SFT) and \method (SFT+DPO).
As shown in \Cref{tab:abl_1}, the baseline LLM prompting achieves a bias score $B$ of 0.203 and a quality score $Q$ of 0.298. When SFT is applied, we observe a reduction in bias to 0.168 while maintaining a similar quality score of 0.299, indicating that SFT benefits LLM capacity for attribute-aware guidance prompt generation. Furthermore, adding DPO to SFT further reduces the bias score to 0.160, while keeping the fairness quality virtually unchanged, suggesting that DPO enhances the model by including additional feedback on quality of guidance prompts, which benefits the model to capture more nuanced correlations between prompt structures and fairness utilities.

      \method (SFT) & 0.168 & 0.299 \\
      \method (SFT+DPO) & 0.160 & 0.297 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}

\subsection{Runtime Analysis}
\label{app:runtime}

\revise{
We also evaluate the runtime of \method and other bias mitigation baselines in both the training phase and inference phase in \Cref{tab:runtime}. As a training-free method, \method induces no training computational costs. In the inference stage, although \method induces $1+2|\mathcal{A}|$ noises estimates in each diffusion step, where $|\mathcal{A}|$ is the number of sensitive attributes, the adaptive guidance is only enforced at a small portion of intermediate diffusion steps (details in \Cref{subsec:abl_d}). Additionally, the noise estimates for different attributes are independent and parallelized in the inference. Therefore, \method only leads to marginal runtime overhead compared to the baselines while mitigating the bias significantly.

\subsection{Visualization Examples}
\label{app:vis}


\revise{
In \Cref{fig}, we present a series of image generations produced by \method, demonstrating its ability to precisely control the gender attribute while maintaining a high level of image fidelity. The figure highlights several key aspects of our model’s capabilities: (1) \method effectively adjusts the gender attribute across all generations, ensuring a balanced distribution between male and female representations. (2) The generated images exhibit high fidelity, preserving fine details in both the subjects and their surrounding environment. This demonstrates the robustness of \method in generating photorealistic images, even under conditions where specific attributes (e.g., gender) are modified. (3) Importantly, \method is able to control gender attributes without intervening with the background elements or scene composition.
