\section{A Unified Framework for Knowledge Distillation and Semi-Supervised Learning (UKDSL)}
\label{sec:method}

In this section, we introduce UKDSL, a Unified Framework for Knowledge Distillation and Semi-Supervised Learning of industrial scale ranking systems, that has been successfully deployed in multi-billion scale industrial settings across various ranking models, serving users at multi-billion scale, across various surfaces, geological locations, clients, and optimize for various events, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind in terms of the scale and efficiency at which it operates. 
In the following, we start by the motivation of the framework, and further detail various modules of UKDSL.


Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques have been proven useful for mitigating the distribution gap between training and serving data, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:related}. 
However, for industrial systems, it is difficult to applied SSL techniques at scale. In our attempts to adopt SSL in industrial-scale systems, we face the following 4 variety and scale challenges:
\newline

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Scale and variety of data 
    \item Scale and variety of model types
    \item Variety of ranking stages
    \item Scale and variety of features
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{6pt}
To tackle these challenges, we proposed the Unified Framework for Knowledge Distillation and Semi-Supervised Learning (UKDSL), a framework that's designed to be flexible and scalable for almost all scenarios in a modern ads delivery system with billions of users. UKDSL has 3 main components: (1) Cross-stage knowledge distillation; (2) Distillation from foundation models; and (3) Semi-supervised feature selection. Figure \ref{fig:ukdsl} shows the components of UKDSL. We describe each of the components in detail in the following sections, and show our results of how they mitigate the cross-stage miscalibration and improve model performance.
