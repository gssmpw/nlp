\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

In multi-stage ads ranking systems, one of the major issues is the inconsistency and miscalibration between early and late-stage models.
In this section, we first analytically show how bias is introduced in ranked items, despite the use of unbiased ranking estimators.
Further, we analyze model calibration in various stages via simulation.
Through this, we uncover inherent miscalibrations in such systems.
We then hypothesize a potential solution to this problem which we empirically validate in Section~\ref{sec:method}.

\subsection{Tackling Miscalibration and Introduced Bias}
In Sections \ref{subsec:introduced_bias} and  \ref{subsec:inherent_miscalibration} we presented two important and fundamental problems that are inherent to multi-stage ranking systems.
In the next section (Section~\ref{sec:method}), we investigate solutions to these two problems via \textit{A Unified Framework for Knowledge Distillation and Semi-Supervised Learning (UKDSL)}.
We present empirical evidence in Section~\ref{subsec:semi_consistency_calib} that shows UKDSL improves calibration, hence addressing the first issue discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:inherent_miscalibration}.
Furthermore, we present our empirical evidence on improving later-stage model's performance via leveraging the foundation models~\cite{bommasani2021opportunities}, which have better performance (e.g, lower prediction variance), hence, according to Eq.~\ref{eq:expeCPM}, will decrease the inherent bias of ranking models.
