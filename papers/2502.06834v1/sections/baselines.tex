\subsection{Baselines}


The experiment comparisons in this manuscript are all compared against the latest production models in a multi-billion-scale industrial ads ranking system, prior to the adoption of UKDSL. 
Our criteria for selecting baselines was to identify models that 1) have been proven to operate effectively at the industry scale; 2) represent the  state-of-the-art ads ranking product models  in the industry.
We consider these production recommendation models to be among the state-of-the-art baselines that meet the above criterion.
