None            & We do not apply any modification to the input speech. Serving as the baseline for comparison.                    \\
White Noise     & Gaussian noise is added at a low amplitude, simulating environmental interference.                               \\
Time Stretching & The audio is randomly stretched by a factor between 0.9 and 1.1, altering the speed without affecting the pitch. \\
Pitch Shifting  & The pitch is randomly shifted by up to Â±2 semitones.
