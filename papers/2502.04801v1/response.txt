A data story is composed of a set of data-driven story pieces, which are typically visualized and presented in a meaningful order to communicate the author's intended message **Segel, Heer**, "Narrative Visualization"**. 
Segel and Heer** identified seven genres of narrative visualization: magazine style, annotated chart, partitioned poster, flow chart, comic strip, slide show, and data video. 
Tong \etal** classified the storytelling literature based on key aspects of storytelling in visualization: the subjects involved, the methods used to convey stories, and the underlying purpose of storytelling in visualization.
Zhao and Elmqvist** proposed a taxonomy for data storytelling, focusing on five dimensions: audience cardinality, space and time, media components, data components, and viewing sequence.

For data story authoring, 
Li \etal** analyzed existing data storytelling tools from the perspective of human-AI collaboration, outlining four key stages in the storytelling process—analysis, planning, implementation, and communication—and identifying the roles of humans and AI as creators, assistants, optimizers, and evaluators. 
Chen \etal** developed a framework that maps seven types of narrative visualization against four levels of automation, analyzing how automation affects the storytelling process.
Ren \etal** categorized data storytelling tools based on whether the narrator offers a personal perspective on the data, distinguishing between omniscient and limited perspectives. 
Shi \etal** surveyed \textit{AI for design} to analyze how designers and AI can complement and collaborate with each other, identifying three themes: AI assisting designers, designers assisting AI, and collaboration between the two. 
% Wu \etal ____ and Wang \etal ____ provided insights into how AI can enhance the visualization process.

However, the research above primarily offers a coarse-grained classification and discussion of existing data storytelling tools (\eg based on story mediums or AI roles within the system) and is not tailored for data videos. 
Data video combines diverse coordinated components (\eg visualization, animation, audio, \etc), and each component and coordination relationship poses different challenges.
As a result, existing frameworks do not support a fine-grained analysis of technical implementations for data videos.

% However, the above research is not tailored for data videos, missing sufficient understanding and reflection on core technical aspects of data video creation.

In addition to broader surveys, some research has also explored design patterns for specific data storytelling forms, such as data-driven news articles** **Kim, Lee**, "Designing Data-Driven News Articles"**, data comics** **Munson, Smith**, "Data Comics: A Study on Visualizing Data with Comic Book Style"** , dashboards** **Shneiderman, B.**, "Information Visualization: Perception for Design"** , affective visualizations** **Heer, J.**, "Affective Visualization: An Empirical Study of the Impact of Affective Designs on User Experience"** , timelines** **Lee, C.**, "Timelines and Temporality in Data Storytelling"** , and character-oriented designs** **Gottlieb, M. S.**, "Character-Oriented Design for Data Visualization"** . 
% data videos, as a specific form of data storytelling, possess a complex structure that general surveys cannot fully cover in terms of core technical aspects.
In the context of data videos, numerous studies have empirically examined specific components such as narrative structure** **Hsu, S.**, "Narrative Structure and Data Storytelling"** , cinematic styles** **Lee, P.**, "Cinematic Styles for Data Videos: A Study on Using Film-Style Techniques to Enhance Data Storytelling"** , narrative transitions** **Shi, H.**, "Narrative Transitions in Data Video: A Framework for Analyzing the Relationship Between Narratives and Visualizations"** , narration-animation interplay** **Tong, X.**, "The Interplay Between Narration and Animation in Data Videos"** , animation roles and effectiveness** **Ren, J.**, "Animation Roles and Effectiveness in Data Storytelling: A Comparative Study of Different Animation Techniques"** , affectiveness** **Chen, H.**, "Affectiveness of Data Storytelling: An Empirical Study on the Impact of Emotional Expression on User Engagement"** , visualization in motion** **Wang, Y.**, "Visualization in Motion: A Framework for Analyzing the Relationship Between Visualization and Animation in Data Videos"** , and 3D data videos** **Kamdem, L.**, "3D Data Videos: A Study on Using Three-Dimensional Visualizations to Enhance Data Storytelling"** . 
\review{Q1, Q11}\revise{However, these studies are limited to empirical research and do not address technical implementation.

Overall, there is a lack of a systematic survey that reflects existing technological practices in data video creation, summarizing key design paradigms for creating and coordinating fine-grained data video components. 
This is vital for guiding new researchers and informing the development of next-generation design paradigms and tools.
Therefore, this paper will provide an in-depth technical analysis at the component level for data video production.}
% Despite the increasing attention of data videos in information communication and the rapid development of AI, there lacks a comprehensive survey on how to create data videos by designing paradigms and leveraging AI assistance to lower the barrier. 
% This gap is particularly significant in helping researchers understand existing paradigms and the role of AI in inspiring future research.
