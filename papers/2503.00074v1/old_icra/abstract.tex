This study proposes a conflict-aware multi-agent global planner (CAMAGP) framework, which consists of a novel heterogeneous map representation, traditional path planning algorithm, and novel heterogeneous graph neural network architecture for multi-agent arrival time estimation. Instead of relying on the structured road infrastructure and historical data to predict the time of arrival, the proposed framework benefits from the total path length and basic structural features, which has better generalization capability. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to predict multi-agent arrival times without any structured road infrastructure. The extensive simulation results illustrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness. Compared to a naive method that does not consider conflict, the best-trained iterative multi-step model improves the overall mean average percentage error by 29.5\%, while the best direct multi-step model improves by 44\%.



% %As the popularity of autonomous mobile robot applications is rising in the industry, conflict-aware multi-agent path planning becomes essential for a smooth and efficient operation of autonomous robots in highly dynamic environments.
% This study proposes a framework for a Conflict Aware Multi-Agent Global Planner (CAMAGP), which combines novel heterogeneous map representation, traditional path-planning algorithms, and a novel heterogeneous graph neural network architecture for multi-agent arrival time estimation. 
% % The proposed framework relies not on historical data but on naive path distance along with the structural features of the path. As a result, the framework does not depend on structured road infrastructure in order to predict the arrival time.
% Contrary to other methods, which rely on structured road infrastructure and historical data to predict the time of arrival, the proposed framework only relies on the total path length and basic structural features, thus making it more general in its application.
% % Since the proposed framework does not rely on historical data but uses naive path distance and structural features of the path, the framework does not depend on a structured road infrastructure to predict the arrival time.
% To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to predict multi-agent arrival times without any structured road infrastructure. 
% Compared to a naive method that does not consider conflict, the best trained iterative multi-step model improves the overall mean average percentage error by 29.5\%, while the best direct multi-step model improves by 44\%.
% The results illustrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.
