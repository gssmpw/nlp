	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from a few examples provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples -- the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated examples. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL. Reinforced ICL uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human examples. Unsupervised ICL removes rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific questions. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases and can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs. Our analysis also reveals the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance.},

	abstract = {We introduce Pixtral 12B, a 12–billion-parameter multimodal language model. Pixtral 12B is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving leading performance on various multimodal benchmarks, surpassing a number of larger models. Unlike many open-source models, Pixtral is also a cutting-edge text model for its size, and does not compromise on natural language performance to excel in multimodal tasks. Pixtral uses a new vision encoder trained from scratch, which allows it to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. This gives users flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Pixtral 12B substanially outperforms other open models of similar sizes (Llama-3.2 11B \& Qwen-2-VL 7B). It also outperforms much larger open models like Llama-3.2 90B while being 7x smaller. We further contribute an open-source benchmark, MM-MT-Bench, for evaluating vision-language models in practical scenarios, and provide detailed analysis and code for standardized evaluation protocols for multimodal LLMs. Pixtral 12B is released under Apache 2.0 license.},

	abstract = {The quality of automatic transcription of heritage documents, whether from printed, manuscripts or audio sources, has a decisive impact on the ability to search and process historical texts. Although significant progress has been made in text recognition (OCR, HTR, ASR), textual materials derived from library and archive collections remain largely erroneous and noisy. Effective post-transcription correction methods are therefore necessary and have been intensively researched for many years. As large language models (LLMs) have recently shown exceptional performances in a variety of text-related tasks, we investigate their ability to amend poor historical transcriptions. We evaluate fourteen foundation language models against various post-correction benchmarks comprising different languages, time periods and document types, as well as different transcription quality and origins. We compare the performance of different model sizes and different prompts of increasing complexity in zero and few-shot settings. Our evaluation shows that LLMs are anything but efficient at this task. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of results allow us to share valuable insights for future work on post-correcting historical texts with LLMs},

	abstract = {The digitisation of historical print media archives is crucial for increasing accessibility to contemporary records. However, the process of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) used to convert physical records to digital text is prone to errors, particularly in the case of newspapers and periodicals due to their complex layouts. This paper introduces Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C), which utilises the infilling and context-adaptive abilities of transformer-based language models (LMs) to improve OCR quality. The study aims to determine if LMs can perform post-OCR correction, improve downstream NLP tasks, and the value of providing the socio-cultural context as part of the correction process. Experiments were conducted using seven LMs on three datasets: the 19th Century Serials Edition (NCSE) and two datasets from the Overproof collection. The results demonstrate that some LMs can significantly reduce error rates, with the top-performing model achieving over a 60\% reduction in character error rate on the NCSE dataset. The OCR improvements extend to downstream tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, with increased Cosine Named Entity Similarity. Furthermore, the study shows that providing socio-cultural context in the prompts improves performance, while misleading prompts lower performance. In addition to the findings, this study releases a dataset of 91 transcribed articles from the NCSE, containing a total of 40 thousand words, to support further research in this area. The findings suggest that CLOCR-C is a promising approach for enhancing the quality of existing digital archives by leveraging the socio-cultural information embedded in the LMs and the text requiring correction.},

	abstract = {OCR errors are common in digitised historical archives significantly affecting their usability and value. Generative Language Models (LMs) have shown potential for correcting these errors using the context provided by the corrupted text and the broader socio-cultural context, a process called Context Leveraging OCR Correction (CLOCR-C). However, getting sufficient training data for fine-tuning such models can prove challenging. This paper shows that fine-tuning a language model on synthetic data using an LM and using a character level Markov corruption process can significantly improve the ability to correct OCR errors. Models trained on synthetic data reduce the character error rate by 55\% and word error rate by 32\% over the base LM and outperform models trained on real data. Key findings include; training on under-corrupted data is better than over-corrupted data; non-uniform character level corruption is better than uniform corruption; More tokens-per-observation outperforms more observations for a fixed token budget. The outputs for this paper are a set of 8 heuristics for training effective CLOCR-C models, a dataset of 11,000 synthetic 19th century newspaper articles and scrambledtext a python library for creating synthetic corrupted data.},

	abstract = {Document pre-trained models and grid-based models have proven to be very effective on various tasks in Document AI. However, for the document layout analysis (DLA) task, existing document pre-trained models, even those pre-trained in a multi-modal fashion, usually rely on either textual features or visual features. Grid-based models for DLA are multi-modality but largely neglect the effect of pre-training. To fully leverage multi-modal information and exploit pre-training techniques to learn better representation for DLA, in this paper, we present VGT, a two-stream Vision Grid Transformer, in which Grid Transformer (GiT) is proposed and pre-trained for 2D token-level and segment-level semantic understanding. Furthermore, a new dataset named D\${\textasciicircum}4\$LA, which is so far the most diverse and detailed manually-annotated benchmark for document layout analysis, is curated and released. Experiment results have illustrated that the proposed VGT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on DLA tasks, e.g. PubLayNet (\$95.7{\textbackslash}\%\$\${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$\$96.2{\textbackslash}\%\$), DocBank (\$79.6{\textbackslash}\%\$\${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$\$84.1{\textbackslash}\%\$), and D\${\textasciicircum}4\$LA (\$67.7{\textbackslash}\%\$\${\textbackslash}rightarrow\$\$68.8{\textbackslash}\%\$).

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety.

While modern document retrieval systems exhibit strong performance on query-to-text matching, they struggle to exploit visual cues efficiently, hindering their performance on practical document retrieval applications such as Retrieval Augmented Generation. To benchmark current systems on visually rich document retrieval, we introduce the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark ViDoRe, composed of various page-level retrieving tasks spanning multiple domains, languages, and settings. The inherent shortcomings of modern systems motivate the introduction of a new retrieval model architecture, ColPali, which leverages the document understanding capabilities of recent Vision Language Models to produce high-quality contextualized embeddings solely from images of document pages. Combined with a late interaction matching mechanism, ColPali largely outperforms modern document retrieval pipelines while being drastically faster and end-to-end trainable.},

	abstract = {Historical document processing (HDP) corresponds to the task of converting the physical-bind form of historical archives into a web-based centrally digitized form for their conservation, preservation, and ubiquitous access. Besides the conservation of these invaluable historical collections, the key agenda is to make these geographically distributed historical repositories available for information mining and retrieval in a web-centralized touchless mode. Being a matter of interest for interdisciplinary scholars, the endeavor has garnered the attention of many researchers resulting in an immense body of the literature dedicated to digitization strategies. The present study first assembles the prevalent tasks essential for HDP into a pipeline and frames an outline for a generic workflow for historical document digitization. Then, it reports the latest task-specific state of the art which gives a brief discourse on the methods and open challenges in handling historical printed and handwritten script images. Next, grounded on various layout attributes, it further talks about the evaluation metrics and datasets available for observational and analytical purposes. The current study is an attempt to trail the contours of undergoing research and its bottlenecks thus, providing readers with a comprehensive view and understanding of existing studies and unfolding the open avenues for the future outlook.},

	abstract = {Self-supervised pre-training techniques have achieved remarkable progress in Document AI. Most multimodal pre-trained models use a masked language modeling objective to learn bidirectional representations on the text modality, but they differ in pre-training objectives for the image modality. This discrepancy adds difficulty to multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we propose {\textbackslash}textbf\{LayoutLMv3\} to pre-train multimodal Transformers for Document AI with unified text and image masking. Additionally, LayoutLMv3 is pre-trained with a word-patch alignment objective to learn cross-modal alignment by predicting whether the corresponding image patch of a text word is masked. The simple unified architecture and training objectives make LayoutLMv3 a general-purpose pre-trained model for both text-centric and image-centric Document AI tasks. Experimental results show that LayoutLMv3 achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in text-centric tasks, including form understanding, receipt understanding, and document visual question answering, but also in image-centric tasks such as document image classification and document layout analysis.

	abstract = {Chomsky and others have very directly claimed that large language models (LLMs) are equally capable of learning languages that are possible and impossible for humans to learn. However, there is very little published experimental evidence to support such a claim. Here, we develop a set of synthetic impossible languages of differing complexity, each designed by systematically altering English data with unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages lie on an impossibility continuum: at one end are languages that are inherently impossible, such as random and irreversible shuffles of English words, and on the other, languages that may not be intuitively impossible but are often considered so in linguistics, particularly those with rules based on counting word positions. We report on a wide range of evaluations to assess the capacity of GPT-2 small models to learn these uncontroversially impossible languages, and crucially, we perform these assessments at various stages throughout training to compare the learning process for each language. Our core finding is that GPT-2 struggles to learn impossible languages when compared to English as a control, challenging the core claim. More importantly, we hope our approach opens up a productive line of inquiry in which different LLM architectures are tested on a variety of impossible languages in an effort to learn more about how LLMs can be used as tools for these cognitive and typological investigations.},

GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales.

Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively. Additionally, as the foundation, Qwen2.5 models have been instrumental in training specialized models such as Qwen2.5-Math, Qwen2.5-Coder, QwQ, and multimodal models.},

With highly complex layouts and mixed scripts, scholarly commentaries are text-heavy documents which remain challenging for state-of-the-art models.

This setting calls for a comparison between textual, visual and hybrid approaches. We therefore assess the performances of two transformers (LayoutLMv3 and RoBERTa) and an objection-detection network (YOLOv5). If results show a clear advantage in favor of the latter, we also list several caveats to this finding. In addition to our experiments, we release a dataset of ca. 300 annotated pages sampled from 19th century commentaries.},

The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra's state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5's long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval ({\textgreater}99\%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professionals on completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75\% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.},

	abstract = {Poor OCR quality continues to be a major obstacle for humanities scholars seeking to make use of digitised primary sources such as historical newspapers. Typical approaches to post-OCR correction employ sequence-to-sequence models for a neural machine translation task, mapping erroneous OCR texts to accurate reference texts. We shift our focus towards the adaptation of generative LLMs for a prompt-based approach. By instruction-tuning Llama 2 and comparing it to a fine-tuned BART on BLN600, a parallel corpus of 19th century British newspaper articles, we demonstrate the potential of a prompt-based approach in detecting and correcting OCR errors, even with limited training data. We achieve a significant enhancement in OCR quality with Llama 2 outperforming BART, achieving a 54.51\% reduction in the character error rate against BART’s 23.30\%. This paves the way for future work leveraging generative LLMs to improve the accessibility and unlock the full potential of historical texts for humanities research.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2409.01704},
	abstract = {Traditional OCR systems (OCR-1.0) are increasingly unable to meet people's usage due to the growing demand for intelligent processing of man-made optical characters. In this paper, we collectively refer to all artificial optical signals (e.g., plain texts, math/molecular formulas, tables, charts, sheet music, and even geometric shapes) as "characters" and propose the General OCR Theory along with an excellent model, namely GOT, to promote the arrival of OCR-2.0. The GOT, with 580M parameters, is a unified, elegant, and end-to-end model, consisting of a high-compression encoder and a long-contexts decoder. As an OCR-2.0 model, GOT can handle all the above "characters" under various OCR tasks. On the input side, the model supports commonly used scene- and document-style images in slice and whole-page styles. On the output side, GOT can generate plain or formatted results (markdown/tikz/smiles/kern) via an easy prompt. Besides, the model enjoys interactive OCR features, i.e., region-level recognition guided by coordinates or colors. Furthermore, we also adapt dynamic resolution and multi-page OCR technologies to GOT for better practicality. In experiments, we provide sufficient results to prove the superiority of our model.},

On this task, vision and semantics of documents, and relations between layout components contribute to the understanding process. Though many works have been proposed to exploit the above information, they show unsatisfactory results. NLP-based methods model layout analysis as a sequence labeling task and show insufficient capabilities in layout modeling. CV-based methods model layout analysis as a detection or segmentation task, but bear limitations of inefficient modality fusion and lack of relation modeling between layout components. To address the above limitations, we propose a unified framework VSR for document layout analysis, combining vision, semantics and relations. VSR supports both NLP-based and CV-based methods. Specifically, we first introduce vision through document image and semantics through text embedding maps. Then, modality-specific visual and semantic features are extracted using a two-stream network, which are adaptively fused to make full use of complementary information. Finally, given component candidates, a relation module based on graph neural network is incorported to model relations between components and output final results. On three popular benchmarks, VSR outperforms previous models by large margins. Code will be released soon.},

	abstract = {Recognizing the layout of unstructured digital documents is an important step when parsing the documents into structured machine-readable format for downstream applications. Deep neural networks that are developed for computer vision have been proven to be an effective method to analyze layout of document images. However, document layout datasets that are currently publicly available are several magnitudes smaller than established computing vision datasets. Models have to be trained by transfer learning from a base model that is pre-trained on a traditional computer vision dataset. In this paper, we develop the PubLayNet dataset for document layout analysis by automatically matching the XML representations and the content of over 1 million PDF articles that are publicly available on PubMed Central. The size of the dataset is comparable to established computer vision datasets, containing over 360 thousand document images, where typical document layout elements are annotated. The experiments demonstrate that deep neural networks trained on PubLayNet accurately recognize the layout of scientific articles. The pre-trained models are also a more effective base mode for transfer learning on a different document domain. We release the dataset (https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet) to support development and evaluation of more advanced models for document layout analysis.},
