Discrete prompts for LLMs have been evaluated for various tasks and applications. For example,  ____ and ____ investigate how sub-optimal prompts affect outputs and ____ study how different prompts influence social bias exhibited by LLMs.

Several techniques have been proposed to optimize discrete prompts. Popular techniques include personas for perspective taking ____, in-context demonstrations to provide application examples ____, and reasoning steps that divide the tasks into sub-tasks ____. In this work, we do not consider single prompting techniques but rather evaluate prompt compositions to take advantage of several techniques. Some related works also explore the effect of combining techniques ____, aiming to find the best composition on average. In contrast, we aim to find the optimal composition on each text.

Among existing approaches to automatic prompt optimization, continuous prompt optimization learns to adjust the latent space ____, whereas several studies generate discrete optimized instructions from task examples, to easier adapt to unseen data ____ or new LLMs ____. Other works focus on iteratively optimizing prompts ____ or predicting the suitability of prompts  ____.
Instead of optimizing the latent space or single techniques, we propose to automatically find optimal prompt compositions for unseen inputs.

Related to the idea of prompt compositions, ____ propose a framework to optimize the use of multiple techniques by training a parameterized model that automatically optimizes the prompt. We do not optimize techniques but learn to predict the optimal composition of techniques for a given setting. We further analyze the importance of each technique using Shapley values.

While several other studies aim to detect social bias in text corpora ____, we aim to identify bias in single text instances, similar to ____, by optimizing prompt compositions.

\hwfigure{approach}{The three steps of our adaptive prompting approach: (1)~Bias labels are collected for all considered prompt compositions. (2)~A model is trained on the collected labels to predict the optimal composition for any given text. (3)~Given an unknown text, the model is applied to predict and use the optimal prompt composition for that text.}

Detecting social bias reliably requires understanding of social language and pragmatics to interpret the implications of text ____. ____ identify seven factors of language (e.g., receiver information) to successfully model social aspects. ____ and ____ design social language benchmarks and find that LLMs are still limited in this regard. In this work, prompt compositions enable the inclusion of social aspects (e.g., receiver information with persona prompts) and can, therefore, provide helpful context for social language tasks.
