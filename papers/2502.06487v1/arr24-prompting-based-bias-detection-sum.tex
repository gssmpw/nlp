\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced the notion of prompt compositions, that is, combining multiple prompting techniques to improve LLM performance. We have further proposed an adaptive prompting model that learns to predict optimal prompt compositions ad-hoc, based on the input instance in the context of social bias detection.

Through extensive experiments and a Shapley analysis, we have provided insights into the utility and importance of several prompting techniques for the given task. We find that the benefit of each technique and composition notably depends on the input and the LLM used, highlighting the need for automated systems to optimize prompt. We show that our adaptive prompting approach can improve upon single compositions on selected datasets.

In future work, we seek to work on technique- and task-agnostic approaches to find optimal prompt compositions and do so more efficiently. We hope that our work contributes towards fairer NLP through better social bias detection systems and enables research on using LLMs more efficiently through better prompting techniques.
