Motivated by traditional semantic parsing where compositionality is explicitly accounted for by symbolic grammars, we propose a new decoding framework that preserves the expressivity and generality of sequence-to-sequence models while featuring lexicon-style alignments and disentangled information processing. Specifically, we decompose decoding into two phases where an input utterance is first tagged with semantic symbols representing the meaning of individual words, and then a sequence-to-sequence model is used to predict the final meaning representation conditioning on the utterance and the predicted tag sequence. Experimental results on three semantic parsing datasets show that the proposed approach consistently improves compositional generalization across model architectures, domains, and semantic formalisms.",

    abstract = "Answering natural language questions on knowledge graphs (KGQA) remains a great challenge in terms of understanding complex questions via multi-hop reasoning. Previous efforts usually exploit large-scale entity-related text corpus or knowledge graph (KG) embeddings as auxiliary information to facilitate answer selection. However, the rich semantics implied in off-the-shelf relation paths between entities is far from well explored. This paper proposes improving multi-hop KGQA by exploiting relation paths{'} hybrid semantics. Specifically, we integrate explicit textual information and implicit KG structural features of relation paths based on a novel rotate-and-scale entity link prediction framework. Extensive experiments on three existing KGQA datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially in multi-hop scenarios. Further investigation confirms our method{'}s systematical coordination between questions and relation paths to identify answer entities.",

  abstract = {The role of Question Answering is central to the fulfillment of the Semantic Web. Recently, several approaches relying on artificial neural networks have been proposed to tackle the problem of question answering over knowledge graphs. Such techniques are however known to be data-hungry and the creation of training sets requires a substantial manual effort. We thus introduce DBNQA, a comprehensive dataset of 894,499 pairs of questions and SPARQL queries based on templates which are specifically designed on the DBpedia knowledge base. We show how the method used to generate our dataset can be easily reused for other purposes. We report the successful adoption of DBNQA in an experimental phase  and  present  how  it  compares  with  existing  question-answering corpora.},
