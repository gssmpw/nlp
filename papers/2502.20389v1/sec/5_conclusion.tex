\section{Conclusion}
We present \model, a model-agnostic pipeline for training 3D VLG models without 3D supervision by leveraging Gaussian Splatting and 2D foundation models.
Beyond enabling zero-shot 3D grounding, \model\ significantly improves downstream performance when fine-tuned with limited 3D data. It also scales effectively, benefiting from larger datasets and stronger 2D foundation models, suggesting continuous improvements with increased data.
Limitations and future directions are discussed in the Appendix.
