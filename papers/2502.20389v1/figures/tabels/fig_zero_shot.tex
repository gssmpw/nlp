    \caption{\textbf{Zero-Shot 3D Segmentation.}
    Trained using only 2D pseudo-labels, \model\ can localize objects in 3D from real text inputs in a zero-shot manner. From left to right, we visualize the \emph{input point clouds}, \emph{segmented 3D masks}(in yellow), \emph{rendered images from predicted 3DGS}, and \emph{rendered segmentation masks}. Language queries include both high-level abstract concepts (e.g., \emph{white}) and detailed descriptions (e.g., \emph{black cabinet near the wall}).
