\section{Conclusions}
In this paper we presented new results regarding the complexity of the Drone Delivery Problem (DDT). For DDT on a line, we prove that the problem remains NP-hard when agents are restricted to two different speeds.  For DDT on a grid graph,
We demonstrate that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within 
$O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ without initial positions for agents with rectangular movement areas and two speeds, while also presenting an $O(n)$-approximation algorithm. 
%we show that the problem is even NP-hard to approximate within $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ without initial positions for agents with rectangular movement areas and with two speeds as well as presenting an $O(n)$ approximation algorithm.} 
Prior work by Erlebach et al.~\cite{erlebach:drones} demonstrates that the DDT problem in a general graph is APX-hard. Our results extend this understanding by addressing the case of two speeds on a line and on a unit grid graph, both with and without initial positions.  
%without initial positions for rectangular movement areas and two speeds as well as for arbitrary movement areas and a single speed the problem is NP-hard and even inapproximable. 
%In the initial position setting the NP-hardness on the grid for both cases can be transferred. 
Our findings may inspire further exploration into the complexity of collaborative routing problems and potentially completely different fields of research, such as  covering problems.

% Our hardness proof for the grid could potentially demonstrate an inapproximability ratio, aligning with the general graph setting that also possesses a tight approximation algorithm. 
One limitation of our study is the absence of research into polynomial-time constant approximation algorithms for DDT on a path graph. This gap opens a promising avenue for future research, particularly in both scenarios, with and without initial positions, where the NP-hardness of the latter remains unresolved. It is also of interest to explore subinterval covering problems. %\simon{What are subinterval covering problems exactly? isnt this the same as DDT on a line without initial positions}

%We leave open any polynomial time constant approximation algorithms for DDT on a line. Regarding this, it might be interesting to consider the setting with and without initial positions. For the setting without initial positions it not even clear whether or not the problem is NP-hard.
