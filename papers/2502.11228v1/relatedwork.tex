\parhead{Question answering.} There are three main approaches to QA: non-retrieval-based methods~\citep{petroni2019language}, single-step RAG~\citep{lewis2020retrieval}, and multi-step RAG~\citep{asai2023self}. Non-retrieval-based QA methods pass queries directly to an LLM and use its generated output as the answer, without consulting external sources. While efficient, these methods struggle with queries requiring external or up-to-date information and suffer from hallucinations on out-of-distribution queries~\citep{shuster2021retrieval}. Single-step RAG methods integrate external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia). These methods improve factual accuracy but are limited by retrieval noise and perform poorly in complex reasoning tasks~\citep{trivedi2022interleaving}. Multi-step RAG methods are designed for complex multi-hop queries~\citep{jeong2024adaptive,asai2023self,tang2024multihop}. 

Recent improvements in multi-hop QA focus on question decomposition~\citep{radhakrishnan2023question}, chain-of-thought reasoning~\citep{wei2022chain,liu2024much}, and iterative retrieval~\citep{jeong2024adaptive,shao2023enhancing,yu2024auto}. Methods like ReCite~\citep{sun2022recitation} and IRCoT~\citep{trivedi2022interleaving} refine retrieval with progressive reasoning, while Self-RAG~\citep{asai2023self} adapts retrieval strategies based on query complexity. Decomposed prompting~\citep{khot2022decomposed} further enhances retrieval for complex queries~\citep{zhang2024accelerating}. MultiHop-RAG~\citep{tang2024multihop} integrates decomposition and retrieval pipelines but remains constrained by the redundancy issue caused by relevance-based retrieval.  

\parhead{Vendi scoring.} The Vendi Score (VS)~\citep{friedman2023vendi} is a similarity-based diversity metric applied in machine learning~\citep{berns2023towards, pasarkar2023cousins, mousavi4924208vsi, nguyen2024quality, kannen2024beyond, jalali2024conditional, askari2024improving, rezaei2025alpha, bhardwaj2025robust}, chemistry~\citep{pasarkar2023vendi}, materials science~\citep{liu2024diversity}, and biology~\citep{pasarkar2025vendiscope}. Vendi-RAG integrates VS into retrieval, balancing diversity and quality beyond conventional ranking systems~\citep{carbonell1998use, slivkins2010learning}. Unlike standard relevance-based retrieval~\citep{guu2020retrieval}, this approach enhances robustness and accuracy in multi-hop QA by incorporating semantic diversity into document retrieval.
