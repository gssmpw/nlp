\begin{abstract}
The goal of conversational product search (CPS) is to develop an intelligent, chat-based shopping assistant that can directly interact with customers to understand shopping intents, ask clarification questions, and find relevant products. However, training such assistants is hindered mainly due to the lack of reliable and large-scale datasets. %Prior studies of CPS are often limited to a very restricted domain (e.g., movie recommendation), or rely on synthetic templates. One alternative is to crowd source high-quality conversations, but this is a nontrivial task given the data noise and steep costs involved.
% interact with a chat-based shopping agent to obtain product recommendations by narrowing down product requirements through dialogue based search. %Prior work on CPS has significant shortcomings. 
%Despite great potential, the development of CPS agents has been challenging. 
Prior human-annotated CPS datasets are extremely small in size and lack integration with real-world product search systems. %Prior studies on CPS focused on representation learning, where the conversations are primarily template-based, lack a natural flow, and are often restricted to fixed domains. %It is also unclear how to extend existing data generation models to a new product domain since these models are usually trained with a fixed dataset. 
We propose a novel approach, \method, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic and natural conversations for different shopping domains. \method's novelty lies in grounding the generation to dialogue plans, which are product search trajectories predicted from a decision tree model, that guarantees relevant product discovery in the shortest number of search conditions. 
% collect the first ever large-scale, human-like, target-oriented CPS dataset, called \textit{Wizard-of-Shopping (WoS)}.
% There are three major challenges involved: (1) %Since LLMs are not directly trained with a product catalog, they do not have direct access to product metadata. 
% (1) LLMs are not directly trained with product catalogs and product metadata;
% (2) %LLMs struggle with how and when to ask effective clarification questions to assist customers in quickly discovering their desired products.
% LLMs do not understand when and how to ask clarification questions during search; and (3) %it is unclear how to model customer preferences without real-world shopping data. 
% LLMs can't personalize product searches based on different real-world user preferences. 
% To tackle these, we create dialogue plans that ground LLMs to generate product search conversations, by leveraging decision tree models to select product attributes that uncover the target products.
%we propose a novel \textbf{T}arget-oriented e-comme\textbf{R}ce di\textbf{A}logue generation approach with de\textbf{C}ision tr\textbf{E}e b\textbf{R}anching (\method). 
%It first samples product features to construct a user profile, by capturing elements that customers may or may not desire. Then, a conversation plan is created by selecting product attributes via interpretable decision tree models that are relevant to the target products. These plans are finally used to ground LLMs to generate product search conversations. %prompting techniques, we leverage the chosen attributes to ground LLM-generated conversations to the product catalog. This ensures the successful discovery of target products by the end of the conversations between users and LLMs. 
%We claim that our approach is domain-agnostic, and h
%Our main contributions are: (1) proposing a CPS approach, \method, that can generalize across different shopping domains; (2) 
We also release the first target-oriented CPS dataset \textit{Wizard of Shopping (WoS)}, containing highly natural and coherent conversations (3.6k) from three shopping domains. Finally, we demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of \textit{WoS} via human evaluations and downstream tasks.

% Human evaluations demonstrate that our generated conversations are highly natural and coherent. We further demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset by using it to train downstream conversational query generators and conversational product ranker models, that significantly outperform baselines.
