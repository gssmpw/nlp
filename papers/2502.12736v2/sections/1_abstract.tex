In wireless networks with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), edge intelligence~(EI) is expected to be developed at edge devices~(ED) for sensing user activities based on channel state information~(CSI).
However, due to the CSI being highly specific to users' characteristics, the CSI-activity relationship is notoriously domain dependent, essentially demanding EI to learn sufficient datasets from various domains in order to gain cross-domain sensing capability.
This poses a crucial challenge owing to the EDs' limited resources, for which storing datasets across all domains will be a significant burden.
In this paper, we propose the \emph{\name} framework, enabling the EI to continually learn-then-discard each incoming dataset, while remaining resilient to catastrophic forgetting.
We design a transformer-based discriminator for handling sequences of noisy and nonequispaced CSI samples.
Besides, we propose a distilled core-set based knowledge retention method with robustness-enhanced optimization to train the discriminator, preserving its performance for previous domains while preventing future forgetting.
Experimental evaluations show that \name achieves 89\% of performance compared to cumulative training while consuming only 3\% of its memory, mitigating forgetting by 79\%.
