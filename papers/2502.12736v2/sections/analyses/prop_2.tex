\begin{proposition}\emph{(Efficacy of CSI Preprocessing)}
    \label{prop_2_x_data}
    Assume that the UD is in proximity to its user, and that the channel gain of static paths is much larger than that of dynamic paths because of line-of-sight transmission over the static paths.
    For an arbitrary Tx antenna and subcarrier, denote the difference of the pre-processed CSI in~\eqref{equ_x_data} by $\Delta x_{r}[n] = x_{r}[n]-x_{r}[n-1]$. 
    Then, based on~\eqref{equ_csi}, it can be derived that the following relationship holds approximately:
    \beq
    \label{equ_efficacy_x}
    \Delta x_r[n] \propto \Delta h_{\rU, r}[n] + \beta_r \overline{\Delta h_{\rU,1}}[n], 
    \eeq
    where $\Delta h_{U,r}[n]=h_{U,r}[n]-h_{U,r}[n\!-\!1]$ denote the difference of the channel gain at the $r$-th Rx antenna associated with the user's movements, and $\beta_r = h_{\rstatic,r}/\overline{h_{\rstatic,1}}$ with $h_{\rstatic,r}$ being the static channel gain at the $r$-th Rx antenna. 
\end{proposition}
