\begin{corollary}
\label{corollary_1}
Denote by $h$ the channel gain for a single scattering path as defined in~\eqref{equ_user_gain}.
In addition, denote the distance between the UD's Tx antenna to the scattering point by $d$.
Then, the influence of $d$ on the relative variation rate of $h$ is inversely proportional to $d$, i.e.,
\beq
\label{equ_pos_influence}
\frac{\partial }{\partial d}\Big(\Big| \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}\Big|\Big) /  \Big| \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}\Big|\approx -\frac{1}{d}.
\eeq
\end{corollary}
\begin{IEEEproof}
Eqn.~\eqref{equ_pos_influence} can be derived by first taking partial derivative of $d$ on the root of~\cite[Eqn. (4)]{Hu2023Mobicom_Muse} and then calculating the relative ratio.
\end{IEEEproof}
