\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclu}

This paper has proposed the \name framework to enable cross-domain continual learning for EI in wireless ISAC networks to handle discriminative tasks.
First, we have modeled the CSI data and analyzed its domain specificity.
Given the limited memory and computational resources of EDs, which cannot support joint re-training on all domain datasets, \name reformulates cross-domain continual learning as a sequential training problem.
We have designed a novel efficient algorithm to solve this problem, integrating the transformer-based discriminator for CSI sequences, knowledge retention through replaying distilled core-sets selected by hybrid clustering and herding, and robustness-enhanced optimization to mitigate accuracy decline due to parameter deviations.
On a real-world ISAC HAR dataset, we have validated that \name mitigates the accuracy decline due to catastrophic forgetting by $79\%$, achieving $89\%$ of the cross-domain training performance while using only $3\%$ of memory of the cumulative training.
