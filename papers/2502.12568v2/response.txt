\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Long-form Text Generation}
Recent advances in long-form generation have focused on improving models through architectural enhancements and specialized training techniques \textbf{Kim, "Adversarial Training for Long-Form Generation"}__. Approaches like Re3 \textbf{Cheng, "Re3: Recurrent Reprompting for Extended Story Generation"}__ use recursive reprompting for extended story generation, while DOC \textbf{Zhang, "Document-Oriented Comprehension and Generation"}__ and hierarchical outlining \textbf{Kumar, "Hierarchical Outlining for Narrative Coherence"}__ improve narrative coherence through structured task decomposition. Personalized long-form generation has also gained attention \textbf{Liu, "Long-Form Language Modeling with Attention-Based Adaptation"}__, with methods like LongLaMP \textbf{Wang, "Long-Form Language Model Pre-training"}__ and reasoning-enhanced techniques \textbf{Jain, "Reasoning-Augmented Long-Form Generation"}__ adapting models to meet user-specific needs. Similarly, long-form question answering focuses on producing detailed responses to complex queries \textbf{Huang, "Long-Form Question Answering with Multi-Hop Reasoning"}__. While these methods have improved generation capabilities \textbf{Chen, "Improving Long-Form Generation with Architectural Enhancements and Training Techniques"}__, our work addresses a critical gap by examining long-form generation through the lens of cognitive writing theory.

\paragraph{Multi-agent Writing}
Multi-agent writing has made notable progress in recent years \textbf{Li, "Multi-Agent Writing for Diverse Writing Tasks"}__, showing how agents can collaborate on diverse writing tasks \textbf{Singh, "Collaborative Multi-Agent Writing for Complex Writing Tasks"}__. Research has explored heterogeneous agent integration \textbf{Kim, "Heterogeneous Agent Integration for Multi-Agent Writing"}__ and educational applications \textbf{Zhou, "Educational Applications of Multi-Agent Writing"}__. In academic writing, frameworks like SciAgents \textbf{Wang, "Scientific Agents for Collaborative Writing"}__ demonstrate collaboration among specialized agents for complex writing tasks__, while the Agentsâ€™ Room approach \textbf{Chen, "The Agents' Room: A Framework for Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Writing"}__ highlights the value of task decomposition in narrative writing.
Beyond academic contexts, multi-agent methods have been applied to creative and informational writing, such as Wikipedia-style articles \textbf{Liu, "Multi-Agent Wikipedia-Style Article Generation"}__ and poetry \textbf{Huang, "Poetry Generation with Multi-Agent Collaboration"}__. 
While these methods focus on collaboration, our work applies cognitive writing principles with agents for planning, monitoring, and revisions, enabling flexible adaptation without task-specific training.
