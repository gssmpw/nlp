\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we introduce \DATASETNAME{}, a novel dataset for SAG from recorded *ACL conference talks. By releasing this dataset under an open license, we hope to foster further advancements in SAG research and encourage the development of more effective models and evaluation techniques. 
Future work could explore the integration of the video content provided in the corpus, offering an additional modality for enriching the generation process and further improving abstract quality.
