\section{Limitations}\label{sec:limitaitons}
While the current study provides a new resource and offers valuable insights about the SAG task, two main limitations should be noted:

\begin{itemize} 
\item The analysis focused on the 
speech-to-text abstract generation task. However, our dataset also provides 
access to the corresponding videos, which were not utilized here. Future research could explore the integration of video content as an additional modality to enhance the generation process and improve the quality of the abstracts. 
\item The human evaluation was limited in scope, involving only a small set of models and samples. Future work could expand this evaluation to include more models and a larger number of samples to better assess the performance of different metrics and determine which is most effective in various contexts. 
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Potential Risks} 
Generating automatic summaries for scientific talks carries the risk that automatic summaries may misrepresent key findings or lack scientific accuracy. However, we hope that by providing more high-quality training data, summarization models can be improved and lead to more reliable and accurate summaries.
