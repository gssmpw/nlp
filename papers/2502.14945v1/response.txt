Surveys on Internet censorship have been published by several authors. We will first summarize the key characteristics of these surveys and then show how our paper improves over these existing surveys.
A fraction of the available surveys discusses (mostly) political aspects of Internet censorship (e.g., **Subramanian, "Internet Censorship: A Survey"**) but we decided to exclude such works due to the technical focus of our paper.

Tab.~\ref{tab:surveycmp:overview} provides an overview of the existing surveys in the field, highlighting their major focus. We compare the Internet protocols covered by the various reviews and censorship detection techniques in Tab.~\ref{tab:surveycmp:techniques}.

In a 2011-survey, Subramanian **Subramanian, "Internet Censorship: A Survey"** summarizes heterogeneous aspects of Internet censorship for selected countries, including circumvention methods. 
%
Aceto and Pescapé **Aceto, Pescapé, "A Comprehensive Survey on Internet Censorship Detection"** provide a comprehensive survey on Internet censorship detection but also cover censorship methodologies. Dated 2015, the survey covers a plethora of fundamental methods for censorship detection %that arose during the first 1.5 decades of the century
but lacks developments of the last ten years. 
%
Tschantz \ea **Tschantz, Eubanks, Juarez, Lee, Narayanan, "Circumvention Methodologies in the Wild"** survey censorship \emph{circumvention} approaches, especially their related evaluation methodology. They further discuss circumvention approaches within the context of real-world censor's known capabilities and conclude that there is a disconnect between the goals of sophisticated circumvention methods and the censor's methods. They present three key reasons for this mismatch, i.e., (i)~that censors focus on the discovery and setup procedure of circumvention channels while circumvention research mostly focuses on the channel itself; (ii) that censors apply cheap passive censorship approaches instead of complex ones; and (iii) that censors try not to risk false blocking while research covers several attacks with collateral damage ____. 
%
In their textbook, Mazurczyk \ea**Mazurczyk, Szaga, "Network Information Hiding Methods and Countermeasures"** discuss network information hiding methods, including network steganography and traffic obfuscation. Regarding the countermeasures, the work mostly focuses on the detection, elimination, and prevention of covert channels on different levels of the TCP/IP stack, including specific covert channel/circumvention tools. 
%
Khattak \ea**Khattak, Ali, Khan, "Survey on Censorship Circumvention Systems: A Systematic Review"** survey censorship-resistant communication tools both from practical and theoretical viewpoints. 
% tools from both, practice and academia. We included this survey as it also covers some aspects of censorship methodology. 
%
A 2017-survey by Zittrain \ea **Zittrain, Benkler, "Censorship and Surveillance in the Digital Age"** conducts a comparison of censorship on different nations and also investigates the impact of HTTPS on Internet censorship. 
%
While not a survey \emph{per se}, Niaki \ea provide an overview of several censorship measurement methods employed by \emph{ICLAB} **Niaki, Li, Zhang, "Censorship Measurement Methods Employed by ICLAB"**, featuring approaches for prominent communication protocols. 
%
Ververis \ea conduct a cross-country comparison of Internet censorship **Ververis, Patel, "Cross-Country Comparison of Internet Censorship"**. Their survey focuses on France, Turkey, and Iran. 
%
% Caviglione **Caviglione, "Countermeasures for Steganographic Techniques: Trends and Challenges"** surveys countermeasures for steganographic (network covert channel) techniques. His work presents a set of trends and challenges. 
%
Karunanayake \ea **Karunanayake, Khan, Ali, "De-Anonymization Attacks on Tor: A Comprehensive Survey"** provide a comprehensive survey of de-anonymization attacks on Tor. Their work features a well-grounded taxonomy of Tor attacks. 
%
Master and Garman **Master, Garman, "Cross-Sectional Study on Internet Censorship of 70 Countries"** conduct a cross-sectional study on Internet censorship of $70$ countries. They also summarize the applied censorship methods and found that censors still apply filtering methods that are easy to bypass and perform total Internet shutdowns.

%\paragraph*{Comparison to Related Work}
In comparison to the above-mentioned surveys, we do not only provide the most up-to-date coverage of methodology that features the broadest set of network protocols. We also draw links to related disciplines, such as information hiding, and cover main human aspects.
