abstract = {Internet Censorship is a phenomenon that crosses several study fields, from computer networking and computer security to social sciences; together with censorship detection and censorship circumvention it has impact on Internet infrastructure, protocols and user behaviors. Detection of Internet Censorship is the basis for the study of this phenomenon, and recently it has received focus from a technical point of view. Due to the heterogeneity of study fields and approaches, the scientific corpus on these topics is still in need of an overall analysis, based on coherent framework and lexicon to describe the experimented approaches and findings. In this paper we present a survey on Internet Censorship detection. We propose a reference for censoring techniques and a characterization of censoring systems, with definitions of related concepts. Based on the censoring techniques investigated in literature, we propose an analysis and discussion of censorship detection techniques and architectures and we present a chronological synopsis of the literature adopting or introducing them. Then we collect, study, and discuss available tools and platforms for censorship detection, and propose a characterization scheme to analyze and compare them. Finally, we compare and discuss detection architectures, tools and platforms, and we use the results to infer current challenges and for proposing new directions in the field of censorship detection.}

This scheme provides a variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a recipient public key. It also includes three authenticated variants, including one that authenticates possession of a pre-shared key and two optional ones that authenticate possession of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) private key. HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) encryption function. Some authenticated variants may not be supported by all KEMs. We provide instantiations of the scheme using widely used and efficient primitives, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement, HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF), and SHA2.

abstract = {Researchers and censoring regimes have long engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, leading to increasingly sophisticated Internet-scale censorship techniques and methods to evade them. In this paper, we take a drastic departure from the previously manual evade-detect cycle by developing techniques to automate the discovery of censorship evasion strategies. We present Geneva, a novel genetic algorithm that evolves packet-manipulation-based censorship evasion strategies against nation-state level censors. Geneva composes, mutates, and evolves sophisticated strategies out of four basic packet manipulation primitives (drop, tamper headers, duplicate, and fragment). With experiments performed both in-lab and against several real censors (in China, India, and Kazakhstan), we demonstrate that Geneva is able to quickly and independently re-derive most strategies from prior work, and derive novel subspecies and altogether new species of packet manipulation strategies. Moreover, Geneva discovers successful strategies that prior work posited were not effective, and evolves extinct strategies into newly working variants. We analyze the novel strategies Geneva creates to infer previously unknown behavior in censors. Geneva is a first step towards automating censorship evasion; to this end, we have made our code and data publicly available.},

abstract = { Steganography embraces several hiding techniques which spawn across multiple domains. However, the related terminology is not unified among the different domains, such as digital media steganography, text steganography, cyber-physical systems steganography, network steganography (network covert channels), local covert channels, and out-of-band covert channels. To cope with this, a prime attempt has been done in 2015, with the introduction of the so-called hiding patterns, which allow to describe hiding techniques in a more abstract manner. Despite significant enhancements, the main limitation of such a taxonomy is that it only considers the case of network steganography. Therefore, this paper reviews both the terminology and the taxonomy of hiding patterns as to make them more general. Specifically, hiding patterns are split into those that describe the embedding and the representation of hidden data within the cover object. As a first research action, we focus on embedding hiding patterns and we show how they can be applied to multiple domains of steganography instead of being limited to the network scenario. Additionally, we exemplify representation patterns using network steganography. Our pattern collection is available under https://patterns.ztt.hs-worms.de.},

The proposed design is evaluated through theoretical, evidence-based, and experimental analysis for the case of NTFS using datasets comprising millions of files. We report a proof-of-concept implementation and confirm that the embedded information is indistinguishable from that of a normal filesystem use. Finally, we discuss the digital forensics analysis implications of this new information-hiding technique.}

abstract="Building automation systems (BAS) are interlinked networks of hardware and software, which monitor and control events in the buildings. One of the data communication protocols used in BAS is Building Automation and Control networking protocol (BACnet) which is an internationally adopted ISO standard for the communication between BAS devices. Although BAS focus on providing safety for inhabitants, decreasing the energy consumption of buildings and reducing their operational cost, their security suffers due to the inherent complexity of the modern day systems. The issues such as monitoring of BAS effectively present a significant challenge, i.e., BAS operators generally possess only partial situation awareness. Especially in large and inter-connected buildings, the operators face the challenge of spotting meaningful incidents within large amounts of simultaneously occurring events, causing the anomalies in the BAS network to go unobserved. In this paper, we present the techniques to analyze and visualize the data for several events from BAS devices in a way that determines the potential importance of such unusual events and helps with the building-security decision making. We implemented these techniques as a mobile (Android) based application for displaying application data and as tools to analyze the communication flows using directed graphs.",

  abstract = {The research discipline of network steganography deals with the hiding of information within network transmissions, e.g. to transfer illicit information in networks with Internet censorship. The last decades of research on network steganography led to more than hundred techniques for hiding data in network transmissions. However, previous research has shown that most of these hiding techniques are either based on the same idea or introduce limited novelty, enabling the application of existing countermeasures. In this paper, we provide a link between the field of creativity and network steganographic research. We propose a framework and a metric to help evaluating the creativity bound to a given hiding technique. This way, we support two sides of the scientific peer review process as both authors and reviewers can use our framework to analyze the novelty and applicability of hiding techniques. At the same time, we contribute to a uniform terminology in network steganography.},

abstract = { Recently, steganographic techniques for hiding data in file system metadata gained focus. Tools for commonly used file systems were published but the exFAT file system did not get much attention – probably because its structure provides only few suitable locations to hide data. In this work we present two approaches to hide data in the exFAT file system. While the first approach is more flexible regarding embedding locations, it is rather fragile and provides a lower embedding rate. The second approach, called exHide, has stricter requirements for embedding, but is rather robust and provides a reasonable embedding rate. We describe the design of both approaches, evaluate them, and discuss their weaknesses and advantages.},

abstract = {Since 2006, Turkmenistan has been listed as one of the few Internet enemies by Reporters without Borders due to its extensively censored Internet and strictly regulated information control policies. Existing reports of filtering in Turkmenistan rely on a handful of vantage points or test a small number of websites. Yet, the country’s poor Internet adoption rates and small population can make more comprehensive measurement challenging. With a population of only six million people and an Internet penetration rate of only 38\%, it is challenging to either recruit in-country volunteers or obtain vantage points to conduct remote network measurements at scale. We present the largest measurement study to date of Turkmenistan’s Web censorship. To do so, we developed TMC, which tests the blocking status of millions of domains across the three foundational protocols of the Web (DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS). Importantly, TMC does not require access to vantage points in the country. We apply TMC to 15.5M domains, our results reveal that Turkmenistan censors more than 122K domains, using different blocklists for each protocol. We also reverse-engineer these censored domains, identifying 6K over-blocking rules causing incidental filtering of more than 5.4M domains. Finally, we use , an open-source censorship evasion tool, to discover five new censorship evasion strategies that can defeat Turkmenistan’s censorship at both transport and application layers. We will publicly release both the data collected by TMC and the code for censorship evasion.},

abstract = {Desiring to control political ideas shared within its borders, China fosters its own domestic Internet communications platforms where it can better enforce its laws and more tightly control political expression. Access to foreign platforms failing to comply with China's requirements on speech restrictions are often wholesale blocked by the country's national firewall. However, some technologies, such as the Web and email, are too universal to wholesale block and are restricted discriminately. While China's restrictions to Web access have been extensively studied, our work provides a look into email censorship in China.In this work, we study censorship on Tencent's QQMail, the most popular email platform in China. We introduce a technique to test whether QQMail automatically censors a message, without requiring control of any Internet endpoints in China or any accounts on the QQMail platform, finding 173 combinations of keywords that trigger automated censorship of multiple political topics. We also discover that some censored keyword combinations have extenuating keyword combinations, any of whose presence disables the corresponding censored combination's censorship. Many of these extenuating terms are as politically sensitive as the censored combinations they are extenuating. We find that the motivation behind such extenuating terms is puzzling, defying easy explanation.},

abstract = {Tor is one of the most popular anonymity networks that allows Internet users to hide their browsing activity. Hiding browsing activity is essential for Internet users to increase their privacy. Only Tor users should know the website they are browsing. However, an attacker can utilise the Website Fingerprinting (WF) attack to identify webpages browsed by Tor users. WF is a significant threat to Internet users' privacy as Tor should conceal the browsed webpages' information. Existing WF studies focused on the investigation to improve the identification capabilities, overlooking the systematic discussion and assessment of existing techniques. In addition, existing surveys and analyses reviewed insufficient variation of WF on Tor techniques. Therefore, this survey paper aims to provide a systematic and thorough review of various WF on Tor techniques. First, we discuss WF on Tor techniques in five primary aspects: threat model, victim target, website realm, traffic feature, and traffic classifier. We analyse and classify the reviewed studies on each WF aspect. The classification facilitates in-depth understanding and comparison between WF on Tor techniques. Furthermore, this paper investigates nine assumptions exercised in WF on Tor: closed-world, sequential browsing, isolated traffic, replicability, traffic parsing, passive webpage, disabled cache, static content, and single webpage. These assumptions limit the WF on Tor's practicality in real-world scenarios. Our analysis and classification indicate that most WF on Tor studies apply these assumptions despite being only suitable in controlled environments or laboratory experiments. In addition, most reviewed studies often lack transparency on the assumptions exercised in their studies, risking misunderstanding the WF on Tor techniques' actual practicality. At the end of this survey, we present WF on Tor taxonomy and highlight 21 WF on Tor research's limitations and gaps with plausible recommendations. We also discuss the WF on Tor studies' contribution category and development phase.}

abstract = {Information leakage is becoming increasingly serious in today’ s network environment. Faced with increasingly forceful network defence strategies, attackers are also constantly trying to steal important information from systems. As for security researchers, the most troublesome way of information stealing is the covert channel. Generally, the covert channel is divided into the covert storage channel (CSC) and the covert timing channel (CTC). For the covert storage channel, there are already many effective methods to detect it. However, the detection of the covert timing channel is still in the research stage. The basis for implementing the covert timing channel is to control the sending time of packets, so most researches about the covert timing channel detection are based on the time interval between packets. Based on this idea, we refer to the method adopted in the researches of the malicious traffic detection and propose a covert timing channel detection method based on the k-NearestNeighbor (kNN) algorithm. This method uses a series of statistics related to the time interval and payload length as features to train a machine learning model and using 10-fold cross-validation to improve model performance. The experiment result proves that the model has a great detection effect, the detection accuracy is 0.96, and the Area Under Curve (AUC) value the model is 0.9737.}

abstract = {Controller Area Network (CAN) is the de-facto standard in-vehicle network system. Despite its wide adoption by automobile manufacturers, the lack of security design makes it vulnerable to attacks. For instance, broadcasting packets without authentication allows the impersonation of electronic control units (ECUs). Prior mitigations, such as message authentication or intrusion detection systems, fail to address the compatibility requirement with legacy ECUs, stealthy and sporadic malicious messaging, or guaranteed attack detection. We propose a novel authentication system called ShadowAuth that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by offering backwardcompatible packet authentication to ECUs without requiring ECU firmware source code. Specifically, our authentication scheme provides transparent CAN packet authentication without modifying existing CAN packet definitions (e.g., J1939) via automatic ECU firmware instrumentation technique to locate CAN packet transmission code, and instrument authentication code based on the CAN packet behavioral transmission patterns. ShadowAuth enables vehicles to detect state-of-the-art CAN attacks, such as busoff and packet injection, responsively within 60ms without false positives. ShadowAuth provides a sound and deployable solution for real-world ECUs.},

Imagine Alice has a training set on an illicit machine learning classification task. Alice wants Bob (a machine learning system) to learn the task. However, sending either the training set or the trained model to Bob can raise suspicion if the communication is monitored. Training set camouflage allows Alice to compute a second training set on a completely different -- and seemingly benign -- classification task. By construction, sending the second training set will not raise suspicion. When Bob applies his standard (public) learning algorithm to the second training set, he approximately recovers the classifier on the original task. Training set camouflage is a novel form of steganography in machine learning. We formulate training set camouflage as a combinatorial bilevel optimization problem and propose solvers based on nonlinear programming and local search. Experiments on real classification tasks demonstrate the feasibility of such camouflage.",

    ABSTRACT={Machine learning (ML) models are applied in an increasing variety of domains. The availability of large amounts of data and computational resources encourages the development of ever more complex and valuable models. These models are considered the intellectual property of the legitimate parties who have trained them, which makes their protection against stealing, illegitimate redistribution, and unauthorized application an urgent need. Digital watermarking presents a strong mechanism for marking model ownership and, thereby, offers protection against those threats. This work presents a taxonomy identifying and analyzing different classes of watermarking schemes for ML models. It introduces a unified threat model to allow structured reasoning on and comparison of the effectiveness of watermarking methods in different scenarios. Furthermore, it systematizes desired security requirements and attacks against ML model watermarking. Based on that framework, representative literature from the field is surveyed to illustrate the taxonomy. Finally, shortcomings and general limitations of existing approaches are discussed, and an outlook on future research directions is given.}

Attackers typically coordinate attack with multiple corrupted devices; defenses often focus on detecting this abnormal communication. We present the first provably-covert channel from a 'covertly-transmitting sensor' to a 'covertly-receiving actuator', interacting only indirectly, via a benign threshold-based controller. The covert devices cannot be practically distinguished from benign devices. The covert traffic is encoded within the output noise of the covertly-transmitting sensor, whose distribution is indistinguishable from that of a benign sensor (with comparable specifications). We evaluated the channel, showing its applicability for signaling and coordinating attacks between the sensor and the actuator. This capability requires to re-evaluate security monitoring and preventing systems in CPS.},

Isolation methods range from firewall devices, to 'data diodes' that only allow one-way communication. In this work we explore a possible threat bypassing existing isolation methods by communicating through the physical process. Specifically, we show how a corrupt actuator in one zone can send covert information to a sensor in a different zone, breaking the isolation. This may allow an attack where the actuator is intentionally malfunctioning, and the sensor is intentionally masking the malfunction. Furthermore, we show that under certain assumptions, such communication can be provably covert. Namely, it cannot be efficiently detected, by current and future detection systems. This has important implications for the design of security and safety mechanisms for critical cyber-physical systems.},

        covert channel for mobile usagethus must be capable of utilizing

        networks and hosts. We present calculation methods for utilizable
        header areas in network protocols, calculations for channel optimization,
        an algorithm to minimize a covert channel's overhead traffic, as
        well as implementation-related solutions for such a mobile environment.
        By minimizing the channel's overhead depending on the set of supported
        protocols between mobile hosts, we also minimize the attention raised
        through the channel's traffic. We also show how existing covert network

abstract = {Deep packet inspection (DPI) technologies provide much-needed visibility and control of network traffic using port-independent protocol identification, where a network flow is labeled with its application-layer protocol based on packet contents. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of a large set of DPI systems from the point of view of protocol misidentification attacks, in which adversaries on the network attempt to force the DPI to mislabel connections. Our approach uses a new cryptographic primitive called format-transforming encryption (FTE), which extends conventional symmetric encryption with the ability to transform the ciphertext into a format of our choosing. We design an FTE-based record layer that can encrypt arbitrary application-layer traffic, and we experimentally show that this forces misidentification for all of the evaluated DPI systems. This set includes a proprietary, enterprise-class DPI system used by large corporations and nation-states. We also show that using FTE as a proxy system incurs no latency overhead and as little as 16\% bandwidth overhead compared to standard SSH tunnels. Finally, we integrate our FTE proxy into the Tor anonymity network and demonstrate that it evades real-world censorship by the Great Firewall of China.},

  abstract = {In the days immediately following the contested June 2009 Presidential election, Iranians attempting to reach news content and social media platforms were subject to unprecedented levels of the degradation, blocking and jamming of communications channels. Rather than shut down networks, which would draw attention and controversy, the government was rumored to have slowed connection speeds to rates that would render the Internet nearly unusable, especially for the consumption and distribution of multimedia content. Since, political upheavals elsewhere have been associated with headlines such as "High usage slows down Internet in Bahrain" and "Syrian Internet slows during Friday protests once again," with further rumors linking poor connectivity with political instability in Myanmar and Tibet. For governments threatened by public expression, the throttling of Internet connectivity appears to be an increasingly preferred and less detectable method of stifling the free flow of information. In order to assess this perceived trend and begin to create systems of accountability and transparency on such practices, we attempt to outline an initial strategy for utilizing a ubiquitious set of network measurements as a monitoring service, then apply such methodology to shed light on the recent history of censorship in Iran.},

  abstract = {Today’s Internet is a massive, distributed network which continues to explode in size as e-commerce and related activities grow. The heterogeneous and largely unregulated structure of the Internet renders tasks such as dynamic routing, optimized service provision, service level verification and detection of anomalous/malicious behavior extremely challenging. The problem is compounded by the fact that one cannot rely on the cooperation of individual servers and routers to aid in the collection of network traffic measurements vital for these tasks. In many ways, network monitoring and inference problems bear a strong resemblance to other “inverse problems” in which key aspects of a system are not directly observable. Familiar signal processing or statistical problems such as tomographic image reconstruction and phylogenetic tree identification have interesting connections to those arising in networking. This article introduces network tomography, a new field which we believe will benefit greatly from the wealth of statistical theory and algorithms. It focuses especially on recent developments in the field including the application of pseudo-likelihood methods and tree estimation formulations.},

  abstract = {Despite the robust structure of the Internet, it is still susceptible to disruptive routing updates that prevent network traffic from reaching its destination. Our research shows that BGP announcements that are associated with disruptive updates tend to occur in groups of relatively high frequency, followed by periods of infrequent activity. We hypothesize that we may use these bursty characteristics to detect anomalous routing incidents. In this work, we use manually verified ground truth metadata and volume of announcements as a baseline measure, and propose a burstiness measure that detects prior anomalous incidents with high recall and better precision than the volume baseline. We quantify the burstiness of inter-arrival times around the date and times of four large-scale incidents: the Indosat hijacking event in April 2014, the Telecom Malaysia leak in June 2015, the Bharti Airtel Ltd. hijack in November 2015, and the MainOne leak in November 2018; and three smaller scale incidents that led to traffic interception: the Belarusian traffic direction in February 2013, the Icelandic traffic direction in July 2013, and the Russian telecom that hijacked financial services in April 2017. Our method leverages the burstiness of disruptive update messages to detect these incidents. We describe limitations, open challenges, and how this method can be used for routing anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {There have been many incidents of prefix hijacking in the Internet. The hijacking AS can blackhole the hijacked traffic. Alternatively, it can transparently intercept the hijacked traffic by forwarding it onto the owner. This paper presents a study of such prefix hijacking and interception with the following contributions: (1). We present a methodology for prefix interception, (2). We estimate the fraction of traffic to any prefix that can be hijacked and intercepted in the Internet today, (3). The interception methodology is implemented and used to intercept real traffic to our prefix, (4). We conduct a detailed study to detect ongoing prefix interception.             We find that: Our hijacking estimates are in line with the impact of past hijacking incidents and show that ASes higher up in the routing hierarchy can hijack a significant amount of traffic to any prefix, including popular prefixes. A less apparent result is that the same holds for prefix interception too. Further, our implementation shows that intercepting traffic to a prefix in the Internet is almost as simple as hijacking it. Finally, while we fail to detect ongoing prefix interception, the detection exercise highlights some of the challenges posed by the prefix interception problem.},

This article analyzes the “Telegram ban” and its ramifications, understanding it as a socio-technical controversy that unveils the tensions between the governmental narrative of a “sovereign Internet” and multiple infrastructure-based battles of resistance, critique and circumvention. We show how, in the context of a Russian Internet which is heavily entwined with and dependent from foreign and global infrastructures, a number of bottom-up, infrastructure-based digital resistances are able to emerge and thrive despite the strategy of effective centralised management that the Russian government seeks to present to the world as its own.},

abstract="Mix networks are a popular mechanism for anonymous Internet communications. By routing IP traffic through an overlay chain of mixes, they aim to hide the relationship between its origin and destination. Using a realistic model of interactive Internet traffic, we study the problem of defending low-latency mix networks against attacks based on correlating inter-packet intervals on two or more links of the mix chain. We investigate several attack models, including an active attack which involves adversarial modification of packet flows in order to ``fingerprint'' them, and analyze the tradeoffs between the amount of cover traffic, extra latency, and anonymity properties of the mix network. We demonstrate that previously proposed defenses are either ineffective, or impose a prohibitively large latency and/or bandwidth overhead on communicating applications. We propose a new defense based on adaptive padding.",

abstract = {Some ISPs and governments (most notably the Great Firewall of China) use DNS injection to block access to "unwanted" websites. The censorship tools inspect DNS queries near the ISP's boundary routers for sensitive domain keywords and inject forged DNS responses, blocking the users from accessing censored sites, such as twitter and facebook. Unfortunately this causes collateral damage, affecting communication beyond the censored networks when outside DNS traffic traverses censored links. In this paper, we analyze the causes of the collateral damages and measure the Internet to identify the injecting activities and their effect. We find 39 ASes in China injecting forged DNS replies. Furthermore, 26 of 43,000 measured open resolvers outside China, distributed in 109 countries, may suffer some collateral damage from these forged replies. Different from previous work that considers the collateral damage being limited to queries to root servers (F, I, J) located in China, we find that most collateral damage arises when the paths between resolvers and some TLD name servers transit through ISPs in China.},

  abstract = {VPN adoption has seen steady growth over the past decade due to increased public awareness of privacy and surveillance threats. In response, certain governments are attempting to restrict VPN access by identifying connections using “dual use” DPI technology. To investigate the potential for VPN blocking, we develop mechanisms for accurately fingerprinting connections using OpenVPN, the most popular protocol for commercial VPN services. We identify three fingerprints based on protocol features such as byte pattern, packet size, and server response. Playing the role of an attacker who controls the network, we design a two-phase framework that performs passive fingerprinting and active probing in sequence. We evaluate our framework in partnership with a million-user ISP and find that we identify over 85\% of OpenVPN flows with only negligible false positives, suggesting that OpenVPN-based services can be effectively blocked with little collateral damage. Although some commercial VPNs implement countermeasures to avoid detection, our framework successfully identified connections to 34 out of 41 “obfuscated” VPN configurations. We discuss the implications of the VPN fingerprintability for different threat models and propose short-term defenses. In the longer term, we urge commercial VPN providers to be more transparent about their obfuscation approaches and to adopt more principled detection countermeasures, such as those developed in censorship circumvention research.}

It's important to identify and classify VPN traffic for network management and security. In this paper, 6 different kinds of VPN traffic are analyzed. Characterizing VPN traffic by Sample Entropy Fingerprint and Payload Length Sequence (PLS) separately, we apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to construct VPN traffic classifiers basing on these features. Comparing with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), Sample Entropy Fingerprint and PLS, our result shows that the classifier based on PLS can achieve accurate VPN traffic classification, including obfuscated VPN traffic.},

Beside used by journalist, activist, and writer as a tool for their freedom of speech, its highly anonymous service is also used by bot-nets, malware, distributed denial of service attacks, hidden services that sells illegal things, spams, and many more. This paper will explain about a TOR usage detection system by using deep packet inspection to extract and analyze its network traffic. The result of the analysis will be used as a parameter for a proxy server to block TOR traffic in the network. Using this network, detection, and blocking design, we can block the Onion Router Traffic originated from TOR browser.},

  abstract = {As the Internet has transformed into a critical infrastructure, society has become more vulnerable to its security flaws. Despite substantial efforts to address many of these vulnerabilities by industry, government, and academia, cyber security attacks continue to increase in intensity, diversity, and impact. Thus, it becomes intuitive to investigate the current cyber security threats, assess the extent to which corresponding defenses have been deployed, and evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation efforts. Addressing these issues in a sound manner requires large-scale empirical data to be collected and analyzed via numerous Internet measurement techniques. Although such measurements can generate comprehensive and reliable insights, doing so encompasses complex procedures involving the development of novel methodologies to ensure accuracy and completeness. Therefore, a systematic examination of recently developed Internet measurement approaches for cyber security must be conducted to enable thorough studies that employ several vantage points, correlate multiple data sources, and potentially leverage past successful techniques for more recent issues. Unfortunately, performing such an examination is challenging, as the literature is highly scattered. In large part, this is due to each research effort only focusing on a small portion of the many constituent parts of the Internet measurement domain. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have offered an in-depth examination of this critical research domain in order to promote future advancements. To bridge these gaps, we explore all pertinent facets of utilizing Internet measurement techniques for cyber security, ranging from threats within specific application domains to threats themselves. We provide a taxonomy of cyber security-related Internet measurement studies across two dimensions. One dimension relates to the many vertical layers (and components) of the Internet ecosystem, while the other relates to internal normal functions vs. the negative impact of external parties in the Internet and physical world. A comprehensive comparison of the gathered studies is also offered in terms of measurement technique, scope, measurement size, vantage size, and the analysis approach that was leveraged. Finally, a discussion of the roadblocks to performing effective Internet measurements and possible future research directions is elaborated.},

  abstract = {The detection of BGP prefix hijacking attacks has been the focus of research for more than a decade. However, the state-of-the-art techniques fall short of detecting more elaborate types of attack. To study such attacks, we devise a novel formalization of Internet routing, and apply this model to routing anomalies in order to establish a comprehensive attacker model. We use this model to precisely classify attacks and to evaluate their impact and detectability. We analyze the eligibility of attack tactics that suit an attacker's goals and demonstrate that related work mostly focuses on less impactful kinds of attacks. We further propose, implement, and test the Hijacking Event Analysis Program (HEAP), a new approach to investigate hijacking alarms. Our approach is designed to seamlessly integrate with the previous work in order to reduce the high rates of false alarms inherent to these techniques. We leverage several unique data sources that can reliably disprove malicious intent. First, we make use of an Internet routing registry to derive business or organizational relationships between the parties involved in an event. Second, we use a topology-based reasoning algorithm to rule out events caused by legitimate operational practice. Finally, we use Internet-wide network scans to identify SSL/TLS-enabled hosts, which helps to identify non-malicious events by comparing public keys prior to and during an event. In our evaluation, we prove the effectiveness of our approach, and show that day-to-day routing anomalies are harmless for the most part. More importantly, we use HEAP to assess the validity of publicly reported alarms. We invite researchers to interface with HEAP in order to crosscheck and narrow down their hijacking alerts.},
