The legal citation were collected by iterating the text of each case or section into chat-gpt-3.5-turbo with the following prompt: "You are an expert legal document analyzer. Your job is to find all references to the Constitution, Case Law, or Statutes in the text." The result was that the LLM acted like a named entity extractor, such that any citations in the text were pulled out in an enumerated list. The citatons mostly included the cases, statutes, and constitution all of New Mexico, but also had references to the United States constitution, New Mexico Administrative Code, and New Mexico Rules Annotated (NMRA). The NMRA had many references to Uniform Jury instructions, rules of criminal proceedings and  civil proceedings.
