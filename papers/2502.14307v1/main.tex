% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

% \section{Ethical Considerations}

%  The results presented in this paper have been disclosed to Intel prior to the conference submission together with the artifacts. As of now, we are waiting for an answer from Intel.
 
%  All the experiments in this work have been conducted in controlled lab servers. Therefore, no live system or third parties have been involved or affected.

%  %In this work, we show how Reinforcement Learning can be used to uncover vulnerabilities in black-box microarchitecture designs. 
%  Given the increasing popularity of AI, both researchers and malicious actors have access to state-of-the-art algorithms and tools. Malicious actors can use these tools to develop exploits without having to reverse engineer the hardware design. However, we believe that open-source development of such automated test systems will accelerate the security research and advance the security of the processors which will do more good than any potential harm to users.

 
% \section{Open Science}
% We will make the custom environment and scripts we developed for $\mu$RL implementation public, together with the data we produced on different hardware platforms and presented in this paper.
