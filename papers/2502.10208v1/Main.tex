\section*{Impact Statement}
% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

This paper presents a scalable supervised graph sparsification method that aims to support large-scale graph machine learning for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
There are many potential societal consequences of our work. Positive consequences include making AI more accessible to smaller organizations and researchers with limited resources, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of AI models. 
%{\color{blue}There are also few potential negative consequences such as bias, fairness, security, and interoperability. }
% There are other potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
