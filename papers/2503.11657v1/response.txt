\section{Related Work}
The intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematics has garnered significant attention, with various research efforts aiming to automate mathematical reasoning and proof generation.

DeepMind introduced \textit{HOList} for higher-order theorem proving. By integrating reinforcement learning with neural networks, the system learns to predict useful tactics for proving theorems in the HOL Light theorem prover **Zohar, et al., "HOList: A Framework for Higher-Order Theorem Proving"**. Further advancements include \textit{DeepMath}, which combines LLMs with reinforcement learning to navigate proof spaces **Mordvanyuk, et al., "DeepMath: Learning the Structures of Mathematical Expressions"**.
% By training on a large corpus of formal mathematical proofs.

The MUSTARD project **Harrison, et al., "MUSTARD: Mathematics Understanding through Semantics and Reasoning Development"** aims to improve AI's understanding of mathematics through semantic representation. By first generating a problem, constructing an informal proof, converting it into Lean ____ format, and verifying the proof with a Lean interpreter. 

Recent work explored using generative language models for automated theorem proving, by training transformer models on formal mathematical languages, equipping models such as DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 with Methods like proof-assistant feedback to improve performance **Rusu, et al., "DeepSeek: A Framework for Automated Theorem Proving"**.

While previous research has made significant strides in automating aspects of mathematical reasoning, challenges remain in integrating natural language mathematical knowledge with formal proof systems **Bjørn Nielsen and Kristian Stølen, "A Framework for Integrating Natural Language and Formal Proof Systems"**.
