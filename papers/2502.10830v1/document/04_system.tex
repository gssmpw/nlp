\section{User Studies Overview}
To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of \theDevice, we conducted two user studies with signers ranging from novice to native/ fluent in ASL proficiency. The first study focused on word-level recognition, assessing the system's ability to accurately recognize individual fingerspelled words across a diverse group of participants. The second study expanded on these findings by examining phrase-level recognition in real-time scenarios, providing insights into the system's performance in more natural, context-rich environments. These studies aimed to validate SpellRing's performance across different levels of signing experience, explore the impact of signing speed and habits on recognition accuracy, and investigate how users adapt to the system in real-time use. The user study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the authors' institution. Participants were compensated \$40 per hour for their participation in the study.
