\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced SpellRing, a smart ring designed to continuously recognize words fingerspelled in ASL using a combination of acoustic sensing and IMU sensors. Our system tracks handshape, movement, and palm orientation, applying a deep learning model with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) for word-level recognition. Through evaluations with 20 ASL signers, including 12 fluent signers and 8 ASL learners, SpellRing achieved promising results, with a top-1 recognition accuracy of 82.45\% and a real-time phrase-level Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.099\%. These results demonstrate the potential of using minimally obtrusive wearable technology for ASL recognition and translation. We also explored the impact of a two-step training model, sensor fusion, and design optimization for improving performance, showing that integrating data from multiple participants significantly enhances recognition accuracy. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, refining hardware, and incorporating more complex ASL signs to create a comprehensive, user-friendly system for Deaf and hard of hearing individuals.
