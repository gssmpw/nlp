\section{Conclusions}

We tackle the problem of generalizable reconstruction of an animatable human avatar from sparse inputs. We propose a feed-forward network featuring iterative updates with iterative feedback and coupled-multi-resolution Gaussians-on-Mesh representation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality. It requires less than 1s for avatar reconstruction and renders at 95 FPS.
