    \caption{\textbf{Main model architecture.} We adopt CLIP as the base module and attach LoRA modules to the visual encoder and visual projection as the plugin module. During all the procedures, only the plugin modules are tuned while the rest are frozen. We get the classification result by comparing the cosine similarity of the visual and text embeddings.}
