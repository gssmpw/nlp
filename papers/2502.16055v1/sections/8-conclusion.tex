\section{Conclusion}
Medical community faces long-standing challenges in integrating decentralized, privacy-se
nsitive data at scale. In this study, we have proposed MedForge as a community-driven approach for medical foundation model development. MedForge enables asynchronous collaboration among multiple institutions to aggregate medical knowledge on various tasks. MegForge allows continuous model updates from separate contributors while effectively protecting the in-house patient data privacy. MedForge reveals strong performance across multiple tasks, including breast cancer, lung cancer subtypes, and colon cancer classification, showing the robustness of merging order and model architecture. These major findings demonstrate the efficiency of MedForge in wide-ranging medical applications toward multi-center performance evaluation.
