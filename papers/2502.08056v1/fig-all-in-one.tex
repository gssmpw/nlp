\mycap{Generation Quality vs Cost/Latency.}{Dashed lines show the Pareto frontier (upper left is better). Cost shown as model API dollar cost for every 1000 requests. Cognify selects models
from GPT-4o-mini and Llama-8B. DSPy and Trace do not support model selection and are given GPT-4o-mini for all steps. Trace results for Text-2-SQL and FinRobot have 0 quality and are not included.}
