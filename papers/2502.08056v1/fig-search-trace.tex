Performed on the HotpotQA workload. Cognify's search results are ordered by iterations from yellow to red colors (up to 128 iterations). Grid search explores the entire 4096 configurations. 
%X-axis represents the execution cost of applying each configuration, Y-axis is the quality score of each configuration.
