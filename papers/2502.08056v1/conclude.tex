\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

This paper formalizes the problem of gen-AI workflow autotuning and outlines the key differences between it and traditional ML autotuning/training. Based on our insights, we proposed an adaptive, hierarchical BO-based optimization algorithm, \search\ and demonstrated its robustness. We presented \sysname, a multi-objective gen-AI workflow autotuning platform we built on top of \search. Our evaluation results show that \sysname\ significantly pushes the Pareto frontier on generation quality, cost, and latency for workflows across a wide range of domains. We also demonstrated the robustness of the \search\ algorithm, allowing \sysname\ to serve as a generic, extensible, open-source gen-AI workflow autotuning platform future researchers and practitioners can leverage.
