\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec6:conclusion}

In this paper, we identify key limitations in existing segmentation attack methods and conduct an in-depth analysis of the underlying causes. Based on these observations, we develop and introduce a novel segmentation attack method, called Feature Similarity Projected Gradient Descent (FSPGD), specifically designed to enhance both attack performance and transferability. The proposed FSPGD method demonstrates notable improvements over conventional methods, not only in terms of attack efficacy but also in transferability across different model architectures. Future work will aim to further optimize the parameter settings of FSPGD to enhance its robustness and adaptability across various model configurations. Additionally, we plan to explore a more automated approach for parameter optimization, which would allow the method to achieve optimal results efficiently across a diverse set of models, thus broadening its applicability in real-world scenarios.

% To validate the superiority of FSPGD, we conduct extensive experiments across various source and target models, including PSPNet-ResNet50, PSPNet-ResNet101, DeepLabv3-ResNet50, DeepLabv3-ResNet101, Segformer, and Mask2former.
