\section{Related Work}
Several lines of research contain methods that share thematically similar ideas in handling multi-scale objects, dynamic sampling, or biologically inspired foveation.
\emph{Deformable Convolutional Networks} \cite{dai2017deformable} and their successors \cite{zhu2019deformable,xiong2024efficient} introduce learnable offsets or selective kernels to better handle varying spatial structures.
\emph{Focal Sparse Convolutional Networks} \cite{chen2022focal} focus computation on salient 3D regions in point clouds. Additionally, biologically inspired foveation has been explored in works like \cite{lukanov2021biologically,kaplanyan2019deepfovea,thavamani2021fovea}.
