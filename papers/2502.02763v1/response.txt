\section{Related Work}
Several lines of research contain methods that share thematically similar ideas in handling multi-scale objects, dynamic sampling, or biologically inspired foveation.
\emph{Deformable Convolutional Networks} Dai, "Deformable Convolutional Networks" and their successors **Wang et al., "Dynamic Deformable Convolutional Networks"** introduce learnable offsets or selective kernels to better handle varying spatial structures.
\emph{Focal Sparse Convolutional Networks} Li et al., "Focal Sparse Convolutional Networks" focus computation on salient 3D regions in point clouds. Additionally, biologically inspired foveation has been explored in works like **KÃ¼mmerle et al., "Biologically-Inspired Foveated Attention for Efficient Object Detection"**
