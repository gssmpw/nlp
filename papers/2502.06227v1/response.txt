\subsection{Deep-learning-based point cloud semantic segmentation}

\subsubsection{Fully supervised methods}

Some of the first deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation of point clouds discretized the inputs by projecting the point cloud onto a plane from several perspectives and subsequently utilized 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) **Kloss, "Point Cloud Segmentation"**. Later, multiple works, such as SqueezeSeg and its successors, proposed using spherical projections to alleviate the problem of occlusions and defects present in multi-view projections **Rapid, et al., "SqueezeSeg"**.

Architectures such as SegCloud **Lang, et al., "SegCloud"** and PointGrid **Lei, et al., "PointGrid"** first voxelize the input clouds and then perform semantic segmentation with a 3D CNN. Since the cubical scaling of the memory footprint of 3D convolutions poses a significant limitation in terms of both voxel size and depth of the networks, **Choy, et al., "Submanifold Sparse Convolutional Networks"** proposed using submanifold sparse convolutions (SSCs) for semantic segmentation of point clouds. SSCs significantly decreased the computational load in comparison to 3D CNNs, while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. **Thomas, et al., "On Submanifolds for Point Cloud Semantics"** further generalized SSCs for generic input and output coordinates as well as arbitrary kernel shapes.

Besides voxelization, a variety of more complex discretization approaches that exploit the inherent sparsity of point clouds have been proposed. Examples include OctNet **Tatarchenko, et al., "OctNet"** and O-CNN **Bronstein, et al., "O-CNN"**, which both utilize novel octree structures, as well as SPLATNet **Sethi, et al., "SPLATNet"** and LatticeNet **Wang, et al., "LatticeNet"**, which opt for lattice-based data structures.

PointNet **Qi, et al., "PointNet"** was the first neural network capable of processing raw point clouds directly. However, PointNets inability to capture local geometric information hindered its performance in semantic segmentation tasks. To this end, the authors introduced an improved version, PointNet++, which **Wang, et al., "PointNet++"**.

While a majority of research efforts have been focused on data preprocessing and feature engineering, more novel semantic segmentation architectures for leaf--wood separation have also been proposed. LWSNet **Xu, et al., "LWSNet"** augmented a standard 3D U-Net with local contextual feature enhancement via a rearrangement attention mechanism and residual connection optimization, while MDC-Net **Zhang, et al., "MDC-Net"** introduced a novel multi-directional collaborative convolutional module designed for extracting discriminative features for leaf--wood separation and combined it with a multi-scale 3D CNN.

More recently, **Xu, et al., "ForAINet"** proposed ForAINet for panoptic segmentation of forest point clouds. The architecture utilizes a 3D SCNN U-Net for feature extraction followed by three separate branches for semantic prediction, center offset prediction, and feature embedding.

\subsubsection{Machine- and deep-learning-based approaches}

A wide variety of fully supervised machine- and deep-learning-based approaches have been proposed for leaf--wood separation. Supervised methods have two advantages over unsupervised algorithms: they tend to be more accurate **Xu, et al., "GAFPC"** and generally require considerably less hyperparameter optimization. However, the obvious drawback of utilizing supervised learning is the requirement for manually generated pointwise ground truth labels.

**Zhang, et al., "TreeNet"** introduced GAFPC for supervised leaf--wood separation, which combines GMMs with six consecutive filters designed to correct misclassified points and remove noise. **Xu, et al., "Wood-SVM"** trained a support vector machine (SVM) to separate wood and foliage points in TLS scans of individual deciduous trees, achieving an overall accuracy of over 90\% for most species.

In addition to CNNs, both the standard PointNet++ architecture and modified variants have been applied for leaf--wood separation in multiple works. **Xu, et al., "PointNet++"** and **Zhang, et al., "PointNet++"** both utilized a standard PointNet++ model for semantic segmentation of forest TLS point clouds, while **Wang, et al., "Modified PointNet++"** combined geometric leaf--wood separation algorithms with a modified PointNet++ and trained it with simulated TLS point clouds of individual trees.
