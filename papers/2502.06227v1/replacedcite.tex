\subsection{Deep-learning-based point cloud semantic segmentation}

\subsubsection{Fully supervised methods}

Some of the first deep learning architectures for semantic segmentation of point clouds discretized the inputs by projecting the point cloud onto a plane from several perspectives and subsequently utilized 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ____. Later, multiple works, such as SqueezeSeg and its successors, proposed using spherical projections to alleviate the problem of occlusions and defects present in multi-view projections ____.

Architectures such as SegCloud ____ and PointGrid ____ first voxelize the input clouds and then perform semantic segmentation with a 3D CNN. Since the cubical scaling of the memory footprint of 3D convolutions poses a significant limitation in terms of both voxel size and depth of the networks, ____ proposed using submanifold sparse convolutions (SSCs) for semantic segmentation of point clouds. SSCs significantly decreased the computational load in comparison to 3D CNNs, while simultaneously achieving state-of-the-art performance. ____ further generalized SSCs for generic input and output coordinates as well as arbitrary kernel shapes.

Besides voxelization, a variety of more complex discretization approaches that exploit the inherent sparsity of point clouds have been proposed. Examples include OctNet ____ and O-CNN ____, which both utilize novel octree structures, as well as SPLATNet ____ and LatticeNet ____, which opt for lattice-based data structures.

PointNet ____ was the first neural network capable of processing raw point clouds directly. However, PointNets inability to capture local geometric information hindered its performance in semantic segmentation tasks. To this end, the authors introduced an improved version, PointNet++, which utilized a hierarchical structure for extracting local features from small point neighborhoods  ____. ____ proposed RandLA-Net for efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale point clouds. The network achieved significant performance gains through an innovative use of random downsampling and a novel local feature aggregation module.

Several works have proposed pointwise convolutions as an alternative to applying CNNs to discretized point clouds. PointCNN ____ introduced the $\bm{\chi}$-convolution which leveraged spatially-local correlation from unstructured point cloud data, while KPConv ____ used a set of kernel points to determine where each convolution kernel weight is applied. On the other hand, since point clouds can easily be transformed into graph representations, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) have also been a popular approach for semantic segmentation. SPG ____ combined GCNNs with superpoint representations, while DGCNN ____ and SPH3D ____ both introduced novel graph convolutional operators designed specifically for point clouds.

More recently, following the success of transformer-based architectures in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, a number of works have proposed architectures adapted for semantic segmentation of point cloud data ____.

\subsubsection{Weakly supervised methods}

Manually generating ground truth labels for large amounts of data is extremely time-consuming, especially when it comes to data formats that are challenging to annotate, like 3D point clouds. Weakly supervised deep learning attempts to alleviate this problem by training models with a very limited amount of ground truth data.

Since manually generating semantic annotations for 2D images requires significantly less labeling than 3D point clouds, utilizing 2D ground truth labels for 3D deep learning is a form of weak supervision, which some works have explored ____. However, the more common strategy for weak supervision is using a limited amount of ground truth labels, such that only a small minority of all available data with annotations is used for training. In principle, training such a model would only require manually annotating a small subset of points. ____ were among the first to apply this form of weak supervision in the context of point cloud semantic segmentation. By combining a 4-part loss function with label propagation at the inference stage, their method achieved an accuracy comparable to that of supervised baselines with only 10\% of the labels. PSD ____ with its perturbed self-distillation framework achieved performance comparable to RandLA-Net using 1\% of available point annotations, while SQN ____ introduced a point feature query network which enabled back-propagating training signals from sparsely annotated points to a wider context, resulting in performance comparable to supervised baselines on multiple benchmark data sets using just 0.1\% of ground truth labels. Transformer architectures have also been adapted to weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation by ____. Contrastive scene contexts proposed a slightly different approach for training semantic segmentation networks in a weakly supervised manner by introducing an unsupervised contrastive pretraining phase ____.

In contrast to methods that only utilize a limited amount of labeled data for training, pseudo-label-based methods assign artificial labels for unlabeled data points. SSPC-Net ____ and HybridCR ____ both presented weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation frameworks based on pseudo-labels. The former utilized a combination of superpoints and dynamic label propagation, while the latter imposed a contrastive loss on pseudo-labels generated from backbone predictions. LESS ____ presented a novel strategy for generating sparsely annotated data, where the labels are divided into three separate categories during training sparse, weak, and propagated, each of which has a separate contrastive loss function.

\subsubsection{Unsupervised methods}

Research on unsupervised deep learning approaches for semantic segmentation of point clouds remains fairly limited. The few existing architectures all utilize some form of deep clustering, where extracted feature vectors are clustered and subsequently used as pseudo-labels, which are iteratively updated during training.

GrowSP ____ first oversegments the input point clouds into superpoints and subsequently constructs superpoint level feature representations based on pointwise feature vectors from a sparse convolutional neural network (SCNN) feature extractor. The features are then clustered with $k$-means to obtain pseudo-labels for training the network. U3DS$^{3}$ ____ and PointDC ____ both utilize a very similar framework based on oversegmented point clouds and a 3D CNN backbone. To improve feature robustness, U3DS$^{3}$ used two separate pathways in the feature extractor combined with a two-part loss function. On the other hand, PointDC utilizes cross-modal distillation (CMD), where the input point clouds are first converted into multi-view images and passed as input to a pretrained unsupervised 2D feature extractor. The 2D features are subsequently projected back into 3D and used as supervision for training the feature extractor network.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the performance of 3D unsupervised approaches is far from state-of-the-art supervised and weakly supervised methods in terms of segmentation accuracy. However, models such as GrowSP and U3DS$^{3}$ both show great potential and achieve results that are comparable to early supervised architectures such as PointNet ____.
