    abstract = {The past decade has seen an explosion in the collection of genotype data in domains as diverse as medicine, ecology, livestock and plant breeding. Along with this comes the challenge of dealing with the related phenotype data, which is not only large but also highly multidimensional. Computational analysis of phenotypes has therefore become critical for our ability to understand the biological meaning of genomic data in the biological sciences. At the heart of computational phenotype analysis are the phenotype ontologies. A large number of these ontologies have been developed across many domains, and we are now at a point where the knowledge captured in the structure of these ontologies can be used for the integration and analysis of large interrelated data sets. The Phenotype And Trait Ontology framework provides a method for formal definitions of phenotypes and associated data sets and has proved to be key to our ability to develop methods for the integration and analysis of phenotype data. Here, we describe the development and products of the ontological approach to phenotype capture, the formal content of phenotype ontologies and how their content can be used computationally.},

abstract = {Many vocabularies and ontologies are produced to represent and annotate agronomic data. However, those ontologies are spread out, in different formats, of different size, with different structures and from overlapping domains. Therefore, there is need for a common platform to receive and host them, align them, and enabling their use in agro-informatics applications. By reusing the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) BioPortal technology, we have designed AgroPortal, an ontology repository for the agronomy domain. The AgroPortal project re-uses the biomedical domain’s semantic tools and insights to serve agronomy, but also food, plant, and biodiversity sciences. We offer a portal that features ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization, comment, and recommendation; enables semantic annotation; stores and exploits ontology alignments; and enables interoperation with the semantic web. The AgroPortal specifically satisfies requirements of the agronomy community in terms of ontology formats (e.g., SKOS vocabularies and trait dictionaries) and supported features (offering detailed metadata and advanced annotation capabilities). In this paper, we present our platform’s content and features, including the additions to the original technology, as well as preliminary outputs of five driving agronomic use cases that participated in the design and orientation of the project to anchor it in the community. By building on the experience and existing technology acquired from the biomedical domain, we can present in AgroPortal a robust and feature-rich repository of great value for the agronomic domain.}
