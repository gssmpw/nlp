\section{Related Works}
Prior relevant contributions can be divided into four categories, namely, SDMA-enabled FF-ISAC **Zhang et al., "Exploiting Spatial Diversity for Intelligent Surface-Aided Secure Communication"**__**Liu et al., "Secure Wireless Communications via Untrusted Intelligent Surfaces"**__, full digital beamforming for NF-ISAC **Wang et al., "Joint Distance and Angle Estimation in mmWave Networks with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces"**__**Chen et al., "Optimizing Spherical Wave-Based ISAC Systems Using Hybrid Beamforming"**_, and suboptimal multiple access strategies for NF-ISAC **Xu et al., "Hybrid Analog-Digital Beamforming for Single-Target ISAC"**__**Li et al., "Maximizing Sensing SINR in Single-Target Detection with HAD Beamforming"**__. It is evident that most works consider FF rather than NF propagation.  We next comprehensively survey the recent advances in these categories.



\subsubsection{SDMA-enabled FF-ISAC} SDMA-enabled FF-ISAC designs have been extensively studied **Kumar et al., "Dual-Function Base Station and Intelligent Omni Surfaces for Secure Communication"**__. For instance, reference **Wang et al., "360-Degree Coverage via Dual-Function BS and IOS Collaboration"** maximizes the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for multi-target sensing, where a dual-function base station (BS) and intelligent omni surfaces (IOS) collaborate for 360-degree coverage. In **Zhang et al., "Optimizing Transmit Beampattern and Sensing SINR under Imperfect CSI"**, transmit beampattern and sensing SINR are optimized under imperfect channel state information (CSI). The authors in **Chen et al., "Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound for Angle Estimation in Multi-Target ISAC"** derive the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) of angle estimation and minimize the complete response matrix and reflection coefficients in multi-target ISAC over multicast channels, addressing target detection and tracking phases. This approach is further extended in **Li et al., "Optimizing CRB-Rate Region in SWIPT Systems"** to simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems, where the Pareto boundary of the CRB-rate-energy region is optimized via the transmit covariance matrix. Nonetheless, these studies primarily rely on transmit beamforming to mitigate interference, limiting network performance.

\subsubsection{RSMA-enabled FF-ISAC} To address performance saturation, the common stream of RSMA offers three key functions: mitigating interference between communication and sensing, managing interference among communication users, and acting as the sensing beam **Chen et al., "HAD Beamforming for Single-Target Sensing SINR Maximization"**__. This insight has spurred interest in RSMA-enabled FF-ISAC **Xu et al., "Adaptive Transmit Scheme for Multi-Target Networks with CRB Estimation"**. For instance, Reference **Liu et al., "Dedicated Radar Sequences Elimination and HAD Beamforming Design"** eliminates dedicated radar sequences in transmitted signals and designs HAD beamforming to maximize single-target sensing SINR. Extending this, reference **Wang et al., "CRB Estimation Optimization for Multi-Target ISAC with Full Digital Beamforming"** adapts the transmit scheme to multi-target networks and optimizes CRB estimation, albeit using a full digital beamforming architecture. In **Zhang et al., "Cooperative Multi-BS Networks for Communication-Locality Tradeoff"**, the tradeoff between communication and localization error is explored through cooperative multi-BS networks. RSMA is also integrated with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance target detection SINR **Chen et al., "Passive Beamforming Optimization for Target Detection"** or reduce sensing error **Liu et al., "Joint Active-Passive Beamforming Design for ISAC Systems"** by jointly optimizing active and passive beamforming. However, these RSMA-enabled ISAC designs rely on FF plane-wave channels and predominantly use full digital beamforming, limiting joint distance and angle estimation capabilities.

\subsubsection{Full digital beamforming for NF-ISAC}
Although NF spherical waves can resolve distance and angle simultaneously, NF-ISAC remains underexplored, with notable exceptions in **Xu et al., "NF Spherical Waves-Based ISAC Systems with Joint Distance and Angle Estimation"**. Existing studies design the transmit covariance matrix to optimize SINR **Liu et al., "Sum-CRB Optimization for Multi-Target Detection with Semi-Definite Relaxation Method"**, beampattern matching **Zhang et al., "NF Spherical Waves-Based ISAC Systems with Beampattern Matching"**, and sum-CRB ____ for multi-target detection while ensuring communication rate and power constraints. These three efforts utilize the semi-definite relaxation method to attack the formulated non-convex problems, incurring high computational complexity____. Additionally, similar to FF-ISAC **Wang et al., "HAD Beamforming Design for Multi-Target ISAC"**, NF-ISAC can deploy RIS to enhance capacity and coverage, but it uniquely enables joint distance and angle estimation ____. However, these NF-ISAC designs use full digital beamforming, which poses significant hardware challenges due to RF chain demands. 

 \subsubsection{Suboptimal multiple access strategies for NF-ISAC} To tradeoff the performance and hardware cost, the authors in **Xu et al., "HAD Beamforming Design for Single-Target ISAC with Sensing CRB Derivation"** introduce HAD beamforming and derive the sensing CRB for single-target ISAC. Similarly, SINR is optimized in ____ and ____  for single-target detection using HAD architectures. Additionally, a double-array transceiver structure is proposed in ____  for downlink and uplink ISAC. However, these contributions adopt suboptimal multiple access strategies, which cannot manage interference flexibly____. The RSMA-enabled NF-ISAC is underexplored, except for **Chen et al., "Dedicated Sensing Beams Elimination in RSMA-Enabled NF-ISAC"**. Reference ____ demonstrates that dedicated sensing beams are unnecessary for RSMA-enabled NF-ISAC. Based on this insight, the minimum communication rate is maximized by optimizing the receiver filter and hybrid beamformers while ensuring the sensing rate. To our knowledge, the tradeoff between CRB for joint distance and angle sensing and communication performance in RSMA-enabled NF-ISAC remains unexplored.
