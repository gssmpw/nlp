\item ____ title: "Misinformation in and about science". IN THE INTRO THEY CITE A LOT OF PAPERS ABOUT MISINFORMATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA (then they cite also exaggerations of some papers' abstracts or wrongly reporting of preprints or preliminary studies, “quotation errors” (i.e., citations that are used to justify claims that are not factually supported by the cited documents), Fake News and Predatory Publishing, Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers, Data and Science Distortion, ...),  "Nearly 40\% of Americans viewed content from untrustworthy websites during the 2016 US election, but these articles only represented about 6\% of all news articles consumed". 

\item ____ title: "The unbearable lightness of politics: Climate change denial and political polarization"

it contains a general discourse about democrats, republicans, and neo-liberals (who are mostly republicans). The latter "promote free-market ideology. They built a network of think tanks that called for deregulation, privatization, welfare cuts, and reduced taxation to revive high corporate profits and economic growth [...]Thus, anti-environmentalism has been, from the start, a keystone of neoliberal antiregulatory politics. But the perceived threats posed by climate change discourse intensified this opposition, mobilizing energy companies and other related industries and broader free-market forces. Discrediting global climate change claims began in earnest in 1989 when the Marshall Institute issued their first report disputing climate
science. Although climate change denial is a latecomer to neoliberal anti-environmentalism, it has now become the countermovement’s pivotal issue in battles against environmental regulations. [...] Pew Research Center Surveys indicate that the partisan divide over warming accelerated between 2007 and 2009". 

\item ____ title: "Where does political polarization come from? Locating polarization within the US climate change debate" 
it mentions the conservative think tanks that attack climate change scientific studies. "this paper analyzes the content of
Congressional debates around climate change [from 2005 to 2009] to understand the polarization of this issue more fully, specifically looking at where the polarization is coming from: the science of the issue or the threat of legislation." 
"In the U.S., this polarization is focused around, not the science of the issue, but perspectives on the policy instrument and the economic implications of the implementation of such an instrument."

\item ____ title "Growing polarization around climate change on social media" 
\item ____ title: "Corporate funding and ideological polarization about climate change"
\item ____ from Nature. title: "Polarisation of Climate and Environmental Attitudes in the United States, 1973-2022" They found "two distinct historical patterns of asymmetric polarisation within environmental and climate change attitudes: first, with Republicans becoming less pro-environmental, beginning in the early 1990s, and second, a more recent greening of Democratic environmental attitudes since the mid-2010s. "

\subsection{Reddit}
%   HOW IT WORKS. THE INITIAL DATASET WE HAVE
Reddit has a quite different architecture from the other popular social media platforms. Users do not have a \emph{profile} with their personal information in which they can share or write posts: they interact in topic-based communities called \emph{subreddits}, which create a huge ecosystem where almost every possible topic can be discussed. This is the reason Reddit is also known as "the front page of the Internet". After choosing a subreddit, a user can write a new  \emph{post}, also called \emph{submission}, or add an answer to another post, with a new \emph{comment}. \\

\textcolor{blue}{from ____ pag 8 
"With over 430 million active users and billions of page-views a month, Reddit is a fruitful source of data for researchers (Amaya et al., 2019). Around 22\% of American adults aged 18-29 and 14\% of adults aged 30-49 use Reddit (Tankovska, 2021), and 70\% of those users use it as their primary source of news (Balther et al., 2016)." etc}\\


We start the study from two sets of monthly datasets, the first containing the submissions and the second the comments, written on Reddit. \textcolor{blue}{collected with the  \emph{pushshift.io} Reddit API\footnote{\url{https://github.com/pushshift/api}} ____}
