\subsection{Ablation Study}
\subsubsection{Total Budget vs Per-Step Budget}


\subsubsection{How Many Words Do We Need}
In previous experiments, we instruct LLMs to limit the reasoning steps to 5 words at most. In this section, we conduct ablation study on what is the optimal word limit. 

\subsubsection{CoD on Different Model Sizes}
To understand how CoD performs on models with different sizes, we also evaluate GSM8K with Llama 3.1 8B, 70B, and 405B~\cite{llama3.1}.
