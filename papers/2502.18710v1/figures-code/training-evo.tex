    \caption{\textbf{Representational Alignment through Training Evolution.} We visualize the evolution of Procrustes alignment between network pairs during task optimization on CIFAR100 \textbf{(Top)} and ImageNet \textbf{(Bottom)}. Lighter shades indicate earlier epochs, progressively darkening with later epochs. The plots span from epoch $0$ (untrained) to epoch $10$, with task performance improving over time. Epoch progression can be inferred from the increasing task performance along the $x$-axis.}
