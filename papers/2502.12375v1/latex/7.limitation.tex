\section*{Limitations}

While UltraGen demonstrates strong performance in handling extremely fine-grained controllable generation, several limitations remain. First, the set of hard attributes used in this work, though diverse and practical, primarily focuses on structural and keyword constraints; future work could explore more complex and domain-specific hard constraints to further stress-test model capabilities. Second, although our attribute correlation and diversity strategies reduce implausible combinations, ensuring absolute coherence across a large number of constraints remains an open challenge.
