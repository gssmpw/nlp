\section{Conclusion}
We proposed UltraGen, a two-stage framework for extremely fine-grained controllable generation. The Auto-Reconstruction stage trains LLMs to align with both soft and hard attributes, while Global Preference Optimization further enhances constraint satisfaction under diverse attribute combinations. Experiments on UltraBench demonstrate that UltraGen significantly improves both constraint adherence and text quality.
