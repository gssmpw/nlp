\section{Conclusion}
We provided an upper bound of $2$ on the $\PoA$ in linear multigraphs for one of the most natural packet routing games. Interestingly, our upper bound is independent of the network size and the number of players which is in stark contrast to other packet routing games. Furthermore, a sequence of linear multigraphs with a $\PoS$ that converges to at least $\frac{e}{e-1}$ has been presented. 
It is evident that our findings extend to serial concatenations of parallel path networks through subdivisions of edges in linear multigraphs and we obtain the same bounds on the $\PoA$ in an extended model where we allow for integer-valued edge capacities, as shown in Appendix \ref{sec:edgcap}. 

A natural next step would be to further tighten the bounds and establish an upper bound on the PoA for more general graph classes. Furthermore, considering the PoA when not restricted to UFR equilibria is an interesting research direction. Future research could explore the PoA for other relevant social objective functions as well.
