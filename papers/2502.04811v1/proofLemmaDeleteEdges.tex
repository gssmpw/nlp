\begin{proof}
It is sufficient to show that the property holds for $|E_2\backslash E_1|=1$. Let $e=(v_j,v_{j+1})$ be the edge where the two graphs differ. Up to node $v_j$ the arrival patterns $a_{v_j}(\badNash_{G_1})$ and $a_{v_j}(\badNash_{G_2})$ trivially coincide.
Suppose that there is a player $i$ such that $a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_2}) > a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1})$ and $a^{i'}_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_2}) \leq a^{i'}_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1})$ for all $i'<i$. In particular, there are at most $|\{e\in E_1^{j+1}: \tau(e) \leq a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1}) - a^i_{v_{j}}(\badNash_{G_1})\}| -1$ players with index less than $i$ that arrive at $v_{j+1}$ at time $a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1})$. Here $E_1^{j+1}$ denotes the edges in $E_1$ that are in the $(j+1)$-th layer of $G_1$. Since $i$ arrives at $v_{j+1}$ strictly later in $G_2$ than in $G_1$, among all edges of $\{e\in E_1^{j+1}: \tau(e) \leq a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1}) - a^i_{v_{j}}(\badNash_{G_1})\}$ players arrive at $v_{j+1}$ at time $a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1})$ in $\badNash_{G_2}$. Note, that is one more player. By Lemma \ref{lemma_order} the additional player $i'$ has $i'<i$, since no overtaking is possible at any intermediate node in any equilibrium. But then we have $a^{i'}_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_2}) > a^{i'}_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1})$, which contradicts that player $i$ was the player with the smallest index that was delayed. Therefore, $a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_1}) \geq a^i_{v_{j+1}}(\badNash_{G_2})$ holds for all $i\in N$.
In the later layers, the graphs are indistinguishable. Therefore, by iterating node by node to the destination node $d$, we obtain the statement by applying Lemma $\ref{lemma_mnK_startpattern}$ at each step.
