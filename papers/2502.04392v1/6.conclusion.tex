\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, our proposed \textit{Division-of-Thoughts} collaborative reasoning framework effectively enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs on edge devices by intelligently distributing tasks between local and cloud resources. \textit{DoT} not only breaks down complex tasks into manageable subtasks but also leverages a directed-acyclic graph to optimize the reasoning path, facilitating parallel edge-cloud processing. Furthermore, the plug-and-play adapter accurately assesses the difficulty of sub-tasks for allocation, ensuring high reasoning performance while significantly reducing costs of money and time.
Looking ahead, we aim to apply our reasoning framework across a broader and more diverse range of scenarios, striving to contribute to the advancement of edge AI.

% Looking ahead, we aim to incorporate additional cloud-based large models, tailored for specific tasks, to refine the overall collaborative framework. 
% We also intend to integrate a broader array of updated benchmarks to thoroughly evaluate the frameworkâ€™s performance across diverse scenarios, ultimately advancing the state of edge AI applications.
