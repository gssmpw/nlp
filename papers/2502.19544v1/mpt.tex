\section*{Impact Statement} \label{app:impact statement}
%
This paper contributes to the field of reinforcement learning (RL), with potential applications including robotics and autonomous machines. While our methods hold promise for advancing technology, they could also be applied in ways that raise ethical concerns, such as in autonomous machines exploring the world and making decisions on their own. However, the specific societal impacts of our work are broad and varied, and we believe a detailed discussion of potential negative uses is beyond the scope of this paper. We encourage a broader dialogue on the ethical use of RL technology and its regulation to prevent misuse.
