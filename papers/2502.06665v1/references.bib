@article{Murgia.2018,
 abstract = {Software development---just like any other human collaboration---inevitably evokes emotions like joy or sadness, which are known to affect the group dynamics within a team. Today, little is known about those individual emotions and whether they can be discerned at all in the development artifacts produced during a project. This paper analyzes (a) whether issue reports---a common development artifact, rich in content---convey emotional information and (b) whether humans agree on the presence of these emotions. From the analysis of the issue comments of 117 projects of the Apache Software Foundation, we find that developers express emotions (in particular gratitude, joy and sadness). However, the more context is provided about an issue report, the more human raters start to doubt and nuance their interpretation. Based on these results, we demonstrate the feasibility of a machine learning classifier for identifying issue comments containing gratitude, joy and sadness. Such a classifier, using emotion-driving words and technical terms, obtains a good precision and recall for identifying the emotion love, while for joy and sadness a lower recall is obtained.},

Software development is a collaborative activity as well, yet there is little information on how affectiveness impacts software productivity. As a first measure of this impact, this paper analyzes the relation between sentiment, emotions and politeness of developers in more than 560K Jira comments with the time to fix a Jira issue. We found that the happier developers are (expressing emotions such as JOY and LOVE in their comments), the shorter the issue fixing time is likely to be. In contrast, negative emotions such as SADNESS, are linked with longer issue fixing time. Politeness plays a more complex role and we empirically analyze its impact on developers' productivity.},

A model of how employees will adopt BI apps is advanced based on theoretical foundations and recent thinking regarding how IT artifacts are becoming perceived of as {\textquotedbl}social actors within one's network.{\textquotedbl} The theory cited asserts that individual's resource management instincts impact sentiment. Repeated app usage is clarified as ongoing appropriation. Actual app store review data is used to test the proposition that sentiment analysis can aid in addressing current practice bottlenecks in requirements engineering. A sentiment analysis tool suite is applied to over 5000 reviews of productivity apps as a proof of concept. Findings support that sentiment analysis can address current bottlenecks to requirements engineering, but that certain types of reviews tend to elude algorithmic analysis. Future needs for sentiment analysis algorithms in the space are suggested.},

@article{Jongeling.2017,
 abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing attention to social aspects of software engineering, including studies of emotions and sentiments experienced and expressed by the software developers. Most of these studies reuse existing sentiment analysis tools such as SentiStrength and NLTK. However, these tools have been trained on product reviews and movie reviews and, therefore, their results might not be applicable in the software engineering domain. In this paper we study whether the sentiment analysis tools agree with the sentiment recognized by human evaluators (as reported in an earlier study) as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of the choice of a sentiment analysis tool on software engineering studies by conducting a simple study of differences in issue resolution times for positive, negative and neutral texts. We repeat the study for seven datasets (issue trackers and Stack Overflow questions) and different sentiment analysis tools and observe that the disagreement between the tools can lead to diverging conclusions. Finally, we perform two replications of previously published studies and observe that the results of those studies cannot be confirmed when a different sentiment analysis tool is used.},

@inproceedings{S.Panichella.2015,
 abstract = {App Stores, such as Google Play or the Apple Store, allow users to provide feedback on apps by posting review comments and giving star ratings. These platforms constitute a useful electronic mean in which application developers and users can productively exchange information about apps. Previous research showed that users feedback contains usage scenarios, bug reports and feature requests, that can help app developers to accomplish software maintenance and evolution tasks. However, in the case of the most popular apps, the large amount of received feedback, its unstructured nature and varying quality can make the identification of useful user feedback a very challenging task. In this paper we present a taxonomy to classify app reviews into categories relevant to software maintenance and evolution, as well as an approach that merges three techniques: (1) Natural Language Processing, (2) Text Analysis and (3) Sentiment Analysis to automatically classify app reviews into the proposed categories. We show that the combined use of these techniques allows to achieve better results (a precision of 75{\%} and a recall of 74{\%}) than results obtained using each technique individually (precision of 70{\%} and a recall of 67{\%}).},

abstract = {Emotion analysis in text has drawn recent interests in the software engineering (SE) community. Existing domain-independent techniques for automated emotion/sentiment analysis perform poorly when operated on SE text. Thus, a few SE domain-specific tools are recently developed for detecting sentimental polarities (e.g., positivity, negativity). But, for capturing individual emotional states such as excitation, stress, depression, and relaxation, there is only one recent tool named DEVA, which uses a lexicon-based approach.We have developed MarValous, the first Machine Learning based tool for improved detection of the aforementioned emotional states in software engineering text. We evaluate MarValous using a dataset containing 5,122 comments collected from JIRA and Stack Overflow. From a quantitative evaluation, MarValous is found to have substantially outperformed DEVA achieving more than 83\% precision and more than 79\% recall.},

@article{Hassan.2018,
 abstract = {The popularity of mobile apps continues to grow over the past few years. Mobile app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store provide a unique user feedback mechanism to app developers through the possibility of posting app reviews. In the Google Play Store (and soon in the Apple App Store), developers are able to respond to such user feedback. Over the past years, mobile app reviews have been studied excessively by researchers. However, much of prior work (including our own prior work) incorrectly assumes that reviews are static in nature and that users never update their reviews. In a recent study, we started analyzing the dynamic nature of the review-response mechanism. Our previous study showed that responding to a review often has a positive effect on the rating that is given by the user to an app. In this paper, we revisit our prior finding in more depth by studying 4.5 million reviews with 126,686 responses for 2,328 top free-to-download apps in the Google Play Store. One of the major findings of our paper is that the assumption that reviews are static is incorrect. In particular, we find that developers and users in some cases use this response mechanism as a rudimentary user support tool, where dialogues emerge between users and developers through updated reviews and responses. Even though the messages are often simple, we find instances of as many as ten user-developer back-and-forth messages that occur via the response mechanism. Using a mixed-effect model, we identify that the likelihood of a developer responding to a review increases as the review rating gets lower or as the review content gets longer. In addition, we identify four patterns of developers: 1) developers who primarily respond to only negative reviews, 2) developers who primarily respond to negative reviews or to reviews based on their contents, 3) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted shortly after the latest release of their app, and 4) developers who primarily respond to reviews which are posted long after the latest release of their app. We perform a qualitative analysis of developer responses to understand what drives developers to respond to a review. We manually analyzed a statistically representative random sample of 347 reviews with responses for the top ten apps with the highest number of developer responses. We identify seven drivers that make a developer respond to a review, of which the most important ones are to thank the users for using the app and to ask the user for more details about the reported issue. Our findings show that it can be worthwhile for app owners to respond to reviews, as responding may lead to an increase in the given rating. In addition, our findings show that studying the dialogue between user and developer can provide valuable insights that can lead to improvements in the app store and user support process.},

 abstract = {How could a product or service is reasonably evaluated by anyone in the shortest time? A million dollar question but it is having a simple answer: Sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is consumers review on products and services which helps both the producers and consumers (stakeholders) to take effective and efficient decision within a shortest period of time. Producers can have better knowledge of their products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their products status (ex. product limitations or market status). Consumers can have better knowledge of their interested products and services through the sentiment analysis (ex. positive and negative comments or consumers likes and dislikes) which will help them to know their deserving products status (ex. product limitations or market status). For more specification of the sentiment values, fuzzy logic could be introduced. Therefore, sentiment analysis with the help of fuzzy logic (deals with reasoning and gives closer views to the exact sentiment values) will help the producers or consumers or any interested person for taking the effective decision according to their product or service interest.},

 abstract = {Users of the Twitter microblogging platform share a considerable amount of information through short messages on a daily basis. Some of these so-called tweets discuss issues related to software and could include information that is relevant to the companies developing these applications. Such tweets have the potential to help requirements engineers better understand user needs and therefore provide important information for software evolution. However, little is known about the nature of tweets discussing software-related issues. In this paper, we report on the usage characteristics, content and automatic classification potential of tweets about software applications. Our results are based on an exploratory study in which we used descriptive statistics, content analysis, machine learning and lexical sentiment analysis to explore a dataset of 10,986,495 tweets about 30 different software applications. Our results show that searching for relevant information on software applications within the vast stream of tweets can be compared to looking for a needle in a haystack. However, this relevant information can provide valuable input for software companies and support the continuous evolution of the applications discussed in these tweets. Furthermore, our results show that it is possible to use machine learning and lexical sentiment analysis techniques to automatically extract information about the tweets regarding their relevance, authors and sentiment polarity.},

To develop and evolve software that is usable and relevant for a diverse group of users, different opinions and experiences need to be taken into account. Goal: In this paper we present DIVERSE, a feature and sentiment centric retrieval approach which automatically provides developers with a diverse sample of user reviews that is representative of the different opinions and experiences mentioned in the whole set of reviews. Results: We evaluated the diversity retrieval performance of our approach on reviews from seven apps from two different app stores. We compared the reviews retrieved by DIVERSE with a feature-based retrieval approach and found that on average DIVERSE outperforms the baseline approach. Additionally, a controlled experiment revealed that DIVERSE can help develop- ers save time when analyzing user reviews and was considered useful for detecting conflicting opinions and software evolution. Conclusions: DIVERSE can therefore help developers collect a comprehensive set of reviews and aid in the detection of conflicting opinions.},

In this work, we are concerned with conducting entity-level sentiment analysis. We first build a manually labeled dataset containing 3,000 issue comments selected from 231,732 issue comments collected from 10 open source projects in GitHub. Then we design and develop SentiSW, an entity-level sentiment analysis tool consisting of sentiment classification and entity recognition, which can classify issue comments into <sentiment, entity=""> tuples. We evaluate the sentiment classification using ten-fold cross validation, and it achieves 68.71\% mean precision, 63.98\% mean recall and 77.19\% accuracy, which is significantly higher than existing tools. We evaluate the entity recognition by manually annotation and it achieves a 75.15\% accuracy.},

Developers are the key factors for the success of a software development process, not merely as executors of tasks, but as protagonists and core of the whole development process. This paper investigates social aspects among developers working on software projects developed with the support of Agile tools. We studied 22 open-source software projects developed using the Agile board of the JIRA repository. All comments committed by developers involved in the projects were analyzed and we explored whether the politeness of comments affected the number of developers involved and the time required to fix any given issue. Our results showed that the level of politeness in the communication process among developers does have an effect on the time required to fix issues and, in the majority of the analysed projects, it had a positive correlation with attractiveness of the project to both active and potential developers. The more polite developers were, the less time it took to fix an issue.},

abstract = {Individual classification models are recently challenged by combined pattern recognition systems, which often show better performance. In such systems the optimal set of classifiers is first selected and then combined by a specific fusion method. For a small number of classifiers optimal ensembles can be found exhaustively, but the burden of exponential complexity of such search limits its practical applicability for larger systems. As a result, simpler search algorithms and/or selection criteria are needed to reduce the complexity. This work provides a revision of the classifier selection methodology and evaluates the practical applicability of diversity measures in the context of combining classifiers by majority voting. A number of search algorithms are proposed and adjusted to work properly with a number of selection criteria including majority voting error and various diversity measures. Extensive experiments carried out with 15 classifiers on 27 datasets indicate inappropriateness of diversity measures used as selection criteria in favour of the direct combiner error based search. Furthermore, the results prompted a novel design of multiple classifier systems in which selection and fusion are recurrently applied to a population of best combinations of classifiers rather than the individual best. The improvement of the generalisation performance of such system is demonstrated experimentally.}

abstract = {Prediction of change prone classes of a software has become an important area of research where the search for the best classifier still continues. While searching for an effective classifier, it needs to be ascertained whether an ensemble of classifier is better than its corresponding constituent classifiers. In this work, we propose four voting ensemble of classifiers, where a group of classifiers learn together and are used to create a single prediction model. The set of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based classifiers are created based on five different fitness functions. Then the voting method is used to combine the predictions of these multiple classifiers so that the resultant model has improved accuracy. This proposal is based on the premises that while using a search-based algorithm for classification tasks, it is crucial to combine various classifiers based on different fitness function. The results of the study are statistically assessed on five popular Android application packages and advocate the use of a weighted voting ensemble of classifiers for developing change prediction models.1},

Bug prediction is one of the potential benefits that can be gained through mining software repositories. Predicting potential defects early as they are introduced to the version control system would definitely help in saving time and effort during testing or maintenance phases. In this paper, defect prediction models that uses ensemble classification techniques have been proposed. The proposed models have been applied using different sets of software metrics as attributes of the classification techniques and tested on datasets of different sizes. The results show that change metrics outperform static code metrics and the combined model of change and static code metrics. Ensembles tend to be more accurate than their base classifiers. Defect prediction models using change metrics and ensemble classifiers have revealed the best performance, especially when the datasets used have imbalanced class distribution.}

abstract = {Typically performed by supervised machine learning algorithms, sentiment analysis is highly useful for extracting subjective information from text documents online. Most approaches that use ensemble learning paradigms toward sentiment analysis involve feature engineering in order to enhance the predictive performance. In response, we sought to develop a paradigm of a multiobjective, optimization-based weighted voting scheme to assign appropriate weight values to classifiers and each output class based on the predictive performance of classification algorithms, all to enhance the predictive performance of sentiment classification. The proposed ensemble method is based on static classifier selection involving majority voting error and forward search, as well as a multiobjective differential evolution algorithm. Based on the static classifier selection scheme, our proposed ensemble method incorporates Bayesian logistic regression, naïve Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machines as base learners, whose performance in terms of precision and recall values determines weight adjustment. Our experimental analysis of classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, software defect prediction, credit risk modeling, spam filtering, and semantic mapping, suggests that the proposed classification scheme can predict better than conventional ensemble learning methods such as AdaBoost, bagging, random subspace, and majority voting. Of all datasets examined, the laptop dataset showed the best classification accuracy (98.86%).}

We argue that among those emotions anger deserves special attention as it can serve as an onset for tools supporting collaborative software development. This, however, requires a fine-grained model of the anger emotion, able to distinguish between anger directed towards self, others, and objects. Detecting anger towards self could be useful to support developers experiencing difficulties; detection of anger towards others might be helpful for community management; detecting anger towards objects might be helpful to recommend and prioritize improvements. As a first step towards automatic identification of anger direction, we built a classifier for anger direction, based on a manually annotated gold standard of 723 sentences that were obtained by mining comments in Apache issue reports.},
