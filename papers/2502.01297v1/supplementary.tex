\firstsection{Introduction}
\maketitle

This is the supplementary document that our main paper refers to. It contains some additional implement details and additional experiment results.

\section{Additional Experiments}

In Sec. 6, we conducted comprehensive experiments on our initialization method and feature tracking approach, comparing them with numerous state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. To further emphasize the advantages of our algorithm, we provide additional experimental results and comparisons in this supplementary material. 

\subsection{Initialization Evaluation}
In Sect. 6.3, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of our initialization algorithm compared to several SOTA algorithms, including Closed-form \cite{martinelli2014closed}, Vins-Mono \cite{qin-tro-2018_VINS-Mono}, Inertial-only \cite{campos2020inertial}, and DRT \cite{Rotation-Translation-Decoupled}. As presented in Tab. 2 in the main text, we compared the accuracy metrics of our initialization method under two configurations: 4-keyframe (4KF) and 5-keyframe (5KF). Our results demonstrated a high initialization success rate with very few initial frames, outperforming SOTA algorithms in terms of accuracy metrics. However, existing methods typically initialize using a 10-keyframe (10KF) configuration. To provide a more comprehensive and fair comparison, we extended our evaluations to include the 10KF configuration. Under this setting, each sequence was segmented into 1137 fragments at intervals of 1.2 seconds, with keyframes uniformly selected at intervals of 0.1 seconds for all methods.

\Cref{tab:Init_Compare2_sup} and  \cref{fig:Init_Error_10KF_CDF_sup} present a detailed overview of the accuracy metrics and corresponding cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of various initialization methods. Notably, our algorithm maintains superiority over existing approaches under the widely adopted 10KF configuration, demonstrating superior performance across all metrics compared to current initialization methods.

Furthermore, it's important to highlight that the DRT method, including DRT-l and DRT-r, does not employ a joint optimization algorithm like VI-BA. To ensure a fair comparison, we conducted additional experiments by disabling VI-BA in the XR-VIO initialization pipeline and compared the results of VA-Align (referred to as XR-VIO w/o VI-BA) with those of the DRT algorithm.

As illustrated in \cref{fig:Init_Error_CDF_sup} and \cref{tab:Init_Compare_sup}, the accuracy metrics of XR-VIO w/o VI-BA are slightly lower than those of XR-VIO, but significantly higher than those of the DRT algorithm. This result highlights the innovativeness and practical value of our VG-SfM approach, confirming its effectiveness even in scenarios where VI-BA is disabled.

\subsection{Trajectory Evaluation}
In Sec. 6.5, we  conducted a comparison of trajectory accuracy between OKVIS \cite{leutenegger-ijrr-2015-OKVIS}, VINS-Mono \cite{qin-tro-2018_VINS-Mono}, VINS-Fusion \cite{qin2019a_VINS_Fusion_Local}, OpenVINS \cite{geneva2020openvins}, HybVIO \cite{hybvio} and our XR-VIO algorithm on the Euroc \cite{Burri25012016-EuRoC} and ZJU-Sensetime \cite{jinyu2019survey} datasets. The overall accuracy of the XR-VIO algorithm surpassed these SOTA algorithms on both datasets. However, Euroc and ZJU-Sensetime datasets do not provide metrics for Apple ARKit \footnote{\url{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/}} and Google ARCore \footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/ar/}},  two leading commercial AR software solutions with substantial influence in the XR field. To further compare with ARKit and ARCore, we utilized the ADVIO dataset ~\cite{cortes2018advio}.

\textbf{ADVIO} (Advanced Visual-Inertial Odometry) dataset is an open benchmark dataset designed for evaluating visual-inertia algorithms. It contains diverse real-world scenes, including different indoor/outdoor environments, lighting conditions, and dynamic object interferences, facilitating the assessment of robustness, accuracy, and real-time performance of various algorithms. Notably, the ADVIO dataset offers three aligned trajectories with ground truth: an ARCore trajectory captured on a Google Pixel device, an ARKit trajectory obtained from an iPhone, and Tango odometry recorded on a Google Tango tablet device.

Following the configurations outlined in Sec. 6, we executed all 23 datasets from ADVIO and compared them with ARKit and ARCore using Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) metrics. As depicted in \cref{tab:data_sup}, out of the 23 datasets, our XR-VIO algorithm achieved the highest accuracy in 13 of them. Overall, our accuracy surpassed that of ARKit and ARCore. This experiment underscores the robustness and superiority of our XR-VIO algorithm in XR environments, particularly in pedestrian XR scenarios.
