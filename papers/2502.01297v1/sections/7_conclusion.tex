\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel and robust VIO system capable of supporting rapid visual-inertial initialization and precise 6DoF tracking. For initialization, we propose VG-SfM, which significantly enhances the robustness of camera pose and gyroscope bias estimation. In terms of feature matching, we propose a hybrid scheme that tightly integrates optical flow and descriptor-based matching, enabling feature tracking to maintain high accuracy even with long track length.  Both approaches contribute significantly to the performance enhancement of our algorithm. 

Our experimental results on the EuRoC, ZJU-Sensetime and ADVIO datasets demonstrate clear superiority over existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our system. Moreover, our algorithm exhibits good computational efficiency, enabling real-time execution on mobile devices. An AR demo on mobile devices further showcases the algorithm's robustness in challenging scenarios and highlights its potential for mobile AR applications.

% TODO
Despite these achievements, our system still faces limitations in extremely challenging environments such as pure-rotation scenes, textureless environments, and dynamic environments. Furthermore, we acknowledge that deep learning-based methods hold promise for further improving VIO performance. For instance, incorporating learning-based depth estimation and inertial navigation systems could provide additional geometric and motion measurements suitable for VIO or SLAM. We plan to explore these avenues in future work to refine and enhance our algorithm.
