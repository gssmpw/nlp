\subsection{Expressive Semantic Translation}

The EST method innovatively enhances neural machine translation by infusing expressiveness and contextual relevance through an iterative refinement process utilizing LLMs. The EST method encompasses several pivotal steps:

\noindent \textbf{Initial Translation:} A standard translation model \(M\) converts text from a source language \(L_1\) into a preliminary translation \(t_0\) in the target language \(L_2\), which often lacks expressiveness and contextual depth.

\noindent \textbf{Enhanced Linguistic Refinement:} Employing multiple LLMs, the initial translation \(t_0\) is refined into diverse candidate translations that exhibit greater naturalness and idiomatic correctness in \(L_2\).

\noindent \textbf{Quality Diversity:} This phase synthesizes the best elements from the candidate translations through a prompt-based evaluation method, aiming to construct a translation that faithfully represents the nuances of \(L_2\).

\noindent \textbf{Candidate Ranking:} Through model-based evaluations, candidates are assessed for contextual appropriateness and linguistic coherence, with the highest-scoring translation selected as the most suitable.

\noindent \textbf{Final Selection:} After multiple iterations, the optimal translation is selected from the top candidates based on rigorous evaluations, ensuring adherence to the linguistic and contextual standards of \(L_2\).

These steps ensure that the final output not only meets the literal translation requirements but also enhances the translation quality by embodying the naturalness and contextual relevance, significantly surpassing traditional methods.
