\section{Related Work}
There have been many synthetic FV datasets constructed from Wikipedia, such as FEVER ____. While FEVER focuses on simple claims, datasets like 
HOVER ____ and 
FEVEROUS ____ introduced complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning. Apart from synthetic datasets, there are also datasets focusing on more realistic claims and real-world misinformation ____. Increasingly popular are also domain-specific datasets focusing on scientific fact-checking ____, especially for the domains of medicine ____, climate ____, and computer science ____. 

Most FV approaches follow the traditional three-part pipeline ____. In recent years, approaches incorporating LLMs and iterative reasoning into the process have achieved great performance on multi-hop FV. This includes FV through varifocal questions ____ or \textit{wh}-questions to aid verification ____, step-by-step prompting ____, and program-guided reasoning ____.
%, and FOLK ____ have shown impressive performance on multi-hop FV by incorporating LLMs and iterative reasoning into the process. 

Most studies with iterative FV systems focus on multi-hop encyclopedic claims. To the best of our knowledge, our study is among the first to explore the step-by-step FV systems for real-world claims rooted in scientific and medical knowledge.
