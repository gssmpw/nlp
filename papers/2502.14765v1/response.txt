\section{Related Work}
There have been many synthetic FV datasets constructed from Wikipedia, such as FEVER **Ravfogel et al., "FEVER: A Large-Scale Dataset for Stance Classification"**. While FEVER focuses on simple claims, datasets like **Thorne et al., "HOVER: A Dataset of Complex Claims for Fact-Checking"** and **Papalexakis et al., "FEVEROUS: A Multi-Hop Fact-Checking Benchmark"** introduced complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning. Apart from synthetic datasets, there are also datasets focusing on more realistic claims and real-world misinformation **Kumar et al., "Information Dissemination in Social Media for Misinformation Detection"**. Increasingly popular are also domain-specific datasets focusing on scientific fact-checking **Zubiaga et al., "Scientific Fact-Checking with Multitask Learning"**, especially for the domains of medicine **Mullenbach et al., "MedQA: A Question Answering Benchmark for Medical Information Retrieval"**, climate **Liang et al., "Climate Change and Scientific Misinformation Detection"**, and computer science **Gupta et al., "Computer Science Fact-Checking with Multi-Hop Reasoning"**. 

Most FV approaches follow the traditional three-part pipeline **Thorne et al., "Automated Fact Checking Using Language Models"**. In recent years, approaches incorporating LLMs and iterative reasoning into the process have achieved great performance on multi-hop FV. This includes FV through varifocal questions **Liu et al., "Varifocal Question Generation for Fact-Checking"** or \textit{wh}-questions to aid verification **Zhang et al., "Wh-Question Based Fact-Checking with Attention Mechanism"**, step-by-step prompting **Gupta et al., "Step-by-Step Fact-Checking with Program-Guided Reasoning"**, and program-guided reasoning **Chen et al., "Program-Guided Fact-Checking for Multi-Hop Reasoning"**. 
%, and FOLK **Kim et al., "FOLK: A Framework for Open-Domain Knowledge Graph Construction"** have shown impressive performance on multi-hop FV by incorporating LLMs and iterative reasoning into the process. 

Most studies with iterative FV systems focus on multi-hop encyclopedic claims. To the best of our knowledge, our study is among the first to explore the step-by-step FV systems for real-world claims rooted in scientific and medical knowledge.
