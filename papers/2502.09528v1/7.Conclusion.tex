\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we presented \textit{\projname{}}, a novel system design and mapping framework aimed at achieving energy-efficient stereo depth processing in AR/VR devices.
By considering the distinct compute requirements on image regions of multiple orders-of-magnitude of scales, our mapping and system co-design loop produces processor designs that fully realize the potential energy savings of ROI-based processing.
Additionally, we propose several specialized compute primitives that enhance efficiency for the unique compute patterns found in stereo depth processing.
Our evaluations demonstrate superior scalability compared to a conventional edge compute platform, and up to $4.35\times$ energy savings over a baseline non-ROI-based processing systems.
