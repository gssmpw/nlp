%% article.

% The presence and controversy of assumptions in technical ecosystems is well-established in responsible AI discourse. What is seldom touched upon is the conceptualization around assumptions, and how AI practitioners identify and handle them throughout their workflows. We present a theoretical framework of how these practitioners generally navigate assumptions and offer recommendations on how to incorporate reflective practices that allow organizations to better utilize these assumptions in avoiding potential harms.

\begin{abstract}
The reference to \textit{assumptions} in how practitioners use or interact with machine learning (ML) systems is ubiquitous in HCI and responsible ML discourse. However, what remains unclear from prior works is the conceptualization of assumptions and how practitioners identify and handle assumptions throughout their workflows. This leads to confusion about what assumptions are and what needs to be done with them. We use the concept of an \textit{argument} from Informal Logic, a branch of Philosophy, to offer a new perspective to understand and explicate the confusions surrounding assumptions. Through semi-structured interviews with 22 ML practitioners, we find what contributes most to these confusions is how \textit{independently} assumptions are constructed, how \textit{reactively} and \textit{reflectively} they are handled, and how \textit{nebulously} they are recorded. Our study brings the peripheral discussion of assumptions in ML to the center and presents recommendations for practitioners to better think about and work with assumptions.
