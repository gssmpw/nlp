\subsection{RQ3. Targets of AEG Techniques}

\subsubsection{Targeted vulnerability types and programming languages}
As reported in Table~\ref{tbl:rqs-g1}, the majority of vulnerabilities that the AEG techniques focus on are memory-based vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs such as buffer overflow~\cite{Xu2022, shahriar2009automatic, DelGrosso20083125, Dixit2021}, heap overflow~\cite{Huang2019}, while the security testing techniques focus on web-based injection vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL Injection~\cite{Bozic202020, zhang2010d, aydin2014automated, Huang2013208}, which are common in PHP- and Java-based applications.
Besides, fuzzing techniques such as~\cite{Bohme2019489, Yu2022, KallingalJoshy2021540}, try to explore the input space to trigger the crash states of both C/C++ and Java programs.
Also, some other techniques focus on specific types of vulnerabilities; for example, Tang et al.~\cite{Tang2017492} and Garcia et al.~\cite{Garcia2017661} tried to generate exploits for Android ICC vulnerabilities, Atlidakis et al.~\cite{Atlidakis2020387} tried to generate the request inputs that can trigger one of four RESTful security violations that they defined themselves.

\subsubsection{Targeted inputs}
Most of the techniques work on the binaries (usually the AEG and fuzzing techniques such as~\cite{Liu2018705, Liu202271, Gong2022374, Zhang201946}) or the source code (security testing techniques and the techniques that require performing symbolic execution or taint analysis such as~\cite{Chen20201580, DelGrosso20083125, avancini2012security, dao2011security, wu2018fuze}) of the targeted programs. Meanwhile, some other techniques focus on web-based vulnerabilities require a running instance of the applications with their APIs~\cite{Appelt2014259, Jan201612, Atlidakis2020387} or UIs~\cite{Simos2019122, Liu2016123, Bozic2020115, Huang2013208} exposed. Some specific techniques, such as model-based security testing, take the special inputs as the program models to find and exploit the vulnerabilities at abstract level~\cite{Pretschner2008338, Lebeau2013445, Khamaiseh2017534}.
