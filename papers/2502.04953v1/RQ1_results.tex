\subsection{RQ1. Publication Trend of AEG}
\label{sub:rq1}

The selected studies are categorized based on publication type and year, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:papers-per-year}. It can be seen that the majority of the studies were published between the years 2011 and 2023. Most of the 66 selected studies were introduced in the conference proceedings (44 publications), including the prestigious conferences in Software Engineering and Security, such as ICSE, ESEC/FSE, and S\&P. Also, we found 15 of the papers published in the volumes of Software Engineering and Security journals, including top-notch ones such as TSE, TSDC, and IEEE Transactions of Reliability.

Figure~\ref{fig:paper-ranks-per-year} and Figure~\ref{fig:venue-research-field} provide more information about the venues where selected studies were published. In particular, Figure~\ref{fig:paper-ranks-per-year} describes the rankings of publishing venues of the studies by year. The venue ranking data were extracted based on the ICORE conference ranking system\footnote{\url{https://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/}} and Scimango Journal ranking system\footnote{\url{https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php}}. More than half of the studies were published in the top venues (36 out of 66 studies) if we consider top venues as conferences with ranks A*, A, and B, and journals with ranks Q1 and Q2. There are eight papers associated with the conferences with rank C. The remaining papers were published at conferences without any known ranks; however, many of these venues were co-located conferences or workshops with the top venues.

Figure~\ref{fig:venue-research-field} shows the distribution of the main research themes of the publishing venues. These venues' top five popular research topics are Software Engineering, Software Testing, Security, Software Security, and Secure Communication.
