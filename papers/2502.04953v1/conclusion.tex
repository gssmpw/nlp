\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work, we surveyed the literature on Automated Exploit Generation, finding 66 relevant research papers that introduce (or improve) techniques for automatically generating exploits (or security tests) for software security vulnerabilities.
%We categorized such techniques into four main groups: AEG, Security Testing, Fuzzing, and Others.

This survey can be used by security researchers to understand the limitations of the current state of AEG practices and develop new solutions to address them.
Besides, in our future agenda, we plan to define a clear workflow for developing AEG tools to encourage the research community to put additional effort into this topic.
