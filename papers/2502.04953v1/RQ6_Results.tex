Table~\ref{tbl:rq6-results} shows the types of datasets used for the evaluation of the techniques in the studies. Most of the techniques were evaluated on real-world applications with real-world CVE vulnerabilities. While others were experienced with artificial vulnerabilities, which are created for the purposes of security research or security competitions such as Capture-The-Flag competitions. More interestingly, some techniques were evaluated on both artificial and real-world datasets.
