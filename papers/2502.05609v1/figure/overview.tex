\caption{\small Overview of database drafting and our proposed method, Hierarchy Drafting (HD). \textit{A.} Previous database drafting methods retrieve draft tokens from a single database constructed from a single source, leading to inconsistent acceleration gains across different scenarios. \textit{B.} HD, however, leverages multiple databases encompassing diverse sources to improve token coverage, ensuring consistent performance.
\textit{B-1.} During the drafting process, databases are accessed sequentially from the smallest to the largest, based on the temporal locality of the token sequences.
\textit{B-2.} Multiple draft token sequences are verified in parallel, and the sequence with the highest number of accepted tokens is finally selected as the generated output.}
