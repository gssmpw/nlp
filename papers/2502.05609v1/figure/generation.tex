\caption{\small (Upper) 4-gram statistics for 100 generations of Llama-2-7b. The x-axis shows the order of 4-grams across 100 generations, with major ticks marking generation steps. The y-axis represents unique 4-gram indices. Red dots indicate 4-grams from previous processes, while blue dots represent those from the current process. (Lower) Frequency analysis of two 4-grams, represented by red and blue dots, respectively.}
