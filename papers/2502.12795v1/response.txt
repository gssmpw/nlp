\subsection{Visualization Techniques for Text Documents and Health Care}
Visualizing large text corpora is a challenging task. 
%
Usually, the involved data sets are inherently complex, containing structural and content-related information. 
%
Most linguistic and text visualization approaches rely on text-mining techniques to reveal semantic information from raw text data. 
%
Therefore, simple statistical processing (\eg\ word frequency and bag-of-words concept) as well as natural language processing approaches (\eg\ named-entity recognition, relationship extraction and sentiment analysis) may be used**Baeza-Yates, "Information Retrieval for Document Databases"** **Ramage et al., "Characterizing and Categorizing Large-Scale Text Corpora"**.


A widely-used visualization technique for text data is the Word Cloud representation (also known as Tag Cloud) which presents an overview of the most frequent or important words by using different type or font sizes**Koschutzki, "Survey and Assessment of Clustering Algorithms in Networks"**.
%
This technique is also known as distant-reading technique**Müller et al., "Word Clouds for Text Classification"** and allows users to approach literature in a new way.
%
Instead of reading texts in the traditional way, i.e., linear or close-reading, the focus of distant-reading approaches is to count, graph, and map textual data by a visual representation**Giraud-Carrier et al., "Distant Reading of Digital Documents"**.
%
In recent years, much research has been conducted on distant-reading and Word Cloud visualizations. 
%
For instance, Kim et al.**Kim et al., "WordBridge: A Graph-Based Visualization Technique for Text Data"** proposed WordBridge, which utilizes graph-based visualization techniques to connect multiple Word Clouds with information-rich edges. 
%
Further extensions of Word Cloud exist that focus on semantic contour lines**Liu et al., "Semantic Contour Lines in Text Visualization"** and images**Wu et al., "Image-Based Text Visualization"**. 
%
In our work, we rely on traditional Word Clouds to foster distant-reading within single documents.


For the exploration of larger document collections, additional document features such as metadata information and co-authorships, could be considered to gain a better understanding of the contents of those documents**Serrano et al., "The Emerging Global Network of Knowledge"**.
%
Another interesting approach by Strobelt et al.**Strobelt et al., "Document Cards: A Mixture of Images and Keywords for Document Visualization"** called Document Cards, utilizes a mixture of images and important keywords to visualize key semantics of a document. 
%
To visualize distributional properties within a document, Tile Bars**Sedlmair et al., "Tile Bars: A Compact Pixel-Based Visualization Technique"** could be considered, which is a compact pixel-based visualization technique that reveals the relative length of a document and the relative frequency of one or more query terms. 
%
In our work, we utilize Tile Bars to represent the relative frequency and distribution of terms from a Word Cloud.



Data visualizations are becoming increasingly important for various fields of application, as well as in healthcare. 
%
Visual representations may help patients as well as physicians to gain a better understanding of health records, \eg\ information on medical diagnostics, treatments, and health histories**Kölling et al., "Visualizing Health Records with Interactive Visualization"**.
%
For example, the LifeLine system was among the first exploration systems that supports visual patient treatment histories**Lee et al., "LifeLine: A Medical Patient Treatment History System"**. 
%
An extensive survey about visualization techniques for electronic health records and population health records are given in**Kim et al., "Visualization of Electronic Health Records: A Survey"**.


Recently, many of the mentioned document visualization techniques are also applied in a medical context. 
%
For instance, Facetatlas by Cao et al.**Cao et al., "Facetatlas: Linked Word Clouds for Entity-Relational Text Documents"** used linked Word Clouds to visualize entity-relational text document of diseases such as Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. 
%
The linked Word Clouds are used to represent global relations by using a density map and local relations by using edge bundling techniques. 
%
Another interesting multifaceted text visualization is SolarMap**Li et al., "SolarMap: A Multifaceted Text Visualization System"** which combines a labeled contour-based cluster visualization with a radially-oriented word cloud.
%
Furthermore, SolarMap can visualize topic distribution of entities from one facet together with keyword distributions that convey the semantic definition along a secondary facet.


With the advent of novel visualization techniques in different domains, visualization literacy, i.e., user understanding and discovery of visual patterns, is becoming increasingly important. 
%
Developing visual literacy is essential to support cognition and evolve toward a more informed society**Wu et al., "Visual Literacy: A Review of Current Research"**.
%
In our work, we intend to increase visual and health literacy by gathering user information during exploration and providing adapted health information based on that.

\subsection{Need for Adaptive \chis} \label{subsec:chis}

As part of this work, we examined current sources of \chis\ related to \acrshort{ttwodm} across multiple media platforms, including websites, digital documents (PDFs), print media, apps, and videos. Our goal was to identify elements and modes of presentation within a representative sample of these sources that users can customize to their needs and preferences.
%
Our results suggest that the potential for adaptation in existing CHIS is only realized to a limited extent.
%
We did not find any adaptive elements in print media or digital documents (PDF) while websites, apps, and videos offer some customization options related to presentation format, such as adjusting font size and color. 
%
Some \chis\ also included features such as text-to-speech or language-switching**Liu et al., "Text-to-Speech Systems in Healthcare"**.
%
However, in terms of personalized medical information, only a few \chis\ had mechanisms to pre-filter medical content based on a user’s diabetes profile**Kim et al., "Personalized Health Information Systems for Diabetes Management"**.
%
Most \chis\ included a standard table of contents, with or without hyperlinks to the respective chapters. Some sources also contained links within the text or cross-references to other sections or chapters. 
%
However, none of the \acrshort{ttwodm} \chis\ we analyzed used a visual document exploration system with multi-dimensional adaptivity for health information consumers.



These results show that existing \chis\ on \acrshort{ttwodm} fall short of the potential of presenting health information in an \emph{interactive}, \emph{adaptive} and/or \emph{personalized} way, while there is evidently a need for it. 
%
The knowledge domain of \acrshort{ttwodm} is complex and comprehensive, with a wide range of information sources (brochures, websites, medical doctors, etc.) and high diversity of topics (such as symptoms, treatments, nutrition, etc.). 
%
This might be overwhelming for laypersons without medical expertise seeking knowledge in the field. Such complex information situations usually put a high \emph{intrinsic cognitive load}**Kester et al., "Cognitive Load Theory: A Review"** on the working memory during information processing and often lead to information seekers applying heuristics and cognitive biases at every stage of information processing. 
%
Such cognitive biases, misconceptions, and even myths about \acrshort{ttwodm} may lead to unhealthy behavior with severe health-related consequences. 


An \emph{interactive} \chis\ has the potential to (i) track behavioral patterns and explicit feedback of consumers, (ii) interpret these indicators in terms of certain cognitive biases (\eg\ the confirmation bias), and (iii) intervene if necessary (\eg\ by suggesting other pieces or sources of information). 

An \emph{adaptive} \chis\ can match the information units to the users and their current information needs. 
%
It can thus balance the \emph{intrinsic cognitive load} to a medium level and ensure that the consumer is neither too bored nor too overwhelmed. 
%
This is in line with the transfer of Vygotsky’s concept of the \emph{zone of proximal development}**Vygotsky, "The Zone of Proximal Development"** to digital learning environments**Kester et al., "Adapting Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development for Digital Learning Environments"**, the outer fringe as suggested by the competence-based knowledge space theory**Soller et al., "Competence-Based Knowledge Spaces: A Review"** and constitutes a solid basis for an enjoyable flow for consumers**Csikszentmihalyi, "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience"**.
%
All these theories emphasize that a medium difficulty of information units lead to a successful processing outcome. The intermediate goal is to successively reach more advanced levels of learning outcomes as suggested by Krathwohl**Krathwohl, "A Taxonomy for Learning, Teaching and Assessing: A Revision of Bloom's Taxonomy"**, which means not simply remembering information, but also applying and evaluating it.


A \emph{personalized} \chis\ can foster a consumers’ personal commitment to engage with the system and information, and thus help to close the `intention-behaviour gap’ or `attitude-action gap'**Pillemer et al., "Intention-Behaviour Gap in Health"**.
%
In our work, we intend to increase visual and health literacy by gathering user information during exploration and providing adapted health information based on that.
