	abstract = {The two core assumptions of the E–Z Reader model of eye-movement control during reading are that: (1) a preliminary stage of lexical access (i.e., the familiarity check) triggers the initiation of a saccadic program to move the eyes from one word to the next; and (2) attention is allocated serially, to one word at a time. This paper provides an overview of the model, some of the research that motivated its assumptions, and the various reading-related phenomena that the model can account for. This paper also summarizes how the model has been and is currently being used to guide empirical research.},

	abstract = {Web analytics has changed significantly in recent years. As part of the big data revolution, frequent low-level user actions, such as mouse movements and clicks, are often used in modern web analytics. Various studies show that when a user moves or clicks the mouse, the position of the mouse cursor is relatively close to the position of the eye gaze on the screen. Accordingly, mouse cursor positions can indicate user attention and interest in specific areas of web pages. This study focuses on mouse movement directions and speeds rather than on mouse cursor positions. A statistical analysis of mouse movements on an online learning website, which was selected for this study, sheds light on several interesting patterns. For example, most mouse movements in the examined usage data are either approximately horizontal or approximately vertical, and horizontal mouse movements are more frequent than vertical mouse movements. Besides, horizontal movements to the left are not equivalent to horizontal movements to the right, in terms of moving time and speed. As this study shows, these statistical findings are related to Pointer Assisted Reading (PAR), a reading behavior consisting of moving the mouse cursor (also known as the mouse pointer) along sentences, marking the reading position, similarly to finger-pointing when reading a book. Associating mouse movements with text reading may potentially highlight content that most users tend to skip, and therefore, might not interest the website's audience, as well as content that many readers read more than once or slowly, suggesting a lack of clarity or ambiguity. As discussed in this paper, this could be useful in locating issues in the textual content of websites and especially in online learning and educational technology applications.},

    abstract = {Past studies of user behavior in Web search have correlated eye-gaze and mouse cursor positions, and other lines of research have found cursor interactions to be useful in determining user intent and relevant parts of Web pages. However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, findings which lead us to question the maxim that "gaze is well approximated by cursor." These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages.},
