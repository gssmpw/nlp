abstract = {In recent decades, deep learning approaches have shown impressive results in many applications. However, most of these approaches rely on manually crafted architectures for a specific task in large design space, allowing room for sub-optimal designs, which are more prone to be stuck in local minima and to overfit. Therefore, there is considerable motivation in performing architecture search for solving a specific task. In this work, we propose an initialization technique for design space exploration of deep neural networks architectures based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). When compared with random initialization using standard datasets in machine learning such as MNIST, and CIFAR-10, the proposed approach shows to be promissory on the neural architectural search domain, outperforming the commonly used random initialization.},

    abstract = { Data from experiments and direct simulations of turbulence have historically been used to calibrate simple engineering models such as those based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. In the past few years, with the availability of large and diverse data sets, researchers have begun to explore methods to systematically inform turbulence models with data, with the goal of quantifying and reducing model uncertainties. This review surveys recent developments in bounding uncertainties in RANS models via physical constraints, in adopting statistical inference to characterize model coefficients and estimate discrepancy, and in using machine learning to improve turbulence models. Key principles, achievements, and challenges are discussed. A central perspective advocated in this review is that by exploiting foundational knowledge in turbulence modeling and physical constraints, researchers can use data-driven approaches to yield useful predictive models. }

Passive dynamics is typically analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, relying on the separation of the linearized hovering dynamics into longitudinal and lateral parts. While the longitudinal dynamics are relatively understood across several insect models, our current understanding of the lateral dynamics is lacking, with a nontrivial dependence on wing–wing interaction and on the details of wing kinematics. Particularly, the passive stability of the fruit fly, D. melanogaster, which is a central model in insect flight research, has so far been analyzed using simplified quasi-steady aerodynamics and synthetic wing kinematics. Here, we perform a CFD-based lateral stability analysis of a hovering fruit fly, using accurately measured wing kinematics, and considering wing–wing interaction. Lateral dynamics are unstable due to an oscillating–diverging mode with a doubling time of 17 wingbeats. These dynamics are determined by wing–wing interaction and the wing elevation kinematics. Finally, we show that the fly's roll controller, with its one wingbeat latency, is consistent with the lateral instability. This work highlights the importance of accurate wing kinematics and wing–wing interactions in stability analyses and forms a link between such passive instability and the insects' controller.}",
