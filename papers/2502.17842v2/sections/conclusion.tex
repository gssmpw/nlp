In this work, we propose an innovative Goal-Oriented Semantic Variational Autoencoder (GOS-VAE) for task/goal-oriented communications, shifting the focus from visual quality or bit-wise recovery to conveying task-driven semantic features. Particularly, the proposed GOS-VAE defines ``semantic information" through end-to-end learning using a downstream task model and leverages imitation learning to preserve essential semantics in reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GOS-VAE framework delivers exceptional performance on the downstream task, surpassing previous methods while utilizing a low-complexity model architecture. Our future work plans to explore more advanced architectures for GO-COM, such as transformer and diffusion-based models, integrated with self-supervised learning.
