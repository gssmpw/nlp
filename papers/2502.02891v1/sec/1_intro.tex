Shape modeling and manipulation are essential across fields like computer graphics, animation, Computer-Aided Design (CAD), and virtual reality, fueling decades of research. Traditionally, shapes have been represented using explicit methods like BÃ©zier curves, splines, and polygonal meshes, which allow direct manipulation of control points or vertices for flexible 3D modeling.

Over time, shape representations in practice expanded to also include point clouds, voxel grids, and volumetric models. Among these, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) \cite{bloomenthal1997introduction, osher2004level} became popular for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) \cite{foley199612}, offering a compact way to define complex geometries by level set functions that measure distances to surfaces.
Recently, implicit neural representations (INRs) have gained attention for encoding 3D shapes continuously and compactly using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) \cite{sitzmann2020implicit}. Neural Signed Distance Functions (neural SDFs), in particular, allow a network to estimate the SDF of a shape, achieving infinite resolution and efficient storage for complex geometries \cite{park2019deepsdf, atzmon2020sal, atzmon2020sald}. However, neural implicit representations are difficult to edit; unlike meshes or splines, where vertices or control points allow direct adjustments, neural SDF parameters are embedded within network weights, making local modifications challenging. This lack of interactive editability in neural SDFs limits their applicability.

While some efforts attempt to enhance neural SDF editability by modifying shape codes or latent spaces \cite{deng2021deformed}, they often lack fine control and real-time feedback. In contrast, traditional sculpting tools allow intuitive, real-time surface manipulation, essential in fields like animation and design. However, such an interactive toolkit is yet to be realized for neural implicit representations.

In this work, we introduce an expressive framework that addresses the challenge of editing 3D shapes represented by neural SDFs. Our method provides a comprehensive, real-time toolkit for sculpting and carving shapes, offering users fine-grained control over surface modifications. Unlike prior approaches that focus on limited, point edits with significant latency \cite{tzathas20233d}, our work supports stroke-based edits, allowing users to define arbitrary brush profiles and apply them across surfaces in real time.

Our approach leverages efficient tubular sampling to create smooth, continuous deformations along a user-defined stroke. This enables real-time feedback and intuitive control, similar to traditional sculpting tools. The flexibility of the framework also allows for the integration of complex user-defined brush profiles, supporting a versatile range of specialized edits and enhancing the creative potential of artists and designers. With this toolkit, complex shapes can be both represented and edited within the same framework, eliminating the need to switch between different representations.

To summarize, our main contributions include
\begin{itemize}
\item We introduce an interactive toolkit, INST-Sculpt, for editing neural SDFs with stroke-based capabilities tailored for 3D modeling.
\item Our framework allows for custom brush profiles with modulation along the stroke path, supporting effects like chiseled strokes, asymmetric shapes, and simultaneous carving and extrusion.
\item We present efficient tubular sampling for stroke-based deformations in neural SDFs, achieving up to 16x speedup over prior point-based methods, resulting in near-instantaneous user feedback during editing.
\item Extensive experiments validate the efficiency, flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.

% \textbf{Explicitly add contributions list}
% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{Language}

% All manuscripts must be in English.

% \subsection{Dual submission}

% Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a
% discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

% \subsection{Paper length}
% Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length.
% The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section.
% For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
% {\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confName\ \confYear.}

% Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.
% This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide.
% Note that this \LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
% The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts.
% The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven.

% %-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% \subsection{The ruler}
% The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review.
% The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution.
% If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\ document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages.
% The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.
% The camera-ready copy should not contain a ruler.
% (\LaTeX\ users may use options of \texttt{cvpr.sty} to switch between different versions.)

% Reviewers:
% note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper --- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.
% Just use fractional references (\eg, this line is $087.5$), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.


% \subsection{Paper ID}
% Make sure that the Paper ID from the submission system is visible in the version submitted for review (replacing the ``*****'' you see in this document).
% If you are using the \LaTeX\ template, \textbf{make sure to update paper ID in the appropriate place in the tex file}.


% \subsection{Mathematics}

% Please number all of your sections and displayed equations as in these examples:
% \begin{equation}
%   E = m\cdot c^2
%   \label{eq:important}
% \end{equation}
% and
% \begin{equation}
%   v = a\cdot t.
%   \label{eq:also-important}
% \end{equation}
% It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.
% Just because you did not refer to it in the text does not mean some future reader might not need to refer to it.
% It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''.
% (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers).
% All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
% \url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

% \subsection{Blind review}

% Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review.
% Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available.

% Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing previous work.
% That is all.
% (But see below for tech reports.)

% Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy Smith;
% it says that you are building on her work.
% If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

% An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{center}
%     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
% \end{center}

%    In this paper we present a performance analysis of our previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
%    Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

%    [1] Removed for blind review
% \end{quote}


% An example of an acceptable paper:
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{center}
%      An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
% \end{center}

%    In this paper we present a performance analysis of the  paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
%    Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

%    [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''. Nature 381(12), 1-213.
% \end{quote}

% If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
% In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as supplemental material and cite it as
% \begin{quote}
% [1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324, Supplied as supplemental material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
% \end{quote}

% Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.
% For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.
% Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.
% Then submit the tech report as supplemental material.
% Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

% Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool that is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.
% For example, let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the 1970 audience would like to hear about your
% solution.
% The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

% You can handle this paper like any other.
% Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
% This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
% That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
% Instead write the following:
% \begin{quotation}
% \noindent
%    We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
%    This system is new because it handles the following cases:
%    A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
%    Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

%    ...

%    The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
%    It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
% \end{quotation}
% As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors.
% A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
% He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B.

% FAQ\medskip\\
% {\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
% {\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
% {\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
% {\bf A:} To conform with the double-blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper.
% For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge.
% Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

% Compare the following:\\
% \begin{tabular}{ll}
%  \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
%  \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
% \end{tabular}\\
% See The \TeX book, p165.

% The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
% So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
% The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

% When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
% If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
% However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
% Thus, the following is correct:
%    ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
%    It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
%    Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

% This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.
