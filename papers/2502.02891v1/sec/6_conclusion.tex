\section{Conclusion}
We presented INST-Sculpt, a framework for interactive sculpting of neural signed distance functions, enabling efficient stroke-based editing with customizable brush profiles and modulation along the curve. By establishing a tailored coordinate system and leveraging tubular sampling, our approach achieves smooth, controlled deformations in real time. This work bridges traditional 3D editing tools with neural implicit representations, enhancing the applicability of neural SDFs in scientific and artistic fields. Future research may explore region-weight localization with reversible editing, to elevate neural SDFs as an expressive medium for 3D design.
