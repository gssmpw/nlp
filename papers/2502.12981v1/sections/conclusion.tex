\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduced Riemannian Gaussian Variational Flow Matching (RG-VFM), extending VFM to structured manifolds through Riemannian Gaussian distributions. Our approach unifies RFM and VFM under a common probabilistic framework, with experiments on spherical data demonstrating superior performance over Euclidean-based methods. These results establish RG-VFM as a promising framework for modeling distributions on complex geometries, with applications in molecular modeling and physics-informed generative tasks.
