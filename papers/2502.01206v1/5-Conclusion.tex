\section{CONCLUSION}
We propose PerfSeer, a novel predictor that efficiently and accurately predicts key performance metrics for models during both training and inference. 
To accurately predict the performance, PerfSeer abstracts a model into a graph with the node, edge, and global features and uses SeerNet, which leverages these features and incorporates optimizations like SynMM and GNPB.
To effectively predict multiple performance metrics simultaneously while maintaining accuracy, PerfSeer implements SeerNet-Multi with PCGrad. 
The evaluation results show that PerfSeer has low overhead and high prediction accuracy, making it suitable for broad applications.
