  \caption{Predicted performance metrics versus measured performance metrics. 
    The points falling on the x\% error area represent that the absolute error of the prediction of the sample is within the absolute error bound x\%.
    % Additionally, due to the large size of the test set, only 2000 randomly sampled samples are displayed in the figure, with the value in brackets calculated from the complete test set.
