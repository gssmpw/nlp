  \caption{Architecture of SeerBlock. The target features for aggregation or update are represented in \textcolor[RGB]{70, 114, 196}{"blue"}; the features required during the aggregation or update are represented in "black"; irrelevant features are represented in \textcolor[RGB]{120, 120, 120}{"gray"}. 
  The function $\phi^x$ represents the update function for feature $x$, while $\rho^{x \rightarrow y}$ represents the aggregation function for feature $x$, with the aggregated result used to update feature $y$.}
