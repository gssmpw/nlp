    \caption{\textbf{Average Log Likelihood Over Cost.} 
    We show the average log likelihood of all the outcomes in our offline dataset against the cost of evaluation for MetaWorld Policies, MetaWorld Checkpoints, HAMSTER, and OpenVLA over \textcolor{mypink}{continuous} and \textcolor{mygold}{binary} performance distributions.
    Each set of experiments is run for 1500 trials.
    % We find that EIG-based approaches generally outperform random baselines, both in the task- and policy-task-based sampling.
    We find that EIG-based approaches struggle to model the true distribution in a more cost-efficient manner than Random Task sampling.
    Task-based sampling strategies are more cost-efficient than policy-task approaches.
