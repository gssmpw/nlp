    \caption{\textbf{Predicted Mean Distributions.}
    We provide a visualization of the means for the predicted \textcolor{mypink}{continuous} and \textcolor{mygold}{binary} distributions over 0, 150, and 750 sampled queries. 
    We use random sampling with 3 evaluations per policy-task pair to show that our surrogate model can actively learn the full distribution of performance as well as have a good understanding of the performance distribution over time.
    For example, for MetaWorld Policies at $t=750$, $750/3=250$ policy-task pairs were sampled of the total $50*10=500$ possible policy-task pairs that could be evaluated, the estimated mean performance is qualitatively comparable to the true mean; Figure~\ref{fig:l1_exps} reports these results quantitatively as L1 error.
    % the estimation of the mean performance looks comparable to the true mean.
