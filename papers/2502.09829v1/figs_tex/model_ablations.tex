    \caption{\textbf{Modeling Ablations.} \textit{Left:} In standard test set evaluation, a test set is i.i.d.~random sampled to cover the domain of possible language, scene and behaviors that a robot can execute. It can be expensive to reset the scene to each new test instance during experiments. \textit{Middle:} In this work, we design contrast sets~\cite{gardner2020evaluating} for language-guided robot evaluation, comprising perturbation strategies based on the language, scene, and expected behavior of the robot. \textit{Right:} The proposed contrast set evaluation allows experimenters to efficiently evaluate neighborhoods around original test instances.
