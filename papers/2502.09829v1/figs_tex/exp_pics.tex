    \caption{\textbf{Offline Datasets used for Experiments.} We consider 4 settings: (1) evaluations from HAMSTER~\cite{li2025hamster}, (2) evaluations from the OpenVLA paper~\cite{kim24openvla}, (3) MetaWorld~\cite{yu2020meta} where we evaluate different policies, and (4) MetaWorld where we evaluate multiple checkpoints of a single policy. For the MetaWorld evaluations, we can model the performance distributions of success rate or continuous rewards. For OpenVLA, the outcomes are binary success rate. For HAMSTER, evaluations were run over a large number of tasks only once while tracking only task progress, so we use this mean value as a mean for a unimodal Gaussian and a fixed standard deviation.
