    \caption{\textbf{Overview.} 
    Exhaustively evaluating multiple robot policies across various tasks has high experimenter cost.
    In this work, we leverage latent relationships between tasks and policies to model performance distributions across all tasks and policies. 
    These estimates are updated sequentially and used to implement cost-aware active experiment selection strategies.
