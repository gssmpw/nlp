    % When an experimenter has multiple robot policies across various tasks, it becomes difficult to evaluate a robot across all these combinations.
    % In this work, we note that likely have relationships between each other that may indicate a task's performance. 
    We build a surrogate parameter estimation model that learns task and policy embeddings to predict the outcome performance distribution of a task and policy combination. 
    We use Bernoulli distributions for binary outcomes or a bimodal Gaussian for continuous outcomes.
    Given this parameter estimation model, we develop an active testing strategy with cost-aware sampling based on expected information gain.
