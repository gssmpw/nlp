    \caption{\textbf{Average L1 Error of the Mean Over Cost.} Instead of computing the average log likelihood of the data as in Figure~\ref{fig:cost_exps}, we compute the error between the ground truth means of a policy-task pair and the mean of the predicted probability distribution. 
    In this case, we find that our method is better able to estimate the means for both \textcolor{mypink}{continuous} and \textcolor{mygold}{binary} distributions.
    We find that task sampling methods are generally more cost-efficient for the same average log likelihood than the policy-task sampling methods.
