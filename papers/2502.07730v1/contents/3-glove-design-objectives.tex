\section{Glove Design Objectives}

\oursystem is designed to precisely capture human hand poses and provide haptic force feedback for intuitive teleoperation. While ensuring these functionalities, the glove is optimized for accessibility by the research community, focusing on low cost, ease of manufacturing, and high performance. To achieve these goals, \oursystem incorporates the following design principles:

\subsection{\textbf{Low cost}}
Commercial products such as the SenseGlove Nova~\cite{senseglove} and Manus VR~\cite{manusmeta} cost more than 5,000~USD, making them prohibitively expensive for many researchers. In contrast, \oursystem provides a low-cost solution under 600~USD.

\subsection{\textbf{Ease of manufacturing}}
All parts of \oursystem are either readily available for purchase online or manufacturable using standard methods. The glove’s main body can be 3D-printed using a commodity 3D printer, while the remaining electronics and servos are easily sourced. The entire glove can be assembled within 6 hours.

\subsection{\textbf{Performance Sufficiency}}
To ensure precise fingertip position tracking, the glove's encoders deliver joint angle data with an error range of ±7.2°, which can be further minimized through careful calibration. For intuitive haptic force feedback, the servos provide sufficient stall torque to halt human finger movement, while the haptic engine supports multiple haptic waveforms to enhance tactile sensations.

\subsection{\textbf{Low latency}}
The MoCap system operates at a maximum frequency of 120~Hz, while the haptic force feedback system achieves a maximum frequency of 30~Hz. Together with the retargeting algorithm, the system ensures seamless operation at a minimum frequency of 30~Hz, providing a smooth and responsive teleoperation experience.
