\section{Limitations and Future Work}

\oursystem is a powerful haptic force feedback glove for dexterous manipulation, but several limitations remain.
%
First, the weight of \oursystem is inevitably high, as it utilizes 5 commercial servos, bringing the total weight to 550g. Additionally, in agile teleoperation scenarios, performance is constrained by the servos' maximum speed and torque output.
%
To address these issues, we are investigating the use of lighter servos with smaller reduction ratios and designing a customized reduction mechanism to balance speed and torque more effectively.
%
Second, although \oursystem is designed to accommodate most hand sizes, it may be uncomfortable for some users. 
%
To enhance adaptability and wearability, we are developing CAD files for linkages in multiple sizes, enabling customization for various hand dimensions.
