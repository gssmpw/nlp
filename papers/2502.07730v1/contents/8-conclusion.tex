\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present \oursystem, a low-cost, open-source haptic force feedback glove designed for dexterous manipulation. \oursystem enables precise and efficient execution of long-horizon, contact-rich tasks. Experimental results show that \oursystem enhances the operator's immersive teleoperation experience while also serving as an effective tool for training imitation learning policies. Moreover, the user study demonstrates that \oursystem provides precise perception of object properties through its integrated haptic force feedback. To support further research and contribute to the community, all hardware designs and code will be open-sourced.
