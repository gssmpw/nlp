  \textbf{The imitation learning experiment.}
  (a) The robot must first locate the correct position of the box and then apply adequate force to press it. Excessive force prevents movement, while insufficient force causes the fingers to slip.
  (b) The robot must first locate the bear, then open its hand to grasp it. Due to the bear's size, precise grasping control is required. An inaccurate grasp deforms the bear and causes it to slip out of the fingertips.
