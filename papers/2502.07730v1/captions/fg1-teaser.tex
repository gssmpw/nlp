\captionof{figure}{\textbf{\oursystem}, a haptic force feedback glove designed for precise teleoperation and dexterous manipulation. It features 21-DoF motion capture and 5-DoF haptic force feedback. By leveraging action and force retargeting, it enables the teleoperation of dexterous hands for complex, contact-rich tasks, including:
%
a) without visual feedback, adjusting contact force with a bottle during teleoperation,
%
b) regulating the flow of condensed milk, and
%
c) performing in-hand rotation by using haptic force feedback to adjust friction.
