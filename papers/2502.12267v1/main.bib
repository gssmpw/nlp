%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

	abstract = {Recent techniques that integrate {\textbackslash}emph\{solver layers\} into Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise in bridging a long-standing gap between inductive learning and symbolic reasoning techniques. In this paper we present a set of techniques for integrating {\textbackslash}emph\{Satisfiability Modulo Theories\} (SMT) solvers into the forward and backward passes of a deep network layer, called SMTLayer. Using this approach, one can encode rich domain knowledge into the network in the form of mathematical formulas. In the forward pass, the solver uses symbols produced by prior layers, along with these formulas, to construct inferences; in the backward pass, the solver informs updates to the network, driving it towards representations that are compatible with the solver's theory. Notably, the solver need not be differentiable. We implement {\textbackslash}layername as a Pytorch module, and our empirical results show that it leads to models that {\textbackslash}emph\{1)\} require fewer training samples than conventional models, {\textbackslash}emph\{2)\} that are robust to certain types of covariate shift, and {\textbackslash}emph\{3)\} that ultimately learn representations that are consistent with symbolic knowledge, and thus naturally interpretable.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a predictive approach for collision risk assessment in autonomous and assisted driving. A deep predictive model is trained to anticipate imminent accidents from traditional video streams. In particular, the model learns to identify cues in RGB images that are predictive of hazardous upcoming situations. In contrast to previous work, our approach incorporates (a) temporal information during decision making, (b) multi-modal information about the environment, as well as the proprioceptive state and steering actions of the controlled vehicle, and (c) information about the uncertainty inherent to the task. To this end, we discuss Deep Predictive Models and present an implementation using a Bayesian Convolutional LSTM. Experiments in a simple simulation environment show that the approach can learn to predict impending accidents with reasonable accuracy, especially when multiple cameras are used as input sources.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2210.05989},
	abstract = {Capturing uncertainty in models of complex dynamical systems is crucial to designing safe controllers. Stochastic noise causes aleatoric uncertainty, whereas imprecise knowledge of model parameters leads to epistemic uncertainty. Several approaches use formal abstractions to synthesize policies that satisfy temporal specifications related to safety and reachability. However, the underlying models exclusively capture aleatoric but not epistemic uncertainty, and thus require that model parameters are known precisely. Our contribution to overcoming this restriction is a novel abstraction-based controller synthesis method for continuous-state models with stochastic noise and uncertain parameters. By sampling techniques and robust analysis, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, with a user-specified confidence level, in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). We synthesize an optimal policy on this iMDP, which translates (with the specified confidence level) to a feedback controller for the continuous model with the same performance guarantees. Our experimental benchmarks confirm that accounting for epistemic uncertainty leads to controllers that are more robust against variations in parameter values.},

Existing deepfake detection methods present two primary limitations; i.e., they are trained on a specific type of deepfake dataset, which renders them vulnerable to unseen deepfakes, and they regard deepfakes as a “black box” with limited explainability, making it difficult for non-AI experts to understand and trust the decisions. Hence, this article proposes a novel neurosymbolic deepfake detection framework that exploits the fact that human emotions cannot be imitated easily owing to their complex nature. We argue that deep fakes typically exhibit inter- or intra-modality inconsistencies in the emotional expressions of the person being manipulated. Thus, the proposed framework performs inter- and intra-modality reasoning on emotions extracted from audio and visual modalities using a psychological and arousal-valence model for deepfake detection. In addition to fake detection, the proposed framework provides textual explanations for its decisions. The results obtained using the Presidential Deepfakes Dataset and World Leaders Dataset of real and manipulated videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting deepfakes and highlight the potential of a neurosymbolic approach for expandability.},

	abstract = {Conventional Human–Machine Interaction (HMI) interfaces have predominantly relied on GUI and voice commands. However, natural human communication also consists of non-verbal communication, including hand gestures like pointing. Thus, recent works in HMI systems have tried to incorporate pointing gestures as an input, making significant progress in recognizing and integrating them with voice commands. However, existing approaches often treat these input modalities independently, limiting their capacity to handle complex multimodal instructions requiring intricate reasoning of language and gestures. On the other hand, multimodal tasks requiring complex reasoning are being challenged in the language and vision domain, but these typically do not include gestures like pointing. To bridge this gap, we explore one of the challenging multimodal tasks, called Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), within multimodal HMI systems incorporating pointing gestures. We present a virtual setup in which a robot shares an environment with a user and is tasked with identifying objects based on the user’s language and gestural instructions. Furthermore, to address this challenge, we propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic model combining deep learning’s versatility with symbolic reasoning’s interpretability. Our contributions include a challenging multimodal REC dataset for HMI systems, an interpretable neuro-symbolic model, and an assessment of its ability to generalize the reasoning to unseen environments, complemented by an in-depth qualitative analysis of the model’s inner workings.},

	abstract = {Autonomous systems with machine learning-based perception can exhibit unpredictable behaviors that are difficult to quantify, let alone verify. Such behaviors are convenient to capture in proba-bilistic models, but probabilistic model checking of such models is difficult to scale - largely due to the non-determinism added to models as a prerequisite for provable conservatism. Statistical model checking (SMC) has been proposed to address the scalabil-ity issue. However it requires large amounts of data to account for the aforementioned non-determinism, which in turn limits its scalability. This work introduces a general technique for reduction of non-determinism based on assumptions of “monotonic safety”, which define a partial order between system states in terms of their probabilities of being safe. We exploit these assumptions to remove non-determinism from controller/plant models to drasti-cally speed up probabilistic model checking and statistical model checking while providing provably conservative estimates as long as the safety is indeed monotonic. Our experiments demonstrate model-checking speed-ups of an order of magnitude while main-taining acceptable accuracy and require much less data for accurate estimates when running SMC - even when monotonic safety does not perfectly hold and provable conservatism is not achieved.},

	abstract = {Autonomous systems are increasingly implemented using end-end-end trained controllers. Such controllers make decisions that are executed on the real system with images as one of the primary sensing modalities. Deep neural networks form a fundamental building block of such controllers. Unfortunately, the existing neural-network verification tools do not scale to inputs with thousands of dimensions. Especially when the individual inputs (such as pixels) are devoid of clear physical meaning. This paper takes a step towards connecting exhaustive closed-loop verification with high-dimensional controllers. Our key insight is that the behavior of a high-dimensional controller can be approximated with several low-dimensional controllers in different regions of the state space. To balance approximation and verifiability, we leverage the latest verification-aware knowledge distillation. Then, if low-dimensional reachability results are inflated with statistical approximation errors, they yield a high-confidence reachability guarantee for the high-dimensional controller. We investigate two inflation techniques -- based on trajectories and actions -- both of which show convincing performance in two OpenAI gym benchmarks.},

First, we introduce a notion of approximate conformance on NNs, which allows us to quantify semantically the deviations in closed-loop system behaviors with different NN controllers. Next, we consider the problem of computationally checking this notion of approximate conformance on two NNs. We reduce this problem to that of reachability analysis on a combined NN, thereby, enabling the use of existing NN verification tools for conformance checking. Our experimental results on an autonomous rocket landing system demonstrate the feasibility of checking approximate conformance on different NNs trained for the same dynamics, as well as the practical semantic closeness exhibited by the corresponding closed-loop systems.},
