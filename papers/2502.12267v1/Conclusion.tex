This paper explores the potential and challenges of neurosymbolic paradigms for designing, testing, and verifying autonomous CPS. We propose \textbf{NeuroStrata}, a framework enabling top-down synthesis of symbolic and neurosymbolic components for perception and planning/control, and bottom-up adaptation of symbolic programs for real-time decisions. Early results validate neural alignment with specifications. We outline challenges and solutions for implementing \textbf{NeuroStrata}, aiming to bridge theoretical advancements and practical applications, transforming autonomous CPS testing and verification in real-world scenarios.

%This paper explores the gaps, potential, and applications of neurosymbolic paradigms for designing, testing, and verifying autonomous CPS. We propose \textbf{NeuroStrata}, a framework enabling top-down synthesis of symbolic and neurosymbolic components for perception and planning/control modules, and bottom-up adaptation of symbolic programs for real-time decision-making. Early results demonstrate the feasibility of aligning neuroal components with specifications and adapting symbolic programs to new information. To develop and evaluate \textbf{NeuroStrata}, we propose a comprehensive plan beginning with the generation of diverse training datasets to cover edge cases and out-of-distribution scenarios. A specification mining module, leveraging neurosymbolic distillation, will be developed to extract formal safety and liveness specifications. These specifications will be used for top-down synthesis of perception and planning/control components and for creating a design-time verifier and runtime validator to ensure compliance. Finally, \textbf{NeuroStrata} will be deployed and validated in collaboration with industry partners, applying it to autonomous driving systems, delivery drones, cargo drones, and the most critical passenger aircraft autonomy systems.
%Future work will focus on neurosymbolic distillation first and then finalizing the top-down synthesis and bottom-up adaptation of the NeuroStrata framework for industrial evaluation.
