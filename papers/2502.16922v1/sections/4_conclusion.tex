\section{Conclusion}
We introduce CTM, a benchmark designed to
evaluate LLMs on temporal reasoning and alignment across Chinese dynasties.
CTM benchmark emphasizes contextualization, cross-entity relationships, and temporal alignment.
Empirical evaluations on various LLMs reveal the challenges posed by CTM, demonstrating that existing LLMs struggle with nuanced temporal understanding. 
These findings through analysis suggest the need for improved pretraining, structured knowledge integration, and refined reasoning mechanisms.
CTM provides a culturally rich resource for advancing temporal reasoning research.
