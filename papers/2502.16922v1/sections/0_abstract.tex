Temporal reasoning is fundamental to human cognition and is crucial for various real-world applications. 
While recent advances in Large Language Models have demonstrated promising capabilities in temporal reasoning, existing benchmarks primarily rely on rule-based construction, lack contextual depth, and involve a limited range of temporal entities. 
To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{C}hinese \textbf{T}i\textbf{m}e Reasoning (CTM), a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on temporal reasoning within the extensive scope of Chinese dynastic chronology.
CTM emphasizes cross-entity relationships, pairwise temporal alignment, and contextualized and culturally-grounded reasoning, providing a comprehensive evaluation. 
Extensive experimental results reveal the challenges posed by CTM and highlight potential avenues for improvement.\footnote{Code and dataset are available at~\url{https://github.com/Linking-ai/ctm_bench}}
