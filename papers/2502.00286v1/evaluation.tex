As a baseline for our design exploration, we use the NVDLA architecture paradigm, which include MAC arrays ranging from 64 to 2048 PEs in powers of $2$. The sizes of the local and global convolution buffers scale proportionally with the dimensions of the MAC arrays, as specified by NVIDIA \cite{nvdla2017}. To evaluate these configurations, we employ two specialized tools: the nn-dataflow~\cite{gao2019tangram}, to estimate DNN workload performance, and ApproxTrain~\cite{gong2023approxtrain}, to calculate the accuracy impact of the approximate multipliers.

Figure \ref{fig:combined} illustrates the trade-off between embodied carbon and performance for DNN accelerators running VGG16 at the 7nm technology node. The configurations for the exact (baseline) accelerator show exponential carbon increase as the architecture becomes more compute-intensive. By incorporating approximate units only, while keeping the architecture unchanged (same number of PEs and memory), we achieved a $5\%$ reduction in embodied carbon. In our experiments, we tested approximate units that resulted in accuracy losses of up to 0.5\%, 1.0\%, and 2.0\% (Appx in legend). Similar trends appeared at 14nm and 28nm, as shown in the corresponding table, with gains of up to $12.75\%$. 
However, the frames per second (FPS) achieved by large accelerators often far exceed the requirements for edge applications~\cite{gupta2022act}. To address this, we applied realistic performance thresholds of 30, 40, and 50 FPS and utilized our genetic algorithm with approximate multipliers. This approach significantly reduced the embodied carbon footprint, achieving reductions of up to 50\%. Each point on the plot (GA-CDP in legend) represents an accelerator design that optimizes the CDP while meeting the specified performance thresholds (30, 40, and 50 FPS).

% 2nd reviewer comment: Not clear why the footprint for 7/14/28nm is the same (I would expect it to be different...).

To validate our methodology, we evaluated VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and ResNet152, on ImageNET subset, across $7$, $14$, and $28$ nm nodes. Figure \ref{fig:overview2} compares three designs: the exact baseline meeting a $30$ FPS threshold, an approximate version using area-efficient multipliers with up to $2.0\%$ accuracy drop, and our proposed solution (GA-CDP). While approximation alone reduces embodied carbon, our methodoogy further optimizes the design through minimal architecture and efficient multipliers. Results show significant reductions in embodied carbon across all networks and nodes, with up to $65\%$ savings for VGG16 and $30\%$â€“$70\%$ for others, proving that our approach creates sustainable, performance-compliant designs.
