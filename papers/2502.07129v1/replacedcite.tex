%Traditional Approaches
The development of mathematical models and numerical methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations has been a major focus of research for decades. These models and methods are widely used in many scientific fields, such as physics, engineering, and biology, to understand complex systems and make predictions about their behavior. Numerical approaches for solving differential equations, such as Euler's Method ____, Runge-Kutta Method ____, the finite element method (FEM) ____, finite difference method (FDM) ____ and finite volume method (FVM) ____, usually involve analytical or numerical techniques that rely on well-established mathematical theories.
These methods have proven to be effective and accurate for many problems, but they often require significant computational resources and can be limited in their ability to handle complex systems. In recent years, machine learning approaches have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods for solving differential equations. In this section, we will review both traditional and machine learning approaches for solving differential equations, with a focus on their applications in scientific problems.

% In this section, we will review machine learning approaches for solving differential equations, with a particular focus on physics-informed neural networks (PINN), which has demonstrated remarkable performance in various scientific fields and have emerged as a promising member of the machine learning family.

\subsection{Machine Learning Approaches}

Traditional numerical methods for solving differential equations often involve discretizing the space, which leads to a trade-off between computational efficiency and resolution. Finer grids offer better accuracy but can be computationally expensive, while coarser grids are faster but less accurate. To address these limitations, machine learning approaches such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) ____, Deep Galerkin Method (DGM) ____, Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) ____, and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have emerged as promising alternatives.

Neural ODEs represent dynamical systems using continuous-time ordinary differential equations, where the coefficients are neural network functions. They can learn complex dynamics from data even when the underlying system is not well understood. Neural ODEs have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems, including image processing ____ and time-series forecasting ____.

DGM is a machine learning approach that uses deep neural networks to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). It approximates the PDE solution by replacing the finite-dimensional subspace in the Galerkin method with a neural network. DGM has shown promising results in solving various PDEs, including fluid dynamics ____ and heat transfer problems ____.

In addition, Physics-informed Neural Network and Fourier Neural Operator are essential in the field of solving differential equations using machine learning. In the following subsections, we will discuss these methods in detail.

% Since numerical differential equation solutions solve equations by discretizing the space, they make a trade-off in resolution: coarse grids are fast but less accurate; fine grids are accurate but slow.

% \paragraph{Neural Ordinary Differential Equations.}
% Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) ____ use a neural network to model the instantaneous rate of change in the state of a system. However, despite their apparent suitability for dynamics-governed time-series, Neural ODEs present a few disadvantages. First, they are unable to adapt to incoming data points, a fundamental requirement for real-time applications imposed by the natural direction of time.
% Second, time series are often composed of a sparse set of measurements that could be explained by many possible underlying dynamics. Neural ODEs do not capture this uncertainty. In contrast, Neural Processes (NPs) are a family of models providing uncertainty estimation and fast data adaptation but lack an explicit treatment of the flow of time.

% Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) ____ are a type of neural network that uses ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model continuous-time dynamics. Unlike traditional neural networks that use discrete-time updates, Neural ODEs are trained to find a continuous function that describes the evolution of a system over time. This allows them to capture arbitrarily long-term dependencies and provide a more accurate representation of dynamic systems. Neural ODEs have been successfully applied in various fields, such as image recognition, physics, and neuroscience.

% Neural Partial Differential Equations (Neural PDEs) ____ use partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the dynamics of a system. Unlike Neural ODEs, which operate on a single dimension, Neural PDEs can model systems in multiple dimensions, making them flexibility for more complex problems in terms of dimensions and applications. Neural PDEs have been used in applications such as fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and materials science. One advantage of Neural PDEs is their ability to handle noise and uncertainty, making them useful for modeling complex systems that involve stochasticity.
% \paragraph{Taylor Series.}
% Taylor series method ____ helps to compute a solution to an initial value problem in ordinary differential equations by expanding each component of the solution in a long Taylor series. The object reference model parameters are embedded as variables, and the power series can be inverted to yield the inverse function. However, though Taylor series methods is very useful for derivations and can be used to get theoretical error bounds, it has some weakness.
% First, Successive terms get very complex and hard to derive. As a result, in practical we avoid using higher-order Taylor expansions.
% Second, the truncation error tends to grow rapidly away from the expansion point, and the results are always not as efficient as curve fitting or direct approximation.

% To address these problems, we introduce Neural ODE Processes (NDPs), a new class of stochastic processes determined by a distribution over Neural ODEs. By maintaining an adaptive data-dependent distribution over the underlying ODE, we show that our model can successfully capture the dynamics of low-dimensional systems from just a few data points. At the same time, we demonstrate that NDPs scale up to challenging high-dimensional time-series with unknown latent dynamics such as rotating MNIST digits.

% \paragraph{Fourier Neural Operator.}
% Silvescu et al.(1999) ____ proposed the Fourier Neural Networks using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), and Li et al.(2020) ____ developed this technique and proposed the Fourier neural operator (FNO), which provides a data-driven method for solving differential equations. FNO uses neural networks to learn gridless, infinite-dimensional operators. Neural operators correct the grid-dependent properties of the finite-dimensional operator approach described above by producing a set of network operating parameters that can be used for different discretizations. It has the ability to transfer solutions between meshes. Compared with the former, FNO has more advantages in terms of success and accuracy, but the premise is that there is a sufficient data set, which is precisely the most difficult to achieve.

% Likewise, other Authors have provided alternative paths in data-driven scientific computing fields. For instance, Arka et al. ____ employs a framework that uses physical properties as soft constraints on the loss function. It utilizes this new loss function to model the relationship between lake temperature and other physics variables. The authors demonstrate that this hybrid model, PGNN, has better generalizability and robustness than other typical deep learning approaches. It is indeed quite common to modify the loss function in order to take scientific constraints into account. Other papers also followed this doctrine, although they have objectives. There are attempts to change or replace an existing physical model by using physics-guided loss functions.____. Sometimes, people do not have physical models ready, and can instead use mathematical approximations. This goal can also be accomplished with the help of physics-guided loss functions.____. Another popular application is to solve PDE systems, since the loss functions do take the derivatives into account. This makes them well-suited for solving PDE systems. ____
