% In systems biology, differential equations are typically used to describe and understand biological systems, but they can be computationally expensive to solve for large-scale complex systems. 
% The recent integration of machine learning and mathematical modeling offers new opportunities for scientific discoveries in biology and health. 
% As an equivalent initial/boundary value problem, the emerging physics-informed neural network (PINN) incorporates differential equations as a soft constraint on the loss function to approximate solutions without ground truth data.
% However, PINN is prone to high computational costs and fails to achieve reliable training and correct solutions for complex biological systems that usually involve highly entangled variables and nonlinear functions.

% In the paper, we propose a Fourier-enhanced neural network to efficiently and accurately predict the dynamics of systems biology models.
% The spectral periodicity characteristics underlying Fourier neural networks make them ideal for handling biological systems that often exhibit ubiquitous and vital oscillatory patterns, particularly for cellular systems. The proposed SB-FNN incorporates two customized designs for systems biology applications: an embedded Fourier neural network and a cyclic penalty function that together optimize the prediction of biological dynamics.
% Experimental results on cellular and population models further demonstrated SB-FNN's remarkable performance in both accuracy and efficiency that cannot be matched by PINN. This method can handle complex biological models, achieve better performance on six biological models, and is expected to replace PINN as the most advanced method in systems biology.

In the field of systems biology, differential equations are commonly used to model biological systems, but solving them for large-scale and complex systems can be computationally expensive. Recently, the integration of machine learning and mathematical modeling has offered new opportunities for scientific discoveries in biology and health.

The emerging physics-informed neural network (PINN) has been proposed as a solution to this problem. However, PINN can be computationally expensive and unreliable for complex biological systems.

To address these issues, we propose the Fourier-enhanced Neural Networks for systems biology (SB-FNN). SB-FNN uses an embedded Fourier neural network with an adaptive activation function and a cyclic penalty function to optimize the prediction of biological dynamics, particularly for biological systems that exhibit oscillatory patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that SB-FNN achieves better performance and is more efficient than PINN for handling complex biological models.


Experimental results on cellular and population models demonstrate that SB-FNN outperforms PINN in both accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising alternative approach for handling complex biological models. The proposed method achieved better performance on six biological models and is expected to replace PINN as the most advanced method in systems biology.
