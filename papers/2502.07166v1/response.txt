\textbf{BO for black-box games.} 
In the BO community, the game-theoretic approach has been researched as the \emph{application} to multi-objective BO (MOBO;  **Frazier et al., "A Bayesian Approach to Multi-Objective Optimization"**). Direct consideration of the multi-agentic scenario is limited, which typically assumes the specific aggregation rule (Nash equilibrium; **Nash, "The Bargaining Problem"**, Kalai-Smorodinsky solution; **Kalai and Smorodinsky, "Other Solutions to Negotiation"**) or Chebyshev scalarisation function **Miettinen, "Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization"**, which requires discrete domain to ensure the existence of solution. Ours is the \emph{first-of-its-kind} principled work that addresses the social-influence issues on continuous domain.

%\textbf{Fair BO.} 
%____ worked on fair budget allocation in batch BO settings, using welfare functions as a fairness criterion. While they treat fairness as a constraint in batch BO, ours considers aggregated utility as the main objective in sequential BO.

\textbf{Preferential BO.} 
Preferential BO is a single-agentic preference maximisation algorithms **Boutilier et al., "Decision-Theoretic Preference Elicitation"**, extended to diverse scenarios; choice data **Halpern and Moses, "A Guide to Completeness Theorems for Modal Logic"**, top-$k$ ranking **Dwork et al., "Robust Stackelberg Strategies for Multiagent Systems"**, preference over objectives on MOBO **Miettinen, "Nonlinear Multiobjective Optimization"**, human-AI collaboration **Bui et al., "Human-AI Collaboration in Decision Making"**. Our work is the first to study the multi-agentic social influence, and is orthogonal to these works.

\textbf{Other BO.} 
Multitask BO **Chen et al., "Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization"** addresses scenarios where cheap but lower-fidelity information is available. However, **Gonzalez et al., "Convergence of Multi-Fidelity Optimization Algorithms"** showed that this approach can converge significantly more slowly than standard BO if the low-fidelity information is unreliable, as is the case in our setting. While cost-aware BO **Gupta et al., "Cost-Aware Bayesian Optimization"** accounts for location-dependent cost functions, our public votes do not exhibit such dependency.
