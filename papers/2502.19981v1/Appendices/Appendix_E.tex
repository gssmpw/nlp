\section{Zero-shot Generation Accuracy}
\label{sec:appendix_E}

We test if \textbf{H1} holds up in predicting the generation accuracy on $s_d$ of Mistral and Gemma for multiple operands. Figure \ref{fig:s2_zero-shot} shows that \textbf{H1} provides an upper bound for the generation accuracy of $s_d$ in a zero-shot setting for Mistral and Gemma on $s_d$.
