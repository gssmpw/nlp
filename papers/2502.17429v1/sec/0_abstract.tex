While 3D instance segmentation has made significant progress, current methods struggle to address realistic scenarios where new categories emerge over time with natural class imbalance. This limitation stems from existing datasets, which typically feature few well-balanced classes. Although few datasets include unbalanced class annotations, they lack the diverse incremental scenarios necessary for evaluating methods under incremental settings. Addressing these challenges requires frameworks that handle both incremental learning and class imbalance. However, existing methods for 3D incremental segmentation rely heavily on large exemplar replay, focusing only on incremental learning while neglecting class imbalance. Moreover, frequency-based tuning for balanced learning is impractical in these setups due to the lack of prior class statistics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework to tackle both \textbf{C}ontinual \textbf{L}earning and class \textbf{Imb}alance for \textbf{3D} instance segmentation (\textbf{CLIMB-3D}). Our proposed approach combines Exemplar Replay (ER), Knowledge Distillation (KD), and a novel Imbalance Correction (IC) module. Unlike prior methods, our framework minimizes ER usage, with KD preventing forgetting and supporting the IC module in compiling past class statistics to balance learning of rare classes during incremental updates. To evaluate our framework, we design three incremental scenarios based on class frequency, semantic similarity, and random grouping that aim to mirror real-world dynamics in 3D environments. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an increase of up to 16.76\% in mAP compared to the baseline.
