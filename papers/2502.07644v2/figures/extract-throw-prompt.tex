Given an ERC, which contains a list of functions, events, and rules. Each function has its own rules, usually above their Solidity declaration. Rules indicating throw or check usually have patterns like
"""
{sub} [must] [throw] [condition] 
[action] [must] [throw]
caller [must] be approved to [action]
[action] are considered invalid

Other patterns that serve similar purposes also count.
