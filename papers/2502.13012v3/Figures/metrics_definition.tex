\textbf{Evaluation Metrics}                   & \textbf{Definitions}          & \textbf{Examples}                                                                                                                    \\ \midrule
Performance                 & Assess RPAs' effectiveness in task execution and outcomes.  & Prediction accuracy                                                                                     \\ 
Psychological               & Measure human psychological responses to RPAs and the agents' self-awareness and emotional state.      & Big Five Invertory                                          \\ 
External Alignment          & Evaluate how closely RPAs align with external ground truth or human behavior and judgments.  & Alignment between model and human                                                  \\ 
Internal Consistency        & Assess coherence between an RPAâ€™s predefined traits (e.g., personality), contextual expectations, and behavior. & Personality-behavior alignment                                  \\ 
Social and Decision-Making  & Analyze RPAs' social interactions and decision-making, including their effects on negotiation, societal welfare, markets, and social dynamics. & Social Conflict Count  \\ 
Content and Textual        & Evaluate the quality, coherence, and diversity of RPAs' text, including semantic understanding, linguistic style, and engagement.  & Content similarity               \\ 
Bias, Fairness, and Ethics  & Assess biases, extreme or unbalanced content, or stereotyping behavior.   & Factual error rate                                                                        \\ \bottomrule
