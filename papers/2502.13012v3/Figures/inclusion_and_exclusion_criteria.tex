    \multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Inclusion Criteria (IC)}} \\
    \midrule
        IC-1 & The LLM agents in the paper simulate humanoid behavior with implicit personality (e.g., preference and behavior pattern) or explicit personality (e.g., emotion or characteristics).  \\
        IC-2 & The LLM agents in the paper have cognitive activities such as decision-making, reasoning, and planning. \\
        IC-3 & The LLM agents in the paper are capable of completing complicated and general tasks. \\
        IC-4 & The LLM agents' action set in the paper is neither predefined nor finite. \\
    \midrule
    \multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Exclusion Criteria (EC)}} \\
    \midrule
        EC-1 & The study does not employ LLM agents for simulation purposes but rather uses them as chatbots, task-specific agents, or evaluators. \\
        EC-2 & The paper's research objectives, methodologies, and evaluations are not focused on simulating human-like behavior with LLM agents, but rather on optimizing LLM algorithms. \\
        EC-3 & The study primarily investigates the perception or action capabilities of LLM agents without simulating the cognitive process. \\
        EC-4 & The LLM agents are restricted to handling specific, close-ended tasks. \\
        EC-5 & The LLM agents' actions are either predefined or limited. \\
