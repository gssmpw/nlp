\section*{Limitations}

RPAs are rapidly evolving and have widespread applications across various domains. While we aim to comprehensively review existing literature, we acknowledge certain limitations in our scope.
First, our review may not encompass all variations of RPA evaluation approaches across different application domains. Second, new research published after December 2024 is not included in our analysis. As a result, our work does not claim to exhaustively cover all potential evaluation metrics. Instead, our goal is to provide a structured framework and actionable guidelines to help future researchers design more systematic and consistent RPA evaluations, even as the field continues to evolve.
