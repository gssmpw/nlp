\label{conclusion}

In this work, we propose \sysname, an energy optimization framework for eDRAM-based PIM. \sysname employs retention-aware scheduling that is able to identify the most energy-efficient tiling scheme and memory operation. We design a novel reconfigurable eDRAM-based architecture that can be dynamically controlled according to the outcomes of the retention-aware scheduling. As a result, \sysname framework is able to reduce memory access power by up to 71.31\% and achieve energy efficiency improvements up to 3.05$\times$ over Neural Cache. With its minimal area and energy overhead for the scheduler and controller, \sysname offers a solution for developing energy-efficient eDRAM-based PIM applications.
