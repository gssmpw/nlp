\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed an automatic pipeline, GistVis, for generating word-scale visualization using LLMs. We informed our design with a formative study across 44 data-rich documents. We designed GistVis modularly to support plug-and-play property for expansion while we steer LLMs with visualization knowledge to generate word-scale visualizations to support document-centric analysis. Our technical evaluation and user study reveal that GistVis could generate satisfactory word-scale visualizations that could reduce users' workload reading data-rich documents. We discuss the limitations of our current approach and outline future directions. We believe that GistVis is a timely contribution to inspire further study from the visualization community about using automatic methods, especially LLMs, to augment data-rich documents.
