\section{Validation Experiments on 2D Sampling}\label{app:val_exps}





We validate the performance of uniform score distillation using a set of 2D particles. Starting with 16 initialized particles, we conduct training over 4,000 iterations. The comparison between USD and variational score distillation is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:app_val_2d}. Our results demonstrate that USD successfully achieves a more balanced distribution compared to the biased pre-trained distribution.

Fig.~\ref{fig:app_val_pc} shows the pose distribution statistics across 10 intervals for both USD and VSD. Here, $\bar{p}_t(\bar{c}|y)$, which represents the expectation of $\bar{p}_t(\bar{c}|\boldsymbol{x},y)$ over $\boldsymbol{x}_t$, indicates the current pose distribution and reveals training bias progression. While VSD exhibits a strong bias toward specific distributions during training (due to the usage of auxiliary prompts), our method maintains an approximately uniform distribution throughout the process.
