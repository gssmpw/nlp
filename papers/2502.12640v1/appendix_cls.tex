\section{Classifier Experiments}\label{app:cls_exps}
\input{tab/table_classifier.tex}

In this appendix, we evaluate our pose classifier's performance using the annotations described in Sec.~\ref{sec:exp_settings}. We assess both the texture and orientation branches independently. Table~\ref{table:class} presents the classification performance of the main classifier and its two variants. This ablation study validates our chosen classifier architecture.
