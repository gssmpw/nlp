\subsection{Statement on ethical issues}
No ethical issues were raised by this work.
Our device profiling activities are in line with the EU legislation on reverse engineering
\cite{eu-law-reverse,eu-law-interpretation}.
All experiments were performed in a controlled environment,
and did not involve any user personal data or other privacy concerns.

\subsection{Comprehensive results}
\label{app:full_results}

Fig.~\ref{fig:count_flow_id} shows the count of unique Flow IDs discovered by our framework
for each investigated event,
split into \emph{first-level} and \emph{hidden} Flow IDs.
Fig.~\ref{fig:robustness-score} shows the \emph{robustness score}
for each event.
Fig.~\ref{fig:count_dns_all} depicts the count of
domain names and DNS resolvers contacted by each event,
both split into \emph{first-level} and \emph{hidden}.
The x-axis of the two former plots,
and the y-axis of the latter,
pertain to the event ID,
as provided in Table~\ref{tab:devices_id}.
