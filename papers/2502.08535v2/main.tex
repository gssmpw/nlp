% % Network-connected Smart Home devices are becoming increasingly common, creating potential security and privacy risks. Previous research has shown these devices follow predictable network communication patterns, allowing researchers to model their normal network behavior and detect potential security breaches. However, existing approaches only observe traffic passively rather than actively trying to disturb it.
% % We present a framework that generates comprehensive network signatures for Smart Home devices by systematically blocking previously observed traffic patterns to reveal new, hidden patterns that other methods miss. These signatures are structured as behavior trees, where each child node represents network flows that occur when the parent node's traffic is blocked.
% % We applied this framework on ten real-world devices under 26 usage scenarios, discovering 138 unique flows, of which 27 (20\%) are information gained through our multi-level tree approach, compared to state-of-the-art single-level traffic analysis.

% Because of their widespread use, Smart Home devices have long attracted the interest of researchers who want to better understand how such devices behave in home networks. Compared to general purpose computers, their network activity follows relatively simple and predictable patterns. Existing work has shown that this property allows to describe the network behavior of a device in a compact profile, which can be used, for example, to configure a firewall.

% However, previous approaches have mostly been limited to studying device behavior under normal network conditions and have not attempted to actively disturb communication, thus missing potential hidden patterns that do not appear by default. We argue that uncovering these hidden patterns is important because they provide insight into how robust a device is to challenging network conditions, and because they lead to more accurate and complete profiles.
 
% In this paper, we present a framework for systematically and automatically revealing hidden communication patterns in Smart Home devices. It generates comprehensive profiles for devices by examining and blocking previously observed traffic patterns to reveal new patterns that other, more shallow methods miss. These profiles are structured as behavior trees, where a node represents a network flow which occurs when the parent nodes' flows are blocked. We apply our framework on ten real-world devices with 36 unique user interactions. We discover 254 unique flows, of which 70 ($>$ 27\%) appear only thanks to our approach and which are not found by state-of-the-art methods.

The widespread use of Smart Home devices has attracted significant research interest in understanding their behavior within home networks. Unlike general-purpose computers, these devices exhibit relatively simple and predictable network activity patterns. However, previous studies have primarily focused on normal network conditions, overlooking potential hidden patterns that emerge under challenging conditions. Discovering these hidden flows is crucial for assessing device robustness.

This paper addresses this gap by presenting a framework that systematically and automatically reveals these hidden communication patterns. By actively disturbing communication and blocking observed traffic, the framework generates comprehensive profiles structured as behavior trees, uncovering flows that are missed by more shallow methods. This approach was applied to ten real-world devices, identifying 254 unique flows, with over 27\% only discovered through this new method. These insights enhance our understanding of device robustness and can be leveraged to improve the accuracy of network security measures.
