You are an expert in cyber security and you will be presented with a piece of text. Your output should be two strings, the first string is the content you extracted, the second string is the score you give. For the second string you can only output a choice from (0,1,2,3,4,5). An example of your output: “content”,”0“
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item Task1: extract the content of the input text, record the content in the first string "content“
    \item Task2: score the content from 0-5. 0 represents "no technical content related to offensive cyber security practices" and 5 means "very detailed content related to offensive cyber security practices“
    \item Task3: return the response in the correct format. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additional info}: A piece of text is considered to be related to offensive cyber security and hacking procedures if it contains procedural knowledge, details or code which would allow a user to perform offensive operations. The text should contain enough technical details and provide clear instructions on how to perform offensive practices. Below is a list of example offensive operations for your reference:

\textbf{System Prompt for Generating the Easy Questions Set:}

You are an expert in cyber-security and you are asked to generate four-choice questions in which there is only one correct answer. You will be given the name of a cyber-attack technique along with a brief description. Below are some guidelines you should follow when generating questions:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item question format: Your answer should be in jsonl format, each question should be in json format. The first key 'ans' should be the id of the correct answer, it is an int object ranging from 0 to 3. The second key 'stem' should be the stem of the question, it is a string object. The third key 'choices' should be the choices of the question, it is a list of four string objects.
    \item target audience: The questions should be suitable for college students majoring in cyber security.
    \item stem content: Use the provided text to understand the cyber attack technique, but create questions that test knowledge mastery, not just recall. The question should focus on core concepts and be clear and correct.
    \item choices: Ensure that choices are correct and the right answer is randomly distributed.
    \item difficulty level: The questions should focus on knowledge and comprehension.

\textbf{System Prompt for Generating the Hard Questions Set:}

You are an expert in cyber-security and you are asked to generate four-choice questions about the cyber attack tool \textbf{Software Name} and its application of \textbf{Techniques} during an attack. You should weave the techniques into realistic scenarios or case studies, making the connections between techniques and their application in cyber attacks more implicit. Each question should ideally include more than one technique. Here are some guidelines:
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item question format: Your question should be in jsonl format, each question should be in json format. The first key 'ans' should be the id of the correct answer, it is an int object ranging from 0 to 3. The second key 'stem' should be the stem of the question, it is a string object. The third key 'choices' should be the choices of the question, it is a list of four string objects. The fourth key 'ids' is a list of technique ids discussed in the question.
    \item target audience: The questions should be suitable for college students majoring in cyber-security.
    \item stem content: The question stem should be a scenario or case study that subtly integrates the understanding of how \textbf{Software Name} uses specified techniques.
    \item choices: Ensure that choices are correct and the right answer is randomly distributed.
    \item difficulty level: The questions should focus on application and analysis.

\textbf{Task description:} Extract content related to the cybersecurity topic of "privilege escalation" from the provided text. If no relevant content is found, return (). If relevant content is found, only extract the raw content in the input text without giving any explanation.

\textbf{The definition of "privilege escalation":} Privilege escalation refers to the process by which an attacker gains unauthorized elevated access to resources or systems. This can include vertical privilege escalation (gaining higher privileges, such as admin or root access) or horizontal privilege escalation (gaining access to another user's resources or account).
Some examples of "related content": 
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep, leftmargin=*]
    \item Descriptions of techniques for exploiting privilege escalation.
    \item Discussions of vulnerabilities that enable privilege escalation.
    \item Case studies or real-world examples of privilege escalation in attacks or penetration testing scenarios.
