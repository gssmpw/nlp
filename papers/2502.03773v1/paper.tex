\section{Related Work}
In the ML field ZKPs have been majorly used for verification of inferences made by models \cite{sun2024zkllm, chen2024zkml, kang2022scaling, PvCNN, sun2023zkdl, Zen, VI2, vCNN, ZKDT, Liu2021zkCNNZK, singh2022zero, fan2023validating}. A line of work also focuses on proving the training of ML models using ZKPs \cite{burkhalter2021rofl, huang2022zkmlaas, ruckel2022fairness, garg2023experimenting, abbaszadeh2024zero}. More recently they're also been used for verifying properties such as fairness \cite{yadav2024fairproofconfidentialcertifiable, confidant, Toreini2023VerifiableFP} and accuracy \cite{zhang2020zero} of confidential ML models.  Contrary to these and to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that identifies the need for proving explanations and provides ZKP based solutions for the same.

\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
In this paper we take a step towards operationalizing explanations in adversarial contexts where the involved parties have misaligned interests. We propose a protocol \name using Commitments and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, which provides guarantees on the model used and correctness of explanations in the face of confidentiality requirements. We propose ZKP-efficient versions of the popular explainability algorithm LIME and demonstrate the feasibility of \name for Neural Networks \& Random Forests.

An interesting avenue for future work is the tailored design of explainability algorithms for high ZKP-efficiency and inherent robustness to adversarial manipulations. Another interesting avenue is finding other applications in ML where ZKPs can ensure verifiable computation and provide trust guarantees without revealing sensitive information.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% This work takes a step towards operationalizing explanations in adversarial settings where the model is kept confidential from customers. With this work it can be guaranteed that the said committed model (1) is used for all inputs, (2) is used for generating predictions and explanations (3) cannot be swapped post-audits. It can also be guaranteed that the explanation is generated correctly using the said explanation algorithm. All of this is guaranteed while maintaining model confidentiality.

% While our protocol \name provides the above guarantees, in order to have complete trust guarantees we also require stable and faithful explanation algorithms which are robust to realistic adversarial attacks as mentioned in Sec.\ref{sec:discuss}. We mention existing solutions to tackle some of these issues in Sec.\ref{sec:discuss} and Sec.\ref{sec:varlime} and call for more research in these directions. These research directions though interesting and important are out of scope for our work.
