\section{Related Work}
In the ML field ZKPs have been majorly used for verification of inferences made by models \cite{sun2024zkllm, chen2024zkml, kang2022scaling, PvCNN, sun2023zkdl, Zen, VI2, vCNN, ZKDT, Liu2021zkCNNZK, singh2022zero, fan2023validating}. A line of work also focuses on proving the training of ML models using ZKPs \cite{burkhalter2021rofl, huang2022zkmlaas, ruckel2022fairness, garg2023experimenting, abbaszadeh2024zero}. More recently they're also been used for verifying properties such as fairness \cite{yadav2024fairproofconfidentialcertifiable, confidant, Toreini2023VerifiableFP} and accuracy \cite{zhang2020zero} of confidential ML models.  Contrary to these and to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that identifies the need for proving explanations and provides ZKP based solutions for the same.
