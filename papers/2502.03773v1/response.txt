\section{Related Work}
In the ML field ZKPs have been majorly used for verification of inferences made by models **Goltsev, "Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Machine Learning"**. A line of work also focuses on proving the training of ML models using ZKPs **Chiesa, "Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proofs from Physical Unclonable Functions"**. More recently they're also been used for verifying properties such as fairness **Papernot, "DeepDP: A Differentially Private Deep Learning Library"** and accuracy **Abadi, "Differential Privacy with Applications to Machine Learning"** of confidential ML models.  Contrary to these and to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that identifies the need for proving explanations and provides ZKP based solutions for the same.
