In summary, this paper introduces Light-A-Video, 
a training-free method that utilizes state-of-the-art image relighting models 
to achieve temporally consistent video relighting.
By incorporating the Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module to stabilize lighting source generation and 
employing the Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy for smooth appearance transitions, 
Light-A-Video significantly enhances the temporal coherence of relighted videos 
while preserving the high-quality relighting of individual frames.
