abstract = {Humans can perceive subtle emotions from various cues and contexts, even without hearing or seeing others. However, existing video datasets mainly focus on recognizing the emotions of the speakers from complete modalities. In this work, we present the task of multimodal emotion reasoning in videos. Beyond directly recognizing emotions from multimodal signals of target persons, this task requires a machine capable of reasoning about human emotions from the contexts and surrounding world. To facilitate the study towards this task, we introduce a new dataset, MEmoR, that provides fine-grained emotion annotations for both speakers and non-speakers. The videos in MEmoR are collected from TV shows closely in real-life scenarios. In these videos, while speakers may be non-visually described, non-speakers always deliver no audio-textual signals and are often visually inconspicuous. This modality-missing characteristic makes MEmoR a more practical yet challenging testbed for multimodal emotion reasoning. In support of various reasoning behaviors, the proposed MEmoR dataset provides both short-term contexts and external knowledge. We further propose an attention-based reasoning approach to model the intra-personal emotion contexts, inter-personal emotion propagation, and the personalities of different individuals. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related baselines significantly. We isolate and analyze the validity of different reasoning modules across various emotions of speakers and non-speakers. Finally, we draw forth several future research directions for multimodal emotion reasoning with MEmoR, aiming to empower high Emotional Quotient (EQ) in modern artificial intelligence systems.
