Sponsorship Committee
Interspeech 2024

Dear Members of the Sponsorship Committee,

I am writing to recommend Le Duy Khanh, a talented young researcher from our Zalo AI Laboratory, for sponsorship to attend Interspeech 2024 in Greece. His paper, titled "Improving Streaming Speech Recognition with Time-Shifted Contextual Attention and Dynamic Right Context Masking" (Paper ID: 1971), has been accepted for presentation at the conference, receiving positive reviews (Accept - Accept - Weak accept).

Khanh is an early-career researcher who has shown exceptional dedication and promise in the field of speech recognition. His accepted paper is a testament to his innovative approach and hard work. This achievement is particularly significant given that it is his first research paper. Attending Interspeech would provide him invaluable exposure to the global research community, allowing him to gain insights, network with experts, and receive constructive feedback on his work.

However, as a laboratory based in Vietnam, a less-represented and low-income country, we face considerable financial constraints. The overall participation costs for Interspeech in Greece are significant, nearly equivalent to Khanh's annual income. Our current funding is insufficient to cover the expenses of international travel to the conference. Unfortunately, our efforts to secure funding through research grants and private donations within Vietnam haven't been successful so far. Given the high cost of travel and accommodation, it is challenging for us to support Khanh's participation without external assistance. 

I firmly believe that attending Interspeech 2024 will be a pivotal moment in Khanh's career. It will boost his confidence and encourage him to continue his research. I sincerely hope that you will consider my request for sponsorship to enable Khanh to attend Interspeech 2024.

Thank you for considering my request. Your support would make a significant difference in Khanh's professional journey.

Sincerely,

Chau Thanh Duc
