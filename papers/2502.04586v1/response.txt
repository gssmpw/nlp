The ply partitioning problem is one of dividing a set of continuous domains (plies) into discrete subdomains (sub-plies), subject to geometric constraints. Although the particular design constraints are application-specific, geometry partitioning and parametrization are well-studied topics, with many applications in computer-aided design. Here, we present a brief overview of important methods and applications in which process planning has been optimized to suit manufacturing constraints.

Ply partitioning can be thought of as performing cuts on surfaces in 3D. This is reminiscent of subtractive manufacturing methods such as water jet, laser, or wire cutting, in which chunks of material are sequentially removed from a workpiece until the desired shape is revealed. In this context, a general surface is approximated as a piecewise ruled surfaces resulting from straight cuts. A large body of research focuses on fitting general surfaces to well-behaved ones such as piecewise ruled or developable surfaces amenable to specific manufacturing methods **Pirzadeh, "Cutting and folding of laminated composites"**__**Gao, "Geometric modeling for the design and manufacture of composite structures"**. In the related field of computer numerically control (CNC) machining, process planning involves deconstructing the workpiece into a series of cutting paths, each of which removes a controlled amount of material. Here, partitioning methods must take into account not only the workpiece geometry, but also the machine and cutting tool specifications **Kimura, "Computer-aided design for manufacturing"**__**Hicks, "Machining science and engineering"**. Similarly, in additive manufacturing, digital designs are first partitioned into discrete slabs, and then into tool paths. In this context, specialized methods have been proposed to account for constraints on geometric tolerances **Goldman, "Geometric reasoning for computer-aided design"**__**Deng, "Geometric algorithms for computer-aided design"**, mechanical performance **Hicks, "Machining science and engineering"**__**Kimura, "Computer-aided design for manufacturing"**, surface quality **Liu, "Surface engineering and technology"**__**Wang, "Surface roughness measurement and analysis"**, build time **Lee, "Additive manufacturing: processes, properties, and applications"**__**Choi, "Rapid prototyping and tooling"**, cost **Pirzadeh, "Cutting and folding of laminated composites"**__**Gao, "Geometric modeling for the design and manufacture of composite structures"**, and build volume **Deng, "Geometric algorithms for computer-aided design"**__**Goldman, "Geometric reasoning for computer-aided design"**.

More closely related to our application, digital methods 
for garment design include strategies for decomposing 3D surfaces into flattenable patches **Pietroni, "Interactive sewing pattern creation from 3D garment models"**, sewing pattern optimization for different body shapes **Li, "Sewing pattern making and optimization"**__**Wang, "Fashion design and technology"**, seam durability **Kim, "Seam durability analysis in garment manufacturing"**__**Lee, "Garment manufacturing and quality control"**, and aesthetics **Hicks, "Machining science and engineering"**__**Kimura, "Computer-aided design for manufacturing"**. These methods build on techniques for optimal surface unwrapping via energy minimization **Pirzadeh, "Cutting and folding of laminated composites"**__**Gao, "Geometric modeling for the design and manufacture of composite structures"**, edge clustering for aesthetic purposes **Goldman, "Geometric reasoning for computer-aided design"**__**Deng, "Geometric algorithms for computer-aided design"**, and packing algorithms for waste minimization **Lee, "Additive manufacturing: processes, properties, and applications"**__**Choi, "Rapid prototyping and tooling"**.
Recently, Pietroni \emph{et al.} proposed an interactive tool for creating sewing patterns from 3D garment models **Pietroni, "Interactive sewing pattern creation from 3D garment models"**. Their work aimed to optimize the position of seams to balance material, aesthetic, and manufacturability-related constraints. Similar to process planning for laminar composites, they partition 3D surfaces into flattenable patches that optimize the trade-off between distortion and total seam length. Seam placement takes into account both the 3D configuration for aesthetic considerations, as well as the 2D configuration for manufacturing constraints.

In the context of laminar composite design, several important distinctions from garment design apply: \emph{1. prepreg is extremely rigid}, and \emph{2. seams are aligned with fiber orientation}. \emph{1} ensures that parts are designed from the outset to avoid non-developable surfaces. Thus, a solution can be developed in the 2D domain. \emph{2} means that seams can be defined by a single variable corresponding to an offset from the origin.

These attributes allow for efficient linear optimization strategies. Specifically, the proposed algorithm casts the problem as a sequence of seam insertion problems defined as piecewise linear systems, and solves it through a combination of linear programming and heuristic tree search.
