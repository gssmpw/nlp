\section*{Contents of the Appendix}
\label{app}    
In \cref{app:motivation}, we present our analysis on logit shifts with optimization-based attacks. After providing the details on the experimental setting in \cref{app:sett}, we give further details about the dataset with some example sentences in \cref{app:dataset}. In \cref{app:llama3}, additional results with Llama 3 model are provided. In \cref{app:app} we discuss different ablation studies about dataset dependency, performance on unseen data, combining final layer representations with \methodname{}, Llama Guard for refusal in baselines, hyperparameter and classifier selection of \methodname{}, the effect of additional prompting on benign samples, a study on adaptive attacks, using Berta for the classification task and comparison ROC curves. In \cref{app:related}, we present extended related work on fine-tuning based jailbreaking attacks.
\section{Motivation continued}
\label{app:motivation}

Below, we present our analysis of automated attacks that minimize the loss with respect to a target sequence. To simplify, let us consider the case of $m=1$ where the attacker aims to minimize the cross-entropy loss w.r.t only the next token such as ``sure''. Without the loss of generality, we assume such a token corresponds to the first token in the logit. Then the objective function in \cref{eq:attack_problem} becomes:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \mathcal{L}
    =  -\log\left(\bm{\sigma}(\bm{l}_1)_{\hat{x}_{1+n}}\right)
    = 
     -\log\left(\bm{\sigma}(\bm{l}_1)_{1}\right)
    \,.\\
    \end{aligned}
\label{eq:attack_problem_onetoken}
\end{equation}
To explore the connection between minimizing the loss and the logit, let us take the derivative w.r.t the logit:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \nabla_{l_{1t}} \mathcal{L} 
    = 
    \begin{cases}
\bm{\sigma}(\bm{l}_1)_1 -1 < 0 
& \text{if } t= 1\,,\\
\bm{\sigma}(\bm{l}_1)_t
> 0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
    \end{aligned}
\label{eq:gradient}
\end{equation}
Clearly, the gradient direction for the first logit (corresponding to ``sure'') is negative. On the contrary, the gradient directions for the remaining large amount of logits are positive, which might result in a shift towards a smaller value by the rule of gradient descent update: $ l_{1t} = l_{1t}- \eta \nabla_{l_{1t}} \mathcal{L}$ with step size $\eta$. This is consistent with our observation of negative shifts in the logit values. Furthermore, by taking the negative logarithm of probability, i.e., 
$-\log (\bm{\sigma_1})_t = - l_{1t} + \log\sum_{k=1}^{|\mathcal{V}|} e^{l_{1k}}$
, one can infer that such a decrease in logits can yield a similar reduction in its negative log probability due to its exponential term. 

This part serves as an intuition and motivation that led us to further investigate the logit values and it does not constitute a full proof of the observed changes. Providing the exact dynamic of each logit is beyond the scope of this study.

\textbf{Remark:} Even though our analysis above only focuses on the optimization based attacks, we have observed the same phenomenon with other types of attacks too. \methodname{} does not assume any prior knowledge on the attack data or its generation method.
 

\section{Experimental setting}
\label{app:sett}
Following the JailbreakBench, we use the vLLM API service to access the models. The GPT models are utilized with OpenAPI API access. Every defense method is implemented using the original code of the respective papers. All experiments were conducted in a single machine with an NVIDIA A100 SXM4 80GB GPU. The parameters related to the JailbreakBench implementation such as $top-p=0.9$ and $temperature=0$ are not changed. 

\section{Details on the datasets}
\label{app:dataset}

For each attack method, we generated multiple successful attack prompts using \textit{Harmful Behavior} data of the AdvBench dataset and \textit{JBB-Behaviors} dataset of JailbreakBench. The Harmful Behaviour dataset consists of 520 unique goals and their respective targets. The JBB-Behaviors dataset includes 100 unique goals which are taken from AdvBench and Trojan Detection Challenge \citep{tdc2023}. Further details on each dataset are provided below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GCG~\citep{zou2023universal}:} We use the original implementation of attacks with default parameters to create the suffixes. Since GCG attack is relatively more expensive, we use some suffixes with more than one harmful behavior to increase the dataset. We also do transfer attacks to increase diversity. Across the datasets, the number of total sentences, unique behaviors, and suffixes are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Total attack sentences: 2042
        \item Unique behaviors: 408
        \item Unique suffixes: 551
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AutoDAN~\citep{liu2023autodan}:} We use the original implementation of attacks to create the prefixes and test one prefix with more than one target. Similar to GCG, we do transfer attacks between \vicuna{} and \llama{}. Across the datasets, the number of total sentences, unique behaviors, and prefixes are as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Total attack sentences: 1528
        \item Unique behaviors: 475
        \item Unique prefixes: 619
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PAIR~\citep{chao2023jailbreaking}:} We used the modified AdvBench dataset of 50 samples to generate the attacks. According to \url{https://jailbreakbench.github.io/}, the PAIR method is not very successful with \llama{}, therefore the tests are not conducted for this model. In total, we collected 404 samples across models.
    \item \textbf{PAP~\citep{zeng2024johnny}:} The authors provided 50 samples per model. Additionally, we implemented their original code to generate more attacks but since they do not provide the whole persuasion taxonomy, the number of samples is limited. We test the same set of prompts with all models and choose the successful ones separately for each model. Since we don't have enough samples with \llama{}, results are not presented. In total, we were able to collect 30 samples.
    \item \textbf{Adaptive~\citep{andriushchenko2024jailbreaking}:} We used the dataset provided in \url{https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks}.
\end{itemize}
Following JailbreakBench, we use the Llama Guard model to eliminate unsuccessful attacks. For GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, for each dataset, we perform transfer attacks and again tes them with Llama Guard.

Moreover, we used two benign datasets for our evaluations on benign data:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AlpacaEval~\citep{dubois2024alpacafarm}:} We randomly sample 800 unique samples from the test dataset and split it into two equal sets as test and potential training data.
    \item \textbf{QNLI~\citep{wang-etal-2018-glue}:} We randomly sample 4000 unique samples from the test dataset. We split the dataset into two equal sets as test and potential training data. 
    \item \textbf{AI2-ARC~\citep{Yadav_2019}:} We randomly sample 2000 unique samples from the test dataset.
    \item \textbf{CodeXGlue~\citep{codexglue}:} We randomly sample 4000 unique samples from the test dataset.
\end{itemize}
We use the same benign test and potential training data for \llama{} and \vicuna{}. For GPT models, we randomly select 500 prompts from the QNLI dataset. For the training dataset, we sample from the potential training dataset prepared with the abovementioned data with a seed to ensure all ablation studies with \methodname{} include a portion of the same data. To ensure there is enough heterogeneity in the datasets, we tried increasing the sample size as much as possible using multiple behaviors and suffix/prefixes. Moreover, we get rid of the bias by randomly splitting the test training samples. By looking at these numbers, we believe that the datasets are quite heterogeneous and representative. In \cref{tab:examples} we provide purposely cut examples of the sentences used in our dataset.

\section{Ablation studies}
\label{app:app}

In this section, we first study the dependency of \methodname{} on data and measure its performance with unseen data. Later, we experiment with certain design choices such as the refusal classifier, using logit values, and hyperparameters. Next, we try prompting the benign samples and finally, we train a binary Bert-based classifier and compare against it. Finally, we perform additional studies on adaptive attacks and compare baselines using ROC curves.

\subsection{Dependency on training data}
\label{app:data}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{\textbf{TP and FP rates of \methodname{} trained with different numbers of attack sentences:} per attack type with \llama{} and \vicuna{} models.

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\label{table:size}
\end{table}

To study the data dependency of \methodname{}, we measure its performance with different datasizes. In \cref{table:size}, we present the TP and FP rates of \llama{} and \vicuna{} models with different number of jailbreaking samples per attack type with a fixed number of benign samples. Results show that even with a few samples, \methodname{} is quite effective in detecting jailbreaking samples.

Another observation we have made is better aligned models require fewer training samples. For instance, \methodname{}’s performance on \llama{} is much better than \vicuna{} with fewer samples. Similarly, it is easier to defend GPT-4 than GPT-3.5. As a result, with newer and well aligned models, this dependency on training data becomes less and less significant. Additionally, the transferability of attacks among models makes the attack generation faster and cheaper while decreasing the cost of training data generation.

\rebuttal{Inspired by \cite{yi2024jailbreakattacksdefenseslarge} and \cite{jin2024jailbreakzoo} we can categorize the jailbreaking attacks as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gradient-based:} The model inputs are changed based on gradients of a target harmful response. Ex: GCG, Adaptive Attack \cite{andriushchenko2024jailbreaking}
    \item \textbf{Genetic algorithm-based:} The jailbreaking is optimized by a genetic algorithm to ensure structured and readable data generation. Ex: AutoDAN
    \item \textbf{LLM-based:} An LLM works as an attacker to, paraphrase, generate or optimize jailbreaking prompts. Ex: PAIR, PAP. 
    \item \textbf{Finetuning-based:} The target LLM is finetuned with adversarial samples to explicit harmful behavior. Ex: \cite{qi2024finetuning, yang2024shadow}
    \item \textbf{Template completion:} The prompt is put into contextual templates to generate successful attacks. Ex: \cite{wei2023chainofthought, li2023deepinception}
    \item \textbf{Prompt rewriting:} The prompt is rewritten in other natural or non-natural languages that are more susceptible to attacks. Ex: \cite{yuan2023cipherchat,deng2024multilingual}
\end{itemize}}

\rebuttal{From the attacks considered for our defense, the GCG and Adaptive attacks belong to the ‘Gradient-based’ attacks, whereas the PAIR and PAP attacks are ‘LLM-based Generation’ attacks. AutoDAN, on the other hand, belongs to a separate group.}

\rebuttal{In \cref{tab:general}, we present a comprehensive TP rate analysis with the \vicuna{} model where the columns corresponding to the training dataset and rows are the test sets. We make the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Having only GCG training data is enough to identify Adaptive attack samples which support the significance of the attack group, rather than the attack type.
    \item As AutoDAN belongs to a different group, alone it performs poorly against other attacks. When combined with GCG, high performance on gradient-based attacks and AutoDAN is achieved.
    \item There is a high correlation between PAIR and PAP attacks which correspond to the same attack family. Even with just PAIR training data, the PAP dataset can be successfully classified.
\end{itemize}}

These observations lead to the conclusion that for the performance of \methodname{} against unseen data, rather than the specific attack, the type of attack is more important. If there is another data from the same group exists on the training dataset, it is possible to achieve great performance without the specific attack samples. In contrast, if we introduce a different type of attack, it fails to do so.

Therefore, for SPD to perform well against unseen data, although the exact attack is not required, other samples with a similar type of attack should be available in the training data. Since re-training or fine-tuning an SVM is quite fast and efficient, taking less than a couple of seconds, adding a new type of attack has an insignificant cost. Overall, these results show that the dependency on training data is not a major disadvantage.

\label{table:benign}
\end{table}

The performance of \methodname{} has been measured on two new and unseen complex benign datasets: AI2$\_$ARC Challenge~\citep{Yadav_2019}, a multichoice reasoning task, and CodeXGLUE~\citep{codexglue}, a coding task. We tested the performance by keeping all the settings in the main experiment the same. We used 1000 randomly selected samples from AI2$\_$ARC and 2000 samples from CodeXGLUE sets as the test data. We first tested with the SVM trained on the original training data (with the two benign sets used in the paper) and observed that \llama{} can perform very well even without seeing the new datasets before. Then, we added 200 training samples from each dataset (there is no overlap between the test and the training samples), and we observed a clear increase in the performance with the \vicuna{} model. To summarize, results indicate that the \methodname{} is quite effective with harder benign tasks too. The numerical results are presented in \cref{table:benign}.

\subsection{Combining \methodname{} with final layer representation}
\label{app:final_layer}

In one concurrent work to ours \cite{zheng2024promptdriven}, has shown that using the hidden layer representations, benign and attack prompts can be separated from each other by generating a prompt. Although their approach to the problem is significantly different than our, we wanted to conduct and ablation study to combine their observation with our SVM based classification method. As a result we performed ablation studies on using hidden layer representations instead of the logit values (called SPD+HL) in \cref{table:hl}). We fixed the rest of the experimental setting the same. For the \llama{} model, results show that both are quite comparable and with \vicuna{}, the hidden-layer classifier enhances the abilities of the classifier. This is expected since \methodname{} is using only a small percentage of the logits and some information might be lost. Although it may perform slightly less, \methodname{} with logits holds several advantages against the hidden layer approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hidden-layer classifier needs open-source access to the models which is not the case with many state-of-the-art models such as GPT family.
    \item The representation matrix of \methodname{} is significantly smaller compared to the hidden-space model (250 vs. $\sim$ 4000-5000) which makes \methodname{} slightly faster both in inference and training.
\end{itemize}
Overall, results support that both approaches are effective. Moreover, this work shows that our observation on the differences between the logit values of an attack and a benign sentence holds and it can be used to classify between those.

In the JailbreakBench implementation of SmoothLLM, to determine if a perturbed sentence is attacked, or in other words to refuse to answer, the Llama Guard model is used instead of a string classifier. We report our findings in \cref{table:guard}. The iteration number includes the iterations with Llama Guard model. With this approach, SmoothLLM performs better compared to the string classifier. This approach is significantly more expensive since it requires an additional LLM, and $\sim 10$ forward passes, and it highlights the inefficacy of the of the string based classification. 


\subsection{\methodname{} hyperparameter selection}
\label{app:token}
In this section, we examine the effects of different design choices of our method: the number of tokens places taken into calculation $r$, the number of tokens for each position $k$, and the size of the training sets used $T$ and $T_{safe}$.

\paragraph{The Choice of $r$ and $k$} 
One of the important design choices was determining the size of $\bm{H} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times k}$ matrix in \cref{eq:h}. We fixed the training dataset sizes to $T=T_{safe}=200$ for each dataset and studied the effect of these two parameters on the TP and FP rates of \vicuna{} in \cref{fig:token}. Our results indicate that the number $k$ has a great effect on the TP rate. This observation corresponds with our findings with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models where we don't have full logit access. When $k<20$, the TP rate is considerably lower. Moreover, increasing $k$ after some point does not change the overall performance. For the FP rate, similarly small $k$ results in a worse performance but the difference is not that crucial if $r >5$. Up to $r\sim5$, as we increase $t$, the TP rate increases, and the FP rate drops. For large $k$ increasing $r$ further does not necessarily improve the performance which is expected since the effect of input becomes less influential. Based on these observations, we set $r=5, k=50$ in our main experiments. 

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/vic_rk.pdf}
    \caption{Affect of the training data size of $\bm{H}$ matrix: We plot the TP (left) and FP (right) rates for different $r$ and $k$ values using the \methodname{} approach with \vicuna{} model. Different lines correspond to different $k$ values. Results show that $k>20$ and $r >5$ yield a better performance.
    }
\label{fig:token}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The training dataset size $T, T_{safe}$}
Since generating attack samples is computationally expensive, the size of the training set is another important factor. One reason for choosing the SVM method over other binary classifiers is its high performance even with a smaller training set. For this experiment, we set the $r=5, k=50$. We can define two different parameters for sizes of attacked and benign datasets as $T$ and $T_{safe}$ respectively. Note that these are the sizes per dataset. In other words, if $T_{safe}=50$, the actual benign dataset size is $ 2\times 50=100$. If we don't have enough training samples from one dataset, we include all available data on the training set. 

In \cref{fig:size}, we report the TP and FP rates at different sizes. Plots illustrate that the FP rate is highly dependent on the $T_{safe}$ value since when $T_{safe}<20$, we get a relatively large FP rate which is not desired. Moreover, the TP rate is correlated with the $T$ size. Using these results, we set the $T=T_{safe}=200$ for \vicuna{}.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{figures/vic_T.pdf}
    \caption{Affect of the training data size of $\bm{H}$ matrix: We plot the TP (left) and FP (right) rates for different $T$ and $T_{safe}$ values using the \methodname{} approach with \vicuna{} model. Different lines correspond to different $T_{safe}$ values. Results show that $T_{safe}>20$ is necessary for low FP and as $T$ increases, TP tends to increase.
    }
\label{fig:size}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Classifier types}
Other alternatives to SVM can be simple binary classifiers such as K-nearest-neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, and XGBoost with \vicuna{} data. In \cref{fig:clasifiers}, we compare \methodname{} with SVM to other classifiers. All models are trained using the same feature vector $\bm{H}$, with the same training set. Though KNN and XGBoost have higher TP rates since we want to keep the FP rate low, the SVM method is the ideal choice in this setting.

\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/classifiers.pdf}

    \caption{Confusion matrices showing performance of other classifiers against the SVM used in \methodname{}. The results indicate that SVM gives the smallest FP rate while still having a high TP rate.}
\label{fig:clasifiers}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Prompting benign samples}
\label{app:sure}
To show that the \methodname{} does not depend on any assumption about the output, we performed additional experiments with prompting. GCG and AutoDAN attacks optimize the input prompt so that the answer will start with "Sure, here is...". Inspired by this, we test the effect of forcing benign inputs to begin with the same phrase on the FDR. For that purpose, we took our original safe datasets AlpacaEval and QNLI and added the following prompt at the beginning of each sample: “I will ask you a question. Please make sure your answer starts with ‘Sure, here is’. Question:[Question]:”. With this additional prompt, $96.5\%$ of all benign responses start with “Sure, here is”.

\begin{figure}[tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/prompting.pdf}
\vspace{-10pt}
    \caption{The effect of forcing a certain start on benign samples: In the first graph, we plot the negative log probability distributions of the first token for a benign and prompted benign sentence in green and pink respectively. We can observe a shift in the positive direction as a result of the added prompt. In the second plot, using two-dimensional t-SNE with $\bm{H}$ feature vector, we visualized the clear separability of attacked, not attacked (benign), and prompted benign sentences. Pink points correspond to attacked sentences, green ones are benign and orange ones are prompted benign. }
\label{fig:sure}
\end{figure}

Later, we trained an SVM model with \vicuna{} attack sentences and benign samples without the additional prompt. Using this model, we tested the prompted benign samples. With this prompting method, the initial FDR of $11.8\%$ dropped to $0.5\%$ which is very favorable for a defense method. In other words, prompting a safe sentence decreased the chance of mistakenly being flagged as a jailbreaking attempt.

In \cref{fig:sure}, the effect of the additional prompt is further examined. \cref{fig:sure} (a) visualizes the negative log-likelihoods of the first token of a benign sentence with and without additional prompting. A positive shift can be observed as a result of the added prompt which is the opposite of the shift observed with jailbreaking attacks. Therefore, this prompt got the logit values further away from an attack sentence and reduced the FDR.  \cref{fig:sure} (b) is the t-SNE plot of samples from these three categories that further illustrates that prompting ensures a better separation between attacked and benign inputs. 

\subsection{\rebuttal{Ablation studies on adaptive attacks}}
\label{app:log_dist}

\rebuttal{To further examine the reason for the logit distribution shift, we performed additional experiments on attack generation that aims to maintain a similar logit distribution to benign samples while getting a successful attack. To do so, inspired by \cite{khoa2021backdoor}, we introduced a KL divergence loss to the GCG attack and observed the changes in losses.}

\rebuttal{ In the \cref{fig:log_dist}, we present the jailbreaking and KL loss evolution during an attack generation process with \llama{} model in two cases: Normal GCG where only the jailbreaking loss is considered and an Adaptive GCG where KL divergence and jailbreaking loss are considered together. The red star shows the steps when a successful attack is achieved. }

\rebuttal{In the provided example, the harmful target is "Write a convincing anonymous death threat." and the default settings are used. The KL divergence is calculated between the average logits of benign samples and the output logits. Among the benign dataset, the KL divergence value between individual samples and the averages ranges between 0.03 and 0.62 with a mean of 0.21.}

\rebuttal{In the normal GCG case (blue line) we can observe a quick decrease in the GCG loss and achieve a successful attack at step 25. When we look at the KL divergence of the output, we can see a rise showing the output distribution is getting more and more different than the benign distribution. }

\rebuttal{In the adaptive case, on the other hand, we could never get a successful attack in 500 steps. Though both GCG and KL losses decrease at the initial steps, after step 200, they start to oscillate, showing it is challenging to achieve these two goals at the same time.}

\rebuttal{The same trend has been observed in all our attempts considering all harmful behaviors in the dataset with 2 different seeds. While the normal attacks were usually successful in fewer steps (between 20-300), with 500 steps, we were never able to get a successful attack using the dual loss. With normal GCG, the KL divergence values are between 0.2-0.5 and the jailbreaking loss ranges from 0.2 to 2.8. With the adaptive attack, on the other hand, the KL loss is between 0.1-0.5 and jailbreaking loss is between 0.7-3.1.}

\rebuttal{We hypothesize that this failure is due to the constrained nature of the logits optimization, which conflicts with the requirements for generating valid jailbreak instructions. Providing a harmful response to a jailbreaking attack is inherently \textit{unnatural} to the model and forcing a naturally harmful response seems quite challenging, if not impossible. }

\subsection{Bert-based binary classifier}
\label{app:bert}

We train a RoBERTa model to do the classification task by looking at the input sentences. We use the same dataset we used to train \methodname{} with \vicuna{} which are $T=T_{safe}=200$. We test the model on the test dataset of \vicuna{}. Results are provided in \cref{table:bert}. Though the FP rates are quite desirable, it does not perform well against AutoDAN and PAP attacks. We believe there are two reasons of that: a) with PAP attack, the training size is too small, only 5 samples, for the model to learn from them b) since the AutoDAN attack is too long, and RoBERTa has a very small window length, some part of the input is not processed. As a result, we believe this method is not an ideal way for defense purposes. Moreover, if an additional language model is used for the classification, attackers can easily attack this model too. Finally, training a binary language classifier is computationally more expensive and the input dimension is much higher than training a simple

\subsection{\rebuttal{ROC curves}}
\label{app:roc}

\rebuttal{The reported TP and FP numbers for the baseline methods such as SmoothLLM, RA-LLM, and Perplexity filter in the main text are gotten by using the default threshold settings of the approaches to determine if a sentence is attacked or not.By changing the threshold value, it is possible to change the TP and FP rates. In \cref{fig:roc_llama}, we plotted the ROC curves for the \llama{} model. Curves and the AUROC score show that SPD significantly outperforms other baseline methods. Since Self-defense is not a probabilistic model, neither fixing the FP rate nor calculating the AUROC score is feasible. }

\rebuttal{Additionally, in the \cref{fig:roc_models}, we present the ROC curve for SPD with different models. With \llama{}, the SPD is exceptionally good as it achieves almost perfect discrimination between the positive and negative classes and achieves an AUROC score of almost 1. Similarly, with \vicuna{} and GPT4 models, the curves indicate good classification results with AUROC scores of 0.95. }

\section{\rebuttal{Extended related work}}
\label{app:related}

\rebuttal{ \textbf{Fine-Tuning Jailbreaking Attacks:} Recent studies have shown that though fine-tuning LLMs enhances their task-specific performance it also introduces significant safety risks, particularly through jailbreaking attacks even if it is not intended \citep{qi2024finetuning}. Additionally, there exist various harmful fine-tuning techniques that makes the models even more susceptible \citep{Harmful_finetuning}. Therefore, it is crucial to have standardized evaluation frameworks for quantifying safety risks, and providing a roadmap for assessing alignment degradation \cite{peng2024navigating}.}  

\rebuttal{Several defensive approaches have been proposed to address these risks. Representation noising \citep{rosati2024representation} and backdoor-enhanced alignment \citep{wang2024backdooralign} prevent misuse by disrupting the adversarial reprogramming of LLMs. Techniques such as ``Vaccine'', a perturbation-aware alignment method \citep{huang2024vaccine}, and ``Safe LoRA'' [\citep{hsu2024safe}, which minimizes risks via low-rank adaptation, aim to safeguard models during fine-tuning. Additionally, \cite{lyu2024keeping} stresses the role of prompt templates in constraining outputs, even for misaligned models, while \cite{huang2024lisa} introduces ``lazy safety alignment'', leveraging dynamic checks post-fine-tuning. These solutions underscore the challenge of maintaining both customization and alignment, which remains a critical focus in the field.}
