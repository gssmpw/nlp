In conclusion, \tabglm\ marks a pivotal advancement in deep learning for tabular data by adeptly handling the inherent heterogeneity of these datasets. 
By transforming each row into both a fully connected graph and serialized text, and leveraging a graph neural network alongside a pretrained text encoder, \tabglm\ captures rich structural and semantic information. 
Its joint multi-modal, semi-supervised learning objective enhances generalization and feature representation. 
The model's flexible graph-text pipeline efficiently processes diverse feature types, resulting in a streamlined architecture with significantly fewer parameters than state-of-the-art approaches. 
Evaluations across 25 benchmark datasets reveal substantial performance gains in AUC-ROC scores, with \tabglm\ surpassing both existing deep learning and traditional machine learning methods. 
These findings underscore the power of multi-modal architectures for tabular data, opening new horizons for innovative applications across various domains.\looseness-1
