Handling heterogeneous data in tabular datasets poses a significant challenge for deep learning models. While attention-based architectures and self-supervised learning have achieved notable success, their application to tabular data remains less effective over linear and tree based models.
Although several breakthroughs have been achieved by models which transform tables into uni-modal transformations like image, language and graph, these models often underperform in the presence of feature heterogeneity.
To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\tabglm} (\textbf{Tab}ular \textbf{G}raph \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odel), a novel multi-modal architecture designed to model both structural and semantic information from a table. 
\tabglm\ transforms each row of a table into a fully connected graph and serialized text, which are then encoded using a graph neural network (GNN) and a text encoder, respectively. By aligning these representations through a joint, multi-modal, self-supervised learning objective, \tabglm\ leverages complementary information from both modalities, thereby enhancing feature learning.
\tabglm's flexible graph-text pipeline efficiently processes heterogeneous datasets with significantly fewer parameters over existing Deep Learning approaches. Evaluations across 25 benchmark datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains, with \tabglm\ achieving an average AUC-ROC improvement of up to 5.56\% over State-of-the-Art (SoTA) tabular learning methods.\looseness-1
