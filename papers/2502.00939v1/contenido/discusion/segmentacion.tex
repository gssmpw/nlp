\subsection{Segmentation}

During the segmentation process, it was identified that some images were affected by various factors associated with the capture process, resulting in a reduction of the original dataset by approximately 17.5\%.

Factors such as brightness, contrast, and lighting conditions were found to have a significant impact on the ability of a segmentation algorithm to generalize correctly. Although manual capture with mobile devices facilitates quick data collection and instant storage, these uncontrolled conditions introduce additional challenges in later stages, such as preprocessing, thereby affecting the quality and consistency of the segmentation.

However, the images discarded due to poor segmentation were not completely removed. They were included in the test set, playing an important role in evaluating the models' ability to generalize and classify images with varied characteristics, including those with imperfect segmentations.
