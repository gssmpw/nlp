In the context of this research, the pre-trained models VGG16 and VGG19 will be used, as they have demonstrated to be the best feature extractors in the study by \cite{12Leonardo2018}. Furthermore, the Inception-V1 model showed promising results in \cite{15Gonzalez-Lopez2022}, where the author recommends using more advanced versions of this model, as they may offer further improvements. Based on this recommendation, Inception-V3 will be employed. This model represents an enhanced iteration of Inception-V1, with improvements in accuracy and efficiency.
