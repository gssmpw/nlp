\subsection{Model Explainability.}

In Section \ref{sec:moscafruta}, we explain the morphological features that experts identify when classifying the species \textit{Anastrepha fraterculus} and \textit{Ceratitis capitata}.

We need to be able to explain the predictions made by our models, which is why we will use the Grad-Cam technique. This method allows us to represent what our model is "looking at" through the last convolutional layer.

This will allow us to verify that our models are correctly identifying the morphological features of each species \cite{24Selvaraju2017}.
