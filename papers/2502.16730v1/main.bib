abstract = {The field of software security testing, more specifically penetration testing, requires high levels of expertise and involves many manual testing and analysis steps. This paper explores the potential use of large-language models, such as GPT3.5, to augment penetration testers with AI sparring partners. We explore two distinct use cases: high-level task planning for security testing assignments and low-level vulnerability hunting within a vulnerable virtual machine. For the latter, we implemented a closed-feedback loop between LLM-generated low-level actions with a vulnerable virtual machine (connected through SSH) and allowed the LLM to analyze the machine state for vulnerabilities and suggest concrete attack vectors which were automatically executed within the virtual machine. We discuss promising initial results, detail avenues for improvement, and close deliberating on the ethics of AI sparring partners.},

abstract = {The recent popularity of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) corresponds with an increase in the risk of cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks are instigated by white-coat hackers, and cyber-criminals. As Connected Vehicles move towards full autonomy the impact of these cyber-attacks also grows. The current research highlights challenges faced in cybersecurity testing of CAV, including access, the cost of representative test setup and the lack of experts in the field. Possible solutions of how these challenges can be overcome are reviewed and discussed. From these findings a software simulated Vehicular Ad Hoc NETwork (VANET) is established as a cost-effective representative testbed. Penetration tests are then performed on this simulation, demonstrating a cyber-attack in CAV. Studies have shown Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve runtime, increase efficiency and comprehensively cover all the typical test aspects, in penetration testing in other industries. In this research a Reinforcement Learning model, called Q-Learning, is applied to automate the software simulation. The expectation from this implementation is to see improvements in runtime and efficiency for the VANET model. The results show this approach to be promising and using AI in penetration testing for VANET to improve efficiency in most cases. Each case is reviewed in detail before discussing possible ways to improve the implementation and get a truer reflection of the real-world application.}

ABSTRACT = {Given the large action space and state space involved in penetration testing, reinforcement learning is widely applied to enhance testing efficiency. This paper proposes an automatic penetration testing scheme based on hierarchical reinforcement learning to reduce both action space and state space. The scheme includes a network intelligence responsible for specifying the penetration host and a host intelligence designated to perform penetration testing on the selected host. Specifically, within the network intelligence, an action-masking mechanism is adopted to shield unenabled actions, thereby reducing the explorable action space and improving the penetration testing efficiency. Additionally, the host intelligence employs an invalid discrimination mechanism, terminating testing after actions that do not alter system states, thereby preventing sudden increases in the number of neural network training steps for an action. An optimistic estimation mechanism is also introduced to select penetration strategies suited to various hosts, preventing training crashes due to value confusion between different hosts. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the host intelligence can learn different penetration strategies for varying penetration depths without significant fluctuations in training steps, and the network intelligence can coordinate with the host intelligence to perform network penetration steadily. This hierarchical reinforcement learning framework can detect network vulnerabilities more quickly and accurately, significantly reducing the cost of security policy updates.},

abstract = {Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pretraining objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},
