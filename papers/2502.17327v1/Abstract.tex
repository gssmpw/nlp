Generating motion for arbitrary skeletons is a longstanding challenge in computer graphics, remaining largely unexplored due to the scarcity of diverse datasets and the irregular nature of the data. 
In this work, we introduce \algoname, a diffusion model that generates motions for diverse characters with distinct motion dynamics, using only their skeletal structure as input. 
Our work features a transformer-based denoising network, tailored for 
arbitrary skeleton
learning, integrating topology information into the traditional attention mechanism.
Additionally, by incorporating textual joint descriptions into the latent feature representation, \algoname learns semantic correspondences between joints across diverse skeletons. Our evaluation demonstrates that \algoname generalizes well, even with as few as three training examples per topology, and can produce motions for unseen skeletons as well. Furthermore, our model's latent space is highly informative, enabling downstream tasks such as joint correspondence, temporal segmentation and motion editing.
