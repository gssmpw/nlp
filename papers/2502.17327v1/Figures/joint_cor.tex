        \textbf{Spatial Correspondence.} Monkey (top left) depicts the reference skeleton, while the fox, scorpion, and bird depict different target skeletons. 
        Target skeleton joints are color-coded to match their corresponding joints in the reference. 
        For better visualization, we color the bones to match their adjacent joints. 
        Note the correspondence in limbs, spine, and tail.
