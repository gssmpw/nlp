        \textbf{Overview.}
        The input to \algoname is a noised motion $X_t$ and the skeleton $\mss=\{\pp_{\mss}, \Rcal_{\mss}, \dd_{\mss},\nn_{\mss}\}$, where $\pp_{\mss}$ refers to the rest-pose, $\Rcal_{\mss}$ denotes joints' relations, $\dd_{\mss}$ defines topological distances between each pair of joints and $\nn_{\mss}$ denotes joint names. The \textit{Enrichment Block} incorporates the skeletal features into the noised motion by concatenating the embedded $\pp_{\mss}$ to the sequence as an additional temporal token, and adding a T5-embedded name to each joint. The enriched motion is then passed through a stack of L \textit{\Stt} layers.  We apply skeletal attention along the joint axis to capture interactions between all joints, and incorporate topology information $\Rcal_{\mss}$ and $\dd_{\mss}$ to attention maps. Next, we apply temporal attention along the frame axis. Finally, the output is projected back to the motion features dimension, facilitating the reconstruction of the motion sequence.
