    \textbf{\Ingen.} The top row depicts two ground truth chicken motions: pecking (left) and walking (right). The bottom row presents synthesized motions of an adapted SinMDM (left) and \algoname (right). The emphasized frames in \algoname demonstrate spatial composition of walking and pecking, introducing novel poses not present in the ground truth. SinMDM embeds entire poses, hence cannot spatially-compose joints.
