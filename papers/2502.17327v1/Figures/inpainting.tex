        \textbf{Editing.} Top: In-betweening. Given motion prefix and suffix, \algoname can generate the middle frames. Bottom: Body part editing. Given the motion of the lower body, \algoname can generate its complement for the upper body.
        Both editing strategies produce smooth and natural transition between the given and the synthesized parts.
