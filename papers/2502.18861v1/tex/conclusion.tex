\section{Conclusion}
%In this paper, we introduced ApoloBot as a method for exploring the design space for restorative justice tools. Through interviews and a deployment with active Discord moderators, we identified key opportunities and challenges associated with these tools, considering various factors spanning the community values, moderation practices, and case scenarios that influence their effectiveness. We also discussed the evaluation for \revision{restorative outcomes} along with additional implications for future initiatives. Our work sets forth a foundation for the future design of online restorative justice tools, offering insights into their potential and areas for further development.

\revision{While restorative justice has demonstrated its potential in offline contexts, its implementation in online spaces remains a relatively new challenge. Motivated by this gap, our study introduces} ApoloBot\revision{, a Discord bot that integrates restorative principles through apology facilitation,} as a method for exploring the design space of restorative justice tools. Through interviews and a deployment with active Discord moderators, we identified key opportunities and challenges associated with these tools, considering various factors spanning the community values, moderation practices, and case scenarios that influence their effectiveness. We also \revision{expanded our focus to discuss} the evaluation for \revision{restorative outcomes,} along with \revision{broader} implications for future initiatives. Our work sets forth a foundation for the future design of online restorative justice tools, offering insights into their \revision{viability} and areas for further development.

%The potential success of online restorative justice tools is not universal; it varies based on its alignment with the community values, moderation practices and the specific nature of the harm being addressed. In this section, we describe various factors base on these scopes that impact the suitability of ApoloBot and similar restorative justice tools in online settings.
