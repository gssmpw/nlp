\caption{Demographics of moderator participants who participated in the user study. \textit{Server Category} refers to the broad topic of the community, for instance Content Creator can include Youtuber or Streamers, and Gaming can include competitive games such as League of Legends and casual plays like Party Animals. Some servers spanned multiple categories, such as a streamer playing specific games (Content Creator, Gaming), or a game with distinct characters and lore (Fandom, Gaming). While most moderators managed multiple communities, we mainly focused on their primary server or the one they deemed most relevant to the study.}
