abstract = {There has been growing attention on fairness considerations recently, especially in the context of intelligent decision making systems. For example, explainable recommendation systems may suffer from both explanation bias and performance disparity. We show that inactive users may be more susceptible to receiving unsatisfactory recommendations due to their insufficient training data, and that their recommendations may be biased by the training records of active users due to the nature of collaborative filtering, which leads to unfair treatment by the system. In this paper, we analyze different groups of users according to their level of activity, and find that bias exists in recommendation performance between different groups. Empirically, we find that such performance gap is caused by the disparity of data distribution, specifically the knowledge graph path distribution in this work. We propose a fairness constrained approach via heuristic re-ranking to mitigate this unfairness problem in the context of explainable recommendation over knowledge graphs. We experiment on several real-world datasets with state-of-the-art knowledge graph-based explainable recommendation algorithms. The promising results show that our algorithm is not only able to provide high-quality explainable recommendations, but also reduces the recommendation unfairness in several aspects.},

abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},
