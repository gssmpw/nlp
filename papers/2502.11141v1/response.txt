\section{Related Work}
%Recent surveys give an overview over the vast amount of current Neural architecture search algorithms that have been widely adopted for algorithmically finding strong performing architectures for image classification **Bingel, "Relational inductive bias for deep learning through probabilistic token permutations"** and **Real, "Regularized evolution for image classifier architecture search"**.

%One class of algorithms utilize evolutionary methods, inspired by the process of natural selection, using bio-inspired methods such as selection, mutation and crossover **Hansen, "Evolution Strategies"**.

    \caption{The evolutionary neural architecture search framework: Starting with a generation of neural architectures, for each model embeddings of all images in the shared NSD dataset are extracted. A ridge regression is then trained to predict the recorded fMRI activity and the correlation coefficient between the predicted and ground truth fMRI is calculated. The models are evaluated based on the mean correlation for all subjects, and the bottom 50\% are eliminated. Finally genetic operations are used to repopulate the models for the next generation.}
