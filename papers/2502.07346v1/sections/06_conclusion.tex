\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce \name, a comprehensive, high-quality, and multiway parallel multilingual benchmark comprising ten tasks designed to assess crucial capabilities across seventeen diverse languages.
The multilingual task data is initially translated from English using machine translation and subsequently refined through multiple iterations of post-editing by native speakers, ensuring high data quality.
Through extensive model evaluations, we find that the language-agnostic capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs remain uneven across different languages.
While increasing model size consistently enhances multilingual performance, the performance gap between English and other languages persists, highlighting the need for further efforts to achieve balanced multilingual capabilities.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
