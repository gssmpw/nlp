\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \alias, an online and scalable solution to mitigate the computational and storage overhead associated with distributed tracing.
Existing trace sampling techniques either sacrifices the accurate detection of edge cases or tracing scalability.
As an orthogonal approach, \alias reduces tracing overhead by compressing trace spans into a concise representation, substantially reducing the costs of trace transmission and storage.
This is achieved by removing the redundant data shared across multiple spans.
The full trace spans can then be seamlessly restored by retrieving the common data that are already delivered by previous spans.
At the service side, such redundancy is continuously encapsulated by Span Retrieval Tree (\sname), which will be synchronized with the backend to ensure consistent trace compression and uncompression.
To manage the complexity of \sname, \alias constantly restructures \sname into its optimal form and employs mapping technique to further reduces its size.
\alias also encompasses a differential update mechanism for efficiently synchronize \sname between services and the backend.
We have implemented \alias within OpenTelemetry Collector and evaluated it on open-source cloud services and production trace data.
Experimental results highlight its potential to pave the way for efficient system monitoring.
