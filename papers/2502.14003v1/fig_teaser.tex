Visualization of energy landscapes. Existing methods identify samples with high Hopfield energy as OOD, though such samples fall into the attractors associated with ID samples.
In contrast, our RecLag-based MHNs possess a dedicated attractor that specifically captures OOD samples.
%Visualization of energy distributions. Conventional methods identify data samples with high Hopfield energy as OOD samples, but every test sample falls into one of the attractors of ID training data.
%RecLag-based MHNs address this limitation by incorporating an attractor specifically for OOD samples.
