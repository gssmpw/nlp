\noindent\textbf{CAD Generation.}  
Parametric CAD, defined by its sketch-and-extrude operations, is central to mechanical design due to its ability to retain modeling history, which facilitates both editing and manufacturing. 
Recent large-scale CAD datasets____ have fueled the development of generative models.
____ explores unconditional generation, where a random latent vector is used as input to generate CAD models. 
____ focus on design variation generation, which randomly modifies parts of an existing CAD model. 
____ studies text-based CAD generation, which transforms textual descriptions into CAD models.
Our work differs in two key aspects.
First, we target a distinct task, unlike prior work, which either lacks text-based control____ or disregards existing CAD models as constraints____.
Second, we introduce a novel locate-then-infill framework based on LLMs to handle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing.
Previous approaches either rely on a VAE-based framework____ or use LLMs without accounting for task-specific needs____.


\noindent\textbf{Large Language Models (LLMs).} 
Recently, LLMs like GPT____ and LLaMA____ have distinguished themselves from smaller models through remarkable emergent capabilities. 
Beyond excelling in natural language processing, LLMs have transforms generative tasks in other domains, e.g., motion generation____ and material generation____. 
These advancements inspire us to adopt LLMs as the backbone for sub-tasks in our locate-then-infill framework.
Moreover, LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly utilized for data synthesis to enhance training____. 
Specifically, ____ leverage LLMs/LVLMs to synthesize data for text-based CAD generation. 
However, our task of text-based CAD editing presents distinct challenges.
First, unlike ____, who generate two-tuple data (a text prompt and a CAD model), our task involves creating triplet data: an editing instruction, an original CAD model, and an edited CAD model. 
We address this by combining design variation models with LLMs/LVLMs.
Second, while ____ focus on captioning single CAD models, our task requires summarizing differences between two CAD models. 
We handle this by introducing a stepwise captioning strategy.


\noindent\textbf{Text-based Editing in Other Domains.}
Text-based editing has been widely explored across various domains, e.g., 3D editing____, image editing____, and video editing____.
It enables users to specify and modify particular objects or attributes with precision and flexibility.
Inspired by these advancements, we introduce text-based editing in the CAD domain for the first time.
