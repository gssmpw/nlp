\section*{Impact Statement}
The societal implications of this work align with broader challenges in deploying reliable language technologies. By exposing limitations in how models process contextual information, we aim to encourage research into architectures that better prioritize relevance and accuracy. These efforts may contribute to safer integration of language technologies into real-world applications. No additional ethical concerns beyond those common to machine learning research require specific emphasis here.
