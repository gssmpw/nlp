\noindent \textbf{ADS Bug Study.} ADSes have been a focus of recent software research, particularly concerning software bugs. Garcia et al.~\cite{GarciaF0AXC20} provided a comprehensive study of bugs in AVs, which has become increasingly relevant as these systems become more prevalent in the automotive industry. 
Building on this, Zampetti et al.~\cite{ZampettiKPP22} conducted an empirical characterization of software bugs in open-source cyber-physical systems, which include ADS. Their study contributes to the understanding of the challenges and common issues in the development and maintenance of these complex systems.

\noindent \textbf{Bug-Fix Patterns.} Syntactic \bfps primarily involve changes in the code structure and statements.
Pan et al.~\cite{PanKW09} were among the pioneers in exploring this area, providing foundational insights into the nature and taxonomy of syntactic bug fixes. This study laid the groundwork for subsequent research, including Zhong et al.~\cite{ZhongS15}, who conducted an empirical study on real bug fixes, focusing on the features of Java projects. 
Soto et al.~\cite{SotoTWGL16} looked deeper into bug fixes by examining patterns, replacements, deletions, and additions. 
Following this, Campos et al.~\cite{CamposM17,CamposM19} conducted large-scale observational studies to identify common BFPs, which were instrumental in cataloging the recurrent patterns in bug fixes across various software.
Additionally, Islam et al.~\cite{IslamZ20} introduced more types of syntactic BFPs based on the study of Pan et al.~\cite{PanKW09} and provided an in-depth analysis of BFPs, particularly focusing on the structural edits and nesting levels in code. 

For semantic \bfps, Islam et al.~\cite{IslamPNR20} explored the bug fixes in deep neural networks. 
Huang et al.~\cite{Huang0WCM023} presents a comprehensive study on characterizing symptoms, root causes, and fix patterns of dependency bugs across the deep learning stack.
Du et al.~\cite{DuCC0C023} complements empirical bug studies in deep learning systems by studying six popular federated learning systems.
