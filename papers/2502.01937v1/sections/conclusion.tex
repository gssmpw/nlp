\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In the rapidly evolving landscape of autonomous driving systems, ensuring the reliability and safety of these systems is essential. Our empirical study, which focuses on \bfps in two major autonomous driving systems, Apollo and Autoware, has provided a comprehensive insight into the hierarchy of ADS bugs and their fix patterns in this domain. 
The dominant \bfps identified, encompassing issues related to path planning optimization, data flow correction, and if-related statements, underscore the multifaceted challenges developers face in maintaining and improving these systems.
Our proposed taxonomies of \numsyn syntactic and \numsem semantic \bfps 
serve as foundational resources for developers and researchers in the ADS domain by identifying \yuntianyihl{and providing a benchmark of} \numbug bug fixes. 
In future work, we aim to use the results and dataset we collected from the \bfp study for facilitating automatic program repair, enhancing debugging tools, training targeted developers, and cross-domain applications in the ADS domain.
