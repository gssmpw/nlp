\section{Related Work}
Many works in the literature have recently adopted RL and deep RL in the wireless domain, specifically in UAV networks. Among these, the authors in **Liu**, "Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled IoT Networks" optimize the UAV optimal path to maximize the data collected from IoT devices. In **Zhang**, "Joint Minimization of Age of Information and Transmission Power in IoT Devices Using Deep RL", the authors propose a DQN algorithm that can jointly minimize AoI and transmission power of limited-power devices. The authors in **Kadhim**, "Centralized and Decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Trajectory Planning in UAV Networks" compare centralized and decentralized deep RL techniques using soft actor-critic (SAC) for trajectory planning in integrated sensing and communications UAV network, where the work in **Wu**, "Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Trajectory Planning and Beamforming Design" formulates a multi-objective deep RL algorithm for trajectory planning and beamforming design.

Apart from RL and deep RL, meta-learning has been fundamental in ensuring scalability in recent wireless applications. Many works have leveraged meta-learning techniques in the wireless domain. For example, the work in **Fernando**, "Meta-Learning Approaches for Fast Training of Autoencoders in Fading Channels" was among the first to investigate meta-learning approaches for wireless communication. It proposes a MAML algorithm for fast training an autoencoder designed for transmitting and receiving data over fading channels. The authors in **Zeng**, "Fast Downlink Beamformers Using Transfer Learning and Meta-Learning" design fast downlink beamformers using transfer learning and meta-learning. The authors in **Li**, "Exploiting Meta-Learning Techniques with Graph Neural Networks for Fast Wireless Indoor Localization" exploit meta-learning techniques with graph neural networks (GNNs) for fast wireless indoor localization. In **Zhuang**, "Deep Reinforcement Learning Combined with Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptability of Optimizing Allocation Policy in Dynamic V2X Network", deep RL is combined with meta-learning to enhance the fast adaptability of the optimizing the allocation policy a dynamic V2X network, where **Sun**, "Multi-Agent Meta-RL Algorithm for Trajectories Design of Multiple UAVs" proposes a multi-agent meta-RL algorithm for trajectories design of multiple UAVs. The authors in **Wang**, "Joint Minimization of IoT Devices' Age of Information and Transmission Power Using Meta-RL Algorithm with Adaptive Objectives" jointly minimize IoT devices' AoI and transmission power using a meta-RL algorithm that adapts quickly to environments with adaptive objectives.


Although most existing RL-related works rely on online RL, offline RL has begun to get further attention in the wireless domain. The work in **Wang**, "Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Trajectory Planning of Multiple UAVs" was the first to introduce offline to the wireless domain. The authors formulate a distributional and offline multi-agent RL algorithm for planning the trajectories of multiple UAVs. The authors in **Zhang**, "Evaluating Offline Reinforcement Learning Techniques with Mixture of Datasets Collected from Different Behavioral Policies for RRM Problem" evaluate various offline RL techniques with a mixture of datasets collected from different behavioral policies for the RRM problem. In contrast, the authors in **Li**, "Distributional Reinforcement Learning Combined with Offline Reinforcement Learning for RRM Problem" combine distributional RL with offline RL for the RRM problem, where the work in **Wu**, "Solving RRM Problem Using Multi-Agent Offline Reinforcement Learning to Minimize Sum and Tail Rates Jointly" solves the RRM problem using multi-agent offline RL to minimize the combination of sum and tail rates jointly.
