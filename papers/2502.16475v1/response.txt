\subsection{2D Diffusion Priors Based 3D Generation}
\label{sec:related-2d-diffusion}
% 借助于text-to-image 的diffusion model的高质量的生成能力，一些 Multiview diffusion model可以被用来进行视图合成based on text/image and view condition. And 一些方法探索了基于广泛的2D diffusion prior进行3D generation. Some methods use SDS-loss based approach, 3DDream____, which uses a pre-trained 2D generative model to generate an initial image of the scene and then refines it through 3D reconstruction techniques. Other approaches ____ use 3D-aware 2D diffusion models, like DiffGS____, that can generate high-quality images from text prompts or other inputs.
To enable controllable 3D generation and editing, SketchDream____ allows users to modify the sketch and achieve edits using SDS optimization for vivid results. However, its controllability is limited as user modifications are made in 2D space, which may not produce the desired effect for unselected viewpoints.  Interactive3D____ directly edits 3DGS in 3D space using SDS optimization and predefined operations, converting the 3DGS representation into InstantNGP____ with further refine. MVDrag3D____ projects 3D-space drag operations onto multiview images, using 2D diffusion editing capabilities, and infers the edited 3DGS through LGM____, followed by SDS refinement. These methods offer a more user-friendly experience. However, all of these methods rely on 2D generative priors, which may lead to geometric inconsistencies as discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:related-2d-diffusion}, and require time-consuming optimization. In contrast, our method enables interactive manipulation of sparse seed points in 3D space, applying seed-point-driven deformation to modify the 3DGS without 2D priors or additional optimization, offering a more user-friendly editing experience.
% However, they all rely on 2D generative priors, leading to geometric inconsistencies as discussed in Sec. 1, and require time-consuming optimization. In contrast, our method edits sparse seed point clouds directly in 3D space,  achieving the desired 3DGS edits without the need for optimization.without relying on 2D generative priors,
