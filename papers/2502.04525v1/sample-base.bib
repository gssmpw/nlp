abstract = "The results of a multi-year research program to identify the factors associated with variations in subjective workload within and between different types of tasks are reviewed. Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload."

This includes user tests and formal experiments. We derive a model of the movement of a levitating particle in such an interface. Based on this, we develop an interactive simulation of the levitation interface in VR, which exhibits the dynamical properties of the real interface. The results of a Fitts' Law pointing study show that the Levitation Simulator enables performance, comparable to the real prototype. We developed the first two interactive games, dedicated for levitation interfaces: LeviShooter and BeadBounce, in the Levitation Simulator, and then implemented them on the real interface. Our results indicate that participants experienced similar levels of user engagement when playing the games, in the two environments. We share our Levitation Simulator as Open Source, thereby democratizing levitation research, without the need for a levitation apparatus.},

abstract = {Assembly procedures are a common task in several domains of application. Augmented Reality (AR) has been considered as having great potential in assisting users while performing such tasks. However, poor interaction design and lack of studies, often results in complex and hard to use AR systems. This paper considers three different interaction methods for assembly procedures (Touch gestures in a mobile device; Mobile Device movements; 3D Controllers and See-through HMD). It also describes a controlled experiment aimed at comparing acceptance and usability between these methods in an assembly task using Lego blocks. The main conclusions are that participants were faster using the 3D controllers and Video see-through HMD. Participants also preferred the HMD condition, even though some reported light symptoms of nausea, sickness and/or disorientation, probably due to limited resolution of the HMD cameras used in the video see-through setting and some latency issues. In addition, although some research claims that manipulation of virtual objects with movements of the mobile device can be considered as natural, this condition was the least preferred by the participants.},

We created a block-based programming interface in a VR space called BlocklyVR based on the existing Blockly programming environment. To investigate programmer performance and experience in BlocklyVR, we conducted a controlled lab experiment (N = 20) with eight programming tasks that covered mathematical operations, if-statements, and function creation. Our initial exploration contributes by classifying movement types made by BlocklyVR programmers and reflecting on how these movements are related to the programming tasks. Additionally, our data suggests that participant performance in BlocklyVR was not affected compared to the 2D Blockly, even if participants were physically moving in VR space. We also found that the virtual reality sickness was marginal. Lastly, we identified four types of interaction that can potentially be employed by VR designers and developers aiming to convert a static task, like programming at a desk, into a “mobile” immersive experience.},

In a short pre-study with 3 participants we determine an optimal number of throwing repetitions for the main study by exploring the learning curve and subjective fatigue of throwing in VR. In the main study, with 12 participants, we find that throwing precision and accuracy in VR are lower particularly in the distance and height dimensions.

abstract = {Driving simulation from the very beginning of the advent of VR technology uses the very same technology for visualization and similar technology for head movement tracking and high end 3D vision. They also share the same or similar difficulties in rendering movements of the observer in the virtual environments. The visual-vestibular conflict, due to the discrepancies perceived by the human visual and vestibular systems, induce the so-called simulation sickness, when driving or displacing using a control device (ex. Joystick). Another cause for simulation sickness is the transport delay, the delay between the action and the corresponding rendering cues.Another similarity between driving simulation and VR is need for correct scale 1:1 perception. Correct perception of speed and acceleration in driving simulation is crucial for automotive experiments for Advances Driver Aid System (ADAS) as vehicle behavior has to be simulated correctly and anywhere where the correct mental workload is an issue as real immersion and driver attention is depending on it. Correct perception of distances and object size is crucial using HMDs or CAVEs, especially as their use is frequently involving digital mockup validation for design, architecture or interior and exterior lighting.Today, the advents of high resolution 4K digital display technology allows near eye resolution stereoscopic 3D walls and integrate them in high performance CAVEs. High performance CAVEs now can be used for vehicle ergonomics, styling, interior lighting and perceived quality. The first CAVE in France, built in 2001 at Arts et Metiers ParisTech, is a 4 sided CAVE with a modifiable geometry with now traditional display technology. The latest one is Renault's 70M 3D pixel 5 sides CAVE with 4K x 4K walls and floor and with a cluster of 20 PCs. Another equipment recently designed at Renault is the motion based CARDS driving simulator with CAVE like 4 sides display system providing full 3D immersion for the driver.The separation between driving simulation and digital mockup design review is now fading though different uses will require different simulation configurations.New application domains, such as automotive AR design, will bring combined features of VR and driving simulation technics, including CAVE like display system equipped driving simulators.},

We investigate the feasibility of using virtual reality (VR) as a test-bed to evaluate deployments of public displays. Specifically, we investigate whether results from virtual field studies, conducted in a virtual public space, would match the results from a corresponding real-world setting. We report on two empirical user studies where we compared audience behavior around a virtual public display in the virtual world to audience behavior around a real public display. We found that virtual field studies can be a powerful research tool, as in both studies we observed largely similar behavior between the settings. We discuss the opportunities, challenges, and limitations of using virtual reality to conduct field studies, and provide lessons learned from our work that can help researchers decide whether to employ VR in their research and what factors to account for if doing so.},

ABSTRACT = {Significant research work has been undertaken related to the game-based learning approach over the last years. However, a closer look at this work reveals that further research is needed to examine some types of game-based learning approaches such as virtual reality serious games and LEGO Serious Play. This article examines and compares the effectiveness for learning Scrum and related agile practices of a serious game based on virtual reality and a learning activity based on the LEGO Serious Play methodology. The presented study used a quasi-experimental design with two groups, pre- and post-tests, and a perceptions questionnaire. The sample was composed of 59 software engineering students, 22 of which belonged to group A, while the other 37 were part of group B. The students in group A played the virtual reality serious game, whereas the students in group B conducted the LEGO Serious Play activity. The results show that both game-based learning approaches were effective for learning Scrum and related agile practices in terms of learning performance and motivation, but they also show that the students who played the virtual reality serious game outperformed their peers from the other group in terms of learning performance.},

A 3 year retrospective study of long-term outcome for autistic spectrum children participating in LEGO© therapy (N = 60) compared Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale socialization domain (VABS–SD) and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale social interaction subscale (GARS–SI) scores preand post-treatment with a matched comparison sample (N = 57) who received comparable non-LEGO© therapy. Although both groups made significant gains on the two outcome measures, LEGO© participants improved significantly more than the comparison subjects. Diagnosis and pre-treatment full-scale IQ scores did not predict outcome scores; however, Vineland adaptive behavior composite, Vineland communication domain, and verbal IQ all predicted outcome on the VABS–SD, especially for the LEGO© therapy group. Results are discussed in terms of implications for methods of social skills intervention for autistic spectrum disorders. }

In order to fill this gap, this study looks at the relationship between Lego construction ability, cognitive abilities and mathematical performance in 7-year-old, Year 2 primary school children (N = 66). While studies have focused on the relationship between mathematics performance and verbal memory, there are limited studies focussing on visuospatial memory. We tested both visuospatial and verbal working memory and short term memory, as well as non-verbal intelligence. Mathematical performance was measured through the WIAT-II numerical operations, and the word reading subtest was used as a control variable. We used a Lego construction task paradigm based on four task variables found to systematically increase construction task difficulty. The results suggest that Lego construction ability is positively related to mathematics performance, and visuospatial memory fully mediates this relationship. Future work of an intervention study using Lego construction training to develop visuospatial memory, which in turn may improve mathematics performance, is suggested.}

Fifteen participants completed the task in both real life and in an identical VR environment. In the second experiment, the same task was repeated at the 5ft distance only with the addition of a randomized order of three different VR controllers and the real-life condition. Results from both experiments indicate substantial differences between real life and VR performance along with differences between controllers. Significant VR research has stressed enhancing visual quality to better replicate real life. However, the focus needs to shift to examine creating accurate psychomotor interactions to achieve more accurate performance and ultimately training success. }

Subjective evaluations of 10 workload-related factors were obtained from 16 different experiments. The experimental tasks included simple cognitive and manual control tasks, complex laboratory and supervisory control tasks, and aircraft simulation. Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition. A multi-dimensional rating scale is proposed in which information about the magnitude and sources of six workload-related factors are combined to derive a sensitive and reliable estimate of workload."

abstract = {Fine motor skills are an integral part of everyday activities. Children with neurological disorders, such as cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder, have problems with fine motor skills, social interaction, and communication. Such children need to repeat a skill to acquire it. Therapy is needed so that children can develop important life skills and be involved in academic activities. However, children need to undergo long sessions of therapy, which will be tedious for them. Physical therapy can therefore be made interactive and motivating by the use of virtual reality-based games. In this chapter, a virtual reality-based serious gaming platform is proposed for fine motor skills and cognitive development of children with special needs. The Unity3D-based virtual reality environment together with a Leap Motion Controller is used to design the rehabilitation games. The Leap Motion Controller with its gesture recognition ability can provide a cohesive platform to improve the life skills of special needs children. The proposed games are developed in such a way that they improve the pincer grasp, intellectual reasoning, and hand–eye coordination of children. More colorful and fun virtual reality games are developed to keep the children engaged for longer. The developed platform is cost effective, remotely accessible, personalized, and physically less painful. The proposed virtual reality game can also be used as an auxiliary tool along with traditional rehabilitation methods.}

abstract="Background: Approximately 5{\%}-10{\%} of elementary school children show delayed development of fine motor skills. To address these problems, detection is required. Current assessment tools are time-consuming, require a trained supervisor, and are not motivating for children. Sensor-augmented toys and machine learning have been presented as possible solutions to address this problem. Objective: This study examines whether sensor-augmented toys can be used to assess children's fine motor skills. The objectives were to (1) predict the outcome of the fine motor skill part of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition (fine MABC-2) and (2) study the influence of the classification model, game, type of data, and level of difficulty of the game on the prediction. Methods: Children in elementary school (n=95, age 7.8 [SD 0.7] years) performed the fine MABC-2 and played 2 games with a sensor-augmented toy called ``Futuro Cube.'' The game ``roadrunner'' focused on speed while the game ``maze'' focused on precision. Each game had several levels of difficulty. While playing, both sensor and game data were collected. Four supervised machine learning classifiers were trained with these data to predict the fine MABC-2 outcome: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM). First, we compared the performances of the games and classifiers. Subsequently, we compared the levels of difficulty and types of data for the classifier and game that performed best on accuracy and F1 score. For all statistical tests, we used $\alpha$=.05. Results: The highest achieved mean accuracy (0.76) was achieved with the DT classifier that was trained on both sensor and game data obtained from playing the easiest and the hardest level of the roadrunner game. Significant differences in performance were found in the accuracy scores between data obtained from the roadrunner and maze games (DT, P=.03; KNN, P=.01; LR, P=.02; SVM, P=.04). No significant differences in performance were found in the accuracy scores between the best performing classifier and the other 3 classifiers for both the roadrunner game (DT vs KNN, P=.42; DT vs LR, P=.35; DT vs SVM, P=.08) and the maze game (DT vs KNN, P=.15; DT vs LR, P=.62; DT vs SVM, P=.26). The accuracy of only the best performing level of difficulty (combination of the easiest and hardest level) achieved with the DT classifier trained with sensor and game data obtained from the roadrunner game was significantly better than the combination of the easiest and middle level (P=.046). Conclusions: The results of our study show that sensor-augmented toys can efficiently predict the fine MABC-2 scores for children in elementary school. Selecting the game type (focusing on speed or precision) and data type (sensor or game data) is more important for determining the performance than selecting the machine learning classifier or level of difficulty.

abstract = {Driving simulators have become an established tool in driver behaviour research by offering a controllable, safe and cost-effective alternative to real world driving. A challenge for using driving simulators as a research tool has been to elicit driving behaviour that equals real world driving. With respect to driver headways few studies have made a direct comparison between behaviour in real and virtual environments. The present study compared driver headway choice in a driving simulator and in an instrumented vehicle. Twenty-two participants carried out instructions to either change their headway to a specific value or to choose a headway as they would normally do. The speed of the lead vehicle (80, 100 or 120km/h) as well as the target headway (1, 1.5, 2s) were varied between trials. Specific headway instructions were provided in seconds as well as metres. The attained headways were compared between the virtual and the real environment. Results show no significant difference between headway choice in the simulator and on a real road, neither for self-chosen nor for instructed headways. The results provide support for the use of driving simulators in studies on headway choice.}

abstract = {Reflecting on personal challenges can be difficult. Without encouragement, the reflection process often remains superficial, thus inhibiting deeper understanding and learning from past experiences. To allow people to immerse themselves in and deeply reflect on past challenges, we developed SelVReflect, a VR experience which offers active voice-based guidance and a space to freely express oneself. SelVReflect was developed in an iterative design process (N=5) and evaluated in a user study with N=20 participants. We found that SelVReflect enabled participants to approach their challenge and its (emotional) components from different perspectives and to discover new relationships between these components. By making use of the spatial possibilities in VR, participants developed a better understanding of the situation and of themselves. We contribute empirical evidence of how a guided VR experience can support reflection. We discuss opportunities and design requirements for guided VR experiences that aim to foster deeper reflection.},

However, co-located interactions and play can be limited due to time, distance, or pandemic-related restrictions. To facilitate distributed play, we developed MagiBricks, a system comprised of 3D-printed smart toy bricks and baseplates that provide feedback regarding their placement. The familiarity and appeal of toy bricks to both older adults and children make them ideal for intergenerational play. We conducted a within-subjects study with six grandparent-grandchildren pairs. We compared the interactions and perceived connectedness of the pairs while playing over a distance with either i) MagiBricks or ii) identical regular toy bricks. We found that MagiBricks affected communication dynamics, role taking, nature of play, and perception of connectedness during playtime compared to regular bricks, and were unanimously preferred. We contribute design implications for future systems leveraging (smart) tangibles and fostering intergenerational connectedness.},
