\section{Conclusion}
This paper begins by examining the evolution of DDoS attacks.
We highlight that these attacks are increasingly exploiting new network protocols and systems, and are employing advanced adversarial techniques to circumvent existing detection mechanisms.
We proceed by categorizing current detection methods, classifying them based on the heuristics and techniques they employ.
This analysis underscores the urgent need for modern detection systems that are not only general and efficient but also capable of distinguishing between the behaviors of legitimate users and attackers.
Additionally, we explore the potential of leveraging emerging hardware technologies to achieve line-speed packet processing and detection, offering a promising direction for enhancing response capabilities against DDoS attacks.
In conclusion, the paper provides recommendations for future research aimed at identifying DDoS vulnerabilities in new network protocols and systems.
We also discuss strategies for developing state-of-the-art DDoS detection systems that can effectively respond to the evolving landscape of network threats.
