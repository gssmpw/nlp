\section{Nearest Neighbors Visualization} \label{app:visualization}

We visualize the nearest neighbors for the self-supervised models described in Section~\ref{sec:results_infomax}. Figure~\ref{fig:nearest_neighbors_ssl} shows the predicted nearest neighbors for five randomly sampled validation images from the Clevr-4 and ImageNet datasets. The left-most image is the query image, and its nearest neighbors are the training samples whose representations have the highest cosine similarity to the query's representation. 
The figure demonstrates that the nearest neighbors visually resemble the query images on both datasets.
