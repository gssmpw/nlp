\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to assess the performance of LLMs in solving existing CAPTCHAs. Following this, we design a user study to determine how many attempts human users need to pass these CAPTCHAs. Based on the findings from our empirical study, we introduce IllusionCAPTCHA, aimed at facilitating the distinction between human users and automated bots.
Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of IllusionCAPTCHA in generating images deceptive to automated solutions. 
The experimental results show that it presents significant challenges for AI models, while simultaneously remaining accessible and user-friendly for human users. This dual capability ensures that our CAPTCHA not only enhances security against automated attacks but also provides a seamless user experience.
