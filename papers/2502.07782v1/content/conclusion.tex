\vspace{-3mm}\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced Flag Decomposition (FD), a novel matrix decomposition that uses flags to preserve hierarchical structures within data. We further proposed~\algname~
%block-modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm 
to robustly find this decomposition even under noise and outlier contamination and studied its 
%key 
properties. With this algorithm, FD augments the machine learning arsenal by providing a robust tool for working with hierarchical data, applicable in tasks like denoising, clustering, and few-shot learning, demonstrated by our evaluations. 


\paragraph{Limitations \& future work} 
Our FD framework is a first step to hierarchy-aware decompositions and leaves ample room for future study. For example, \algname~is prone to the instabilities of Gram-Schmidt and requires a flag type and column hierarchy as inputs. In the future, we will improve algorithms for faster and more stable computation. Next, we plan to automate the flag type detection and explore fine-tuning a feature extractor for few-shot learning with flags. We will also investigate learning of (latent) hierarchical structures directly from data.
