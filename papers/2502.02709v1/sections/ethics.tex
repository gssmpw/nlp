\section{Ethics Considerations and Compliance with the Open Science Policy}
\subsection{Ethics considerations}

Our work is motivated by the desire to create ergonomic \emph{necessary} notions of privacy that simultaneously preserve the intuition about the harms against which they protect and are rigorous enough to inform algorithm design. Within the scope of this work, we did not conduct experiments or write software, limiting the ethical risks associated with our research. 

While there are are other ethical considerations during the conduct of research, we start with some of the categories explicited stated within the call for papers:
\begin{itemize}[--]

    \item \emph{Impact on deployed systems:} Our work is not experimental, and therefore we did not interact with deployed systems as part of our research efforts.  Additionally, our work does not uncover vulnerabilities that could be used attack deployed systems.  
        
    \item \emph{Costs the research imposes on others:} This work does not impose costs on others.

    \item \emph{Safely and appropriately collecting data:} There was no data collected for our work. 
    
    \item \emph{Well-being of the research team:} Our research process did not expose researchers to harmful content. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compliance with the Open Science Policy}

There are no artifacts associated with our submission.
