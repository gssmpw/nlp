\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we aim to reduce the human effort required to design weak supervision labeling functions. We propose a novel system, ScriptoriumWS, to leverage code-generation models to provide programming assistance to synthesize labeling functions (LFs) automatically. We study a variety of prompting strategies, propose a simple pipeline, and obtain promising results when comparing to human-designed labeling functions on the WRENCH weak supervision benchmark. Our results show the effectiveness of ScriptoriumWS and can be used as complement approach with existing PWS pipelines to improve end model performance.
