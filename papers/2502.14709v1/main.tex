% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)

% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% data-efficient pretraining. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, such as lowering the resource barriers to developing advanced foundation models, improving the efficiency and interpretability of working with large datasets, etc. Careful consideration and responsible usage are necessary to ensure that the benefits of our approach are maximized while mitigating potential negative impacts.

Our work paves the way for a future where data-efficient pretraining seamlessly integrates data valuation, curation, and model training into a unified, self-optimizing framework. By advancing group-level data influence modeling, our approach empowers foundation models to utilize data wisely and purposefully, significantly reducing computational costs while enhancing scalability and generalization. This breakthrough has the potential to lower resource barriers, making high-performance AI more accessible to a wider range of researchers and organizations.

Beyond efficiency, our work improves the interpretability of training data influence, shedding light on how different subsets contribute to model learning. As foundation models become increasingly capable of dynamically adapting to evolving data distributions, they will drive progress in various fields, from AI-driven scientific discovery to large-scale real-world applications. Moving forward, our approach lays the groundwork for a new paradigm in pretrainingâ€”one where models autonomously optimize their learning trajectories with minimal human intervention, leading to more efficient, adaptive, and impactful AI development.

% none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here. \cx{...write something}

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.
