% \paragraph{Group-Level Data Valuation.} We approach it with data influence models.

Group-level data valuation is an important yet challenging problem in foundation model pretraining due to the non-additive and dynamic nature of individual influence~\cite{grosse2023studyinginfluence,hu2024most}. Our work approximates the oracle group-level influence with a relational data influence model and highlights the importance of having relationship terms in addressing cancellation and amplification effects between training points. Recent works~\cite{wang2024capturing} also propose to look back on the previous training trajectory to quantify temporally dependent data influence, an alternative to approach group-level influence. We believe that the future framework for data-efficient pretraining will unify data valuation, data curation, and actual pretraining in one procedure, allowing the model to self-determine which direction to move forward with minimal human efforts.
