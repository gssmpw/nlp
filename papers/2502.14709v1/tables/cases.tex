      Cancellation & Let the schools teach history, science, arts... hopefully allowing a greater degree of creativity and diversity to manifest. And parents should teach their children their philosophy, spiritual practices, and their wisdom as they see fit... & With technology,  teachers are no longer going to be relevant, but on the contrary teachers  are becoming more important, have very different role, of an expert, a  manager and a facilitator...

     % Amplification &  when I started out acting; I just wanted to tell stories and play different people. Now I know it’s my need to explore the human soul that makes me do what I do, and to be able to explore different cultures is an even bigger gift than I could have imagined.” & Shallow Grave Danny Boyle's first directorial effort is slick, but a little too stylish for its own good. For a better take on a similar premise, watch A Simple Plan (serious) or La Comunidad (absurdist). Shallow Grave goes for both, but never adds up. (Amazing that the same guy who directed this also cranked out Millions.)

     Amplification & the object is to find integers x and z satisfying the Diophantine equation x-\-4z=44 A) Inasmuch as gcd A, 4) = 1 is a divisor of 44, there is a solution to this equation. Upon multiplying the relation 1 = 1 (-3) + 4 • 1 by 44 to get 44= l(-132) + 4-44... &  Definition 2.2. Let a and b be given integers, with at least one of them different from zero. The greatest common divisor of a and b, denoted by gcd(a,b), is the positive integer d satisfying the following: (a) d | a and d | b. (b) If c | a and c | \&, then c < d...
