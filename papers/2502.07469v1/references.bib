    abstract = {We present an ultrafast neural network model, QLKNN, which predicts core tokamak transport heat and particle fluxes. QLKNN is a surrogate model based on a database of 3×108 flux calculations of the quasilinear gyrokinetic transport model, QuaLiKiz. The database covers a wide range of realistic tokamak core parameters. Physical features such as the existence of a critical gradient for the onset of turbulent transport were integrated into the neural network training methodology. We have coupled QLKNN to the tokamak modeling framework JINTRAC and rapid control-oriented tokamak transport solver RAPTOR. The coupled frameworks are demonstrated and validated through application to three JET shots covering a representative spread of H-mode operating space, predicting the turbulent transport of energy and particles in the plasma core. JINTRAC–QLKNN and RAPTOR–QLKNN are able to accurately reproduce JINTRAC–QuaLiKiz Ti,e and ne profiles, but 3–5 orders of magnitude faster. Simulations which take hours are reduced down to only a few tens of seconds. The discrepancy in the final source-driven predicted profiles between QLKNN and QuaLiKiz is on the order of 1\%–15\%. Also the dynamic behavior was well captured by QLKNN, with differences of only 4\%–10\% compared to JINTRAC–QuaLiKiz observed at mid-radius, for a study of density buildup following the L–H transition. Deployment of neural network surrogate models in multi-physics integrated tokamak modeling is a promising route toward enabling accurate and fast tokamak scenario optimization, uncertainty quantification, and control applications.},

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {A neural-network based innovative model recognizing the wavenumber space images has been developed to accurately forecast when the saturation of turbulent heat fluxes commences, i.e., the saturation time, in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. The wavenumber space images of the perturbed distribution function are focused on, which better represent the characteristics of turbulence. The model exploiting the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model is capable of detecting minuscule differences between the images. Once the wavenumber space image is fed into the developed model, it can quickly and almost perfectly classify which phase of the turbulence evolution in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations the image is in: the linearly and nonlinearly growing phases and the saturation phase. It can also predict the simulation time at which the image was processed with significantly high accuracy. The model enables us to forecast the saturation time of the gyrokinetic simulation in question by feeding an image at an early stage of the simulation and receiving the degree of progress toward the saturation. The ability of the model makes it possible to easily search out a desirable initial condition that rapidly conducts the simulation to a saturation phase. Such a pre-prediction model is important for running long time simulations on a large scale supercomputer like Fugaku in view of the efficient use of computational resources. In order to improve the predictive capability for the simulation that is going to be performed, several prediction models are trained by data with different major instabilities. The best predictor is selected to be in use based on the result of the pre-performed linear stability calculation with low computational cost.}

abstract = {Abstract Gyrokinetic simulations are required for the quantitative calculation of fluxes due to turbulence, which dominates over other transport mechanisms in tokamaks. However, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations are computationally expensive. A multimodal convolutional neural network model that reads images and values generated by nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations and predicts electrostatic turbulent heat fluxes was developed to support efficient runs. The model was extended to account for squared electrostatic potential fluctuations, which are proportional to the fluxes in the quasilinear model, as well as images containing fluctuating electron and ion distribution functions and fluctuating electrostatic potentials in wavenumber space. This multimodal model can predict the time and electron and ion turbulent heat fluxes corresponding to the input data. The model trained on the Cyclone base case data successfully predicted times and fluxes not only for its test data, but also for the completely different and unknown JT-60U case, with high accuracy. The predictive performance of the model depended on the similarity of the linear stability of the case used to train the model to the case being predicted.},

abstract = {A real-time capable core turbulence tokamak transport model is developed. This model is constructed from the regularized nonlinear regression of quasilinear gyrokinetic transport code output. The regression is performed with a multilayer perceptron neural network. The transport code input for the neural network training set consists of five dimensions, and is limited to adiabatic electrons. The neural network model successfully reproduces transport fluxes predicted by the original quasilinear model, while gaining five orders of magnitude in computation time. The model is implemented in a real-time capable tokamak simulator, and simulates a 300 s ITER discharge in 10 s. This proof-of-principle for regression based transport models anticipates a significant widening of input space dimensionality and physics realism for future training sets. This aims to provide unprecedented computational speed coupled with first-principle based physics for real-time control and integrated modelling applications.}

abstract = {The RAPTOR code is a control-oriented core plasma profile simulator with various applications in control design and verification, discharge optimization and real-time plasma simulation. To date, RAPTOR was capable of simulating the evolution of poloidal flux and electron temperature using empirical transport models, and required the user to input assumptions on the other profiles and plasma parameters. We present an extension of the code to simulate the temperature evolution of both ions and electrons, as well as the particle density transport. A proof-of-principle neural-network emulation of the quasilinear gyrokinetic QuaLiKiz transport model is coupled to RAPTOR for the calculation of first-principle-based heat and particle turbulent transport. These extended capabilities are demonstrated in a simulation of a JET discharge. The multi-channel simulation requires∼0.2 s to simulate 1 second of a JET plasma, corresponding to∼20 energy confinement times, while predicting experimental profiles within the limits of the transport model. The transport model requires no external inputs except for the boundary condition at the top of the H-mode pedestal. This marks the first time that simultaneous, accurate predictions of Te, Ti and ne have been obtained using a first-principle-based transport code that can run in faster-than-real-time for present-day tokamaks.}

In addition the physics of plasma rotation has been implemented through a formulation of the gyro-kinetic equation in the co-moving system. The gyro-kinetic model is five-dimensional and requires a massive parallel approach. GKW has been parallelised using MPI and scales well up to 8192+ cores.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU GPL v3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 29 998 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 206 943 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Fortran 95 Computer: Not computer specific Operating system: Any for which a Fortran 95 compiler is available Has the code been vectorised or parallelised?: Yes. The program can efficiently utilise 8192+ processors, depending on problem and available computer. 128 processors is reasonable for a typical nonlinear kinetic run on the latest x86-64 machines. RAM: ∼128 MB–1 GB for a linear run; 25 GB for typical nonlinear kinetic run (30 million grid points) Classification: 19.8, 19.9, 19.11 External routines: None required, although the functionality of the program is somewhat limited without a MPI implementation (preferably MPI-2) and the FFTW3 library. Nature of problem: Five-dimensional gyro-kinetic Vlasov equation in general flux tube tokamak geometry with kinetic electrons, electro-magnetic effects and collisions Solution method: Pseudo-spectral and finite difference with explicit time integration Additional comments: The MHD equilibrium code CHEASE [1] is used for the general geometry calculations. This code has been developed in CRPP Lausanne and is not distributed together with GKW, but can be downloaded separately. The geometry module of GKW is based on the version 7.1 of CHEASE, which includes the output for Hamada coordinates. Running time: (On recent x86-64 hardware) ∼10 minutes for a short linear problem; 48 hours for typical nonlinear kinetic run. References:[1] H. Lütjens, A. Bondeson, O. Sauter, Comput. Phys.

title = {Non-linear model-based optimization of actuator trajectories for tokamak plasma profile control},
journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
abstract = {A computational method is presented to determine the tokamak actuator time evolution (trajectories) required to optimally reach a given point in the tokamak operating space while satisfying a set of constraints. Usually, trajectories of plasma auxiliary heating, current drive and plasma current required during the transient phases of a tokamak shot to reach a desired shape of the plasma temperature and safety factor (q) profiles are determined by trial-and-error by physics operators. In this paper, these trajectories are calculated by solving a non-linear, constrained, finite-time optimal control problem.

The optimization problem contains a physics model of the non-linear plasma profile dynamics, a cost function to be minimized, and a set of constraints on the actuators and plasma quantities. The method is tested by optimizing the trajectories of Ip, heating and current drive power to obtain a typical hybrid plasma q profile at the end of the current ramp-up phase, while minimizing both the Ohmic flux swing and the distance from a stationary condition, and requiring q &gt; 1 and edge Vloop &gt; 0 at all times. The optimized trajectories feature an Ip overshoot similar to that used in existing experiments, and are shown to perform significantly better than a set of non-optimized trajectories, allowing stationary profiles to be obtained at the beginning of the flat-top phase. Additional information is obtained, including the parameter sensitivity of the optimal solution, a linear model describing the linearized dynamics of the profiles around the optimal trajectory, as well as a classification of the actuator trajectories based on the critical constraint which limits their value at a given time. This provides a solid basis for subsequent closed-loop feedback controller design. The tools presented in this paper could be useful to improve existing tokamak operational scenarios, to prepare operation of future machines and optimize their design.}

The fluctuating electrostatic potential frequency and wave-number spectra are chosen based on turbulence measurements and nonlinear simulations results. A peculiar focus on particle transport is developed. The directions of compressibility and thermodiffusion convections of ions and electrons are analytically derived for passing and trapped particles in both ion and electron turbulence. Also, the charge and mass dependence of trace heavy impurity convection is analytically estimated. These results are compared with quasilinear simulations done by QuaLiKiz. Finally, the impact of accounting for all unstable modes and of summing over the wave-number spectrum is shown to reverse in some cases the direction of particle fluxes.},

Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations.

abstract = {Extreme weather amplified by climate change is causing increasingly devastating impacts across the globe. The current use of physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) limits accuracy and resolution due to high computational cost and strict time-to-solution limits.We report that a data-driven deep learning Earth system emulator, FourCastNet, can predict global weather and generate medium-range forecasts five orders-of-magnitude faster than NWP while approaching state-of-the-art accuracy. FourCastNet is optimized and scales efficiently on three supercomputing systems: Selene, Perlmutter, and JUWELS Booster up to 3,808 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, attaining 140.8 petaFLOPS in mixed precision (11.9\% of peak at that scale). The time-to-solution for training FourCastNet measured on JUWELS Booster on 3,072 GPUs is 67.4 minutes, resulting in an 80,000 times faster time-to-solution relative to state-of-the-art NWP, in inference.FourCastNet produces accurate instantaneous weather predictions for a week in advance and enables enormous ensembles that could be used to improve predictions of rare weather extremes.},

abstract = {Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy but does not directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. Here, we introduce GraphCast, a machine learning–based method trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables for the next 10 days at 0.25° resolution globally in under 1 minute. GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90\% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclone tracking, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems. The numerical models used to predict weather are large, complex, and computationally demanding and do not learn from past weather patterns. Lam et al. introduced a machine learning–based method that has been trained directly from reanalysis data of past atmospheric conditions. In this way, the authors were able to quickly predict hundreds of weather variables globally up to 10 days in advance and at high resolution. Their predictions were more accurate than those of traditional weather models in 90\% of tested cases and displayed better severe event prediction for tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. —H.
