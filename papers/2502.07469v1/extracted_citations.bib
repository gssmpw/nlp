Machine learning (ML) offers a wealth of techniques to extract information from data that can be translated into knowledge about the underlying fluid mechanics. Moreover, ML algorithms can augment domain knowledge and automate tasks related to flow control and optimization. This article presents an overview of past history, current developments, and emerging opportunities of ML for fluid mechanics. We outline fundamental ML methodologies and discuss their uses for understanding, modeling, optimizing, and controlling fluid flows. The strengths and limitations of these methods are addressed from the perspective of scientific inquiry that considers data as an inherent part of modeling, experiments, and simulations. ML provides a powerful information-processing framework that can augment, and possibly even transform, current lines of fluid mechanics research and industrial applications.",

abstract = {Abstract Gyrokinetic simulations are required for the quantitative calculation of fluxes due to turbulence, which dominates over other transport mechanisms in tokamaks. However, nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations are computationally expensive. A multimodal convolutional neural network model that reads images and values generated by nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations and predicts electrostatic turbulent heat fluxes was developed to support efficient runs. The model was extended to account for squared electrostatic potential fluctuations, which are proportional to the fluxes in the quasilinear model, as well as images containing fluctuating electron and ion distribution functions and fluctuating electrostatic potentials in wavenumber space. This multimodal model can predict the time and electron and ion turbulent heat fluxes corresponding to the input data. The model trained on the Cyclone base case data successfully predicted times and fluxes not only for its test data, but also for the completely different and unknown JT-60U case, with high accuracy. The predictive performance of the model depended on the similarity of the linear stability of the case used to train the model to the case being predicted.},

title = {Toward efficient runs of nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations assisted by a convolutional neural network model recognizing wavenumber-space images},
journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {A neural-network based innovative model recognizing the wavenumber space images has been developed to accurately forecast when the saturation of turbulent heat fluxes commences, i.e., the saturation time, in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. The wavenumber space images of the perturbed distribution function are focused on, which better represent the characteristics of turbulence. The model exploiting the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model is capable of detecting minuscule differences between the images. Once the wavenumber space image is fed into the developed model, it can quickly and almost perfectly classify which phase of the turbulence evolution in nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations the image is in: the linearly and nonlinearly growing phases and the saturation phase. It can also predict the simulation time at which the image was processed with significantly high accuracy. The model enables us to forecast the saturation time of the gyrokinetic simulation in question by feeding an image at an early stage of the simulation and receiving the degree of progress toward the saturation. The ability of the model makes it possible to easily search out a desirable initial condition that rapidly conducts the simulation to a saturation phase. Such a pre-prediction model is important for running long time simulations on a large scale supercomputer like Fugaku in view of the efficient use of computational resources. In order to improve the predictive capability for the simulation that is going to be performed, several prediction models are trained by data with different major instabilities. The best predictor is selected to be in use based on the result of the pre-performed linear stability calculation with low computational cost.}

abstract = {Extreme weather amplified by climate change is causing increasingly devastating impacts across the globe. The current use of physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) limits accuracy and resolution due to high computational cost and strict time-to-solution limits.We report that a data-driven deep learning Earth system emulator, FourCastNet, can predict global weather and generate medium-range forecasts five orders-of-magnitude faster than NWP while approaching state-of-the-art accuracy. FourCastNet is optimized and scales efficiently on three supercomputing systems: Selene, Perlmutter, and JUWELS Booster up to 3,808 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, attaining 140.8 petaFLOPS in mixed precision (11.9\% of peak at that scale). The time-to-solution for training FourCastNet measured on JUWELS Booster on 3,072 GPUs is 67.4 minutes, resulting in an 80,000 times faster time-to-solution relative to state-of-the-art NWP, in inference.FourCastNet produces accurate instantaneous weather predictions for a week in advance and enables enormous ensembles that could be used to improve predictions of rare weather extremes.},
