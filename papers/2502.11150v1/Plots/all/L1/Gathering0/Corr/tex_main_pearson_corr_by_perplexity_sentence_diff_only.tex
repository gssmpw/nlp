    \caption{\textbf{Robustness to the choice of language model}. Depicted are Pearson r correlations between $\Delta Surprisal$, the surprisal difference between
original and simplified texts, and $\Delta RT$, the average reading measure difference on the same pairs of texts. Shapes represent the statistical significance level of the correlation. Colors represent the model family. Model sizes range from 70 million to 13 billion parameters.}
