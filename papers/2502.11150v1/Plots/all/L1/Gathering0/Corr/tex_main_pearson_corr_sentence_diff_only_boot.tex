    \caption{Evaluation of readability and psycholinguistic measures using reading facilitation, at the sentence level. Depicted are Pearson $r$ correlations between $\Delta \text{ReadabilityScore}_T$, the readability measure difference between original and simplified texts, and $\Delta \text{RT}_T$, the average reading measure difference on the same pairs of texts. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. Colors represent the statistical significance level of the correlation.}
