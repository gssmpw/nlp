\subsection{3D Feature Matching}
Feature matching is a crucial step in 
correspondence-based point cloud registration____. 
According to the approach of feature extraction, feature matching methods 
can be categorized into two types: traditional descriptor-based methods____ and 
learning-based methods____. 
Before the widespread adoption of deep learning, features were manually designed descriptors tailored to represent local information. 
They are classified into LRF-based methods____ and LRF-free methods____ 
based on whether a local reference frame (LRF) is needed. With the advancements in deep learning, 
numerous learning-based methods have emerged. Based on the representation strategy, 
they can be further divided into patch-based methods____ 
and fragment-based methods____. 
SpinNet____ and BUFFER____ have achieved excellent generalization ability through 3D cylindrical convolution. Additionally, CoFiNet____ and GeoTransformer____ propose a coarse-to-fine matching strategy and a Transformer-based framework, which has garnered widespread attention. Subsequent methods____ have further 
improved performance by incorporating position encoding and prior information into this framework.
ODIN____ achieves the best performance through diffusion strategy and global optimization.

\subsection{Geometry-based Outlier Removal}
Geometry-based outlier removal involves fitting models from noisy correspondences using the geometric properties of 3D scenes to estimate poses. The most classic method is random sampling consensus (RANSAC)____, which 
samples correspondences multiple times and validates to 
obtain the best pose, thus mitigating the impact of noisy correspondences. Subsequently, numerous variants of RANSAC____ have been proposed to address issues 
of time consumption and instability. TEASER____ introduces the truncated least squares (TLS) cost to solve for pose and employ rotation invariant measurements to handle outliers. Then, SC$^2$-PCR____ propose second-order consistency for robust outlier removal. In recent years, methods____ based on 
geometric consistency have been widely applied in point cloud registration, leveraging graph-theoretic approaches____ and geometric consistency to 
remove outliers, thereby achieving robust registration.

       Overall framework of our method.
       We extract features from the original point cloud, 
       obtaining features $\mathbf{{F} }^{\mathcal{P}}$ and $\mathbf{{F} }^{\mathcal{Q}}$ 
       as input for our method. 
       % Initially, global 
       % feature matching is conducted using these features, followed by simple geometric constraints 
       % for preliminary spatial filtering to obtain initial correspondences $\mathcal{{G}}^{0}$. 
       Subsequently, a progressive 
       process is applied to iteratively regenerate more accurate and denser 
       correspondences $\mathcal{{G}}^{t}$. At each iteration, the output correspondences $\mathcal{{G}}^{t-1}$ from the previous 
       iteration serve as input. Firstly, prior-guided local grouping is employed to sample 
       seed corresponding points and form local correspondence regions 
       $\mathbf{P}^{t}_i$ and $\mathbf{Q}^{t}_i$. Then, for each pair of local correspondence regions, 
       generalized mutual matching is performed to get new correspondences. Next, these correspondences are refined locally and globally using our center-aware three-point consistency, 
       followed by a merging operation $\oplus$ of local correspondences $\mathcal{{G}}^{t}_{i}$ using a hash table.
       % Finally, pose $\mathbf T\{\mathbf R,\mathbf t\}$ is estimated using refined correspondences $\mathcal{{G}}^{T}$ through efficient SVD
       % , and Point-level Correspondence Verification is proposed for further pose refinement.
       Finally, using these refined correspondences,
       we achieve robust and accurate transformation estimation $\mathbf T\{\mathbf R,\mathbf t\}$ only with SVD.

\subsection{Learning-based Outlier Removal}
Recent researches____ have integrated 
deep learning into outlier removal and pose estimation, 
showcasing promising performance through training. 
Inspired by image matching____, 3DRegNet____ adapts CN-Net____ to remove outliers in point cloud registration. Subsequently, PointDSC____ embeds the spatial consistency 
into feature maps and employs neural spectral matching to estimate confidence of correspondences, 
achieving robust registration. VBReg____ utilizes variational Bayesian inference 
to achieve better outlier removal. Hunter____ addresses severe outlier issues 
by introducing higher-order consistency using hypergraphs. However, while both geometry-based 
and learning-based methods have shown effectiveness in outlier removal, 
they inherently rely on the initial correspondences and only trim down on them, 
which poses challenges when initial inliers are scarce.
