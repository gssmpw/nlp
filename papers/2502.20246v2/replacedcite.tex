\paragraph{Data Poisoning on Code LLMs}
With the growing adoption of Code LLMs, concerns about training data security have intensified. For instance, OWASP has labeled \textit{Data and Model Poisoning} as a critical threat.\footnote{OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 (\url{https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/})} Various studies highlight different attacks in Code LLMs. ____ implant backdoors by modifying variable or method names with specific triggers, while others____ insert dead code into training data. 

\paragraph{Poisoning Defense on Code LLMs}
Several defense mechanisms have been introduced to combat data poisoning in code. One widely used technique is spectral signature analysis____, which detects anomalies by comparing the feature distributions of poisoned versus standard samples. Additional defenses leverage activation clustering____ or token-level detection____, but these can inadvertently remove or modify crucial elements such as keywords, punctuation, or parts of identifiersâ€”ultimately risking syntactic and semantic integrity.
