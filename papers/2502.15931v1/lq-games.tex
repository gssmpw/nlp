\section{LQ Network Games with Graph Structure}

Let us consider a class of linear-quadratic games played on a graph. There are multiple ways to introduce a graph-type formalism into LQ games. We will consider a broad class of games where each player gets to pick an {\em control input} which diffuses according to the graph structure. However, cost can be a globally dependent phenomenon. 

Concretely, consider an $n$-person game, $T$-stage game played on a weighted graph $G \in \RR^{n \times n}$. The state at time $t$ for $1 \leq t \leq T$ is given by $x_t \in \RR^d$. The {\em intrinsic dynamics} are described by a matrix $A_t \in \RR^{d \times d}$, and the control-dynamics are given by a matrix $B_t \in \RR^{d \times n}$. 

At time $t$ each player $j$ gets to choose a scalar control $u_{t;j} \in \RR$ and this results in the control input $u_t \in \RR^n$. The dynamics are thus: 

\[
x_{t+1} = A_t x_{t} + (B_t \circ G) u_t
\]

Where $\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product. The point is that if $i \not\sim j$ in the graph, then $B_{t;ij} = 0$. However, in general $B_t$ can re-weight arbitrarily. 

The cost for player $i$ across time is given as: 

\[
J^i = \frac 1 2 \sum_{t \in [T]} \big[ \la x_t^T Q_t^i + 2 q_{t}^{i}, x_t \ra 
+ \la u_t^T R_t^i + 2 r_t^i, u_t \ra
\big]
\]

For appropriate matrices and vectors $Q, R, q, r$. 

We claim that this is the most general class of LQ games possible with a notion of graph structure. We may want to impose additional constraints, such each player only suffering control costs from their own actions (e.g. $R_t^i = e_i e_i^T, r_t^i = e_i$) and so on. But in this model, costs are fully global while dynamics are a mixture of some driving process given by $A_t$ and a control process which diffuses on the graph and is then filtered by the $B_t$. 

It is known that dynamic programming gives optimal feedback control policies for this game. The idea is to solve a coupled system of $n$ Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. 

{\bf The role of inference.} In general the feedback solution requires full knowledge of the $B_t$ matrix, which encodes graph structure. Our question is: What can 

{\bf External observer.} Following the model of \cite{leng2020learning}, suppose we observe $m$ independent PSNEs of the form $(I - \beta G) \bm{a} = \bm{b}$. Then to joinly infer $G, \bm{b}_1, \dots, \bm{b}_m$, we can solve a quadratic optimization problem in the matrices $G, B$. 

In our case, the vector $\bm{b}$ shows up in the utility of each player, but there are no dynamics. Therefore, we need a reasonable dynamical model to make sense of this question. 

{\bf Graph imputation.}

{\bf Controls-type approaches.} In controls papers like \cite{peters2021inferring}, we can solve the inverse game by just writing down the optimality conditions of players as constraints, and then optmizing for fit with observations, or just directly minimizing KKT residuals. What about provable guarantees?
