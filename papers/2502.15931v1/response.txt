\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Opinion Dynamics} Opinion dynamics are well-studied in computer science and economics, as well as sociology, political science, and related fields. There have been many models proposed for opinion dynamics, such as with network interactions as we study in this paper (FJ model) **Grimmett, "Percolation"**, ____ as bounded confidence dynamics (**Hegselman-Krausse Model**), coevolutionary dynamics ____ as well as many variants of them; see, for example _____. The work of **Alon et al., "The Influencer"** shows bounds on the Price of Anarchy (PoA) between the PSNE and the welfare-optimal solution for the FJ model, and the subsequent work of ____ shows PoA bounds for the coevolutionary dynamics. Additionally, the opinion dynamics have been modeled by the control community; see, for example, ____.

As in these works, we treat the FJ model as a basis. However, our work is significantly different as it studies a framework where any subset $S \subseteq [n]$ of strategic agents can {\em deviate} from their truthful intrinsic opinions, as opposed to studying the evolution of the expressed opinions and their PSNE in the FJ model. In our model, each strategic agent $i \in S$ can only choose a single entry $\bs_i^\prime$ of the overall deviation $\bs^\prime$, but pays a cost based on the resulting equilibrium ($\bz^\prime = B \bs^\prime$), which depends on the choices of other members of $S$.

\paragraph{Disagreement and Polarization in Social Networks} Motivated by real-world manipulation of social networks in, e.g., the 2016 US election, a recent line of work studies polarization and strategic behavior in opinion dynamics _____. **Aral et al., "Distinguishing Influence from Popularity"** consider a model in which an adversary can control $k \leq n$ nodes' internal opinions and seeks to maximize polarization at equilibrium. Similarly, ____ considers a single adversary who can modify intrinsic opinions $\bm{s}$ belonging to an $\ell_2$-ball. More recent work also studies modification of agents' susceptibility parameters $\alpha_i$ to alter the median opinion at equilibrium____. By contrast, we study a setting in which any subset $S \subseteq [n]$ can be strategic. Unlike previous works, these ``adversaries'' can have conflicting goals in our model.

\paragraph{Manipulation of Dynamic Games.} Opinion dynamics are a widely studied instance of a network game, which is a game played by nodes in a network with payoffs depending on the actions of their neighbors_____. In addition to the manipulation of opinion dynamics, researchers have studied strategic manipulation of financial network formation _____. In the non-network setting, researchers have studied the manipulation of recommendation systmes from a game-theoretic perspective _____, as well as security games _____, repeated auctions ____ and Fisher markers with linear utilities ____.

% Moreover, works in multi-agent learning consider optimal play against a learning algorithm_____, but only a single agent against a single learner. By contrast we study strategic behavior by 
% in network games, in which an agent must consider not only their neighbors, but the neighbors of their neighbors, and so on.

% \paragraph{Anomaly Detection in Graphs.} Our work is also related to the anomaly detection literature in networks. One work closely related to ours is the work of ____ where the authors want to detect Anti-Benford subgraphs in a large transaction or financial graph. The Anti-Benford subgraphs consist of a set of nodes that perform many transactions that significantly deviate from Benford's law, and the authors develop a hypothesis test to detect such graphs. Similarly, the work of ____ proposes a framework based on a chi-squared statistic to perform a graph similarity search.  In our paper, similarly, we develop a robust regression and a hypothesis testing algorithm that is able to detect nodes that are strategic and misreport their opinions. Additionally, our work assumes the strategic behavior of the agents, whereas the works of ____ do not.

% In a similar spirit, the work of ____ studies financial networks, whereas a subset of strategic agents has incentives to misreport their own local network connections in order to obtain higher utility, and develop algorithms that can identify the set of such agents. Our paper works in a similar flavor, however, in a significantly different application domain and context, which corresponds to social networks.


\paragraph{Learning from Strategic Data.} We develop learning algorithms which observe the (possibly manipulated) equilibrium $\bz^\prime$ to detect if manipulation occurred, and if so who was responsible. The former problem relates to anomaly detection in networks. ____ develop a hypothesis test to detect such fraud in financial transaction neteworks, by testing if certain subgraphs deviate from Benford's Law. Similarly, ____ propose a framework based on a $\chi^2$-statistic to perform graph similarity search.

The problem of recovering the set of deviators relates to the broader literature of learning from observations of network games. Most works give learning algorithms for games {\em without} manipulation_____. But our data $\bz^\prime$ can be a manipulated equilibrium, which is a {\em strategic sources} of data____. Learning algorithms for strategic sources are known for certain settings such as linear classifiers with small-deviation assumptions ____ , or binary classifiers in a linear reward model ____ . When agents can modify their features to fool a known algorithm, even strategy-robust classifiers such as ____ can be inaccurate ____ .  
Since agents can deviate arbitrarily in our model, we use a robust regression method with guarantees against {\em adversarial} corruptions ____ , similar to the learning algorithms in ____ . The work of ____ studies learning from financial networks with strategic manipulations, which is in a similar spirit to our work but differs significantly in the application domain and context.

% Our setting is closest to that of ____, who give 

% .  A growing body of work studies learning from ``strategic sources'' of data such as $\bz^\prime$. 

%  ____ study strategy-awareness for linear classification, but assume that agents can only misreport data up to an $\eps$-ball. Our setting is closer to that of ____, who show that agents who are evaluated by a third-party classifier (e.g. for approval for a bank loan) can strategically modify their features to game the classifier, even if the classifier used is strategy-robust in the sense of ____ . 
% ____ give a $\Tilde{O}(n^{(d+1)/(d+2)})$-regret algorithm for online binary classification against $n$ strategic agents with $d$-dimensional features, but in a linear reward model. Finally, ____ give a mechanism to encourage strategic data providers to report truthful data, but in a model where the data providers have no incentive to hurt the classifier's accuracy (e.g. crowdsourcing).

% \paragraph{Network Games.} Network games, also known as graphical games, involve $n$ agents whose payoffs are influenced by the actions of their neighbors_____. A substantial body of research examines learning from observations of such games_____. These studies typically focus on games with finite or one-dimensional action spaces, whereas in our model, each of the $n$ agents operates in an $n$-dimensional action space.

% Furthermore, another area of research explores influencing the outcomes of network games. Most of these studies address games with one-dimensional action spaces and a single strategic actor_____. In contrast, we consider arbitrary sets of strategic actors. Recent works have also examined scenarios with multiple strategic actors, such as in repeated auctions ____ and Fisher markets with linear utilities ____ . While relevant, this work does not directly apply to our setting since it focuses on optimizing individual agents rather than studying the overall network behavior.
