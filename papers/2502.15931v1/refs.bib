This gives raise in particular to new algorithmic challenges driven by the thresholds. This paper investigates whether a general phenomenon takes place for multiple communities, without imposing symmetry. In the general stochastic block model SBM (n, p, W), n vertices are split into k communities of relative siz{\{}pi{\}} i∈[k], and vertices in community i and j connect independently with probability {\{}Wij{\}}i,j ∈[k]. This paper investigates the partial and exact recovery of communities in the general SBM (in the constant and logarithmic degree regimes), and uses the generality of the results to tackle overlapping communities. The contributions of the paper are: (i) an explicit characterization of the recovery threshold in the general SBM in terms of a new f-divergence function D+, which generalizes the Hellinger and Chern off divergences, and which provides an operational meaning to a divergence function analog to the KL-divergence in the channel coding theorem, (ii) the development of an algorithm that recovers the communities all the way down to the optimal threshold and runs in quasi-linear time, showing that exact recovery has no information-theoretic to computational gap for multiple communities, (iii) the development of an efficient algorithm that detects communities in the constant degree regime with an explicit accuracy bound that can be made arbitrarily close to 1 when a prescribed signal-to-noise ratio (defined in term of the spectrum of diag(p)W tends to infinity.},

	abstract     = {The stochastic block model with two communities, or equivalently the planted bisection model, is a popular model of random graph exhibiting a cluster behavior. In the symmetric case, the graph has two equally sized clusters and vertices connect with probability p within clusters and q across clusters. In the past two decades, a large body of literature in statistics and computer science has focused on providing lower bounds on the scaling of |p - q| to ensure exact recovery. In this paper, we identify a sharp threshold phenomenon for exact recovery: if $\alpha$ = pn/log(n) and $\beta$ = qn/log(n) are constant (with $\alpha${\textgreater} $\beta$), recovering the communities with high probability is possible if ($\alpha$ + $\beta$/2) - √$\alpha$$\beta$ {\textgreater} 1 and is impossible if ($\alpha$ + $\beta$/2) - √$\alpha$$\beta$ {\textless} 1. In particular, this improves the existing bounds. This also sets a new line of sight for efficient clustering algorithms. While maximum likelihood (ML) achieves the optimal threshold (by definition), it is in the worst case NP-hard. This paper proposes an efficient algorithm based on a semidefinite programming relaxation of ML, which is proved to succeed in recovering the communities close to the threshold, while numerical experiments suggest that it may achieve the threshold. An efficient algorithm that succeeds all the way down to the threshold is also obtained using a partial recovery algorithm combined with a local improvement procedure.},

This body of literature suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation on social networks: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider those that modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. Here, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and formalize the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of susceptibility. We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility leads to an interesting family of new questions in network opinion dynamics. We find that the questions are quite different depending on whether there is an overall budget constraining the number of agents we can target or not. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set. We show that this problem is NP-hard when there is a budget, and that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular. Finally, we propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization problem and show its efficacy at finding target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions on real world networks, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates.},

However, beyond a certain point, dense interconnections serve as a mechanism for the propagation of shocks, leading to a more fragile financial system. Our results thus highlight that the same factors that contribute to resilience under certain conditions may function as significant sources of systemic risk under others.},

This trend has been most pronounced in the United States but has had a profound influence on the global financial system as a whole. In a market-based financial system, banking and capital market developments are inseparable, and funding conditions are closely tied to the fluctuations in leverage of market-based financial intermediaries. Balance-sheet growth of market-based financial intermediaries provides a window on liquidity in the sense of the availability of credit, whereas financial crises tend to be associated with contractions of balance sheets. We describe the changing nature of financial intermediation in the market-based financial system, chart the course of the recent financial crisis, and outline the policy responses that have been implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to counter it.},

Changes in dealer repos—the primary margin of adjustment for the aggregate balance sheets of intermediaries—forecast changes in financial market risk as measured by the innovations in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX). Aggregate liquidity can be seen as the rate of change of the aggregate balance sheet of the financial intermediaries.},

We develop and implement moment-based estimation and testing procedures for this model. The estimates provide evidence of self-excitation both in the US and the other world markets, and of asymmetric cross-excitation, with the US market typically having more influence on the jump intensity of other markets than the reverse. We propose filtered values of the jump intensities as a measure of market stress and examine their out-of-sample forecasting abilities.},

We introduce a criterion for the resilience of a large financial network to the insolvency of a small group of financial institutions and quantify how contagion amplifies small shocks to the network. Our results emphasize the role played by "contagious links" and show that institutions which contribute most to network instability have both large connectivity and a large fraction of contagious links.

We also take an overview of the new emergent features coming out from the interplay between the structure and the function of the underlying patterns of connections. Extensive numerical work as well as analytical approaches to the problem are presented. Finally, we review several applications of synchronization in complex networks to different disciplines: biological systems and neuroscience, engineering and computer science, and economy and social sciences. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We also consider hypotheses concerning the validity of sparsification of a network (e.g., based on the strength of ties) and hypotheses restricting heterogeneity in peer effects (so that, e.g., only the number or fraction treated among neighboring units matters). Our general approach is to define an artificial experiment, such that the null hypothesis that was not sharp for the original experiment is sharp for the artificial experiment, and such that the randomization analysis for the artificial experiment is validated by the design of the original experiment.},

	abstract     = {Bucket testing, also known as A/B testing, is a practice that is widely used by on-line sites with large audiences: in a simple version of the methodology, one evaluates a new feature on the site by exposing it to a very small fraction of the total user population and measuring its effect on this exposed group. For traditional uses of this technique, uniform independent sampling of the population is often enough to produce an exposed group that can serve as a statistical proxy for the full population. In on-line social network applications, however, one often wishes to perform a more complex test: evaluating a new social feature that will only produce an effect if a user and some number of his or her friends are exposed to it. In this case, independent uniform draws from the population are unlikely to produce groups that contains users together with their friends, and so the construction of the sample must take the network structure into account. This leads quickly to challenging combinatorial problems, since there is an inherent tension between producing enough correlation to select users and their friends, but also enough uniformity and independence that the selected group is a reasonable sample of the full population. Here we develop an algorithmic framework for bucket testing in a network that addresses these challenges. First we describe a novel walk-based sampling method for producing samples of nodes that are internally well-connected but also approximately uniform over the population. Then we show how a collection of multiple independent subgraphs constructed this way can yield reasonable samples for testing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through computational experiments on large portions of the Facebook network.

We consider several penalty functions, involving error estimates on independent test data, empirical {\{}$\backslash$sc vc{\}} dimension, empirical {\{}$\backslash$sc vc{\}} entropy, and margin-based quantities. We also consider the maximal difference between the error on the first half of the training data and the second half, and the expected maximal discrepancy, a closely related capacity estimate that can be calculated by Monte Carlo integration.

However, there is no widely accepted methodology to determine the systemically important nodes in a network. To fill this gap, we introduce, DebtRank, a novel measure of systemic impact inspired by feedback-centrality. As an application, we analyse a new and unique dataset on the USD 1.2 trillion FED emergency loans program to global financial institutions during 2008g-2010. We find that a group of 22 institutions, which received most of the funds, form a strongly connected graph where each of the nodes becomes systemically important at the peak of the crisis. Moreover, a systemic default could have been triggered even by small dispersed shocks. The results suggest that the debate on too-big-to-fail institutions should include the even more serious issue of too-central-to-fail.},

In recent years, quite a few approaches have been developed to learn the graph structure underlying a set of observations captured in a data space. Although real world data is often acquired in settings where relationships are influenced by a priori known rules, this domain knowledge is still not well exploited in structure inference problems. In this paper, we identify the structure of signals defined in a data space whose inner relationships are encoded by multi-layer graphs. We aim at properly exploiting the information originating from each layer to infer the global structure underlying the signals. We thus present a novel method for combining the multiple graphs into a global graph using mask matrices, which are estimated through an optimization problem that accommodates the multi-layer graph information and a signal representation model. The proposed mask combination method also estimates the contribution of each graph layer in the structure of signals. The experiments conducted both on synthetic and real world data suggest that integrating the multi-layer graph representation of the data in the structure inference framework enhances the learning procedure considerably by adapting to the quality and the quantity of the input data},

Many proposals for financial reform address the need for systemic regulation - that is, regulation focused on the soundness of the whole financial system and not just that of individual institutions. In this paper, we study one particular problem faced by a systemic regulator: the tension between the distribution of assets that individual banks would like to hold and the distribution across banks that best supports system stability if greater weight is given to avoiding multiple bank failures. By diversifying its risks, a bank lowers its own probability of failure. However, if many banks diversify their risks in similar ways, then the probability of multiple failures can increase. As more banks fail simultaneously, the economic disruption tends to increase disproportionately. We show that, in model systems, the expected systemic cost of multiple failures can be largely explained by two global parameters of risk exposure and diversity, which can be assessed in terms of the risk exposures of individual actors. This observation hints at the possibility of regulatory intervention to promote systemic stability by incentivizing a more diverse diversification among banks. Such intervention offers the prospect of an additional lever in the armory of regulators, potentially allowing some combination of improved system stability and reduced need for additional capital.},

This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.},

This allows us to study the cost of disagreement by comparing between the cost at equilibrium and the social optimum.

	abstract     = {We developed a computational tool to assess the risks of novel coronavirus outbreaks outside of China. We estimate the dependence of the risk of a major outbreak in a country from imported cases on key parameters such as: (i) the evolution of the cumulative number of cases in mainland China outside the closed areas; (ii) the connectivity of the destination country with China, including baseline travel frequencies, the effect of travel restrictions, and the efficacy of entry screening at destination; and (iii) the efficacy of control measures in the destination country (expressed by the local reproduction number R loc ). We found that in countries with low connectivity to China but with relatively high R loc , the most beneficial control measure to reduce the risk of outbreaks is a further reduction in their importation number either by entry screening or travel restrictions. Countries with high connectivity but low R loc benefit the most from policies that further reduce R loc . Countries in the middle should consider a combination of such policies. Risk assessments were illustrated for selected groups of countries from America, Asia, and Europe. We investigated how their risks depend on those parameters, and how the risk is increasing in time as the number of cases in China is growing.},

First to present classical results in a way that is accessible to non-specialists. Second, to describe results of Smirnov in conformal invariance, and outline the proof that the critical probability for random Voronoi percolation in the plane is 1/2. Throughout, the presentation is streamlined, with elegant and straightforward proofs requiring minimal background in probability and graph theory. Numerous examples illustrate the important concepts and enrich the arguments. All-in-all, it will be an essential purchase for mathematicians, physicists, electrical engineers and computer scientists working in this exciting area.},

Inspired by cascades of load shedding in coupled electric grids and other infrastructure, we study the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model on modular random graphs and on graphs based on actual, interdependent power grids. Starting from two isolated networks, adding some connectivity between them is beneficial, for it suppresses the largest cascades in each system. Too much interconnectivity, however, becomes detrimental for two reasons. First, interconnections open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large cascades. Second, as in real infrastructure, new interconnections increase capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. Using a multitype branching process and simulationswe show these effects and estimate the optimal level of interconnectivity that balances their trade-offs. Such equilibria could allow, for example, power grid owners to minimize the largest cascades in their grid.We also showthat asymmetric capacity among interdependent networks affects the optimal connectivity that each prefers and may lead to an arms race for greater capacity. Ourmultitype branching process framework provides building blocks for better prediction of cascading processes on modular random graphs and on multitype networks in general.},

Notably, we consider the effect of heterogeneous degree distributions, heterogeneous balance sheet size and degree correlations between banks. We study the probability of contagion conditional on the failure of a random bank, the most connected bank and the biggest bank, and we consider the effect of targeted policies aimed at increasing the capital requirements of a few banks with high connectivity or big balance sheets. Networks with heterogeneous degree distributions are shown to be more resilient to contagion triggered by the failure of a random bank, but more fragile with respect to contagion triggered by the failure of highly connected nodes. A power law distribution of balance sheet size is shown to induce an inefficient diversification that makes the system more prone to contagion events. A targeted policy aimed at reinforcing the stability of the biggest banks is shown to improve the stability of the system in the regime of high average degree. Finally, disassortative mixing, such as that observed in real banking networks, is shown to enhance the stability of the system. {\textcopyright} 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We develop a network approach to the amplification of financial contagion due to the combination of overlapping portfolios and leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a generalized branching process. This can be used to compute the stability for any particular configuration of portfolios. By studying a stylized model we estimate the circumstances under which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a function of parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification, and market impact. Although diversification may be good for individual institutions, it can create dangerous systemic effects, and as a result financial contagion gets worse with too much diversification. There is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are always stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases. Note that our model assumes passive portfolio management during a crisis; however, we show that dynamic deleveraging during a crisis can amplify instabilities. The financial system exhibits "robust yet fragile" behavior, with regions of the parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it occurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and provide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

To capture the negative link between volatility and stock price, we assume a constant elasticity of variance (CEV) specification for the instantaneous stock volatility prior to default. We show that deterministic changes of time and scale reduce our stock price process to a standard Bessel process with killing. This reduction permits the development of completely explicit closed form solutions for risk-neutral survival probabilities, CDS spreads, corporate bond values, and European-style equity options. Furthermore, our valuation model is sufficiently flexible so that it can be calibrated to exactly match arbitrarily given term structures of CDS spreads, interest rates, dividend yields, and at-the-money implied volatilities.},

For scalings that take into account only natural selection, we obtain a hyperbolic singular equation that embeds the Replicator Dynamics and satisfies only one conservation law.

We build a feedback model to try and capture some of these effects, in which traditional economic demand for a commodity, oil say, is perturbed by the influence of portfolio optimizers. We approach the full problem of utility maximizing with a risky asset whose dynamics are impacted by trading through a sequence of problems that can be reduced to linear PDEs, and we find correlation effects proportional to the long or short positions of the investors, along with a lowering of volatility.},

For example, spectral radius (or the principal eigenvalue) is related to the effective spreading rates of dynamic processes (e.g., rumor, disease, information propagation) on graphs. Algebraic connectivity (or the Fiedler value), which is a lower bound on the node and edge connectivity of a graph, captures the “partitionability” of a graph into disjoint components. In this work we address the problem of modifying a given graph's structure under a given budget so as to maximally improve its robustness, as quantified by spectral measures. We focus on modifications based on degree-preserving edge rewiring, such that the expected load (e.g., airport flight capacity) or physical/hardware requirement (e.g., count of ISP router traffic switches) of nodes remain unchanged. Different from a vast literature of measure-independent heuristic approaches, we propose an algorithm, called EdgeRewire, which optimizes a specific measure of interest directly. Notably, EdgeRewire is general to accommodate six different spectral measures. Experiments on real-world datasets from three different domains (Internet AS-level, P2P, and airport flights graphs) show the effectiveness of our approach, where EdgeRewire produces graphs with both (i) higher robustness, and (ii) higher attack-tolerance over several state-of-the-art methods.},

This is particularly so when relatively small data sets, as compared to the number signal components, have to be used. It is often the case that each component of the measured signal can be described in terms of a few other measured variables and these dependences can be encoded in a graphical way via so called "Dynamic Bayesian Networks". The problem of finding the interconnection structure as well as estimating the dynamic models can be posed as a system identification problem which involves variable selection. While this variable selection could be performed via standard selection techniques, computational complexity may however be a critical issue, being combinatorial in the number of inputs and outputs. In this paper we introduce two new nonparametric techniques which borrow ideas from a recently introduced kernel estimator called "stable-spline" as well as from sparsity inducing priors which use ℓ 1-type penalties. Numerical experiments regarding estimation of large scale sparse (ARMAX) models show that this technique provides a definite advantage over a group LAR algorithm and state-of-the-art parametric identification techniques based on prediction error minimization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The assumption that the response variables are independent is, however, too strong. In many applications, these responses are collected on nodes of a network, or some spatial or temporal domain, and are dependent. Examples abound in financial and meteorological applications, and dependencies naturally arise in social networks through peer effects. Regression with dependent responses has thus received a lot of attention in the Statistics and Economics literature, but there are no strong consistency results unless multiple independent samples of the vectors of dependent responses can be collected from these models. We present computationally and statistically efficient methods for linear and logistic regression models when the response variables are dependent on a network. Given one sample from a networked linear or logistic regression model and under mild assumptions, we prove strong consistency results for recovering the vector of coefficients and the strength of the dependencies, recovering the rates of standard regression under independent observations. We use projected gradient descent on the negative log-likelihood, or negative log-pseudolikelihood, and establish their strong convexity and consistency using concentration of measure for dependent random variables.},

These opinions are influenced by network neighbors. Many models have been proposed for such opinion dynamics, but they have some limitations. Most consider the strength of edge influence as fixed. Some model a discrete decision or action on part of each actor, and an edge as causing an "infection" (that is often permanent or self-resolving). Others model edge influence as a stochastic matrix to reuse the mathematics of eigensystems. Actors' opinions are usually observed globally and synchronously. Analysis usually skirts transient effects and focuses on steady-state behavior. There is very little direct experimental validation of estimated influence models. Here we initiate an investigation into new models that seek to remove these limitations. Our main goal is to estimate, not assume, edge influence strengths from an observed series of opinion values at nodes. We adopt a linear (but not stochastic) influence model. We make no assumptions about system stability or convergence. Further, actors' opinions may be observed in an asynchronous and incomplete fashion, after missing several time steps when an actor changed its opinion based on neighbors' influence. We present novel algorithms to estimate edge influence strengths while tackling these aggressively realistic assumptions. Experiments with Reddit, Twitter, and three social games we conducted on volunteers establish the promise of our algorithms. Our opinion estimation errors are dramatically smaller than strong baselines like the DeGroot, flocking, voter, and biased voter models. Our experiments also lend qualitative insights into asynchronous opinion updates and aggregation.},

Starting at R(0) = 0 , whenever a particle attempts to jump into R(t) the latter instantaneously moves k≥ 1 steps to the right, absorbing all particles along its path. We take k to be the minimal random integer such that exactly k particles are absorbed by the move of R, and view the particle system as a discrete version of the Stefan problem∂tu∗(t,$\xi$)=12∂$\xi$2u∗(t,$\xi$),$\xi${\textgreater}r(t),u∗(t,r(t))=0,ddtr(t)=12∂$\xi$u∗(t,r(t)),t↦r(t)non-decreasing,r(0):=0.For a constant initial particle density u ∗ (0 , $\xi$) = $\rho$1 {\{}$\xi${\textgreater}{\}} , at $\rho${\textless} 1 the particle system and the PDE exhibit the same diffusive behavior at large time, whereas at $\rho$≥ 1 the PDE explodes instantaneously. Focusing on the critical density $\rho$= 1 , we analyze the large time behavior of the front R(t) for the particle system, and obtain both the scaling exponent of R(t) and an explicit description of its random scaling limit. Our result unveils a rarely seen phenomenon where the macroscopic scaling exponent is sensitive to the amount of initial local fluctuations. Further, the scaling limit demonstrates an interesting oscillation between instantaneous super- and sub-critical phases. Our method is based on a novel monotonicity as well as PDE-type estimates.},

Different state-of-the-art tools for network inference use specific assumptions and simplifications to deal with underdetermination, and these influence the inferences. The outcome of network inference therefore varies between tools and can be highly complementary.

We propose a model selection procedure based on a worst-case analysis and on a data-independent choice of the parameter. For the regularized least-squares algorithm we bound the generalization error of the solution by a quantity depending on a few known constants and we show that the corresponding model selection procedure reduces to solving a bias-variance problem. Under suitable smoothness conditions on the regression function, we estimate the optimal parameter as a function of the number of data and we prove that this choice ensures consistency of the algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2004 SFoCM.},

First we review some basic concepts on spectral graph theory, including adjacency and Laplacian matrices, paying special attention to the topological implications of having large spectral gaps. We also introduce related concepts such as 'expanders', Ramanujan, and Cage graphs. Afterwards, we discuss two different dynamical features of Networks, synchronizability and flow of random walkers, so that they are optimized if the corresponding Laplacian matrix has a large spectral gap. From this, we show, by developing a numerical optimization algorithm, that maximum synchronizability and fast random walk spreading are obtained for a particular type of extremely homogeneous regular networks, with long loops and poor modular structure, that we call entangled networks. These turn out to be related to Ramanujan and Cage graphs. We argue also that these graphs are very good finite-size approximations to Bethe lattices, and provide optimal or almost optimal solutions to many other problems, for instance searchability in the presence of congestion or performance of neural networks. Finally, we study how these results are modified when studying dynamical processes controlled by a normalized (weighted and directed) dynamics; much more heterogeneous graphs are optimal in this case. Finally, a critical discussion of the limitations and possible extensions of this work is presented. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Because peer effects are often confounded with homophily and common external causes, recent work has used randomized experiments to estimate effects of specific peer behaviors. These experiments have often relied on the experimenter being able to randomly modulate mechanisms by which peer behavior is transmitted to a focal individual. We describe experimental designs that instead randomly assign individuals' peers to encouragements to behaviors that directly affect those individuals. We illustrate this method with a large peer encouragement design on Facebook for estimating the effects of receiving feedback from peers on posts shared by focal individuals. We find evidence for substantial effects of receiving marginal feedback on multiple behaviors, including giving feedback to others and continued posting. These findings provide experimental evidence for the role of behaviors directed at specific individuals in the adoption and continued use of communication technologies. In comparison, observational estimates differ substantially, both underestimating and overestimating effects, suggesting that researchers and policy makers should be cautious in relying on them.},

Familiar statistical formalism, experimental designs, and analysis methods assume the absence of this interference, and result in biased estimates of causal effects when it exists. While some assumptions can lead to unbiased estimates, these assumptions are generally unrealistic in the context of a network and often amount to assuming away the interference. In this work, we evaluate methods for designing and analyzing randomized experiments under minimal, realistic assumptions compatible with broad interference, where the aim is to reduce bias and possibly overall error in estimates of average effects of a global treatment. In design , we consider the ability to perform random assignment to treatments that is correlated in the network, such as through graph cluster randomization. In analysis , we consider incorporating information about the treatment assignment of network neighbors. We prove sufficient conditions for bias reduction through both design and analysis in the presence of potentially global interference; these conditions also give lower bounds on treatment effects. Through simulations of the entire process of experimentation in networks, we measure the performance of these methods under varied network structure and varied social behaviors, finding substantial bias reductions and, despite a bias–variance tradeoff, error reductions. These improvements are largest for networks with more clustering and data generating processes with both stronger direct effects of the treatment and stronger interactions between units.},

Next, we develop an algorithm that both clears the financial system in a computationally efficient fashion and provides information on the systemic risk faced by the individual system firms. Finally, we produce qualitative comparative statics for financial systems. These comparative statics imply that, in contrast to single-firm results, even unsystematic, nondissipative shocks to the system will lower the total value of the system and may lower the value of the equity of some of the individual system firms.},

Such anonymous platforms are also important in nations under authoritarian rule, where freedom of expression and the personal safety of message that authors may depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or retribution, it is sometimes crucial to hide the identities of users who post sensitive messages. In this paper, we consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the author of a message; it observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time or sampled timestamp metadata, or both. Recent advances in rumor source detection show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model, adaptive diffusion spreads content fast and achieves perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That is, all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. When the contact network is an irregular tree, we characterize the probability of maximum likelihood detection by proving a concentration result over Galton-Watson trees. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, is irregular, and has cycles.},

	abstract     = {Abstract–Causal inference on a population of units connected through a network often presents technical challenges, including how to account for interference. In the presence of interference, for instance, potential outcomes of a unit depend on their treatment as well as on the treatments of other units, such as their neighbors in the network. In observational studies, a further complication is that the typical unconfoundedness assumption must be extended—say, to include the treatment of neighbors, and individual and neighborhood covariates—to guarantee identification and valid inference. Here, we propose new estimands that define treatment and interference effects. We then derive analytical expressions for the bias of a naive estimator that wrongly assumes away interference. The bias depends on the level of interference but also on the degree of association between individual and neighborhood treatments. We propose an extended unconfoundedness assumption that accounts for interference, and we develop new covariate-adjustment methods that lead to valid estimates of treatment and interference effects in observational studies on networks. Estimation is based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. We carry out simulations, calibrated using friendship networks and covariates in a nationally representative longitudinal study of adolescents in grades 7–12 in the United States, to explore finite-sample performance in different realistic settings.

This paper shows that correlation coefficients are conditional on market volatility. Under certain assumptions, it is possible to adjust for this bias. Using this adjustment, there was virtually no increase in unconditional correlation coefficients (i.e., no contagion) during the 1997 Asian crisis, 1994 Mexican devaluation, and 1987 U.S. market crash. There is a high level of market comovement in all periods, however, which we call interdependence.},

Nonetheless, these systems can be induced to make errors on data that are surprisingly similar to examples the learned system handles correctly. The existence of these errors raises a variety of questions about out-of-sample generalization and whether bad actors might use such examples to abuse deployed systems. As a result of these security concerns, there has been a flurry of recent papers proposing algorithms to defend against such malicious perturbations of correctly handled examples. It is unclear how such misclassifications represent a different kind of security problem than other errors, or even other attacker-produced examples that have no specific relationship to an uncorrupted input. In this paper, we argue that adversarial example defense papers have, to date, mostly considered abstract, toy games that do not relate to any specific security concern. Furthermore, defense papers have not yet precisely described all the abilities and limitations of attackers that would be relevant in practical security. Towards this end, we establish a taxonomy of motivations, constraints, and abilities for more plausible adversaries. Finally, we provide a series of recommendations outlining a path forward for future work to more clearly articulate the threat model and perform more meaningful evaluation.},

The key characteristic of successful promotion campaigns is that they take into consideration such opinion-formation dynamics in order to create a overall favorable opinion about a specific information item, such as a person, a product, or an idea. In this paper, we adopt a well-established model for social-opinion dynamics and formalize the campaign-design problem as the problem of identifying a set of target individuals whose positive opinion about an information item will maximize the overall positive opinion for the item in the social network. We call this problem Campaign. We study the complexity of the Campaign problem, and design algorithms for solving it. Our experiments on real data demonstrate the efficiency and practical utility of our algorithms.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to {\textless}sup{\textgreater}1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}/{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

	abstract     = {A/B testing, also known as bucket testing, split testing, or controlled experiment, is a standard way to evaluate user engagement or satisfaction from a new service, feature, or product. It is widely used in online websites, including social network sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter to make data-driven decisions. The goal of A/B testing is to es- timate the treatment effects of a new change, which becomes intricate when users are interacting, i.e., the treatment ef- fects of a user may spill over to other users via underlying social connections. When conducting these online controlled experiments, it is a common practice to make the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) that each in- dividual's response is affected by their own treatment only. Though this assumption simplifies the estimation of treat- ment effects, it does not hold when network interference is present, and may even lead to wrong conclusion. In this paper, we study the problem of network A/B test- ing in real networks, which have substantially different char- acteristics from the simulated random networks studied in previous works. We first examine the existence of network effects in a recent online experiment conducted at LinkedIn; Secondly, we propose an efficient and effective estimator for Average Treatment Effect (ATE) considering the interfer- ence between users in real online experiments; Finally, we apply our method in both simulations and a real world online experiment. The simulation results show that our estimator achieves better performance with respect to both bias and variance reduction. The real world online experiment not only demonstrates that large-scale network A/B test is fea- sible but also further validates many of our observations in the simulation studies.`},

The new developments are the use of the SJVJD model with log-truncated-double-exponential jump-amplitude distribution in returns and exponential jump-amplitude distribution in volatility for the optimal portfolio problem. Although unlimited borrowing and short-selling play an important role in pure diffusion models, it is shown that borrowing and short-selling are unrealistically constrained for infinite-range jump-amplitudes.  Finite-range jump-amplitude models can allow constraints to be very large in contrast to infinite range models which severely restrict the optimal instantaneous stock-fraction to [0,1].  The reasonable constraints in the optimal stock-fraction due to jumps in the wealth argument for stochastic dynamic programming jump integrals remove a singularity in the stock-fraction due to vanishing volatility.  Main modifications for the usual constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) power utility model are for handling the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) resulting from the additional variance independent variable, instead of the ordinary integro-differential equation (OIDE) found for the pure jump-diffusion model of the wealth process.  In addition to natural constraints due to  jumps when enforcing the positivity of wealth condition, other constraints are considered for all practical purposes under finite market conditions. Computational results are presented for optimal portfolio values, stock fraction and consumption policies.},

	abstract     = {Many behavioral phenomena have been found to spread interpersonally through social networks, in a manner similar to infectious diseases. An important difference between social contagion and traditional infectious diseases, however, is that behavioral phenomena can be acquired by non-social mechanisms as well as through social transmission. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for studying these phenomena (the SISa model) by adapting a classic disease model to include the possibility for 'automatic' (or 'spontaneous') non-social infection. We provide an example of the use of this framework by examining the spread of obesity in the Framingham Heart Study Network. The interaction assumptions of the model are validated using longitudinal network transmission data. We find that the current rate of becoming obese is 2{\%} per year and increases by 0.5percentage points for each obese social contact. The rate of recovering from obesity is 4{\%} per year, and does not depend on the number of non-obese contacts. The model predicts a long-term obesity prevalence of approximately 42{\%}, and can be used to evaluate the effect of different interventions on steady-state obesity. Model predictions quantitatively reproduce the actual historical time course for the prevalence of obesity. We find that since the 1970s, the rate of recovery from obesity has remained relatively constant, while the rates of both spontaneous infection and transmission have steadily increased over time. This suggests that the obesity epidemic may be driven by increasing rates of becoming obese, both spontaneously and transmissively, rather than by decreasing rates of losing weight. A key feature of the SISa model is its ability to characterize the relative importance of social transmission by quantitatively comparing rates of spontaneous versus contagious infection. It provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviors, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Hill et al.},

This is a strong expander property. We estimate both the decay rate of the spectral gap to {\$}1{\$} and the failure probability, up to a constant factor. We also show that the {\$}1/2{\$} in the above is optimal, and that if {\$}p = \backslashfrac{\{}c \backslashlog n{\}}{\{}n{\}}{\$} for {\$}c {\textless} 1/2,{\$} then there are eigenvalues of the Laplacian restricted to the giant component that are separated from {\$}1.{\$} We then describe several applications of our spectral gap results to stochastic topology and geometric group theory. These all depend on Garland's method [24], a kind of spectral geometry for simplicial complexes. The following can all be considered to be higher-dimensional expander properties. First, we exhibit a sharp threshold for the fundamental group of the Bernoulli random {\$}2{\$}-complex to have Kazhdan's property (T). We also obtain slightly more information and can describe the large-scale structure of the group just before the (T) threshold. In this regime, the random fundamental group is with high probability the free product of a (T) group with a free group, where the free group has one generator for every isolated edge. The (T) group plays a role analogous to that of a “giant component” in percolation theory. Next we give a new, short, self-contained proof of the Linial–Meshulam–Wallach theorem [35, 39], identifying the cohomology-vanishing threshold of Bernoulli random {\$}d{\$}-complexes. Since we use spectral techniques, it only holds for {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}Q{\}}{\$} or {\$}\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\$} coefficients rather than finite field coefficients, as in [35] and [39]. However, it is sharp from a probabilistic point of view, providing for example, hitting time type results and limiting Poisson distributions inside the critical window. It is also a new method of proof, circumventing the combinatorial complications of cocycle counting. Similarly, results in an earlier preprint version of this article were already applied in [33] to obtain sharp cohomology-vanishing thresholds in every dimension for the random flag complex model.},

On one hand, tighter risk management reduces the maximum position an institution can take, thus the amount of liquidity it can offer to the market. On the other hand, risk managers can take into account that lower liquidity amplifies the effective risk of a position by lengthening the time it takes to sell it. The main result of the paper is that a feedback effect can arise: tighter risk management reduces liquidity, which in turn leads to tighter risk management, etc. This can help explain sudden drops in liquidity and, since liquidity is priced, in prices in connection with increased volatility or decreased risk-bearing capacity.},

	abstract     = {We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking networks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous work on random financial networks assumes independent connections between banks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge probabilities (i.e., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We analyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the cascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge probabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition, analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 in epidemic modelling, that characterizes whether or not a single initially defaulted bank can trigger a cascade that extends to a finite fraction of the infinite network. This cascade condition is an easily computed measure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology. We use percolation theory for random networks to derive a formula for the frequency of global cascades. These analytical results are shown to provide limited quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo simulation studies of finite-sized networks. We show that edge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can have a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade condition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and we propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the graph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.},

In order to investigate the factors influencing the Laplacian spectrum of the observed graphs, we study the following complex network models: the random graph of Erd˝ os-R{\'{e}}nyi, the small- world of Watts and Strogatz and the scale-free graph, derived from a Havel-Hakimi power- law degree sequence. Along with these complex network models, we also study the correspond- ing Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Extensive simulations show that the Laplacian spectra of complex network models differ substantially from the spectra of the observed graphs. How- ever, the Laplacian spectra of the MST in the Erd˝ os-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph with uniformly distributed link weights does bear resemblance to it. Furthermore, we discuss an extensive set of topological characteristics extracted from the Laplacian spectra of the observed real-world graphs as well as from complex network models.},

We show how copulas can be introduced to any problem that involves distributions and how they can provide solutions for the modeling of the portfolio. We use this to provide the copula formulation of the CVaR of a portfolio. Given the critical dependence of CVaR on the underlying distribution, we use a robust framework to extend our approach to Worst Case CVaR (WCVaR). WCVaR is achieved through the use of rival copulas. These rival copulas have the advantage of exploiting a variety of dependence structures, symmetric and not. We compare our model against two other models, Gaussian CVaR and Worst Case Markowitz. Our empirical analysis shows that WCVaR can asses the risk more adequately than the two competitive models during periods of crisis. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We report here on an extensive session of behavioral experiments on biased voting in networks of individuals. In each of 81 experiments, 36 human subjects arranged in a virtual network were financially motivated to reach global consensus to one of two opposing choices. No payments were made unless the entire population reached a unanimous decision within 1 min, but different subjects were paid more for consensus to one choice or the other, and subjects could view only the current choices of their network neighbors, thus creating tensions between private incentives and preferences, global unity, and network structure. Along with analyses of how collective and individual performance vary with network structure and incentives generally, we find that there are well-studied network topologies in which the minority preference consistently wins globally; that the presence of "extremist" individuals, or the awareness of opposing incentives, reliably improve collective performance; and that certain behavioral characteristics of individual subjects, such as "stubbornness," are strongly correlated with earnings. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target? We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here. The two conference papers upon which this article is based (KDD 2003 and ICALP 2005) provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63{\%} of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks. We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

Identifying the most efficient 'spread-ers' in a network is an important step towards optimizing the use of available resources and ensuring the more efficient spread of information. Here we show that, in contrast to common belief, there are plausible circumstances where the best spreaders do not correspond to the most highly connected or the most central people 6-10 . Instead, we find that the most efficient spreaders are those located within the core of the network as identified by the k-shell decomposition analysis 11-13 , and that when multiple spreaders are considered simultaneously the distance between them becomes the crucial parameter that determines the extent of the spreading. Furthermore, we show that infections persist in the high-k shells of the network in the case where recovered individuals do not develop immunity. Our analysis should provide a route for an optimal design of efficient dissemination strategies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Formally, given a union of two weighted graphs G and W and an integer k, we are asked to find a k-edge weighted graph Wk such that G+Wk is a good spectral sparsifer of G+W. We will refer to this problem as the subgraph (spectral) sparsification. We present a nontrivial condition on G and W such that a good sparsifier exists and give a polynomial-time algorithm to find the sparsifer. As an application of our technique, we show that for each positive integer k, every n-vertex weighted graph has an (n-1+k)-edge spectral sparsifier with relative condition number at most n/k log n, {\~{O}}(log log n) where {\~{O}}() hides lower order terms. Our bound nearly settles a question left open by Spielman and Teng about ultrasparsifiers. We also present another application of our technique to spectral optimization in which the goal is to maximize the algebraic connectivity of a graph (e.g. turn it into an expander) with a limited number of edges. {\textcopyright} 2010 ACM.},

First, agents hold diversified portfolios that link their financial positions to those of other agents. Second, shocks to fundamentals at the initial date cause some portfolio losses. Agents who incur losses reallocate their portfolios, thereby breaking some linkages. In the Pareto-efficient symmetric equilibrium studied, two related types of financial crisis can occur in response. One occurs gradually as losses spread, breaking more links. The other type occurs instantaneously when forward-looking agents preemptively shift to safer portfolios to avoid future losses from contagion. An economy is more fragile the earlier its last remaining link breaks from such a crisis.

Roughly speaking, we are concerned with situations that involve a very large number of "rational players" with a limited information (or visibility) on the "game". Each player chooses his optimal strategy in view of the global (or macroscopic) informations that are available to him and that result from the actions of all players. In the three examples we mention here, we derive a mean-field problem which consists in nonlinear differential equations. These equations are of a new type and our main goal here is to study them and establish their links with various fields of Analysis. We show in particular that these nonlinear problems are essentially well-posed problems i.e., have unique solutions. In addition, we give various limiting cases, examples and possible extensions.

In contrast to models with symmetric costs, some firms may be inactive in equilibrium. (With symmetric costs, the results trivialize to all firms active or all firms inactive.) We concentrate on the linear demand structure with constant marginal but asymmetric costs. In static one-period models, we compare the number of active firms, i. e. the number of firms producing a positive quantity in equilibrium, across four different models of oligopoly: Cournot and Bertrand with homogeneous or differentiated goods. When firms have different costs, we show that, for fixed good type, Cournot always results in more active firms than Bertrand. Moreover, with a fixed market type, differentiated goods result in more active firms than homogeneous goods. In dynamic models, asymmetric costs induce different entry times into the market. We illustrate with a model of energy production in which multiple producers from costly but inexhaustible alternative sources such as solar or wind compete in a Cournot market against an oil producer with exhaustible supply. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Here we introduce a powerful new approach for learning generative models over graphs, which can capture both their structure and attributes. Our approach uses graph neural networks to express probabilistic dependencies among a graph's nodes and edges, and can, in principle, learn distributions over any arbitrary graph. In a series of experiments our results show that once trained, our models can generate good quality samples of both synthetic graphs as well as real molecular graphs, both unconditionally and conditioned on data. Compared to baselines that do not use graph-structured representations, our models often perform far better. We also explore key challenges of learning generative models of graphs, such as how to handle symmetries and ordering of elements during the graph generation process, and offer possible solutions. Our work is the first and most general approach for learning generative models over arbitrary graphs, and opens new directions for moving away from restrictions of vector- and sequence-like knowledge representations, toward more expressive and flexible relational data structures.},

Miners compete against each other for mining rewards by increasing their computational power. This leads to a novel mean field game of jump intensity control, which we solve explicitly for miners maximizing exponential utility, and handle numerically in the case of miners with power utilities. We show that the heterogeneity of their initial wealth distribution leads to greater imbalance of the reward distribution, or a "rich get richer" effect. This concentration phenomenon is aggravated by a higher bitcoin price, and reduced by competition. Additionally, an advanced miner with cost advantages such as access to cheaper electricity, contributes a significant amount of computational power in equilibrium. Hence, cost efficiency can also result in the type of centralization seen among miners of cryptocurrencies.},

	abstract     = {A theoretical framework is developed that highlights the principles governing consistent and economically meaningful estimates of the cost of bailouts. The approach is applied to estimating the direct costs, and identifying the direct beneficiaries, of bailouts associated with the 2008 financial crisis in the United States. Drawing selectively on existing cost estimates and augmenting them with new calculations, I conclude that the total direct cost of crisis-related bailouts in the U.S. was on order of {\$}500 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP in 2009. The largest costs arose from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, TARP and the FHA. The contingent liabilities of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were greatly elevated, but taxpayers were largely shielded from those exposures. The largest direct beneficiaries of the bailouts were the unsecured creditors of financial institutions. Those conclusions stand in sharp contrast to popular accounts that claim there was no cost because the money was repaid, and with claims of costs in the multiple trillions of dollars. The cost is large enough to suggest the importance of revisiting whether there might have been less expensive ways to intervene to stabilize markets. At the same time, it is small enough to call into question whether the benefits of ending bailouts permanently exceed the regulatory burden of policies aimed at achieving that goal. Directions for further research include undertaking similar analyses for other countries and historical episodes. 3},

The critical assumption required for such a strategy to be feasible, is that the underlying stock return dynamics can be described by a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In this paper, an option pricing formula is derived for the more-general case when the underlying stock returns are generated by a mixture of both continuous and jump processes. The derived formula has most of the attractive features of the original Black-Scholes formula in that it does not depend on investor preferences or knowledge of the expected return on the underlying stock. Moreover, the same analysis applied to the options can be extended to the pricing of corporate liabilities. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

We therefore designed and analyzed a large-scale randomized experiment on a social news aggregation Web site to investigate whether knowledge of such aggregates distorts decision-making. Prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects. Whereas negative social influence inspired users to correct manipulated ratings, positive social influence increased the likelihood of positive ratings by 32{\%} and created accumulating positive herding that increased final ratings by 25{\%} on average. This positive herding was topic-dependent and affected by whether individuals were viewing the opinions of friends or enemies. A mixture of changing opinion and greater turnout under both manipulations together with a natural tendency to up-vote on the site combined to create the herding effects. Such findings will help interpret collective judgment accurately and avoid social influence bias in collective intelligence in the future.},

	abstract     = {The rise of social media and online social networks has been a disruptive force in society. Opinions are increasingly shaped by interactions on online social media, and social phenomena including disagreement and polarization are now tightly woven into everyday life. In this work we initiate the study of the following question: given {\$}n{\$} agents, each with its own initial opinion that reflects its core value on a topic, and an opinion dynamics model, what is the structure of a social network that minimizes {\{}$\backslash$em polarization{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$em disagreement{\}} simultaneously? This question is central to recommender systems: should a recommender system prefer a link suggestion between two online users with similar mindsets in order to keep disagreement low, or between two users with different opinions in order to expose each to the other's viewpoint of the world, and decrease overall levels of polarization? Our contributions include a mathematical formalization of this question as an optimization problem and an exact, time-efficient algorithm. We also prove that there always exists a network with {\$}O(n/\backslashepsilon{\^{}}2){\$} edges that is a {\$}(1+\backslashepsilon){\$} approximation to the optimum. For a fixed graph, we additionally show how to optimize our objective function over the agents' innate opinions in polynomial time. We perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on synthetic and real-world data that verify their value as mining tools to better understand the trade-off between of disagreement and polarization. We find that there is a lot of space to reduce both polarization and disagreement in real-world networks; for instance, on a Reddit network where users exchange comments on politics, our methods achieve a {\$}\backslashsim 60\backslash,000{\$}-fold reduction in polarization and disagreement.},

In contrast to the previous research, we (i) consider very general driving processes, (ii) allow for inhomogeneous connection structures, and (iii) analyze a game in which the particles determine their connections strategically. Hereby, we uncover two completely new phenomena. First, we characterize the "times of fragility" of such systems (e.g., the times when a macroscopic part of the population defaults or gets infected simultaneously, or when the neuron cells "synchronize") explicitly in terms of the dynamics of the driving processes, the current distribution of the particles' values, and the topology of the underlying network (represented by its Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue). Second, we use such systems to describe a dynamic credit-network game and show that, in equilibrium, the system regularizes: i.e., the times of fragility never occur, as the particles avoid them by adjusting their connections strategically. Two auxiliary mathematical results, useful in their own right, are uncovered during our investigation: a generalization of Schauder's fixed-point theorem for the Skorokhod space with the M1 topology, and the application of the max-plus algebra to the equilibrium problem for credit networks.},

In this model, a bank defaults when its normalized asset value hits a lower threshold, and its default causes instantaneous losses to other banks, possibly triggering a cascade of defaults. The strength of this interaction is determined by the level of the so-called noncore exposure. We show that, when the size of the system becomes large, the cumulative loss process of a bank resulting from the defaults of other banks exhibits discontinuities. These discontinuities are naturally interpreted as systemic events, and we characterize them explicitly in terms of the level of noncore exposure and the fraction of banks that are “about to default.” The main mathematical challenges of our work stem from the very singular nature of the interaction between the particles, which is inherited by the limiting system. A similar particle system is analyzed in [Ann. Appl. Probab. 25 (2015) 2096–2133] and [Stochastic Process. Appl. 125 (2015) 2451–2492], and we build on and extend their results. In particular, we characterize the large-population limit of the system and analyze the jump times, the regularity between jumps, and the local uniqueness of the limiting process.},

Algebraic connectivity of a graph is the second smallest eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix and a measure of speed of solving consensus problems in networks. We demonstrate that it is possible to dramatically increase the algebraic connectivity of a regular complex network by 1000 times or more without adding new links or nodes to the network. This implies that a consensus problem can be solved incredibly fast on certain small-world networks giving rise to a network design algorithm for ultrafast information networks. Our study relies on a procedure called "random rewiring" due to Watts {\&} Strogatz (Nature, 1998). Extensive numerical results are provided to support our claims and conjectures. We prove that the mean of the bulk Laplacian spectrum of a complex network remains invariant under random rewiring. The same property only asymptotically holds for scale-free networks. A relationship between increasing the algebraic connectivity of complex networks and robustness to link and node failures is also shown. This is an alternative approach to the use of percolation theory for analysis of network robustness. We also show some connections between our conjectures and certain open problems in the theory of random matrices. {\textcopyright}2005 AACC.},

We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms.

That is, when agents make decisions based on their private information, as well as observing the actions of those before them, then it might be rational to ignore their private signal and imitate the action of previous individuals. If the individuals are choosing between a right and a wrong state, and the initial actions are wrong, then the whole cascade will be wrong. This issue is due to the fact that cascades can be based on very little information. We show that if agents occasionally disregard the actions of others and base their action only on their private information, then wrong cascades can be avoided. Moreover, we study the optimal asymptotic rate at which the error probability at time t can go to zero. The optimal policy is for the player at time t to follow their private information with probability pt = c/t, leading to a learning rate of c′/t, where the constants c and c′ are explicit.},

	abstract     = {We present a new approach to showing that random graphs are nearly optimal expanders. This approach is based on recent deep results in combinatorial group theory. It applies to both regular and irregular random graphs. Let {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Gamma {\$}{\$}$\Gamma$ be a random {\$}{\$}d{\$}{\$}d-regular graph on {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}n vertices, and let {\$}{\$}$\backslash$lambda {\$}{\$}$\lambda$ be the largest absolute value of a non-trivial eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. It was conjectured by Alon (Combinatorica 6(2), 83–96, 1986) that a random {\$}{\$}d{\$}{\$}d-regular graph is “almost Ramanujan”, in the following sense: for every {\$}{\$}$\backslash$varepsilon {\textgreater}0{\$}{\$}$\epsilon${\textgreater}0, {\$}{\$}$\backslash$lambda {\textless}2$\backslash$sqrt{\{}d-1{\}}+$\backslash$varepsilon {\$}{\$}$\lambda${\textless}2d-1+$\epsilon$ asymptotically almost surely. Friedman famously presented a proof of this conjecture in Friedman (Memoirs of the AMS 910, 2008). Here we suggest a new, substantially simpler proof of a nearly-optimal result: we show that a random {\$}{\$}d{\$}{\$}d-regular graph satisfies {\$}{\$}$\backslash$lambda {\textless}2$\backslash$sqrt{\{}d-1{\}}+1{\$}{\$}$\lambda${\textless}2d-1+1 a.a.s. A main advantage of our approach is that it is applicable to a generalized conjecture: For {\$}{\$}d{\$}{\$}d even, a {\$}{\$}d{\$}{\$}d-regular graph on {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}n vertices is an {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}n-covering space of a bouquet of {\$}{\$}d/2{\$}{\$}d/2 loops. More generally, fixing an arbitrary base graph {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Omega {\$}{\$}$\Omega$, we study the spectrum of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Gamma {\$}{\$}$\Gamma$, a random {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}n-covering of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Omega {\$}{\$}$\Omega$. Let {\$}{\$}$\backslash$lambda {\$}{\$}$\lambda$ be the largest absolute value of a non-trivial eigenvalue of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Gamma {\$}{\$}$\Gamma$. Extending Alon's conjecture to this more general model, Friedman (Duke Math J 118(1),19–35, 2003) conjectured that for every {\$}{\$}$\backslash$varepsilon {\textgreater}0,{\$}{\$}$\epsilon${\textgreater}0, a.a.s. {\$}{\$}$\backslash$lambda {\textless}$\backslash$rho +$\backslash$varepsilon {\$}{\$}$\lambda${\textless}$\rho$+$\epsilon$, where {\$}{\$}$\backslash$rho {\$}{\$}$\rho$ is the spectral radius of the universal cover of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Omega {\$}{\$}$\Omega$. When {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Omega {\$}{\$}$\Omega$ is regular we get a bound of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$rho +0.84{\$}{\$}$\rho$+0.84, and for an arbitrary {\$}{\$}$\backslash$Omega {\$}{\$}$\Omega$, we prove a nearly optimal upper bound of {\$}{\$}$\backslash$sqrt{\{}3{\}}$\backslash$rho {\$}{\$}3$\rho$. This is a substantial improvement upon all known results (by Friedman, Linial-Puder, Lubetzky-Sudakov-Vu and Addario-Berry-Griffiths).},

Management Sci. 47(2):236-249] by introducing costs of default if loans have to be called in by a failing bank. This immediately introduces novel and realistic effects. We find that, in general, many different clearing vectors can arise, among which there is a greatest clearing vector, arrived at by letting banks fail in succession until only solvent banks remain. Such a collapse should be prevented if at all possible. We then study situations in which consortia of banks may have the means and incentives to rescue failing banks. This again departs from the conclusions of the earlier work of Eisenberg and Noe, where in the absence of default losses there would be no incentive for solvent banks to rescue failing banks. We conclude with some remarks about how a rescue consortium might be constructed. {\textcopyright} 2013 INFORMS.},

In this paper, we investigate how the structure of those networks can affect the capacity of regulators to assess the level of systemic risk. We introduce a model to compute the individual and systemic probability of default in a system of banks connected in a generic network of credit contracts and exposed to external shocks with a generic correlation structure. Even in the presence of complete knowledge, we identify conditions on the network for the emergence of multiple equilibria. Multiple equilibria give rise to uncertainty in the determination of the default probability. We show how this uncertainty can affect the estimation of systemic risk in terms of expected losses. We further quantify the effects of cyclicality, leverage, volatility and correlations. Our results are relevant to the current policy discussions on new regulatory framework to deal with systemic events of distress as well as on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.},

This is complemented with theoretical results proving consistency as the number M of topics grows large.

Different from the stationary setting where the GSO and the covariance matrix of the observed signals are simultaneously diagonalizable, here they are not. Hence, estimating the eigenvectors requires first estimating the unknown diffusion (graph) filter - a polynomial in the GSO which does preserve the sought eigenbasis.

We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has nontrivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract     = {We consider the problem of detecting the source of a rumor which has spread in a network using only observations about which set of nodes are infected with the rumor and with no information as to when these nodes became infected. In a recent work (Shah and Zaman 2010), this rumor source detection problem was introduced and studied. The authors proposed the graph score function rumor centrality as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible Infected (SI) model with exponential spreading times for regular trees. They showed that as the size of the infected graph increases, for a path graph (2-regular tree), the probability of source detection goes to 0 and for d-regular trees with d ≥ 3 the probability of detection, say $\alpha$d , remains bounded away from 0 and is less than 1/2. However, their results stop short of providing insights for the performance of the rumor centrality estimator in more general settings such as irregular trees or the SI model with nonexponential spreading times. This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting connection between a continuous time branching process and the effectiveness of rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all previous results as a special case and obtain a variety of novel results including the universality of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI model with a generic spreading time distribution.},

This theoretically explains the impressive generalization performance of the maximal margin hyperplane algorithm of Vapnik and co-workers (which is the basis for their support vector machines). The paper concludes with a more general result in terms of "luckiness" functions, which provides a quite general way for exploiting serendipitous simplicity in observed data to obtain better prediction accuracy from small training sets.

After the credit crisis, securitisation was blamed for allowing the 'hot potato' of bad loans to be passed to unsuspecting investors. Both views miss the endogeneity of credit supply. Securitisation enables credit expansion through higher leverage of the financial system as a whole. Securitisation by itself may not enhance financial stability if the imperative to expand assets drives down lending standards. The 'hot potato' of bad loans sits in the financial system on the balance sheets of large banks rather than being sold on to final investors, since the aim of financial intermediaries is to expand lending in order to utilise slack in balance sheet capacity. {\textcopyright} The Author(s).

We study first the idealized problem with constant intensities where solutions are essentially explicit. We also give the large portfolio asymptotics for this problem. We then analyse the case where the firms have stochastic default intensities driven by a common factor, which can be viewed as another extreme from the independent case. This involves the numerical solution of a system of reaction-diffusion PDEs. We observe that the nonlinearity of the utility-indifference valuation mechanism enhances the effective correlation between the times of the credit events of the various firms leading to non-trivial senior tranche spreads, as often seen from market data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We prove that every graph has a spectral sparsifier of nearly linear size. Moreover, we present an algorithm that produces spectral sparsifiers in time O(mlogc m), where m is the number of edges in the original graph and c is some absolute constant. This construction is a key component of a nearly linear time algorithm for solving linear equations in diagonally dominant matrices. Our sparsification algorithm makes use of a nearly linear time algorithm for graph partitioning that satisfies a strong guarantee: if the partition it outputs is very unbalanced, then the larger part is contained in a subgraph of high conductance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

We assume that corporate debt can be valued as an option on corporate business asset value, and derive payoff functions when there exist cross-holdings of stock or debt between two firms. Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, we show we can calculate the default spread easily when complicated cross-holdings exist in many firms by a simulation that includes the contraction principle method. By using our method, we can reevaluate which cross-held shares are beneficial or disadvantageous for the cross-holding firms.},

By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we derive the closed-form expressions for the value function, as well as the optimal strategy. Moreover, under suitable assumption on model parameters, our problem reduces to the classical mean-variance portfolio selection problem and the efficient frontier is obtained.},

Across these contexts, behavioural specialization often co-occurs with modular and assortative social networks, such that individuals tend to associate with others that have the same behavioural specialization. This raises the question of whether a common mechanism could drive co-emergent behavioural specialization and social network structure across contexts. To investigate this question, here we extend a model of self-organized DOL to account for social influence and interaction bias among individuals-social dynamics that have been shown to drive political polarization. We find that these same social dynamics can also drive emergent DOL by forming a feedback loop that reinforces behavioural differences between individuals, a feedback loop that is impacted by group size. Moreover, this feedback loop also results in modular and assortative social network structure, whereby individuals associate strongly with those performing the same task. Our findings suggest that DOL and political polarization-two social phenomena not typically considered together-may actually share a common social mechanism. This mechanism may result in social organization in many contexts beyond task performance and political behaviour.},

	abstract     = {A/B testing is a standard approach for evaluating the effect of online experiments; the goal is to estimate the 'average treatment effect' of a new feature or condition by exposing a sample of the overall population to it. A drawback with A/B testing is that it is poorly suited for experiments involving social interference, when the treatment of individuals spills over to neighboring individuals along an underlying social network. In this work, we propose a novel methodology using graph clustering to analyze average treatment effects under social interference. To begin, we characterize graph-Theoretic conditions under which individuals can be considered to be 'network exposed' to an experiment. We then show how graph cluster randomization admits an efficient exact algorithm to compute the probabilities for each vertex being network exposed under several of these exposure conditions. Using these probabilities as inverse weights, a Horvitz-Thompson estimator can then provide an effect estimate that is unbiased, provided that the exposure model has been properly specified. Given an estimator that is unbiased, we focus on minimizing the variance. First, we develop simple sufficient conditions for the variance of the estimator to be asymptotically small in n, the size of the graph. However, for general randomization schemes, this variance can be lower bounded by an exponential function of the degrees of a graph. In contrast, we show that if a graph satisfies a restricted-growth condition on the growth rate of neighborhoods, then there exists a natural clustering algorithm, based on vertex neighborhoods, for which the variance of the estimator can be upper bounded by a linear function of the degrees. Thus we show that proper cluster randomization can lead to exponentially lower estimator variance when experimentally measuring average treatment effects under interference.},

Much less well understood are matrices that are endowed with an arbitrary structure, such as sparse Wigner matrices or matrices whose entries possess a given variance pattern. The challenge in investigating such structured random matrices is to understand how the given structure of the matrix is reflected in its spectral properties.

Spectral metrics (eigenvalues of graph-related matrices), especially, the largest eigenvalue $\lambda${\{}1{\}} of the adjacency matrix and the algebraic connectivity $\mu${\{}N-1{\}} (second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian) are powerful characterizers of dynamic processes on networks such as virus spreading and synchronization processes.

Applying the degree-preserving rewiring algorithm to various real-world networks illustrates that (a) assortative degree-preserving rewiring increases $\lambda${\{}1{\}}, but decreases $\mu${\{}N-1{\}}, even leading to disconnectivity of the networks in many disjoint clusters and that (b) disassortative degree-preserving rewiring decreases $\lambda${\{}1{\}}, but increases the algebraic connectivity, at least in the initial rewirings. {\textcopyright} 2010 EDP Sciences, SIF, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.}}},

For tree networks, multiple sequential observations for one single instance of rumor spreading cannot improve over the initial snapshot observation. The situation dramatically improves for multiple independent observations. We propose a unified inference framework based on the union rumor centrality, and provide explicit detection performance for degree-regular tree networks. Surprisingly, even with merely two observations, the detection probability at least doubles that of a single observation, and further approaches one, i.e., reliable detection, with increasing degree. This indicates that a richer diversity enhances detectability. For general graphs, a detection algorithm using a breadth-first search strategy is also proposed and evaluated. Besides rumor source detection, our results can be used in network forensics to combat recurring epidemic-like information spreading such as online anomaly and fraudulent email spams.

	abstract     = {The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small initial shocks is a phenomenon that manifests itself as diversely as cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network is susceptible to very large cascades-herein called global cascades-that occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.},

We develop the notion of network identifiability, a property of a parameterized model set that ensures that module dynamics are uniquely related to the filters that specify the one-step-ahead predictors of all node signals in the network. It can be used to specify which presence of excitation signals will result in a unique representation of the network dynamics in a particular network model parametrization. This uniqueness is necessary for detecting the topology of the network from measured data, and for consistently estimating the network dynamics. We combine aspects of the classical notion of system identifiability with a uniqueness-oriented parametrization concept, and extend this to the situation of highly structured model sets. All node signals in the network are treated in a symmetric way. The presented concept and theory allow for the incorporation of particular structural prior knowledge of the network structure},

This poses a multiagent systems challenge to act under uncertainty about how the agents are connected. We formalize this problem by introducing exploratory influence maximization, in which an algorithm queries individual network nodes (agents) to learn their links. The goal is to locate a seed set nearly as influential as the global optimum using very few queries. We show that this problem is intractable for general graphs. However, real world networks typically have community structure, where nodes are arranged in densely connected subgroups. We present the ARISEN algorithm, which leverages community structure to find an influential seed set. Experiments on real world networks of homeless youth, village populations in India, and others demonstrate ARISEN's strong empirical performance. To formally demonstrate how ARISEN exploits community structure, we prove an approximation guarantee for ARISEN on graphs drawn from the Stochastic Block Model.},

These optimal linear iterations are often substantially faster than several common heuristics that are based on the Laplacian of the associated graph. We show how problem structure can be exploited to speed up interior-point methods for solving the fastest distributed linear iteration problem, for networks with up to a thousand or so edges. We also describe a simple subgradient method that handles far larger problems, with up to 100000 edges.

In many settings, however, it might not be clear which subclass of graphical models to use, particularly for non-Gaussian and non-categorical data. In this paper, we consider a general sub-class of graphical models where the node-wise conditional distributions arise from exponential families. This allows us to derive multivariate graphical model distributions from univariate exponential family distributions, such as the Poisson, negative binomial, and exponential distributions. Our key contributions include a class of M-estimators to fit these graphical model distributions; and rigorous statistical analysis showing that these M-estimators recover the true graphical model structure exactly, with high probability. We provide examples of genomic and proteomic networks learned via instances of our class of graphical models derived from Poisson and exponential distributions.},

Bayesian network inference algorithms hold particular promise in that they can capture linear, non-linear, combinatorial, stochastic and other types of relationships among variables across multiple levels of biological organization. However, challenges remain when applying these algorithms to limited quantities of experimental data collected from biological systems. Here, we use a simulation approach to make advances in our dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) inference algorithm, especially in the context of limited quantities of biological data. Results: We test a range of scoring metrics and search heuristics to find an effective algorithm configuration for evaluating our methodological advances. We also identify sampling intervals and levels of data discretization that allow the best recovery of the simulated networks. We develop a novel influence score for DBNs that attempts to estimate both the sign (activation or repression) and relative magnitude of interactions among variables. When faced with limited quantities of observational data, combining our influence score with moderate data interpolation reduces a significant portion of false positive interactions in the recovered networks. Together, our advances allow DBN inference algorithms to be more effective in recovering biological networks from experimentally collected data. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

In order to identify the network structure that generated the data, we compute the smallest distances between the measured data and the data that would have been generated by particular network structures.

Two major problems that most CF approaches have to contend with are scalability and sparseness of the user profiles. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we describe a CF algorithm alternating-least-squares with weighted-$\lambda$ -regularization (ALS-WR), which is implemented on a parallel Matlab platform. We show empirically that the performance of ALS-WR (in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE)) monotonically improves with both the number of features and the number of ALS iterations. We applied the ALS-WR algorithm on a large-scale CF problem, the Netflix Challenge, with 1000 hidden features and obtained a RMSE score of 0.8985, which is one of the best results based on a pure method. In addition, combining with the parallel version of other known methods, we achieved a performance improvement of 5.91{\%} over Netflix's own CineMatch recommendation system. Our method is simple and scales well to very large datasets. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},
