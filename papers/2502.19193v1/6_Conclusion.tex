\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec: conclusion}
In this study, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent simulation framework that effectively simulates language evolution under social media regulations through the synergy of LLM and GA. The simulation primarily operates through the interaction between participant agents, acting as users, and a supervisory agent, acting as regulatory systems. Furthermore, LLM serves as the operator to enable GA-based evolution of language strategies through selection, crossover, and mutation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of evolving language across two scenarios. Additionally, the user study with 40 participants confirms the real-world relevance of the generated texts and strategies. Finally, ablation experiments underscore the effectiveness of GA in improving the stability and performance of the simulation.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider that the language strategies observed in our simulations may not fully capture real human behaviors, and their applicability to other contexts remains uncertain.
One promising direction for future work is to explore the use of LLM models that have been fine-tuned specifically for social media scenarios. Such specialized models are expected to generate strategies and dialogue content that are more realistic, better capturing the nuances of actual online interactions.
Another area of exploration involves integrating human participants into the simulation framework. By including real users either as dialogue participants or supervisory agents, we can examine how human involvement influences the evolution of language strategies, offering deeper insights into human-machine interaction dynamics under regulatory constraints.
Additionally, we plan to expand the simulation to encompass more general social media settings, such as platforms like X, where multiple users engage in discussions on a single topic. This extension will allow us to study the complex interplay of collective user behavior and strategy evolution in a more dynamic and realistic online environment.
