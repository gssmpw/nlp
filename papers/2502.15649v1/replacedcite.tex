This section presents previous studies on the simulation-to-reality gap and links these concepts to the proposed pipeline. For this purpose, it is necessary to define the concept of environment used in this paper. In robotic RL applications, the environment includes not only the space where the robot operates but also the robot itself, and the agent is the decision-making algorithm or policy that sends commands via the robot.  However, it is also common to refer to the robot along with the learning algorithm as the agent and the environment as everything external to the robot. This paper adopts this latter convention to distinguish the robot from its surroundings.

Research on RL in robotic systems has led to various methodologies for improving sample efficiency of RL algorithms and reducing the sim-to-real problem. The sample efficiency in RL refers to the number of samples (i.e., experiences) needed to achieve a certain performance level. A comprehensive survey on the topic is presented by Calder√≥n-Cordova et al.____. They present many techniques, frameworks, tools, and a practical guide for developing RL control applications focused on robotic manipulators. Even though their work is extensive, they propose a simple pipeline containing a single simulation stage with no discussion of the various levels of simulation complexity and their effects on the reality gap. 

In contrast,____ presents a survey on RL applied to bio-inspired robots that categorize RL methodologies into four main groups: 1) methods that rely on accurate simulators; 2) approaches that only use simplified kinematic or dynamic models; 3) techniques that apply RL on top of hierarchical controllers; and 4) methods that leverage human demonstrations. They also mention that while methodologies in group 1 often perform better after a sim-to-real transfer, they are less sample-efficient than the others. Our proposed pipeline supports not only a single simulation stage, as presented in____ but also allows for multi-level simulation complexities. This includes options to integrate high-fidelity simulators and simplified kinematic or dynamic models as core simulators.

In another survey, Zhao et al.____ discuss not only the potential benefits of high-fidelity simulation in improving the sim-to-real transfer but also present three other approaches: system identification to create a simulator tailored to a specific robot, domain randomization, and domain adaptation. Domain randomization methods involve modelling parameters from reality and randomizing their values in the simulator to cover the actual distribution of these parameters in the real world. On the other hand, domain adaptation involves the combination of two or more environments during the training process. For example, one could train a model in a high-fidelity simulator and then transfer the model to training on real-world data.

% Successful examples of domain randomization include the works of Huber et al.____, Peng et al.____, and Akkaya et al.____. 
Several works successfully use domain randomization____. In____, a feedback approach is used to change the simulation parameters based on how the real robot performs with the transferred policy, thus allowing for automatic randomization to achieve high performance on the transferred policy. In contrast,____ performs a comprehensive randomization of parameters (e.g., table size, arm dynamics, controller gains, links' mass, friction, noise levels, and time steps) on a robotic arm application, %such as modifying table size, dynamics of the arm, controller gains, mass of the links,  friction coefficients, noise levels, time step variations, 
totalling 95 randomized parameters, resulting in a successful sim-to-real transfer without additional training on the physical system. Using a combination of system identification techniques, domain randomization and curriculum learning, ____ obtained a remarkable level of dexterity in a robotic hand when trained to solve the Rubik's cube.

% The task of controlling a robotic hand to solve the Rubik's cube is discussed in____.The level of dexterity obtained was remarkable due to a combination of system identification techniques, domain randomization and curriculum learning .%, where they increased the task's difficulty as training progressed. 

Domain adaptation techniques involve converting input data from one domain into another, where most training is performed. For example,____ develops a machine-learning model that converts the visual feedback data from the real world into a format that resembles simulated inputs. This translation technique allows a model trained in simulation to perform well on physical robots. Similar strategies are used in____.

Note that these methodologies are not always necessary. For example,____ presents a sim-to-real pipeline to address the challenge of robot navigation in 3D cluttered environments. Their pipeline includes a simulation stage that matches the inputs and outputs to the real robot, and uses simulated sensors and state estimation techniques that closely matched the real ones. These steps achieved successful real-world transfer without requiring any adaptation or additional training. While control problems like these could be solved with classical control techniques, RL provides a data-based adaptive methodology that is independent of the robot model.

Ultimately, the requirements of the RL process depend on the complexity of the task. If the robot is passively stable and accepts simple commands, such as linear and angular velocities, it is possible to transfer the learned model without further adaptation____. However, more complex problems, such as solving a Rubik's cube with 24 degrees of freedom, require more steps to achieve acceptable performance in real applications____. %The proposed pipeline includes many components used in their applications, supporting various levels of system complexity.
