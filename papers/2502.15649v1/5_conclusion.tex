\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) pipeline that incorporates multiple stages of training, from simulation to real-world robotic applications. Our pipeline includes two levels of simulation complexity for sequential training of the RL agent, along with iterative feedback paths that support an iterative refinement of the policy. By incorporating our pipeline and applying techniques such as system identification, domain randomization, and curriculum learning, it is possible to reduce the reality gap and facilitate safe and efficient policy training in robotics. We also present a case study using the Boston Dynamics Spot robot in a surveillance application, demonstrating the practical value of our pipeline through a successful deployment of an RL agent.
