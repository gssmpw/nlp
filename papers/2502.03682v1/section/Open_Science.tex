\section*{Open Science}

The artifacts produced by this work include 1) source code, models, and binaries necessary to run \sys, 2) 18.7 hour phone usage dataset collected from our 27 participant user study, and 3) scripts used to generate results presented in this paper. Due to the physically, mentally, and emotionally harmful nature of IPV, we do not plan to make our code, scripts, or datasets available to the general public for safety concerns. We only plan to share, on request, to qualified individuals, entities, and authorities, such as security clinics or other reputable researchers in the IPV space.
