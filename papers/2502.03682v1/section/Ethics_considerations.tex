\section*{Ethics Considerations}
\noindent\textbf{Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval.} This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at our institution.

\noindent\textbf{Participant Selection and Psychological Safety.} Our study did not involve direct interaction with real IPV abusers or victims. Instead, we recruited couples and friends in healthy relationships. This approach was chosen to avoid causing psychological or physical harm to vulnerable populations while still collecting data with behavioral similarities valuable for the development of IPV detection systems. By doing so, we ensured the safety and well-being of participants.

\noindent\textbf{Use of Deception and Debriefing.} At the beginning of the data collection process, we employed partial disclosure by framing the study as a "Smartphone Usage Analysis." This deliberate use of deception was necessary to prevent participants from altering their behavior due to the knowledge of the study’s association with IPV-related research, which could bias the data collection and affect the reliability of general behavioral patterns.

After the data collection phase concluded, participants were fully debriefed. During the debriefing, we disclosed the true purpose of the study, explained why deception was necessary, and provided them with an opportunity to ask questions and voice any concerns.

Importantly, participants were given the right to withdraw their data at any point after the debriefing if they felt uncomfortable with the study or its purpose. This ensured that their autonomy and rights were respected throughout the process.

\noindent\textbf{Privacy and Anonymity.} To protect participants’ privacy, we designed the study to inherently anonymize all collected data. No personal or identifiable information was logged during the process. Participants used lab-provided smartphones and lab-provided app accounts, ensuring minimal risk of privacy leakage.

Additionally, the collected data were securely transferred and stored on an encrypted lab server accessible only to authorized personnel. These measures ensured that the risk of privacy breaches was effectively mitigated.
