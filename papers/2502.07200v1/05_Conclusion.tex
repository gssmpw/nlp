In this study, we proposed a practical approach for single-source domain generalization in color medical image segmentation. 
By introducing dynamic color image normalization (DCIN) for test-time color adaptation and color-quality generalization (CQG) loss to enhance model robustness, our method effectively improves segmentation performance on non-source domains. 
Trained solely on high-quality pharynx images, our framework demonstrates strong generalization to low-quality and smartphone-acquired images. 
The proposed pipeline not only enhances segmentation accuracy across large domain shifts for pharyngeal images but also highlights its potential for broader applications to improve the robustness of medical imaging systems.
