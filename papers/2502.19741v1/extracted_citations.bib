abstract = {Estimating long-term causal effects based on short-term surrogates is a significant but challenging problem in many real-world applications such as marketing and medicine. Most existing methods estimate causal effects in an idealistic and simplistic manner — disregarding unobserved surrogates and treating all short-term outcomes as surrogates. However, such methods are not well-suited to real-world scenarios where the partially observed surrogates are mixed with the proxies of unobserved surrogates among short-term outcomes. To address this issue, we develop our flexible method called LASER to estimate long-term causal effects in a more realistic situation where the surrogates are either observed or have observed proxies. In LASER, we employ an identifiable variational autoencoder to learn the latent surrogate representation by using all the surrogate candidates without the need to distinguish observed surrogates or proxies of unobserved surrogates. With the learned representation, we further devise a theoretically guaranteed and unbiased estimation of long-term causal effects. Extensive experimental results on the real-world and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

abstract = {Estimating causal effects from observational network data is a significant but challenging problem. Existing works in causal inference for observational network data lack an analysis of the generalization bound, which can theoretically provide support for alleviating the complex confounding bias and practically guide the design of learning objectives in a principled manner. To fill this gap, we derive a generalization bound for causal effect estimation in network scenarios by exploiting 1) the reweighting schema based on joint propensity score and 2) the representation learning schema based on Integral Probability Metric (IPM). We provide two perspectives on the generalization bound in terms of reweighting and representation learning, respectively. Motivated by the analysis of the bound, we propose a weighting regression method based on the joint propensity score augmented with representation learning. Extensive experimental studies on two real-world networks with semi-synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},
