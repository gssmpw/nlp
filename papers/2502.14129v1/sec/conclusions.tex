\section{Conclusion}

We introduce GlossGau, an efficient approach to GS-based inverse rendering framework for scenes with glossy surfaces. Our method models the BRDF through singular Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian for Gaussian Splatting, which analytically approximate the microfacet normal distribution function. Additionally, we innovatively adopts surfel-based Gaussian as primitives, which combines with regularization, ensures accurate normal estimation and visibility computation with no extra cost, yielding improved decomposition of geometry and material properties. Quantitative and visual comparisons show that our method obtains competitive rendering fidelity and superior efficiency advantage over prior works.
