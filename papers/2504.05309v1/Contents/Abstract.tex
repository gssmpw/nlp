The essence of modern e-Commercial search system lies in matching user's intent and available candidates depending on user's query, providing personalized and precise service.
However, user's query may be incorrect due to ambiguous input and typo, leading to inaccurate search. These cases may be released by query rewrite: modify query to other representation or expansion. 
However, traditional query rewrite replies on static rewrite vocabulary, which is manually established meanwhile lacks interaction with both domain knowledge in e-Commercial system and common knowledge in the real world.
% The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) empower opportunity to rephrase query rewrite
In this paper, with the ability to generate text content of Large Language Models (LLMs), we provide an iterative framework to generate query rewrite. 
The framework incorporates a 3-stage procedure in each iteration: 
Rewrite Generation with domain knowledge by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and query understanding by Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT); 
Online Signal Collection with automatic positive rewrite update;
Post-training of LLM with multi task objective to generate new rewrites.
Our work (named as \method{}) provides a comprehensive framework to generate \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{R}ewrite with both domain / real-world knowledge. 
It automatically update and self-correct the rewrites during \textbf{iter}ations.
\method{} has been deployed in Meituan Delivery's search system 
 (China's leading food delivery platform), providing service for users with significant improvement.
