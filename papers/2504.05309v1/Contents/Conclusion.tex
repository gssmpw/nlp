In this paper, we proposed \method{}, an iterative framework to generate rewrites by meticulous prompt tuning and post training of LLMs.
Specially, in each iteration, the prompt formulates query rewrite into a query understanding and process task by CoT and incorporate associated interacted restaurant and cuisine of the query as RAG. 
The generated rewrites are deployed to collect online feedback. The positive rewrites is reserved for their leading restaurant and cuisine is clicked by users.
The collected rewrites, together with the relevance labels are utilized in a multi-task post training of LLM, which motivates new rewrites in next iteration to supplement deployment for feedback collection.
