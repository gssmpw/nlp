\section{Further Experiments}

We conduct further experiments trying out different hyperparameters in the models which conditioned on local ResNet features. The results can be seen in Figure \ref{table:appendix_table}. The models used are as follows:

\textbf{MLP}
uses the MLP point encoder and 4x4 feature map from ResNet. The diffusion policy uses an embedding dimension of 128. 

\textbf{MLP256}
is similar to MLP but the diffusion policy has an embedding dimension of 256. 

\textbf{SUGAR}
uses the point cloud encoder from the SUGAR pretrained model and 4x4 feature map from ResNet. The point cloud encoder is frozen. The diffusion policy uses an embedding dimension of 128.

\textbf{SUGAR-FT2}
is similar to SUGAR but the last two layers are finetuned while keeping the other layers frozen.

\textbf{SUGAR256-FT2}
is similar to SUGAR-FT2 but the diffusion policy uses an embedding dimension of 256.

\textbf{MLP8x8}
uses the MLP point encoder and 4x4 feature map from ResNet. The transformer used to get the condition vector from the ResNet features has an embedding dimension of 256. The diffusion policy uses an embedding dimension of 128. 

\textbf{MLP8x8-L512}
is similar to MLP8x8 but the transformer used to get the condition vector from the ResNet features has an embedding dimension of 512.

% \textbf{SUGAR8x8}
% is similar to SUGAR but uses 8x8 feature map from ResNet.
