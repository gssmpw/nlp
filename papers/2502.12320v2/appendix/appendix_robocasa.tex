\section{Experiment Settings}
\label{appendix:exp_settings}

RoboCasa is a state-of-the-art simulation framework developed to advance the training of generalist robots in diverse and realistic household settings, particularly in kitchen environments. It comprises 120 meticulously modeled kitchen layouts, over 2,500 high-quality 3D objects spanning 150 categories, and 25 foundational atomic tasks that are the building blocks for robot learning. These atomic tasks encompass essential sensorimotor skills, including pick-and-place, opening and closing doors or drawers, twisting knobs, turning levers, pressing buttons, performing insertions, and navigating kitchen spaces. In our work, we evaluated our model in 24 of these tasks, except for the navigation. A list of these tasks evaluated in our work is given in Table \ref{tab:robo_casa}.

The benchmark is particularly challenging due to its unparalleled diversity and realism. Each scenario includes unique configurations and employs just a single demonstration, significantly raising the bar for generalization. For example, in pick-and-place tasks, the objects vary extensively between scenarios, with no repetitions, forcing models to adapt to new instances without direct prior exposure. Furthermore, the training and evaluation environments are entirely distinct, compelling robotic agents to exhibit robust transfer learning capabilities across unseen kitchens and objects.

These features create a demanding benchmark, testing models on their ability to understand and generalize robotic behavior in highly diverse, real-world-inspired scenarios. RoboCasa's emphasis on realistic physics, photorealistic rendering, and the integration of generative AI tools for diverse asset creation ensures it sets a new standard for evaluating robotic learning methodologies. Its extensive task variability and high fidelity make it one of the most rigorous and comprehensive platforms for advancing generalist robot capabilities in everyday household environments.
