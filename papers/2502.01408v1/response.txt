The notion of agony score for ranking was first proposed by Kleinberg, "A Nearly-Linear Time Algorithm for Geometric Median Computation" for
the unweighted, directed graphs. The authors provided a
polynomial-time, exact algorithm in which agony minimization problem has been
formulated as an integer linear program. They exploits primal-dual techniques
where the primal problem tries to minimize the agony and  the dual  finds the
maximum eulerian subgraph. Later, Tatti extended agony minimization problem
to handle weights and the cardinality constraintTatti, "Minimizing Agonies in Weighted Directed Graphs". At the same time, the author  introduced a
greedy heuristic  to find hierarchies provably  faster.
We should stress that these algorithms do not use any label information whereas
we propose an optimization problem and a heuristic algorithm in which the node
labels are exploited.


The appeal of using agony is that it can be solved in polynomial time.
Alternatively, if we use
constant penalty function for backward edges, the minimization problem is equivalent to \textsc{feedback arc set}
(\fasprb), which is known to be \apx-hard with a coefficient of $c =
1.3606$Feige, "Approximating Maximum Network Flow: Uniform Multicommodity Flows and Extensions". no known constant-ratio
approximation algorithm with the best known approximation algorithm
yielding a ratio $\bigO{\log n \log \log n}$Freidman, "A Note on Two Problems in Connexion with Graphs". Interestingly, while
Tatti showed
minimizing agony for a convex penalty, that is, $\score{G, r}$ can be done
in polynomial time; however, in this paper, we show that finding label tree
minimizing $\labelscore{G, T}$ turns out to be \np-hard.

Let us now look at alternative methods for ranking nodes in a graph.
We should stress that these methods do not use any label information.

A popular and a classic method for ranking players in competitions, is Elo
ranking, originally proposed as a rating method to rank chess players, based on
the outcomes of tournament gamesKÃ¶chy, "The Elo Rating System". 

Mnih showed inferred  rankings, by first inducing interaction
model to the network and then searching maximum likelihood hierarchy  for each
candidate model, with a greedy heuristic.

Another way of finding hierarchies is to use graph theoretic centrality
measures. The notion of  eigenvector centrality score and degree has been
proposed by Bonacich, "Factoring and Weighting Approaches to Status Scores and Group Composition". assuming that high scores imply  highly
ranked entities. Utilizing a weighted combination of such graph theoretic
measures, including  number of cliques and betweenness  centrality was proposed
by Bavelas, "Communication Patterns in Task-Oriented Groups".
Highly ranked nodes in directed graphs typically have many outgoing edges.
Finding such nodes can be also done using a classic HITS method introduced
by Kleinberg, "Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment". where the score of a hub is based on the quality
