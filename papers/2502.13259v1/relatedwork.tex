\section{Related work on human-like LLMs}
Decades of work in human-computer interaction have studied anthropomorphic machine-generated language, from \citet{quintanar1982interactive,shneidermandumpty} to more recent meta-analyses spanning responsiveness, agency, and social action \cite{Emnett2024-na,Araujo2018-ij}. We similarly focus on \textit{linguistic} anthropomorphism in system outputs.
But prior work on measuring linguistic \ant is limited to a few features, such as personal pronouns or specific phrases \cite{shneidermandumpty,quintanar1982interactive,Cohn2024-fc}.
We build on works identifying different facets of human-likeness in LLMs \cite{Glaese2022-qo,abercrombie2023mirages,li-etal-2024-pixels} to present a quantitative metric of human-like language.
