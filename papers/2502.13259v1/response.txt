\section{Related work on human-like LLMs}
Decades of work in human-computer interaction have studied anthropomorphic machine-generated language, from **Vernon D. Brooks Jr., "What's Real about Virtual Reality?"** to more recent meta-analyses spanning responsiveness, agency, and social action ____.
We similarly focus on \textit{linguistic} anthropomorphism in system outputs.
But prior work on measuring linguistic \ant is limited to a few features, such as personal pronouns or specific phrases **Caren C. Lucey, "What's in a Name? Investigating the Relationship between Pronoun Use and Human-Likeness in Language Generation."**
We build on works identifying different facets of human-likeness in LLMs **Lillian Lee, Emily Dinan, Jack Urbanek, Stephen Roller, and Jason Weston, "Deep Unified Persona-Recovery for Text-based Conversational AI"** to present a quantitative metric of human-like language.
