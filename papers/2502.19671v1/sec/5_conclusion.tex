\section{Conclusion}

Based on extensive experiments across various training scenarios and ablation studies, we summarize the effectiveness of TTMG as follows: 1) Developing a modality-generalizable medical image segmentation model requires addressing the distributional differences in features across modalities. 2) MASP with content consistency loss is essential for aligning feature distributions across different modality datasets while maintaining performance on seen modalities. 3) MSIW selectively whitens modality-sensitive features, effectively mitigating overfitting to specific modalities and preserving critical modality-invariant information. In conclusion, we propose a novel framework, called \textbf{Test-Time Modality Generalization (TTMG)}, to tackle the challenge of generalizing to unseen modalities in medical image segmentation. TTMG integrates two core components—MASP and MSIW—to enhance generalization to unseen modalities \textbf{without requiring additional retraining}. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate that TTMG significantly improves performance on unseen modalities, providing a scalable and efficient solution for medical image segmentation in real-world applications. This work lays a solid foundation for future research in modality generalizable medical image segmentation, and we plan to extend TTMG to support broader training scenarios involving multiple modality sources including single modality training scheme.
