\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:ccl}
{\method{} introduces a novel paradigm for enhancing 3D occupancy prediction through differentiable Gaussian rendering, bridging the gap between voxel-based supervision and projective consistency. By enforcing {projective} geometric and semantic coherence, 
it
significantly reduces spatial artifacts while maintaining compatibility with diverse architectures. The module's efficiency and flexibility enable state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks.}

{Looking ahead, several exciting directions emerge. First, integrating dynamic viewpoint synthesis with temporal sequences could further improve occlusion reasoning. Second, extending Gaussian rendering to open-vocabulary 3D understanding (leveraging vision-language models) might unlock semantic reasoning beyond predefined classes.}
