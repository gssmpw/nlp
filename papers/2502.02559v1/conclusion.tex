\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we have proposed the idea of SafeSPLE (or Safe Software Product Line Engineering) to support automation of related safety cases in controlled airspaces. We use a product line of features representing the expected context for a safety case. We then use parameterized safety cases where SPL features are mapped to the context and evidence nodes to  represent a family of (rather than individual) safety cases. Last, we will use the product line instances to instantiate individual safety cases on the fly, which can provide evidence for decision making regarding entry of an sUAS into a controlled airspace in an automated UTM. We have demonstrated our vision through a case study that focuses on two context nodes of a larger safety case--the pilot and weather. As future work we are building an automated tool for this process and plan to demonstrate SafePLE on a more complete safety case under a larger set of contexts.
