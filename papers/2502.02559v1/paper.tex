\section{From Abstract to Paper}

If accepted to submit a full paper, we will extend our abstract to a full paper reporting on an example to demonstrate the construction of an initial, partial feature model of sUAS features and constraints, its transformation into a parameterized safety case, and results from its experimental use to generate sUAS-specific safety-case instances.  We also will explore integration of results from our safety-case product line with the broader infrastructure that determines whether to allow or deny entry to a sUAS.
