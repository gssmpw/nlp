\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
As small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (sUAS) increasingly operate in the national airspace, safety concerns arise due to a corresponding rise in reported airspace violations and incidents, highlighting the need for a safe mechanism for sUAS entry control to manage the potential overload. This paper presents work toward our aim of establishing automated, customized safety-claim support for managing on-entry requests from sUAS to enter controlled airspace. We describe our approach, Safety Case Software Product Line Engineering (SafeSPLE), which is a novel method to extend product-family techniques to on-entry safety cases. It begins with a hazard analysis and design of a safety case feature model defining key points in variation, followed by the creation of a parameterized safety case. We use these together to automate the generation of instances for specific sUAS. Finally we use a case study to demonstrate that the SafeSPLE method can be used to facilitate creation of safety cases for specific flights.
