In order to search for optimization algorithms for PCB placement, we refer to a large amount of literature, which includes different scenarios and algorithms. In a broad sense, Layout scenarios can be broadly divided into three categories: floorplanning for mixed-size modules, placement for standard units and PCB placement. At the same time, there are a large number of methods to solve the layout problem, such as the representative structure-based layout method, the analytic placement method and the reinforcement learning method. For the first two methods, they have been introduced in Section I. What needs to be further supplemented is the research of these two algorithms for larger scale and different scenarios.

To improve the efficiency of meteherusitics on combinatorial model of placement, Lee \emph{et al.}, "A Multi-Level Floorplanning/Placement Method Based on B*-tree", proposed a multi-level floorplanning/placement method based on B*-tree. Through multi-level optimization and efficient space management, the method significantly improves layout quality and computational efficiency, especially in reducing wirelength and optimizing design area. Chen and Chang, "An Improved Fast Simulated Annealing Algorithm (FSA)", presented an improved fast simulated annealing algorithm (FSA), which provides faster calculation speed and higher solution quality when dealing with large-scale layout problems and has significant advantages over standard simulated annealing algorithms.



Analytic methods are popularly employed in floorplanning/placement scenarios of very-larege scale integrated circuit (VLSI). In order to overcome the difficulty of the standard quadratic programming method, Nam \emph{et al.}, "A Fast Hierarchical Quadratic Programming Layout Algorithm (HQP)", proposed an innovative fast hierarchical quadratic programming layout algorithm (HQP). Chen and Zhu, "A Multilevel Algorithm for Placement of Standard Cells and VLSI", proposed a multilevel algorithm for placement of standard cells and VLSI, which employs a nonlinear programming technique and a best-choice clustering algorithm to take a global view of the whole netlist and placement information, and then uses an iterative local refinement technique during the declustering stage to further distribute the cells and reduce the wirelength. By modeling the placement task as an optimzation problem constrained by the Poisson equation, Lu \emph{et al.}, "ePlace: An Efficient Cell Placement Algorithm for VLSI", developed the analytic algorithm ePlace for the cell placement of VLSI, and Li \emph{et al.}, "Efficient Large-Scale Floorplanning Algorithm", proposed an efficient large-scale floorplanning algorithm for the task of large-scale floorplanning with fixed-outline. To address the challenge of developing a faster mixed-size placer without hardware acceleration and loss of solution quality, Peng and Zhu, "A Mixed-Size Placement Algorithm Based on Potential Energy", proposed a mixed-size placement algorithm based on a novel definition of potential energy  and a fast approximate computation scheme for partial derivatives of the potential energy for the Poissonâ€™s equation.

Since the anlaytic global placement cannot eliminate overlaps between modules, the legalization process is always introduced at the following stage.
Peter \emph{et al.}, "A Legalization Algorithm for Placement in VLSI", proposed a legalization algorithm for placement in VLSI, in which standard cells can be aligned to rows. Lin \emph{et al.}, "Polygon-Based ILP for Legalization", use polygon to approximate the curve of the area of every soft module and solve an ILP for legalization, which is time consuming and is difficult to scale up for large-scale floorplanning problem. Moffitt \emph{et al.}, "Floorist: A Graph-Based Legalization Method", proposed the repair method Floorist based on constraint graphs, where the insertion of constraints could result in dense constraint graphs that is expensive to visit all arcs. Li \emph{et al.}, "Improved Graph-Based Legalization Method", improved the graph-based legalization method based on Floorist, where both insertion and deletion of constraints are performed to legalize the floorplan efficiently. Sun \emph{et al.}, "Composite Objective Optimization for Legalization", performed the legalization by optimizing the commposite objective with increasing weight of overlap violation, which contributes to faster convergence and small wirelength of the final result.



The constraint graph method can consider the interaction between components in the global scope and avoid the unreasonable global layout caused by local overlap or local optimization. However, building an accurate constraint graph and managing all the constraints in it is a complex process. If the initial layout is not properly set, the effect of graph optimization may be affected, resulting in a slow convergence rate during optimization, or even an effective legal layout cannot be found. In order to eliminate the above problems, this paper proposes an innovative legalization algorithm. It is designed to expand the overlapping components from the middle to the periphery, which effectively maintains the relative position of the components.
Machine learning is also implemented in the floorplanning/placement scenarios. Hu \emph{et al.}, "Graph2Plan: A Deep Learning-Based Floorplan Generation Method", presented the Graph2Plan, which utilizes deep learning to automatically generate VLSI floorplans. The method works by modeling a floorplan problem as a graph structure and using a graph neural network (GNN) to learn how to generate an optimized layout from graph data. Vassallo and Bajada, "Reinforcement Learning for Circuit Placement", explores the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automate learning and optimize circuit placement. They propose a new reinforcement learning framework that utilizes adaptive reward mechanisms to improve the performance of layout algorithms, especially in large-scale and complex VLSI designs. Lin \emph{et al.}, "DREAMPlace: An Accelerated Layout Optimization Method", proposed an accelerated algorithm named as DREAMPlace, which approximates the objective function in the traditional layout optimization problem by using the neural network model, and making full use of parallel computing power to accelerate the layout process. Mirhoseini \emph{et al.}, "Layout Inference with a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent", proposed a novel agent-based framework that automatically generates PCB layouts meeting industrial constraints through user interactions.

To accelerate the placement process of PCB, Zhang \emph{et al.}, "GPU-Accelerated PCB Placement Method", proposed a scalable GPU-accelerated PCB placement method inspired by VLSI. It incorporates tailored cost functions, constraint handling, and optimized techniques adapted for PCB layouts. Taking the netlist of the already placed and unplaced circuits as input and abstract them into graphs, Chen \emph{et al.}, "Subgraph Matching-Based Reference Placement Algorithm", proposed a subgraph matching based reference placement algorithm to achieve PCB placement reuse, thereby improving placement efficiency.

Chen \emph{et al.}, "Deep Q-Learning for PCB Placement", adopted Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm as the core method of reinforcement learning. Through Q-learning, the agent updated the Q value after each placement operation according to the reward obtained, thus optimizing the placement strategy.
Heuristic algorithms are also often applied in this scenario.  Sheng \emph{et al.}, "Relay Racer: A Heuristic Approach for Layout Optimization", propose a heuristic approach, inspired by Relay races, that continuously improves layout quality through multiple "relay" stages. By simulating a competition mechanism similar to a race, it continuously "transmits" improved information at different stages and gradually optimizes the layout.

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item In order to solve the problem of large-scale components placement, we propose a components clustering algorithm based on DBSCAN, and give the initial placement and global placement system based on clustering.
    \item For the global placement based on the original DEA-PPM and CSA algorithms, we introduce them into the clustering system, and give a complete set of parameters adjustment scheme for different scale clustering and the placement scheme of single cluster components.
    \item We propose a novel legalization algorithm, which can effectively eliminate overlap while preserving component position relationship and fast convergence.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section \ref{pre} provides some preliminary information. Then, in Section \ref{init} and \ref{global placement}, the algorithms developed for the top and bottom layer placement problems are presented. Section \ref{legalization} legalizes the placement results of the previous section. In Section \ref{experiment}, numerical experiments are conducted to prove the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm, and Section \ref{conclusion} summarizes the paper.
