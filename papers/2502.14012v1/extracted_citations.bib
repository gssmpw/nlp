abstract = {Placement for very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits is one of the most important steps for design closure. This paper proposes a novel GPU-accelerated placement framework DREAMPlace, by casting the analytical placement problem equivalently to training a neural network. Implemented on top of a widely-adopted deep learning toolkit PyTorch, with customized key kernels for wirelength and density computations, DREAMPlace can achieve over 30\texttimes{} speedup in global placement without quality degradation compared to the state-of-the-art multi-threaded placer RePlAce. We believe this work shall open up new directions for revisiting classical EDA problems with advancement in AI hardware and software.},

abstract = {We develop a flat, analytic, and nonlinear placement algorithm, ePlace, which is more effective, generalized, simpler, and faster than previous works. Based on the analogy between placement instance and electrostatic system, we develop a novel placement density function eDensity, which models every object as positive charge and the density cost as the potential energy of the electrostatic system. The electric potential and field distribution are coupled with density using a well-defined Poisson's equation, which is numerically solved by spectral methods based on fast Fourier transform (FFT). Instead of using the conjugate gradient (CG) nonlinear solver in previous placers, we propose to use Nesterov's method which achieves faster convergence. The efficiency bottleneck on line search is resolved by predicting the steplength using a closed-form equation of Lipschitz constant. The placement performance is validated through experiments on the ISPD 2005 and ISPD 2006 benchmark suites, where ePlace outperforms all state-of-the-art placers (Capo10.5, FastPlace3.0, RQL, MAPLE, ComPLx, BonnPlace, POLAR, APlace3, NTUPlace3, mPL6) with much shorter wirelength and shorter or comparable runtime. On average, of all the ISPD 2005 benchmarks, ePlace outperforms the leading placer BonnPlace with 2.83\% shorter wirelength and runs 3.05\texttimes{} faster; and on average, of all the ISPD 2006 benchmarks, ePlace outperforms the leading placer MAPLE with 4.59\% shorter wirelength and runs 2.84\texttimes{} faster.},

abstract = {Standard cell circuits consist of millions of standard cells, which have to be aligned overlap-free to the rows of the chip. Placement of these circuits is done in consecutive steps. First, a global placement is obtained by roughly spreading the cells on the chip, while considering all relevant objectives like wirelength, and routability. After that, the global placement is legalized, i.e., the cell overlap is removed, and the cells are aligned to the rows. To preserve the result of global placement, cells should be moved as little as possible during legalizationThis paper presents "Abacus", which is a fast approach to legalize standard cell circuits with minimal movement. The approach is based on sorting the cells according to their position first, and legalizing the cells one at a time then. Legalizing one cell is done by moving the cell from row to row until the optimal place with the lowest movement is found. Whenever a cell is moved to a row, the cells already aligned to the row are placed by dynamic programming to minimize their total movement. Therefore, our approach Abacus moves already legalized cells during legalization. In contrast to this, Tetris [1], which uses a similar legalization technique, does not move already legalized cells. Consequently, the average movement is about 30\% lower in Abacus than in Tetris. On the other hand, the CPU time of the whole placement process is increased by only 7\% with our legalization approach. Applying Abacus to routability-driven placement results in 1\% improvement in routed wirelength},

abstract="By formulating the floorplanning of VLSI as a mixed-variable optimization problem, this paper proposes to solve it by a memetic algorithm, where the discrete orientation variables are addressed by the distribution evolutionary algorithm based on a population of probability model (DEA-PPM), and the continuous coordination variables are optimized by the conjugate sub-gradient algorithm (CSA). Accordingly, the fixed-outline floorplanning algorithm based on CSA and DEA-PPM (FFA-CD) and the floorplanning algorithm with golden section strategy (FA-GSS) are proposed for the floorplanning problems with and without fixed-outline constraint. Numerical experiments on GSRC test circuits show that the proposed algorithms are superior to some celebrated B*-tree based floorplanning algorithms, and are expected to be applied to large-scale floorplanning problems due to their low time complexity.",
