Typosquat is one of the threat model.}


\subsection{Typosquatting and Package Confusion}

% Origin of typosquat attack
Typosquatting originated from DNS domain names~\cite{koide2023phishreplicantLanguageModelBasedDNSSquattingDetection, moubayed2018DNSTyposquatDomainDetection}

% Taxonomy of detections
Package typosquatting, or package confusion...


% Detection methods
Previous methods have focused on maximizing detection by applying typosquatting detectors across the Cartesian product of popular and less popular packages, aiming to catch all potential typosquats.
The simplest approach utilizes Levenshtein distance (edit distance) measurements~\cite{taylor2020spellbound}. A more advanced method employs \textit{FastText} embeddings to capture semantic similarities and phonetic resemblance~\cite{neupane2023beyondTyposquatting}.
