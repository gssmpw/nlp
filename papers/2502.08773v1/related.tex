\textbf{Model routing.}\
Model routing has emerged as a simple yet effective strategy to lower LLMs' inference cost~\citep{Hendy:2023,Narayanan:2023}.
Recent works have studied various strategies to learn a %
router,
including
training an explicit ``meta-model'' based on a neuronal network~\citep{Ding:2024,Sakota:2024,CheJiaLin2024,Aggarwal:2024},
$k$-nearest neighbours~\citep{HuBieLi2024,Shnitzer:2023,Stripelis:2024,Lee:2024},
matrix factorisation~\citep{OngAlmWu2024,ZhuWuWen2024,Li:2025},
and graph neural networks~\citep{Feng:2024}.
Works have also explored the role of supervision in training a router~\citep{LuYuaLin2024,Zhao:2024},
and enhancing router robustness~\citep{Dann:2024,Montreuil:2025,Shafran:2025}.
Typically,
the router orchestrates amongst multiple independent LLMs,
although it is also possible to route amongst \emph{implicit} sub-models in a larger model, such as those defined by a MatFormer~\citep{Devvrit:2024,Cai:2024}.


\textbf{Model cascading.}\
Cascading is a closely related technique for orchestrating amongst multiple models,
wherein one \emph{sequentially invokes} {each} model in order of cost.
One then uses statistics from the resulting model output (e.g., the confidence) to decide whether or not to proceed to the next costlier model.
Cascading has a long history in computer vision applications~\citep{VioJon2001,WanLuoCra2018,Swayamdipta:2018,Rawat:2021,WanKonChr2022,Kag:2023,Jitkrittum:2023}.
Recently, cascades have also been successfully proven in the case of LLMs~\citep{CheZahZou2023,GupNarJit2024,Yue:2024,Chen:2024}.

\textbf{Selective classification and learning to defer.}\ 
The formal underpinnings of routing and cascading can be traced to
three closely related literatures:
learning to reject~\citep{chow1970optimum,Bartlett:2008,Cortes:2016}, 
selective classification~\citep{Geifman:2019,NarMenJit2024,NarMenJit2024a},
and learning to defer to an expert~\citep{Madras:2018,SanErdKon2023}.
Following pioneering studies of~\citet{Trapeznikov:2013,Bolukbasi:2017,MozSon2020},
a series of works have studied the routing and cascading problem through these lenses~\citep{NarJitMen2022,MaoMohMoh2024,Mao2024,MaoMohZho2024,MaoMohZho2024a}.
