In this work, we have proposed our \alg~algorithm
to automatically optimize the meta-prompt for LLM-based sequential decision-making tasks. We further extend our \alg~to derive the \alges~algorithm, which additionally optimizes the exemplars in the meta-prompt.
Our algorithms use neural networks to estimate the scores of different meta-prompts and sequentially selects the meta-prompts in a randomized fashion based on adversarial bandits.
We use extensive experiments to show that our algorithms considerably and consistently improve the performance of LLM-based sequential decision-making.
