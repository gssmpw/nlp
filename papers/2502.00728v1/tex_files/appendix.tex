\caption{\alges}
\label{algo:ES-subset}
\end{algorithm}



Our complete \alges~algorithm is described in Algo.~\ref{algo:ES-subset}.
As we have discussed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:expo:es}, there are two major differences compared to the way in which our \alg~algorithm optimizes the task description and meta-instruction (Algo.~\ref{algo:EXPO}).
Firstly, our domain of $k^{\text{ES}}$ arms (i.e., every arm corresponds to a randomly sampled exemplar sequence) changes in every iteration (line 8).
Secondly, as a result of the time-varying domains, we need to save a copy of the parameters of the NN trained in every iteration in order to compute the cumulative score estimates (lines 9-14).

\paragraph{Simplified Variant of Our \alges~Algorithm.}
When applying our \alges~algorithm to the LLM-based MAB algorithm in \citet{krishnamurthy2024can} (Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:bandits}), we have adopted a simplified variant of our \alges.
This is because in the problem setting from \citet{krishnamurthy2024can}, the number of arms is small. Therefore, instead of including a subset of the history of exemplars in the prompt, their algorithm has instead included a summarized observation history.
An example of such summarized observation history with 5 arms (represented by 5 buttons with different colors) is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:example:summarized:history} below.
Therefore, here we aim to optimize the format of the summarized observation history.
Specifically, we \emph{optimize the order of the arms} in the summarized history, and our domain of arms consist of \emph{all cyclically shifted variants of the following sequence of buttons}: $\{\text{blue button}, \text{green button}, \text{red button}, \text{yellow button}, \text{purple button}\}$.
For example, some other arms (button sequences) in our domain include: $\{\text{green button}, \text{red button}, \text{yellow button}, \text{purple button}, \text{blue button}\}$ and $\{\text{red button}, \text{yellow button}, \text{purple button}, \text{blue button}, \text{green button}\}$.
As a result, unlike our original \alges~algorithm described in Sec.~\ref{subsec:expo:es}, here we do not suffer from the issue of \emph{time-varying domain of arms}.

\end{figure}

Therefore, when applying our \alges~algorithm to improve the LLM-based MAB method from \citet{krishnamurthy2024can} (Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:bandits}), we make two modifications to our standard \alges~algorithm described in Algo.~\ref{algo:ES-subset}.
Firstly, instead of randomly sampling $k^{\text{ES}}$ exemplar sequences to form our domain of exemplar sequences, here our domain remains fixed across different iterations, i.e., all cyclically shifted variants of the arms.
Secondly, since here we do not suffer from the issue of time-varying domain of arms (i.e., exemplar sequences), we can resort to the incremental update of the cumulative reward estimates adopted by our \alg~algorithm (line 9 of Algo.~\ref{algo:EXPO}). As a result, we do not need to save a copy of the parameters of the NN trained in every iteration.





\section{More Details on Our Experimental Settings}

\subsection{More Details on the Generation of the Domain of Task Description and Meta-Instruction}
\label{app:subsec:detail:domain:generation}
Here we describe the details about how we generate the domain of task descriptions and meta-instructions.
Below we provide the prompt we have used to instruct the LLM to generate every prompt in the domain.

\end{mycolorbox}

\textbf{Generation of the Domain.}
To effectively generate task-specific prompts, we utilized an initial prompt to guide the LLM in creating diverse task descriptions and meta-instructions. For each task, the LLM was prompted 100 times to rephrase the task description and meta-instruction separately, resulting in 100 unique rephrased prompts for each. Combined with the initial prompt, this process produced a total of \(101 \times 101\) combinations of task descriptions and meta-instructions for each task. 

To optimize computational efficiency, we pre-compute the embeddings of all task descriptions and meta-instructions in the domain using the embedding model $g(\cdot)$ and store the results to prevent redundant calculations during subsequent experiments. 

For the rephrasing process, we employed 
% the \texttt{gpt-4} model 
the GPT-4 model
with a temperature setting of \(1.3\), ensuring diverse and high-quality rephrased prompts for both task descriptions and meta-instructions.



% \subsection{More Details on the Tasks in Sec.~\ref{sec:experiments}}
\subsection{More Details on OPRO for the Linear Regression and Traveling Salesman Problem (Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:opro})}

\subsubsection{Task Setting.}
\textbf{Linear Regression.} We conduct experiments on Linear Regression by selecting two challenging ground truth weight-bias (\(w, b\)) pairs. The experiments follow the OPRO framework, which requires warm-starting the LLM with initial exemplars. Using a fixed random seed, we first generate 50 random data points uniformly distributed within the range \([-1, 1]\), which perfectly satisfy the ground truth \(w_{\text{true}}, b_{\text{true}}\) pairs, ensuring that these data points can serve as the foundation for evaluating the LLMâ€™s ability to model the relationships. Additionally, 5 \(w, b\) pairs with corresponding scores, sampled within the range \([10, 20]\), are generated using another fixed random seed to serve as the initial exemplars. At each iteration, the LLM is prompted 8 times (consisting of 1 inference with a temperature setting of $T=0$ and 7 inferences with a temperature setting of $T=1$) using the current exemplars, and the prompt is updated based on the generated outputs. The exemplars are dynamically updated to include the top 20 \(w, b\) pairs and their associated scores from all historical records across iterations, ensuring the LLM is always guided by the best-performing examples. The total number of iterations is set to 50, and each ground truth configuration is repeated 5 times for consistency.


\textbf{Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).} For the TSP task, experiments are conducted on three problem sizes defined by the number of nodes: 10, 15, and 20. 
For each TSP instance, the problem is defined by randomly generating $n=10,15,20$ nodes, where the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each node are sampled uniformly from the range $[-100, 100]$.
For each configuration, a specific TSP instance is generated using a fixed random seed, and a single random seed is used to generate warm-start exemplars to initialize the LLM prompts. 
To initialize the optimization process, we randomly sample 5 different TSP routes along with their corresponding total distances. These routes and their lengths are used as the initial exemplars for the LLM.
Each iteration consists of 8 prompt calls to the LLM, followed by an update of the exemplars based on the generated results. 
More specifically, during each iteration, the GPT-3.5-turbo is prompted 8 times using the same prompt, consisting of 1 inference with a temperature setting of $T=0$ to ensure stability and 7 inferences with a temperature setting of $T=1$ to encourage exploration. 
Similar to the Linear Regression task, the exemplars for TSP are updated to include the top 20 historical solutions with the best scores, ensuring the prompt leverages the most effective examples. The number of iterations is set to 100, 200, and 300 for 10-node, 15-node, and 20-node TSP problems, respectively, to account for the increasing complexity of the tasks. Each node configuration is repeated 3 times to ensure consistency and reliability.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Metrics.}
\textbf{Linear Regression.}
In the Linear Regression task, the performance of the algorithms is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. Given a set of $N$ one-dimensional input data points \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}\) and their corresponding ground truth labels \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}\), the MSE is computed as:
\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \left\lVert \mathbf{y} - (w \cdot \mathbf{x} + b) \right\rVert^2,
\]
where \(w \in \mathbb{R}\) and \(b \in \mathbb{R}\) are the weight and bias parameters inferred by the LLM, and \(N\) is the total number of data points.

\textbf{Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).}
For the TSP task, the performance of the LLM-generated solutions is evaluated based on the total Euclidean distance of the TSP tour. Given a set of two-dimensional points \(\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes, the length of a proposed TSP tour \(\mathcal{P} = [\pi(1), \pi(2), \dots, \pi(N), \pi(1)]\) is computed as:
\[
\text{Length} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sqrt{\left( x_{\pi(i+1)} - x_{\pi(i)} \right)^2 + \left( y_{\pi(i+1)} - y_{\pi(i)} \right)^2},
\]
where \(\pi\) represents the permutation of nodes in the proposed tour, and \(\pi(N+1) = \pi(1)\) ensures the tour returns to the starting node.

To evaluate the convergence and effectiveness of the agents, we use the \textit{Optimality Gap} metric, which quantifies the deviation of the solver's best-found solution from the true optimal solution. It is defined as:
\[
\text{Optimality Gap} = \frac{\text{SolverOptimal} - \text{Optima}}{\text{Optima}} \times 100\%,
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\text{SolverOptimal}\) denotes the shortest tour length found by the solver up to the current iteration.
    \item \(\text{Optima}\) is the length of the known optimal TSP tour.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Design of Prompt Score.}
In both the Linear Regression and TSP tasks, optimal solutions are characterized by lower evaluation scores. To align with the requirements of the algorithm and ensure more stable learning, we define the \textit{Prompt Score} using the formula:
\[
\text{Prompt Score} = \frac{-\text{Evaluation Score} + b}{b},
\]
where \(b > 0\) is a stabilizing constant. This formulation ensures that lower evaluation scores correspond to higher prompt scores, which better facilitates the optimization process and contributes to steady algorithmic learning.

For the Linear Regression task, the \textit{Evaluation Score} is defined as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the weight-bias (\(w, b\)) pairs proposed by the algorithm at each iteration under a Temperature=0 stable inference. The MSE is computed based on the provided one-dimensional data points.

For the TSP task, the \textit{Evaluation Score} corresponds to the total Euclidean distance (\textit{Length}) of the TSP tour proposed by the algorithm at each iteration, also under a Temperature=0 stable inference.


\subsubsection{Details about the Models and Parameters in Our Algorithms}

\textbf{LLM Agents and Embedding Model.}
In our experiments, the primary LLM agent used is GPT-3.5-Turbo.
For embedding generation, we utilized OpenAI's \texttt{text-embedding-3-large} model, which outputs embeddings of dimensionality 3072. These embeddings were used to represent both the task description and meta-instruction in the \alg~ framework. The embeddings were also employed to represent the exemplars in the \alges~ framework. During each iteration of inference, the LLM agent performed 1 prediction with a temperature setting of \(T=0\) to provide a stable solution and 7 additional predictions with a temperature setting of \(T=1\) to encourage exploration.

\textbf{Neural Network Parameters.}
For the \alg, the input to the neural network consists of the concatenated embeddings of the task description and meta-instruction, resulting in an input dimensionality of \(3072 + 3072 = 6144\). The neural network employs a single hidden layer with a width of 1536 and produces a single scalar output. The training objective is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

For the \alges, the exemplar selection process differs depending on the iteration count. During the initial iterations, when fewer than 20 optimal historical records are available, we use all available exemplars. As the iteration count increases, exemplars are selected from the top \(\min(\text{total exemplar records}, 30)\) historical optimal records. From this pool, 257 exemplars are constructed, consisting of 256 randomly selected exemplars and 1 heuristic exemplar
% , which was 
generated from a combination of 20 best historical records. The neural network for \alges~ operates on an input dimensionality of 3072, corresponding to the embedding of a single exemplar. It employs a single hidden layer with a width of 512 and produces a single scalar output. The training objective is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

\textbf{EXP3 Learning Rate.}
In the \alg~, the learning rate parameter \(\eta_{\text{desc}}\) is set to \(100\) for selecting task descriptions and meta-instruction combinations. In the \alges, \(\eta_{\text{desc}}\) is also set to \(100\) for selecting task descriptions and meta-instruction combinations, while \(\eta_{\text{exemplar}}\) is set to \(10\) for selecting exemplars.



\subsubsection{Enhanced OPRO}
\label{app:sec:enhanced:opro}
Here, we describe how we have enhanced the original algorithm \cite{yang2023large} by modifying its prompts.

During initial experiments with the meta-prompts provided by the original OPRO algorithm \cite{yang2023large} for task description rephrasing, we observed that the LLM often misinterprets the \emph{descending order} semantics described in the original design. 
In tasks like TSP and Linear Regression, where better solutions correspond to lower evaluation scores, \emph{descending order} is intended to arrange solutions from high evaluation scores to low. However, the LLM frequently misunderstands this as a \emph{descending order of solution quality}, interpreting higher-ranked solutions as better and lower-ranked ones as worse, which is contrary to the intended meaning.

To address this issue, we enhance the orginal meta-prompts by explicitly clarifying the semantics of descending order in the context of evaluation scores. This modification ensures that the LLM accurately understand the intended instructions. When tested with the enhanced prompts, the problem was resolved, and the LLM is able to consistently generate correct rephrased task descriptions.
For a clearer illustration, we provide below the original OPRO meta-prompt (Fig.~\ref{fig:original:opro:prompt}) and our enhanced OPRO meta-prompt (Fig.~\ref{fig:enhanced:opro:prompt}).

\subsubsection{Explanation of BSSCD and BSSND}

\label{subsec:exp:app:more:details:bandit}

We provide a detailed explanation and demonstration of prompt designs for both BSSCD and BSSND \cite{krishnamurthy2024can}, highlighting their key components and structures. Figure~\ref{fig:wholeprompt4BSSCD} illustrates a complete example of a BSSCD prompt designed for the MAB problem under the hard difficulty setting.

In other words, our \alg~algorithm is used to optimize the text in these two sections.

\subsubsection{Task Setting}
The experiments are conducted for both the BSSND and BSSCD prompts under two pre-defined difficulty levels: \textit{hard} and \textit{easy}. For the \textit{hard} setting, the MAB instance consists of $K=5$ arms, where the best arm has a mean reward of $\mu^\star = 0.5 + \Delta / 2$ with $\Delta = 0.2$, and all other arms have a mean reward of $\mu = 0.5 - \Delta / 2$. For the \textit{easy} setting, the MAB instance consists of $K=4$ arms with a larger gap $\Delta = 0.5$ between the best arm and the suboptimal arm.
We set the blue button as the optimal arm in experiments, corresponding to the arm with the highest expected reward. Each configuration is tested using two fixed random seeds, with experiments repeated 3 times for each seed, resulting in a total of \(2 \times 3 = 6\) runs per setting. Each experiment consists of 100 iterations, with the LLM-based agents making decisions and updating prompts iteratively to optimize performance.
The work of \citet{krishnamurthy2024can} has reported that GPT-3.5 models encounter exploration failures in MAB tasks, making them unsuitable as agents for solving such problems. In contrast, GPT-4 demonstrates the capability to effectively handle the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in MAB settings. Therefore, we adopt GPT-4-turbo as the LLM agent for this experiment. 


\subsubsection{Evaluation Metric.}
In the LLM-based Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) task (Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:bandits}), the performance of the LLM agent is assessed using the \textit{Cumulative Regret} metric. At each iteration, the LLM agent outputs a probability distribution over the arms, representing the likelihood of sampling each arm.

Formally, let there be \(K\) arms, each associated with an expected reward \(\mu_1, \mu_2, \dots, \mu_K\), where \(\mu^* = \max_{k \in \{1, \dots, K\}} \mu_k\) denotes the expected reward of the optimal arm. At iteration \(t\), we sample an arm \(a_t \in \{1, \dots, K\}\), which is determined by the probability distribution provided by the LLM agent. The instantaneous regret for iteration \(t\) is then defined as:
\[
r_t = \mu^* - \mu_{a_t},
\]
where \(\mu_{a_t}\) represents the expected reward of the selected arm \(a_t\) at iteration \(t\).

The cumulative regret after \(T\) iterations is computed as:
\[
R_T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( \mu^* - \mu_{a_t} \right).
\]



\subsubsection{Design of Prompt Score.}
The score of the prompt is designed to quantify the expected reward of the LLM agent's sampling strategy at each iteration. At iteration \( t \), the LLM agent outputs a sampling probability distribution \( \{ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_K \} \), where \( p_i \) represents the probability of selecting arm \( i \) (\( i = 1, 2, \dots, K \), with \( K \) being the total number of arms). Simultaneously, the historical records from the first \( (t-1) \) iterations allow us to compute an unbiased estimate of the Bernoulli reward parameter for each arm, \( \hat{\mu}_i \), based on the observed rewards and sampling counts.

For arm \( i \), the Bernoulli parameter \( \hat{\mu}_i \) is estimated as:
\[
\hat{\mu}_i = 
\begin{cases} 
0, & \text{if } n_i = 0, \\
\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{t-1} R_{i,j}}{n_i}, & \text{if } n_i > 0.
\end{cases}
\]
where \( \sum_{j=1}^{t-1} R_{i,j} \) denotes the cumulative reward obtained from arm \( i \) during the first \( (t-1) \) iterations, and \( n_i \) represents the total number of times arm \( i \) was sampled during the same period.

The LLM agent's expected reward \( \hat{R}_{\text{expected}} \) at iteration \( t \) is then calculated by weighting the estimated Bernoulli parameters \( \{\hat{\mu}_1, \hat{\mu}_2, \dots, \hat{\mu}_K\} \) with the sampling probabilities \( \{ p_1, p_2, \dots, p_K \} \) provided by the LLM:
\[
\hat{R}_{\text{expected}} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i \cdot \hat{\mu}_i.
\]

This expected reward \( \hat{R}_{\text{expected}} \) serves as the score of the prompt.

\paragraph{Motivation for the Score Design.}
The design of the prompt score is driven by the objective of guiding the LLM agent to favor arms with higher expected rewards, represented by \( \mu_i \). Since the true values of \( \mu_i \) are not available, the prompt score is designed to estimate this quantity based on observed data. Specifically, the higher the value of \( \mu_i \), the higher the sampling probability \( p_i \) should be assigned to arm \( i \), reflecting the optimal choice. Conversely, arms with lower values of \( \mu_i \) should be assigned lower probabilities.

The original score with the Bernoulli parameters:
\[
R_{\text{expected}} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i \mu_i.
\]
In the absence of the true \( \mu_i \), we rely on the unbiased estimates \( \hat{\mu}_i \):
\[
\hat{R}_{\text{expected}} = \sum_{i=1}^{K} p_i \hat{\mu}_i.
\]

This design is justified because, for most of iterations, the score \( \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \hat{\mu}_i \) is an unbiased estimate of the true expected reward \( \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \mu_i \), and we proceed to formally establish this unbiasedness.

\paragraph{Proof of Unbiasedness.}
For iteration \( t \), where \( n_i > 0 \) for all \( i \), we aim to show that the score \( \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \hat{\mu}_i \) is an unbiased estimate of the true expected reward \( \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \mu_i \). Since \( \hat{\mu}_i \) is an unbiased estimate of \( \mu_i \), we have:
\[
\expect{\hat{\mu}_i} = \expect{\mu_i},
\]
Thus, by the linearity of expectation, we obtain:
\begin{align*}
    \expect{\sum_{i=1}^K p_i \hat{\mu}_i} &= \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \expect{\hat{\mu}_i} \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^K p_i \expect{\mu_i} \\
    &= \expect{\sum_{i=1}^K p_i \mu_i}
\end{align*}
This shows that the score $\hat{R}_{\text{expected}}$ is an unbiased estimate of the true expected reward $R_{\text{expected}}$.



\subsubsection{Details about the Models and Parameters in Our Algorithms}
\textbf{LLM Agents and Embedding Model.}
For the MAB tasks, the primary LLM agent is 
GPT-4-Turbo
and the fixed inference temperature is set to \(T=0\). For embedding generation, we employed OpenAI's \texttt{text-embedding-3-large} model, which outputs embeddings with a dimensionality of 3072. These embeddings are utilized to represent the prompts provided to the LLM agent during the experiments. At each iteration, the LLM is prompted once using the designed prompt.

\textbf{Neural Network Parameters.}
For the \alg, the input to the neural network consists of the concatenated embeddings of the task description and meta-instruction, resulting in an input dimensionality of \(3072 + 3072 = 6144\). The neural network employs a single hidden layer with a width of 1536 and produces a scalar output. The model is trained by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

For the \alges, the neural network is designed to process \(K\) exemplars, where \(K\) is determined by the total number of available summaries. To ensure fairness, \(K\) distinct exemplar combinations are generated at each iteration using a cyclic rotation mechanism. This mechanism ensures that each summary occupies every possible position within the exemplar sequence. Formally, given \(K\) summaries indexed as \(\{e_0, e_1, \dots, e_{K-1}\}\), the \(i\)-th exemplar combination is defined as:
\[
(e_i, e_{(i+1) \mod K}, \dots, e_{(i+K-1) \mod K}).
\]
This guarantees that each summary appears in every position across all \(K\) combinations.

Each exemplar is embedded into a 3072-dimensional vector using the embedding model, and these embeddings are processed individually by the neural network. The neural network consists of a single hidden layer with a width of 512 and produces a scalar output. Like \alg, the training objective is to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function.

\textbf{EXP3 Learning Rate.} 
For the \alg, the learning rate parameter \(\eta_{\text{desc}}\) is set to \(10\) for selecting task descriptions and meta-instruction combinations. In the \alges, two learning rate parameters are used: \(\eta_{\text{desc}}\) is set to \(10\) for selecting task description and meta-instruction combinations, and \(\eta_{\text{exemplar}}\) is set to \(10\) for selecting exemplars.


\subsection{Improving Numerical Stability}

To prevent numerical overflow during the computation of exponentials in our algorithms,
a translation constant \( C^{(t)} \) is introduced at each iteration \( t \). This constant stabilizes the computation by shifting the cumulative scores, ensuring the algorithm operates reliably until convergence without altering the resulting probability distribution. The translation constant is defined as:
\begin{equation}
C^{(t)} = \max_{j} S_j^{(t)}.
\end{equation}

The translated scores are:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{S}_i^{(t)} = S_i^{(t)} - C^{(t)}.
\end{equation}

The probability distribution after translation is:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_t[i] = \frac{\exp\big(\eta \tilde{S}_i^{(t)}\big)}{\sum_{j=1}^k \exp\big(\eta \tilde{S}_j^{(t)}\big)}.
\end{equation}

Substituting \( \tilde{S}_i^{(t)} = S_i^{(t)} - C^{(t)} \):
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_t[i] = \frac{\exp\big(\eta \big(S_i^{(t)} - C^{(t)}\big)\big)}{\sum_{j=1}^k \exp\big(\eta \big(S_j^{(t)} - C^{(t)}\big)\big)}.
\end{equation}

Using \( \exp(a - b) = \frac{\exp(a)}{\exp(b)} \):
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_t[i] = \frac{\exp\big(\eta S_i^{(t)}\big) / \exp\big(\eta C^{(t)}\big)}{
\sum_{j=1}^k \big(\exp\big(\eta S_j^{(t)}\big) / \exp\big(\eta C^{(t)}\big)\big)}.
\end{equation}

Simplifying:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_t[i] = \frac{\exp\big(\eta S_i^{(t)}\big)}{\sum_{j=1}^k \exp\big(\eta S_j^{(t)}\big)}.
\end{equation}

Thus, the probabilities remain unchanged:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{P}_t[i] = P_t[i].
\end{equation}

\label{app:ablation:subsec:gpt4-turbo}
Fig.~\ref{fig:TSP_ablation} shows a zoomed version of Fig.~\ref{fig:TSP_ablation:eta} (bottom right) in the main paper. It shows that when GPT-4-Turbo is used as the LLM, our \alg~is still able to significantly outperform OPRO.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Results of Other Variants of OPRO}
\label{exp:app:opro:full:results}
As we have discussed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:expo} and Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:opro}, the original OPRO uses a temperature of $1$ to choose all $8$ actions in a batch, while we have made a slight modification such that we choose the last action in the batch with a temperature of $0$. Here we show that this has a minimal impact on the performance of OPRO (Fig.~\ref{fig:full_results}).
Specifically, in Fig.~\ref{fig:full_results}, the orange curves represent the original OPRO (using a temperature of $1$ for all $8$ actions) and the pink curves correspond to our modified version.
We have also compared the performances of the enhanced variants (see Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:opro} for details) for both the original (purple) and modified OPRO (green).
The results show that setting the temperature to $0$ while selecting the last action has negligible impact on the performance of OPRO.
Importantly, \textbf{our \alg~and \alges~algorithms consistently and dramatically outperform all variants of OPRO}.

\subsection{Impact of Adding Exemplar Embedding to the NN in \alg}
Recall that in every iteration of our \alg~(Algo.~\ref{algo:EXPO}), we need to train a neural network (NN) $\mathcal{M}(g(\cdot);\theta)$ to estimate the scores of the task descriptions and meta-instructions in the domain (line 8 of Algo.~\ref{algo:EXPO}).  
Note that the training set used to train this NN is $\{(\left[g(\mathcal{D}_i) \oplus g(\mathcal{I}_i)\right], s_i)\}_{i=1,\ldots,t+1}$ (line 7 of Algo.~\ref{algo:EXPO}).  
However, it is also important to note that in our \alg~algorithm, the set of exemplars included in the meta-prompt $\mathcal{E}'_{t}$ changes in every iteration and hence may also affect the scores $s_i$'s.  
Therefore, one may naturally wonder whether including the embedding of $\mathcal{E}'_{t}$ in the input of the NN can further improve the performance of the trained NN and, consequently, the performance of the overall \alg.  
We conduct an ablation study to validate this hypothesis, and the results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:with_without_exemplars_embedding}.  
The results demonstrate that including the embedding of the exemplars in the input of the NN does not lead to better performance than our standard approach of excluding it (Algo.~\ref{algo:EXPO}).  
This is likely due to the significantly increased dimensionality of the input to the NN, which makes training the NN more challenging.  
Therefore, these results suggest that the benefit of additionally accounting for the changing exemplars is outweighed by the drawback of the significantly increased dimensionality of the input to the NN.

We include the comparisons for the TSP task (Fig.~\ref{fig:example:descriptions:tsp}), and the two different prompt designs for the LLM-based MAB task in Sec.~\ref{subsec:exp:bandits} (Fig.~\ref{fig:example:descriptions:MABbssnd} and Fig.~\ref{fig:example:descriptions:MAB}).
