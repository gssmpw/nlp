\section*{Limitations}





While \textsc{MemoryCode} and our experimental setup enable us to identify key strengths and weaknesses of current models, certain limitations remain, which could inspire future research. 
First, \textsc{MemoryCode} is based on synthetic data. 
This choice was driven by both cost considerations---as collecting real interactions would have been much more expensive---, and the need for greater control over the factors influencing model performance. 
However, future work could explore more realistic interactions by relaxing the constraints imposed in \textsc{MemoryCode}. 
Second, our experiments do not establish a human performance upper bound. This could be an interesting direction for future investigation for future work, as it would provide useful information on human limitations at keeping track of relevant information provided over long periods of time and amidst large amount of irrelevant information.
Third, our dataset only focus on a specific kind of task, namely, coding. This kind of task was chosen due to it being very common in real-world scenarios and very easy to evaluate. However, future work should expand to other domains, to assess if results are consistent with those that we report. 
While we are aware of the limitations above, and that others possibly exist, we believe these do not impact the robustness of our findings.
