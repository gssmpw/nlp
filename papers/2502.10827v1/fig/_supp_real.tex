\caption{Comparison of E-3DGS against the baselines and ablation study on E-3DGS-Real. As observed in the main paper, Deblur-GS, E2VID + 3DGS, and EventNeRF exhibit issues such as blurring, floaters and noise. Notably, the ablation study highlights the impact of removing key components. Removing $L_\text{iso}$ leads to an increase in floaters and artifacts. In contrast, the experiment without adaptive event windows (AW) shows little difference in performance. This is likely due to the relatively consistent camera speeds in this dataset that reduce the potential benefits of AW.
