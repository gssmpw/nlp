\caption{Comparison of E-3DGS vs.~baselines on the E-3DGS-Synthetic dataset. As observed in the main paper, E2VID + 3DGS struggles with poor color reconstruction but captures edges and structure reasonably well. EventNeRF suffers from noise and a lack of sharpness. In contrast, our method delivers clear details and accurate colors, with issues mainly confined to less observed areas, such as the roof. Best viewed with zoom.}
