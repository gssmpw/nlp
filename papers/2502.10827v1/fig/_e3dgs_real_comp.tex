\caption{Comparison of E-3DGS against the baselines and ablation study on the E-3DGS-Real dataset. Deblur-GS, E2VID + 3DGS and EventNeRF suffer from various issues including blurring, floaters, and noise. In contrast, our method delivers clear details, such as the intricate structure of the sculpture's face. }
