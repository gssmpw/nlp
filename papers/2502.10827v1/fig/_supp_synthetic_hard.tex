Ablation study of E-3DGS on the E-3DGS-Synthetic-Hard dataset. The increased difficulty of this dataset leads to overall performance deterioration compared to E-3DGS-Synthetic, but our full method still performs well. The version without the adaptive event window (AW) is closest to the full method but shows more artifacts. For example, in the first column of the Company sequence, the sofa shows some artifacts in the AW-removed version that are absent in the full method. Similar minor artifacts are visible elsewhere. The second column of the Subway sequence is interesting, as all versions struggle with reconstructing it. Even so, the full method demonstrates a better structure and fewer artifacts than the others.}
