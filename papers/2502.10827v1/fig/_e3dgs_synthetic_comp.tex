\caption{Comparison of E-3DGS vs.~baselines on the E-3DGS-Synthetic dataset. E2VID + 3DGS struggles with poor color reconstruction but captures edges and structure reasonably well. EventNeRF suffers from noise and a lack of sharpness. In contrast, our method delivers clear details and accurate colors, with only minor issues in certain areas (such as the coat on a chair in the ScienceLab sequence. Best viewed with zoom.}
