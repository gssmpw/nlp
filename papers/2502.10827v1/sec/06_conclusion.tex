We show that E-3DGS effectively combines the strengths of 3D Gaussian splatting and event-based supervision for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis of large-scale scenes. 
It significantly outperforms the baselines quantitatively and qualitatively, while being orders of magnitude faster. 
One aspect beyond the scope of this paper 
is lifting the requirement for camera pose initialization through an external process. 
We believe this work paves the way for robust and scalable large-scale scene reconstruction utilizing the advantages of event cameras to capture details in challenging conditions, such as low light and fast motion.
