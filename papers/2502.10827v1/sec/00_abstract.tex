Novel view synthesis techniques predominantly utilize RGB cameras, inheriting their limitations such as the need for sufficient lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and restricted dynamic range. In contrast, event cameras are significantly more resilient to these limitations but have been less explored in this domain, particularly in large-scale settings. Current methodologies primarily focus on front-facing or object-oriented (360-degree view) scenarios. For the first time, we introduce 3D Gaussians for event-based novel view synthesis. Our method reconstructs large and unbounded scenes with high visual quality. We contribute the first real and synthetic event datasets tailored for this setting. Our method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms the baseline \mbox{EventNeRF} by a margin of $11{-}25\%$ in PSNR (dB) while being orders of magnitude faster in reconstruction and rendering.
