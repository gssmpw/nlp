\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:Preliminaries} 

\subsection{3D Gaussians}
3D Gaussian Splatting~\cite{3dgs} is a high-quality and efficient scene representation. 
The Gaussians are defined by a 3D covariance matrix \(\var_i\) centered around a point \(\mean_i\): 
\begin{equation}
   G_i(\x) = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\x - \mean_i)^T \var_i^{-1} (\x - \mean_i)\right) \mathrm{\,,}
   \label{eq:gaussian_density}
\end{equation}
and their overlay models the 
geometry at scene location~$\x$.
Each Gaussian is additionally associated with an opacity~$o_i$ and spherical harmonics that model view-dependent color.
For rendering purposes, the means~$\mean_i$ and covariance matrices~$\var_i$ are transformed into image coordinates. The projected matrix~$\var'_i$ can be obtained by applying the viewing transformation~$\boldsymbol{W}$ and the Jacobian~$\boldsymbol{J}$ of the affine approximation of the projective transformation:
\begin{equation}
   \var'_i = \boldsymbol{J} \boldsymbol{W} \var_i \boldsymbol{W}^T \boldsymbol{J}^T \mathrm{\,.}
   \label{eq:gaussian_project}
\end{equation}
The third row and column of~$\var'_i$ are dropped to obtain a 2D matrix.
Using Equation~\ref{eq:gaussian_density}, one can then evaluate the different Gaussians~$i$ that overlap with an image pixel~$x$ and obtain alpha values as \(\alpha_{i,x} = o_i G'_i(\x)  \). 
The Gaussians are then sorted according to their depth, and alpha blending for every pixel  is performed by combining the view-dependent colors $c_i$ using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
   C_x = \sum_{i=1}^{N} T_{i,x} \alpha_{i,x} c_i \mathrm{\,,}
\end{equation}
where \(T_{i,x} = \prod_{k=1}^{i-1} (1 - \alpha_{k, x})\) represents the transmittance. 

\subsection{Event Formation Model}

Event cameras generate a continuous stream of events denoted as $ e = (\x, p, \tau) $, where $\x$ are the pixel coordinates at which an event is triggered at time $\tau$, and $p \in \{-1, +1\}$ signifies the polarity of the event, indicating an increase or decrease in the logarithmic intensity by 
the predefined contrast threshold \( \Delta \). 
Thus, the relationship between the triggered event and the logarithmic image intensity reads: 
\begin{equation}
    L_{\x}(\tau) - L_{\x}(\tau^\mathrm{prev}) = p\Delta, 
    \label{eq:egm}
\end{equation}
where \( \tau^\mathrm{prev} \) is the time when the previous event for the pixel was triggered. This concept can then be generalized to apply for an accumulation of events within a time interval $(\tau_1, \tau_2) | \tau_1 < \tau_2$ for a pixel location $\x$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
    L_{\x}(\tau_2) - L_{\x}(\tau_1) = \sum_{\tau_1 < \tau_t \leq \tau_2} p_t\Delta \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} E_{\x}(t_1, t_2)\mathrm{\,,}
    \label{eq:egm_sum}
\end{equation}
where $t_1$, $t_2$ index the sequence of events closest to 
$\tau_1$, $\tau_2$.
