Prompt & Use Case \\

Hi, I am building an algorithm detecting whether a given system prompt was used in a language model. My approach assumes that I can query the language model with task prompts. Below I will show you a system prompt, I would like your help to curate 10 probe task prompts for that system prompt. A task prompt is a good probe for a given system prompt if it elicits responses that are related to the system prompt and are directly influenced by it. Return results as a json. \\
System prompt: \textit{[Insert system prompt here]} & Task Queries \\

Hi, I am building an algorithm detecting whether a given system prompt was used in a language model. My approach assumes that I can query the language model with task prompts. I want to set up an experiment with difficult-to-distinguish examples by creating rephrased variations of my system prompt that are similar in spirit but differ in details and thus cannot be considered stolen. \\
First, here are the system prompts I use in my experiments: \\
\textit{[Insert system prompts here]}\\
Now, let's move on to making variations of these ten proprietary prompts. For each of the ten prompts, suggest five variations -- (1) the same prompt, slightly rephrased with minor changes in a few words (2) very similar in spirit, but somewhat rephrased, (3) very similar in spirit, but significantly rephrased, (4) a different prompt for the same role with some remote similarities to the original one, (5) a completely different prompt for the same role with significant conceptual changes. & Hard Examples \\
