\section{Related Work}
ECG has a wide range of applications in the healthcare field. It plays a crucial role in monitoring heart activity and diagnosing various medical conditions. One of its most important and widely used applications is the detection of CVDs using machine learning algorithms ____ and deep learning algorithms ____. ECG is used to check for different kinds of arrhythmia. These can be detected when we have a clean ECG signal, but signals are affected by various reasons, causing the signals to become distorted and noisy. Noisy signal hampers the ML and DL performance. There are various methods by which the noisy segments are removed; statistical methods like EMD and EEMD are used for denoising the ECG signal ____ and CEEMD to detect the noisy ECG signals using statistical features ____. However, automation of noisy signal detection is necessary to automate the process of discarding the ECg noisy segment.
