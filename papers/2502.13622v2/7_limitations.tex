\section*{Limitations}

While REFIND achieves notable improvements in hallucination detection, there are limitations to consider. First, the reliance on retrieved documents means that the quality of the retriever directly impacts performance. Errors in retrieval or limited availability of relevant documents may lead to suboptimal CSR calculations and misclassification of hallucinated spans. Second, the approach involves computational overhead associated with calculating token probabilities with and without retrieved context, which could pose challenges in low-latency applications. Lastly, REFIND focuses on detecting factual hallucinations, and its performance in non-factoid question answering \cite{Bolotova2022NFQATaxanomy, Lee2025Typed-RAG} remains unexplored. Further studies are needed to assess its ability to detect hallucinations in non-factoid QA tasks.
