  abstract = {A novel gray-box neural network model (GBNNM), including multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network (NN) and integrators, is proposed for a model identification and fault estimation (MIFE) scheme. With the GBNNM, both the nonlinearity and dynamics of a class of nonlinear dynamic systems can be approximated. Unlike previous NN-based model identification methods, the GBNNM directly inherits system dynamics and separately models system nonlinearities. This model corresponds well with the object system and is easy to build. The GBNNM is embedded online as a normal model reference to obtain the quantitative residual between the object system output and the GBNNM output. This residual can accurately indicate the fault offset value, so it is suitable for differing fault severities. To further estimate the fault parameters (FPs), an improved extended state observer (ESO) using the same NNs (IESONN) from the GBNNM is proposed to avoid requiring the knowledge of ESO nonlinearity. Then, the proposed MIFE scheme is applied for reaction wheels (RW) in a satellite attitude control system (SACS). The scheme using the GBNNM is compared with other NNs in the same fault scenario, and several partial loss of effect (LOE) faults with different severities are considered to validate the effectiveness of the FP estimation and its superiority.},

  abstract = {In recent years, integrated electricity-gas systems (IEGSs) have attracted widespread attention. The unified scheduling and control of the IEGS depends on high-precision operating data. To this end, it is necessary to establish an appropriate state estimation (SE) model for IEGS to filter the raw measured data. Considering that power systems and natural gas systems have different time scales and sampling periods, this paper proposes a dynamic state estimation (DSE) method based on a Kalman filter that can consider the dynamic characteristics of natural gas pipelines. First, the standardized state transition equations for the gas system are developed by applying the finite difference method to the partial differential equations (PDEs) of the gas system; then the DSE model for IEGS is formulated based on a Kalman filter; also, the measurements from the electricity system and the gas system with different sampling periods are fused to ensure the observability of DSE by using the interpolation method. The IEEE 39-bus electricity system and the 18-nodes Belgium gas system are integrated as the test systems. Simulation results verify the proposed method's accuracy and calculation efficiency.},

  abstract = {The pipeline efficiency factor (E-value) and the overall heat transfer coefficient (K-value) are, respectively, the characteristic parameters that describe the flow and heat transfer behavior of gas pipe sections. These parameters have a significant impact on the accuracy of the thermo-hydraulic calculations of the gas flow processing. Hence, they should be investigated thoroughly. Due to various complex factors affecting the E-value and the K-value in operating the in-service gas pipe sections, it is often difficult to calculate the two characteristic parameters accurately using physics-based formulae. Based on quasi-steady-state historical operational data sets of the in-service gas pipe section, the characteristic parameters are identified with the maximum likelihood method and the least square method, respectively. Besides, the characteristic parameters of the gas pipe section are derived from solving the inverse problem of the steady-state thermo-hydraulic calculations. Both methods are applied to an in-service pipeline, and the two parameters are obtained from 144 historical operational data sets. By introducing the two parameters into the thermo-hydraulic calculations for certain quasi-steady-state historical conditions in the same gas pipe section, the maximum relative errors occurred between the calculated results and the measured data are 2.91\% and 2.66\%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the two methods is small, with a gap of 0.0037 W/(m2 K) in K-value and 0.0206 in E-value. The proposed identification methods are extendable to provide adequate technical support for large-scale gas pipeline networks.},

  abstract = {To obtain the accurate transient states of the big scale natural gas pipeline networks under the bad data and non-zero mean noises conditions, a robust Kalman filter-based dynamic state estimation method is proposed using the linearized gas pipeline transient flow equations in this paper. Firstly, the dynamic state estimation model is built. Since the gas pipeline transient flow equations are less than the states, the boundary conditions are used as supplementary constraints to predict the transient states. To increase the measurement redundancy, the zero mass flow rate constraints at the sink nodes are taken as virtual measurements. Secondly, to ensure the stability under bad data condition, the robust Kalman filter algorithm is proposed by introducing a time-varying scalar matrix to regulate the measurement error variances correctly according to the innovation vector at every time step. At last, the proposed method is applied to a 30-node gas pipeline network in several kinds of measurement conditions. The simulation shows that the proposed robust dynamic state estimation can decrease the effects of bad data and achieve better estimating results.},

However, the assumed physical parameters such as the length of the pipes are usually investigated from blueprint or factory technical tests, which may differ from actual values and cause inaccurate hydraulic calculation result. Moreover, an initialization sufficiently near the root guarantees the convergence of the Newton's Iteration (NI) for solving the hydraulic equations. In this paper, a data-driven hydraulic calculation method is proposed, where we make two major contributions. (i) A parameter estimation method is provided for adjustment to the hyper parameters of the hydraulic calculation.

The numerical results show that the proposed data-driven parameter estimation improves the hydraulic calculation accuracy and initialization method reduces the calculation time cost.},

  abstract = {The large-scale coverage of natural gas makes the composition structure and operation mode of natural gas network more complex, higher requirements are put forward for the effectiveness and accuracy of state estimation. The existing methods for state estimation of natural gas network with noise are all modeled after processing the data with noise, leading to the real data being distorted to a certain extent. With that in mind, a data-driven method is presented in this paper. While solving the problem of state estimation for natural gas network with measurement noise in the input data, filtering and denoising are unnecessary during state estimation, retaining the complete information of real data. It avoids destruction of real data induced by separating noise from measured data owing to different methods and intensities of noise processing. According to the gas flow characteristic equation of natural gas system, the original problem is converted into a weighted low-rank approximation problem, the search space is shrunk to an orthogonal complement space. The selection of initial values is not merely unrestricted but there will be no accumulation and transmission of iteration error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulating 10-node natural gas network. Compared with the Newton's method, the data-driven method has superior performance, the RMSE achieves 0.2268 and the MAPE achieves 1.63\%.},

PN signals, e.g., pressure and temperature, are modeled as low-pass time-varying graph signals, and an outlier-resistant graph-frequency domain (GFD) filter is proposed. This article extends the innovation saturation (IS) mechanism from the node domain to the GFD. A GFD IS function is developed with a more compact structure, which reduces outlier effects by restricting PN signals' smoothness. Since the PN signal is time-varying, the saturation function is embedded in the Kalman filter as an inequality constraint. The close-form solution to the filter is derived by replacing the nonlinear inequality constraints with high-pass graph Fourier transforms, and the cutoff frequency is found by analyzing the graph-frequency component of prior and posterior. A steel industrial PN is used to evaluate the proposal. Results indicate that the proposed filter exhibits superior performance in PN systems, particularly internal nodes.},

This paper proposes a hybrid physical and data driven modeling approach, which can take full advantage of physical laws and measurement data to characterize the transient behavior of gas flow in pipeline networks. Based on the linear graph theory, the gas flow dynamics and network topology are uniformly repre\- sented in the directed graph, so that the state-space model can be extracted automatically. Considering that the increasing number of model parameters with networks scale, a decentralized parameters identification algorithm is designed to enhance computational efficiency. The overall network is partitioned into a certain number of nonoverlapping subnetworks, and each one formulizes the parameter identification as a nonlinear optimization problem solved by an iterative Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a real-world gas network from a steel industrial park in China is studied, and simulation results are compared with the commercial simulation software Apros™. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the accuracy in gas network transient modeling markedly.},

  abstract = {A new challenge has arisen in power generation scheduling recently, as the rapid increase in the number of gas-fired units has made power systems more vulnerable to failures in natural gas networks. The large-scale integration of wind power further exacerbates the problem because gas-fired units are usually scheduled to catch up wind power uncertainty and thus lead to great variations in the state of gas network. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to commit and dispatch the gas-fired units considering both wind uncertainty and natural gas network security. However, the dynamic characteristics of gas flow are remarkably slower than those of power flow, which should be appropriately modeled to explore its benefits for power system operation. Because directly applying partial differential equations overly complicates the already complicated generation scheduling problem, we address this problem by proposing an approximated transient matrix-form gas flow model. A two-stage robust generation scheduling model is then proposed considering the dynamic security constraints of gas networks and the wind power uncertainty. Moreover, we successfully avoid the nonlinearity of gas flow constraints by developing a new solution methodology. Finally, an illustrative case is presented to demonstrate the effect of gas network dynamics in generation scheduling.},

  abstract = {The natural gas pipeline network is an important part of the integrated energy system. The optimal control of the integrated energy system requires accurate transient online simulation of the natural gas pipeline network. However, the existing relevant research does not make enough use of the measured data, resulting in low simulation accuracy. Therefore, a high-accuracy online transient simulation framework is proposed from four perspectives: transient simulation model selection, model parameters settings, measured data processing, and model error compensation. In this framework, measured data is fully used to improve simulation accuracy by integrating multiple physics-based and data-driven methods. First, the simulation model based on the finite volume method is selected as the basic physics-based model. Then measured data are processed based on the 3 times standard deviation method and moving average filtering to drive the simulation model. To set suitable model parameters, a data-driven method combining with the Kriging model and genetic algorithm is proposed to simultaneously identify the two key parameters of roughness and heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the final simulation errors of the physics-based model are compensated by combining the data-driven model in three modes, namely supplement, embedment, and integration. Two cases of an actual single pipeline and a complex pipeline network illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework and verify the advantage of the integrated data-driven and physics-based methods. Compared with measured data, the final simulation errors of mass flow and temperature are 0.3279\% and 0.1036\%, respectively. Under the trend of delicacy and intelligent operation of natural gas pipeline network, the proposed framework provides a theoretical basis for the online simulation application.},

  abstract = {The pressure changes dramatically during the shutdown process of the multi-product pipeline. When the pipeline pressure comes to decrease, it is often mistaken as pipeline leakage or other abnormal condition which increases the burden of the operator on-site. At present, the method of pipeline shutdown pressure analysis is mainly based on numerical simulation which can not monitor shutdown pressure in real-time. In this work, the time-series approximate ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) is taken advantage of to construct a shutdown pressure prediction model. To overcome the drawback of this deep learning algorithm that is trained only by ample data, the scientific principle and theory are integrated into LSTM. Subsequently, the theory-guided long short-term memory (TG-LSTM) is proposed for pipeline shutdown pressure prediction. The proposed model is trained with available data and simultaneously guided by the theory (physical principle and engineering theory) of the underlying problem. In the training process, the data mismatch, as well as monotonicity constraints, and boundary constraints are coupled into loss function. After acquiring the parameters of the neural network, a TG-LSTM model is established which not only fits the data, but also follows the physical principle and the engineering theory. The proposed model is verified by three real-world multi-product pipelines. The results indicate that TG-LSTM achieves better accuracy than other prediction models, with MAPE being 0.246\%, 0.186\%, and 0.143\%, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of different hyper-parameter is conducted to illustrate the robustness of TG-LSTM in pipeline shutdown pressure prediction.},

Additionally, the method of purely machine learning has the problems of poor interpretability and difficulty in optimizing the model. A novel dynamic simulation method based on an interpretable shortcut Elman network (Shortcut-ENN) model for the pipeline network is proposed. The Shortcut-ENN model is derived from the state space equations. Based on the Shortcut-ENN model, the connection relationship and mechanism characteristics of the pipeline are retained, and an interpretable machine learning pipeline network model is constructed to make up for the lack of mechanism modeling. The model fully adopts the mechanism knowledge and is very suitable for optimization, which greatly improves robustness of the model. Validated and compared with long short-term memory model, the results show that MSE, MAE, R2, and EV of the proposed Shortcut-ENN-based model considering embedded pipeline mechanism and compressor constraints are improved approximately 84.4\%, 60.1\%, 0.75\%, and 53.3\%, respectively, and the R2 is about larger than 0.99, and the EV is about less than 0.02.},
