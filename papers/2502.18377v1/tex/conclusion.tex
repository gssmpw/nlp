This paper presents a new method for discovering governing PDEs from data.
We build specialized multigrid parallel and differentiable solver for solving PDEs in batch which is then incorporated in a discovery architecture.
Experiments show that the method can discover complex equations from data while being robust to noise and expands the class of PDEs that can be modeled by machine learning methods.

\emph{Limitations.} Scalability is a main limitation of grid-based PDE methods and one way forward might be to explore a combination of grid-based and mesh-free techniques.
Another shortcoming is that the method sometimes sacrifices accuracy for speed.
This could be resolved by better multigrid solvers and faster GPU implementations. 
Finally, we do not consider the identifiability of the PDEs being discovered and the conditions under which discovery is possible. Extending the analysis of~\citet{yao2024marrying} to PDEs would be an interesting starting point.
