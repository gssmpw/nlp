	abstract = {The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate, debug, and explain code has sparked the interest of researchers and educators in undergraduate programming, with many anticipating their transformative potential in programming education. However, decisions about why and how to use LLMs in programming education may involve more than just the assessment of an LLM’s technical capabilities. Using the social shaping of technology theory as a guiding framework, our study explores how students’ social perceptions influence their own LLM usage. We then examine the correlation of self-reported LLM usage with students’ self-efficacy and midterm performances in an undergraduate programming course. Triangulating data from an anonymous end-of-course student survey (n = 158), a mid-course self-efficacy survey (n=158), student interviews (n = 10), self-reported LLM usage on homework, and midterm performances, we discovered that students’ use of LLMs was associated with their expectations for their future careers and their perceptions of peer usage. Additionally, early self-reported LLM usage in our context correlated with lower self-efficacy and lower midterm scores, while students’ perceived over-reliance on LLMs, rather than their usage itself, correlated with decreased self-efficacy later in the course.},

(Machine learning, or ML, lets systems learn to analyze data without being explicitly programmed.) We created it to help students, teachers, designers, and others learn about ML by creating and using their own classification models. Its broad uptake suggests it has empowered people to learn, teach, and explore ML concepts: People have created curriculum, tutorials, and other resources using Teachable Machine on topics like AI ethics at institutions including the Stanford d.school, NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program, the MIT Media Lab, as well as creative experiments. Users in 201 countries have created over 125,000 classification models. Here we outline the project and its key contributions of (1) a flexible, approachable interface for ML classification models without ML or coding expertise, (2) a set of technical and design decisions that can inform future interactive machine learning tools, and (3) an example of how structured learning content surrounding the tool supports people accessing ML concepts.},

To address this challenge, we deployed the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents’ demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits. We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global, socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this article are publicly available.},

A qualitative research approach, leveraging the use of literature review as a research design and approach was used and effectively facilitated the realization of the study purpose. Artificial intelligence is a field of study and the resulting innovations and developments that have culminated in computers, machines, and other artifacts having human-like intelligence characterized by cognitive abilities, learning, adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The study ascertained that AI has extensively been adopted and used in education, particularly by education institutions, in different forms. AI initially took the form of computer and computer related technologies, transitioning to web-based and online intelligent education systems, and ultimately with the use of embedded computer systems, together with other technologies, the use of humanoid robots and web-based chatbots to perform instructors' duties and functions independently or with instructors. Using these platforms, instructors have been able to perform different administrative functions, such as reviewing and grading students' assignments more effectively and efficiently, and achieve higher quality in their teaching activities. On the other hand, because the systems leverage machine learning and adaptability, curriculum and content has been customized and personalized in line with students' needs, which has fostered uptake and retention, thereby improving learners experience and overall quality of learning.},

These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course’s own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-tostudent ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had “a personal tutor.” Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course’s discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

	abstract = {Computing educators face significant challenges in providing timely support to students, especially in large class settings. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students' usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.},

We developed CodeAid, an LLM-based programming assistant delivering helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. For example, CodeAid can answer conceptual questions, generate pseudo-code with line-by-line explanations, and annotate student's incorrect code with fix suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a 12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed, further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights on CodeAid. Findings revealed students primarily used CodeAid for conceptual understanding and debugging, although a minority tried to obtain direct code. Educators appreciated CodeAid's educational approach, and expressed concerns about occasional incorrect feedback and students defaulting to ChatGPT.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied in various societal areas such as medicine, education, and science. For example, through the generation of more accurate medical diagnoses to support patients’ treatment, more content personalization to provide adaptive learning for students and more accurate predictions for future climate changes. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for professionals from different fields with AI competencies. These future professionals need preparation during their undergraduate education to deal with the remarkable AI breakthroughs in their domains and to understand, use, and help with the responsible development of these technologies. However, to address AI to non-computer science students in undergraduate education, it is necessary to thoroughly investigate the core AI competencies essential to these students acquire in order to prepare them effectively. Based on this, the objective of the research is to develop a framework with core AI competencies that can be adopted in future work to inform AI education for this target audience. Therefore, towards the AI competency framework for non-computer science students in undergraduate education, as an initial part of the process, we conducted semi-structured interviews with professionals working in the intersection of AI and other domains. The objective of the interviews was to qualitatively investigate the AI competencies considered suitable for incorporation into the undergraduate education curricula of non-computer science students from these professionals’ points of view. In this work, we present the results of these interviews and the list of core AI competencies for non-computer science students in undergraduate education according to these professionals. In summary, this list encompasses different perspectives, varying from basic AI competencies related to AI definition, history, and capabilities to more complex theoretical knowledge and practical skills regarding data and machine learning. The list also includes responsible AI competencies, covering AI’s social, ethical, and legal aspects.},

One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.},

Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs. Our study findings capture a rare snapshot in time in early 2023 as computing instructors are just starting to form opinions about this fast-growing phenomenon but have not yet converged to any consensus about best practices. Using these findings as inspiration, we synthesized a diverse set of open research questions regarding how to develop, deploy, and evaluate AI coding tools for computing education.},

Detecting this behavior will be a necessary component in introductory computer science (CS1) courses, and educators should be well-equipped with detection tools when the need arises. However, ChatGPT generates code non-deterministically, and thus, traditional similarity detectors might not suffice to detect AI-created code. In this work, we explore the affordances of Machine Learning (ML) models for the detection task. We used an openly available dataset of student programs for CS1 assignments and had ChatGPT generate code for the same assignments, and then evaluated the performance of both traditional machine learning models and Abstract Syntax Tree-based (AST-based) deep learning models in detecting ChatGPT code from student code submissions. Our results suggest that both traditional machine learning models and AST-based deep learning models are effective in identifying ChatGPT-generated code with accuracy above 90\%. Since the deployment of such models requires ML knowledge and resources that are not always accessible to instructors, we also explore the patterns detected by deep learning models that indicate possible ChatGPT code signatures, which instructors could possibly use to detect LLM-based cheating manually. We also explore whether explicitly asking ChatGPT to impersonate a novice programmer affects the code produced. We further discuss the potential applications of our proposed models for enhancing introductory computer science instruction.},

Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.},

Traditional pedagogical practices have focused on code writing tasks, but there is now a shift in importance towards reading, comprehending and evaluating LLM-generated code. Alongside this shift, an important new skill is emerging -- the ability to solve programming tasks by constructing good prompts for code-generating models. In this work we introduce a new type of programming exercise to hone this nascent skill: 'Prompt Problems'. Prompt Problems are designed to help students learn how to write effective prompts for AI code generators. A student solves a Prompt Problem by crafting a natural language prompt which, when provided as input to an LLM, outputs code that successfully solves a specified programming task. We also present a new web-based tool called Promptly which hosts a repository of Prompt Problems and supports the automated evaluation of prompt-generated code. We deploy Promptly in one CS1 and one CS2 course and describe our experiences, which include student perceptions of this new type of activity and their interactions with the tool. We find that students are enthusiastic about Prompt Problems, and appreciate how the problems engage their computational thinking skills and expose them to new programming constructs. We discuss ideas for the future development of new variations of Prompt Problems, and the need to carefully study their integration into classroom practice.},

Since June 2022, Copilot has officially been available for free to all students as a plug-in to development environments like Visual Studio Code. Prior work exploring OpenAI Codex, the underlying model that powers Copilot, has shown it performs well on typical CS1 problems thus raising concerns about its potential impact on how introductory programming courses are taught. However, little is known about the types of problems for which Copilot does not perform well, or about the natural language interactions that a student might have with Copilot when resolving errors. We explore these questions by evaluating the performance of Copilot on a publicly available dataset of 166 programming problems. We find that it successfully solves around half of these problems on its very first attempt, and that it solves 60\% of the remaining problems using only natural language changes to the problem description. We argue that this type of prompt engineering, which we believe will become a standard interaction between human and Copilot when it initially fails, is a potentially useful learning activity that promotes computational thinking skills, and is likely to change the nature of code writing skill development.},

In May 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) formed a joint working group to develop national guidelines for teaching AI to K-12 students. Inspired by CSTA's national standards for K-12 computing education, the AI for K-12 guidelines will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The AI for K-12 working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI- related videos, demos, software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. This blue sky talk invites the AI research community to reflect on the big ideas in AI that every K-12 student should know, and how we should communicate with the public about advances in AI and their future impact on society. It is a call to action for more AI researchers to become AI educators, creating resources that help teachers and students understand our work.},

AI literacy has become an important concept in the current technological landscape, emphasizing the need for individuals to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage with AI systems. This systematic review examined 47 articles published between 2019 and 2023, focusing on recent work to capture new insights and initiatives given the burgeoning of the literature on this topic. In the initial stage, we explored the dataset to identify the themes covered by the selected papers and the target population for AI literacy efforts. We identified that the articles broadly contributed to one of the following themes: a) conceptualizing AI literacy, b) prompting AI literacy efforts, and c) developing AI literacy assessment instruments. We also found that a range of populations, from pre-K students to adults in the workforce, were targeted. In the second stage, we conducted a thorough content analysis to synthesize six key constructs of AI literacy: Recognize, Know and Understand, Use and Apply, Evaluate, Create, and Navigate Ethically. We then applied this framework to categorize a range of empirical studies and identify the prevalence of each construct across the studies. We subsequently review assessment instruments developed for AI literacy and discuss them. The findings of this systematic review are relevant for formal education and workforce preparation and advancement, empowering individuals to leverage AI and drive innovation.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems are ubiquitous across many fields ranging from medicine (e.g., tumor detection), to natural language processing (e.g., digital home assistants, auto-translate tools), and personalization (e.g., social media recommendations). The rise of these systems has also seen a rise in the ethical challenges resulting from how some of these systems are designed and implemented. Most problematic is their propagation and amplification of problems such as racism and sexism [4, 6], among others. Further, these challenges exist within a computing discipline that is already burdened by exclusive, marginalizing cultures and practices that lead to low participation by women and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) [3]. Our project, AI + Dance, attends to these dimensions of inequity within AI/ML education through developing our understanding of how we can equip learners to recognize and rectify issues of AI and ML systems within an inclusive and culturally sustaining experience. We explore this in collaboration with STEM From Dance1 (SFD), a non-profit organization that supports girls of color in creative production with dance, CS, and STEM. In our prior work with SFD, we developed danceON, an open-access creative coding environment that enables learners to create code to engage authentically with dance and body motion [5]. With danceON, learners can code animations that can bind and respond to body positions and be statically and dynamically positioned in space. The system provides two ways to explore AI and ML. First, it integrates a pose detection machine learning model (PoseNet [8]) that consists of body points (i.e., Left Ear, Nose, etc.) and confidence scores for these key points, which are all accessible within the code. Second, danceON enables learners to import a model trained in Google’s Teachable Machine [2] to access the probabilistic classifier to manipulate and trigger animations. While we have explored the use of danceON to enable learners to build culturally relevant artistic artifacts [5], we have yet to explore how we can teach AI and ML concepts and ethics through the use of the system. We investigate two research questions through the co-design of culturally sustaining AI/ML resources with teachers: RQ1) How can we authentically build on learners’ identities, cultural knowledge, and practices with dance as they build, explore, and critique ML and AI models and systems? RQ2) How can we leverage learners’ creative, embodied experiences with ML and AI to facilitate reflection and critique of CS and AI/ML within their communities and society more broadly? We focus on co-design as a method that facilitates sustainability through centering teachers’ values, ownership, and authentic contexts in the realization, implementation, and evaluation of learning designs [7]. Through co-designing curricular resources, we will develop a set of modules aligned with the AI4K12 guidelines [1] that builds our understanding of creating culturally sustaining educational resources to teach about AI and ethical design in ways that leverage the culturally situated, collaborative, and embodied nature of dance.},

In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.},

However, it remains unknown which factors affect its effectiveness in empowering learners to solve programming problems. Therefore, this study employed a quasi-experimental research design and used Python graphing in programming education as an example to investigate the factors influencing the effectiveness of learners in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving. Findings: AI literacy significantly influences learners’ effectiveness in using ChatGPT to solve problems, with AI awareness and AI usage being key factors. The knowledge base of programming language significantly affects learners’ effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to solve programming problems. Learners’ cognitive level of ChatGPT significantly influences their effectiveness in applying ChatGPT to problem-solving, while usage intention does not have a significant impact. However, learners’ intention to use ChatGPT significantly improves after application. Based on these findings, this study proposes that in the process of empowering education with Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) products, the focus on learners should shift from cultivating their AI usage to AI literacy, laying the foundation for empowering learning with AIGC products. It is suggested to shift from mastering specific knowledge to graph-based rules as a method for empowering learning with AIGC products. Additionally, the focus should shift from enhancing learners’ intention to use the technology to strengthen their technological awareness, thereby creating practical pathways for empowering learning with AIGC products. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In recent years, the applications of AIED have been gradually adopted to progress our understanding of students’ learning and enhance learning performance and experience. However, the adoption of AIED has led to increasing ethical risks and concerns regarding several aspects such as personal data and learner autonomy. Despite the recent announcement of guidelines for ethical and trustworthy AIED, the debate revolves around the key principles underpinning ethical AIED. This paper aims to explore whether there is a global consensus on ethical AIED by mapping and analyzing international organizations’ current policies and guidelines. In this paper, we first introduce the opportunities offered by AI in education and potential ethical issues. Then, thematic analysis was conducted to conceptualize and establish a set of ethical principles by examining and synthesizing relevant ethical policies and guidelines for AIED. We discuss each principle and associated implications for relevant educational stakeholders, including students, teachers, technology developers, policymakers, and institutional decision-makers. The proposed set of ethical principles is expected to serve as a framework to inform and guide educational stakeholders in the development and deployment of ethical and trustworthy AIED as well as catalyze future development of related impact studies in the field.},

To demonstrate this, we conducted different coding-related experiments with ChatGPT, including code generation from problem descriptions, pseudocode generation of algorithms from texts, and code correction. The generated codes are validated with an online judge system to evaluate their accuracy. In addition, we conducted several surveys with students and teachers to find out how ChatGPT supports programming learning and teaching. Finally, we present the survey results and analysis.},

Recently, users have played active roles in surfacing and mitigating harm from algorithmic bias. Despite being frequent users of AI, youth have been under-explored as potential contributors and stakeholders to the future of AI. We consider three notions that may be at the root of youth facing barriers to playing an active role in responsible AI, which are youth (1) cannot understand the technical aspects of AI, (2) cannot understand the ethical issues around AI, and (3) need protection from serious topics related to bias and injustice. In this study, we worked with youth (N = 30) in first through twelfth grade and parents (N = 6) to explore how youth can be part of identifying algorithmic bias and designing future systems to address problematic technology behavior. We found that youth are capable of identifying and articulating algorithmic bias, often in great detail. Participants suggested different ways users could give feedback for AI that reflects their values of diversity and inclusion. Youth who may have less experience with computing or exposure to societal structures can be supported by peers or adults with more of this knowledge, leading to critical conversations about fairer AI. This work illustrates youths' insights, suggesting that they should be integrated in building a future of responsible AI.},

In this position paper however, we advocate for an approach more informed by the AI itself - teaching early CS learners not only how to use the tools but also how to better understand them. Novice programmers leveraging AI-code-generation without proper understanding of syntax or logic can create "black box" code with significant security vulnerabilities.

We find that children draw from personal experiences when formulating AI problems; they assume voice and video capabilities, explore diverse machine learning approaches, and plan for error handling. Their ideas promote human involvement in AI, though some are drawn to more autonomous systems. Their designs prioritize values like capability, logic, helpfulness, responsibility, and obedience, and a preference for a comfortable life, family security, inner harmony, and excitement as end-states.

Drawing on research in psychology and cognitive science, and recent GenAI user studies, we illustrate how GenAI systems impose metacognitive demands on users, requiring a high degree of metacognitive monitoring and control. We propose these demands could be addressed by integrating metacognitive support strategies into GenAI systems, and by designing GenAI systems to reduce their metacognitive demand by targeting explainability and customizability.

However, while the future of genAI is taking form, there remain potentially harmful limitations, such as generation of outputs with misinformation and bias. We ran a workshop study focused on ChatGPT to explore middle school girls’ (N = 26) attitudes and reasoning about how genAI works. We focused on girls who are often disproportionately impacted by algorithmic bias. We found that: (1) middle school girls were initially overtrusting of genAI, (2) deliberate exposure to the limitations and mistakes of generative AI shifted this overtrust to disillusionment about genAI capabilities, though they were still optimistic for future possibilities of genAI, and (3) their ideas about school policy were nuanced. This work informs how children think about genAI like ChatGPT and its integration in learning settings.},

The aim of this paper is to distinguish the integrative review method from other review methods and to propose methodological strategies specific to the integrative review method to enhance the rigour of the process. Background. Recent evidence-based practice initiatives have increased the need for and the production of all types of reviews of the literature (integrative reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and qualitative reviews). The integrative review method is the only approach that allows for the combination of diverse methodologies (for example, experimental and non-experimental research), and has the potential to play a greater role in evidence-based practice for nursing. With respect to the integrative review method, strategies to enhance data collection and extraction have been developed; however, methods of analysis, synthesis, and conclusion drawing remain poorly formulated. Discussion. A modified framework for research reviews is presented to address issues specific to the integrative review method. Issues related to specifying the review purpose, searching the literature, evaluating data from primary sources, analysing data, and presenting the results are discussed. Data analysis methods of qualitative research are proposed as strategies that enhance the rigour of combining diverse methodologies as well as empirical and theoretical sources in an integrative review. Conclusion. An updated integrative review method has the potential to allow for diverse primary research methods to become a greater part of evidence-based practice initiatives.},

We begin with an overview of the AI4K12 Initiative, which is developing national guidelines for teaching AI in K-12, and briefly discuss each of the “Five Big Ideas in AI” that serve as the organizing framework for the guidelines. We then discuss the general format and structure of the guidelines and grade band progression charts and provide a theoretical framework that highlights the developmental appropriateness of the knowledge and skills we want to impart to students and the learning experiences we expect them to engage in. Development of the guidelines is informed by best practices from Learning Sciences and CS Education research, and by the need for alignment with CSTA’s K-12 Computer Science Standards, Common Core standards, and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The remainder of the article provides an in-depth exploration of the AI4K12 Big Idea 3 (Learning) grade band progression chart to unpack the concepts we expect students to master at each grade band. We present examples to illustrate the progressions from two perspectives: horizontal (across grade bands) and vertical (across concepts for a given grade band). Finally, we discuss how these guidelines can be used to create learning experiences that make connections across the Five Big Ideas, and free online tools that facilitate these experiences.},

            The influence of Artificial Intelligence on higher education is increasing. As important drivers for student retention and learning success, generative AI-tools like translators, paraphrasers and most lately chatbots can support students in their learning processes. The perceptions and expectations of first-years students related to AI-tools have not yet been researched in-depth. The same can be stated about necessary requirements and skills for the purposeful use of AI-tools. The research work examines the relationship between first-year students’ knowledge, skills and attitudes and their use of AI-tools for their learning processes. Analysing the data of 634 first-year students revealed that attitudes towards AI significantly explains the intended use of AI tools. Additionally, the perceived benefits of AI-technology are predictors for students’ perception of AI-robots as cooperation partners for humans. Educators in higher education must facilitate students’ AI competencies and integrate AI-tools into instructional designs. As a result, students learning processes will be improved.},

Using Amos version 23 structural equation modelling and 880 student survey responses, the suggested model was empirically tested. According to the report, students think well of ChatGPT utilization in the classroom. Credibility, Usefulness and ease of use, all influence how positively people feel about using this technology in a classroom setting. The study's findings, however, did not support the notion that students' adoption and use of ChatGPT was insignificantly influenced by perceived enjoyment. Moreover, the results conclude that attitude mediates the relationship between usefulness and intention to use ChatGPT. The research will help businesses, educational institutions, and the global community by providing insight into how students view the ChatGPT service within a learning environment. Additionally, the application boosts learners' confidence and interest, which improves general awareness and literacy. Finally, the research will facilitate developers of AI in the betterment of their product and service delivery and regulators in regulating the use of AI-based bots. Owing to its recentness, there is not much study currently available on ChatGPT use in education. This research adds significantly to the extant knowledge on the adoption of advanced education technologies by examining the adoption characteristics of ChatGPT, a novel AI-based tool involving students. Additionally, there is a dearth of research in the literature on students' adoption of ChatGPT for educational purposes.

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This study explores the Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception (KAP) towards ChatGPT among university students and faculty. It also examines the faculty’s readiness to cope with the challenges and leverage the opportunities presented by AI-powered conversational models. 

Background: Launched on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT took the world by storm with its capability to generate high-quality written expressions in a conversational manner. The reactions to this innovation varied, from enthusiasm regarding its potential to enrich students’ learning to concerns about its threat to students’ cognitive development and academic integrity. A systematic exploration of students’ and faculty’s KAP towards ChatGPT can play an important role in addressing the multifaceted dimensions of AI-driven conversational models.

Methodology: This study employs a cross-sectional survey research design based on questionnaires distributed to 145 faculty members, as well as 855 undergraduate and graduate students at the ESPRIT School of Engineering and School of Business. The student sample was based on stratified and convenience sampling, while the faculty sample was based on a consensus sampling approach.

Contribution: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study that contributes to understanding the KAP of students and faculty towards ChatGPT, as well as the readiness of faculty to effectively adopt AI-driven conversational models. Furthermore, our research contributes to the body of knowledge by taking Vygotsky’s (1978) principle of social interaction and its role in promoting cognitive development to a new level by hypothesizing that if students were to acquire the competencies to actively engage with AI-driven chatbots in meaningful discussions and collaborative conversations, they might be able to develop some higher-order thinking skills further.

Findings: Our results indicated that faculty demonstrated a higher level of ChatGPT knowledge than students and that more than 40\% of surveyed students and faculty expressed some trust in the reliability of ChatGPT’s responses, a perception that does not align with reality. Faculty attitude towards ChatGPT was comparatively more reserved compared to that of students and showcased varying opinions. Furthermore, the surveyed faculty showcased a more negative perception of ChatGPT than students, and they expressed a greater degree of skepticism. Our research revealed that 63.4\% of surveyed faculty reported that they lack the requisite training and resources to integrate ChatGPT into their pedagogical practices.

Recommendations for Practitioners: HEIs should take appropriate measures to enhance students’ and faculty’s knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding ChatGPT to stimulate ethical, meaningful, innovative, and engaging interactions and learning experiences.

Recommendation for Researchers: Our study has shed light on some moderating factors that shape the acceptance of AI-driven conversational models and some adoption barriers. It delves into the perceptions, biases, and misconceptions held by both students and faculty, thereby providing a basis for future investigations on the effective integration of AI-driven conversational models in higher education.

Impact on Society: This research provides new insights that can harness the potential merits of ChatGPT in enhancing students’ learning while mitigating potential pitfalls. It suggests facilitating open forums and dialogues among students, faculty, employers, and other key stakeholders to debate the impact of AI-driven conversational models on students’ learning and faculty’s teaching and assessment.  

Future Research: We invite researchers to conduct cross-cultural studies on this topic while also taking into consideration a qualitative research design approach. Future research can also test the hypothesis that AI-driven conversational models inhibit critical thinking by facilitating the passive consumption of information.},

              Background
              The number of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy studies in K‐12 education has recently increased, with most research focusing on primary and secondary education contexts. Little research focuses on AI literacy programs in early childhood education.
            
            
              Objectives
              The aim of this mixed‐methods study is to examine the feasibility of an AI literacy program called “AI4KG” and explore how it might affect kindergarteners' perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A total of 26 child–parent dyads recruited from a Hong Kong kindergarten were involved in this study, consisting of 26 children (
                M
                age
                 = 4 years, SD = 0.28) and their parents. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys and interviews designed to explore children's perceptions of robots and attitudes towards engineering and science, and parents' perceptions of the AI4KG intervention.
              
            
            
              Results
              It is found that children have increased their perceptions of robots after the AI literacy program, but the AI4KG curriculum had no significant effects on kindergarten children's engineering and science attitudes. Most parents (22 out of 26) agreed that their children's AI knowledge, AI skills, and AI attitudes have been enhanced after learning through the AI4KG curriculum.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study suggests that the AI4KG curriculum is potentially effective in promoting early AI literacy and favourable attitudes towards the technology, but further research is needed to develop age‐appropriate measures and assess its long‐term impact on children's education and career paths.

                    It evaluates an 8‐week AI literacy curriculum called AI4KG for kindergarteners in Hong Kong.
                  
                  
                    The curriculum used tools like Teachable Machine and taught concepts through play and storytelling.
                  
                  
                    It improved children's perceptions of robots but did not significantly impact engineering/science attitudes.
                  
                  
                    Parents perceived improvements in children's AI knowledge, skills, and attitudes after the curriculum.

                    The curriculum provides an example for developing age‐appropriate AI literacy activities.
                  
                  
                    More rigorous research on impacts over time is needed, but results suggest potential benefits of AI literacy in early childhood.

However, current AI curricula have not yet been made accessible and engaging enough for students and schools from all socio-economic backgrounds with different educational goals. In this work, we developed an open-source learning module for college and high school students, which allows students to build their own robot companion from the ground up. This open platform can be used to provide hands-on experience and introductory knowledge about various aspects of AI, including robotics, machine learning (ML), software engineering, and mechanical engineering. Because of the social and personal nature of a socially assistive robot companion, this module also puts a special emphasis on human-centered AI, enabling students to develop a better understanding of human-AI interaction and AI ethics through hands-on learning activities. With open-source documentation, assembling manuals and affordable materials, students from different socio-economic backgrounds can personalize their learning experience based on their individual educational goals. To evaluate the student-perceived quality of our module, we conducted a usability testing workshop with 15 college students recruited from a minority-serving institution. Our results indicate that our AI module is effective, easy-to-follow, and engaging, and it increases student interest in studying AI/ML and robotics in the future. We hope that this work will contribute toward accessible and engaging AI education in human-AI interaction for college and high school students.},

They learned about representation through work with neural network playgrounds. Students engaged in supervised learning of an image processing model and used the model to control the actions of a robot car. Natural interactions and societal impacts were assessed as students observed the robot car's behavior. 
Results demonstrate that our curriculum was successful in achieving its objectives. Excluding the robot car kit, the curriculum was created using free platforms and tools. This program could be replicated in informal settings by any educator or collaborator with a computer science background.

            The present discussion examines the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings, focusing on the necessity for AI literacy, prompt engineering proficiency, and enhanced critical thinking skills. The introduction of AI into education marks a significant departure from conventional teaching methods, offering personalized learning and support for diverse educational requirements, including students with special needs. However, this integration presents challenges, including the need for comprehensive educator training and curriculum adaptation to align with societal structures. AI literacy is identified as crucial, encompassing an understanding of AI technologies and their broader societal impacts. Prompt engineering is highlighted as a key skill for eliciting specific responses from AI systems, thereby enriching educational experiences and promoting critical thinking. There is detailed analysis of strategies for embedding these skills within educational curricula and pedagogical practices. This is discussed through a case-study based on a Swiss university and a narrative literature review, followed by practical suggestions of how to implement AI in the classroom.},

              Background
              As the significance of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to increase, there is a need for effective scaffolding and support for novice learners. Educators have encountered challenges in effectively scaffolding novice learners AI concepts, and providing appropriate motivational support. Research evidence has shown the potential of game‐based approaches to fostering secondary school students' AI literacy and motivation to learn AI.
            
            
              Objectives
              This study developed an online platform TreasureIsland to gamify ebooks and investigated whether and how students playing with it can effectively enhance their AI literacy. This study aims to contribute an empirical and theoretical basis for AI literacy education and promote the use of gamification that would be broadly applied in other schools.
            
            
              Methods
              A quasi‐experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of the proposed gamified approach, which included a control group using an ebook with playful resources. To triangulate the quantitative results obtained from the pre and post‐test, focus group interviews were also conducted.
            
            
              Results
              The platform was effective in improving students' motivation, self‐efficacy, career interest, and understanding of AI concepts and ethics, but did not enhance their confidence of using AI, and high cognition of applying, evaluating and creating AI. TreasureIsland players demonstrated significant improvement in all affective and cognitive domains, except for the ability to apply, evaluate, and create AI. Interviews revealed that the gamified approach could promote students' AI literacy by adhering to guidelines, including (1) creating a competitive and motivating learning environment through game mechanics, (2) providing scaffolding modules and feedback, and (3) visualising complex AI concepts via simulations. Feedback collected from the study suggested adding pedagogical elements such as flipped classrooms and project‐based learning in future research to improve the instructional design, and enable students to reach a higher level of cognition.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study concludes that the use of gamification can provide affective and cognitive support and an enjoyable experience for fostering learners' AI literacy. It helps instructional designers and teachers enrich the pedagogical knowledge related to gamified platform and AI literacy.

              What is already known about this topic
              
                
                  
                    AI literacy is considered as an important digital literacy skill that many secondary schools started to incorporate AI in computer/STEAM curricula.
                  
                  
                    Game‐based approach has been incorporated to foster students' AI literacy and knowledge.
                  
                  
                    Gamification is increasingly used to enhance students' digital literacy skills and learning motivation.
                  
                
              
            
            
              What this paper adds
              
                
                  
                    We designed a platform to gamify ebooks and compared the effects using merely ebook using a mixed‐methods case study design.
                  
                  
                    Gamifying ebooks can lead to improvement in AI literacy, affective and cognitive engagement.
                  
                  
                    While this pedagogy fostered students' AI knowledge and understanding, it cannot effectively enhance students' higher cognition skills.
                  
                
              
            
            
              Implications for practice and/or policy
              
                
                  
                    We synthesised the evidence that shows the effectiveness of gamification to foster students' learning motivation, basic understanding of AI knowledge and ethics.
                  
                  
                    We updated the AI literacy framework and explored the relations between students' engagement, and AI knowledge.
                  
                  
                    This study proposed a meaningful measure of AI literacy development through considering affective and cognitive domains.},

              Current knowledge and research on students’ utilization and interaction with generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their academic work is limited. This study aims to investigate students’ engagement with these tools.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This research used survey-based research to investigate generative AI literacy (utilization, interaction, evaluation of output and ethics) among students enrolled in a four-year public university in the southeastern USA. This article focuses on the respondents who have used generative AI (218; 47.2\%).
            
            
              Findings
              Most respondents used generative AI to generate ideas for papers, projects or assignments, and they also used AI to assist with their original ideas. Despite their use of AI assistance, most students were critical of generative AI output, and this mindset was reflected in their reported interactions with ChatGPT.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought convenience to human lives, but its pervasive impact extends beyond individuals, affecting society as a whole. Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI. The implications of this study are significant for the field of AI education.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly pervaded and reshaped almost all walks of life, but efforts to promote AI literacy in K-12 schools remain limited. There is a knowledge gap in how to prepare teachers to teach AI literacy in inclusive classrooms and how teacher-led classroom implementations can impact students. This paper reports a comparison study to investigate the effectiveness of an AI literacy curriculum when taught by classroom teachers. The experimental group included 89 middle school students who learned an AI literacy curriculum during regular school hours. The comparison group consisted of 69 students who did not learn the curriculum. Both groups completed the same pre and post-test. The results show that students in the experimental group developed a deeper understanding of AI concepts and more positive attitudes toward AI and its impact on future careers after the curriculum than those in the comparison group. This shows that the teacher-led classroom implementation successfully equipped students with a conceptual understanding of AI. Students achieved significant gains in recognizing how AI is relevant to their lives and felt empowered to thrive in the age of AI. Overall this study confirms the potential of preparing K-12 classroom teachers to offer AI education in classrooms in order to reach learners of diverse backgrounds and broaden participation in AI literacy education among young learners.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is at the top of the agenda for education today in developing learners' AI knowledge, skills, attitudes and values in the 21st century. However, there are few validated research instruments for educators to examine how secondary students develop and perceive their learning outcomes. After reviewing the literature on AI literacy questionnaires, we categorized the identified competencies in four dimensions: (1) affective learning (intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy/confidence), (2) behavioural learning (behavioural commitment and collaboration), (3) cognitive learning (know and understand; apply, evaluate and create) and (4) ethical learning. Then, a 32-item self-reported questionnaire on AI literacy (AILQ) was developed and validated to measure students' literacy development in the four dimensions. The design and validation of AILQ were examined through theoretical review, expert judgement, interview, pilot study and first- and second-order confirmatory factor analysis. This article reports the findings of a pilot study using a preliminary version of the AILQ among 363 secondary school students in Hong Kong to analyse the psychometric properties of the instrument. Results indicated a four-factor structure of the AILQ and revealed good reliability and validity. The AILQ is recommended as a reliable measurement scale for assessing how secondary students foster their AI literacy and inform better instructional design based on the proposed affective, behavioural, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) learning framework. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic AI literacy has drawn increasing attention in recent years and has been identified as an important digital literacy. Schools and universities around the world started to incorporate AI into their curriculum to foster young learners' AI literacy. Some studies have worked to design suitable measurement tools, especially questionnaires, to examine students' learning outcomes in AI learning programmes. What this paper adds Develops an AI literacy questionnaire (AILQ) to evaluate students' literacy development in terms of affective, behavioural, cognitive and ethical (ABCE) dimensions. Proposes a parsimonious model based on the ABCE framework and addresses a skill set of AI literacy. Implications for practice and/or policy Researchers are able to use the AILQ as a guide to measure students' AI literacy. Practitioners are able to use the AILQ to assess students' AI literacy development.},

	abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the manufacturing sector introduces new challenges and demands for the engineering workforce in the evolving European economy. This paper investigates how advancements in AI tools, especially in manufacturing, necessitate a shift in engineering education to equip graduates with relevant skills and ethical understanding. While AI is not new to manufacturing, its ongoing development and increased accessibility bring forth fresh challenges related to required competencies and ethical considerations. Furthermore, this work explores the potential of incorporating recent AI tools, such as ChatGPT and other generative adversarial networks, into engineering education. This is illustrated through a case study of a master’s level digitalization course. In this course, AI tools aimed to help students bridge their programming knowledge gaps and educate them on ethical AI use, providing a model adaptable to lifelong learning courses in the field. This inquiry also addresses the broader concerns related to AI misuse in academic settings and the subsequent difficulties in plagiarism detection and accurate learning outcome assessment. The discussion does not argue against AI adoption but emphasizes managing its inadvertent impacts on the industry and society. By integrating emerging technologies and their ethical use into the curriculum, the engineering education system can better align with the shifting demands of the workforce in an increasingly digitalized manufacturing landscape.},

Efforts are underway, such as those by the AI4K12 initiative, to establish guidelines for organizing K- 12 AI education; however, effective instructional resources are needed by educators. In this paper, we describe our work to design, develop, and implement an unplugged activity centered on facial recognition technology for middle school students. Facial recognition is integrated into a wide range of applications throughout daily life, which makes it a familiar and engaging tool for students and an effective medium for conveying AI concepts. Our unplugged activity, “Guess Whose Face,” is designed as a board game that focuses on Representation and Reasoning from AI4K12’s 5 Big Ideas in AI. The game is crafted to enable students to develop AI competencies naturally through physical interaction. In the game, one student uses tracing paper to extract facial features from a familiar face shown on a card, such as a cartoon character or celebrity, and then other students try to guess the identity of the hidden face. We discuss details of the game, its iterative refinement, and initial findings from piloting the activity during a summer camp for rural middle school students.},

            Generative artificial intelligence provides both opportunities and challenges for higher education. Existing literature has not properly investigated how this technology would impact assessment in higher education. This scoping review took a forward-thinking approach to investigate how generative artificial intelligence transforms assessment in higher education. We used the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews to select articles for review and report the results. In the screening, we retrieved 969 articles and selected 32 empirical studies for analysis. Most of the articles were published in 2023. We used three levels—students, teachers, and institutions—to analyses the articles. Our results suggested that assessment should be transformed to cultivate students’ self-regulated learning skills, responsible learning, and integrity. To successfully transform assessment in higher education, the review suggested that (i) teacher professional development activities for assessment, AI, and digital literacy should be provided, (ii) teachers’ beliefs about human and AI assessment should be strengthened, and (iii) teachers should be innovative and holistic in their teaching to reflect the assessment transformation. Educational institutions are recommended to review and rethink their assessment policies, as well as provide more inter-disciplinary programs and teaching.},

To help classroom teachers address this, we introduce Prompty, a specialized teaching tool co-designed to facilitate both critical and effective use of LLMs. Prompty serves multiple learning goals: it allows students to critically evaluate text generated by LLMs, aids in their writing practice, and provides a deeper understanding of how LLMs function—all within a student-friendly environment secured by essential guardrails. Prompty was co-designed in collaboration with high school teachers as part of CRAFT, an initiative by Stanford University to promote AI literacy. It was pilot-tested in a high school English class to serve as an AI writing assistant, focusing on the critical evaluation of machine-generated text. This trial yielded preliminary evidence that attests to the tool's effectiveness in fulfilling its educational goals. The findings from the pilot study indicate that easy-to-use tools like Prompty have great potential. These tools can be adapted to fit the goals of individual teachers. They can help in achieving subject-specific learning goals while serving as an effective way to teach AI concepts in high school.},

            In recent years, the European Union has advanced towards responsible and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, development and innovation. While the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI released in 2019 and the AI Act in 2021 set the starting point for a European Ethical AI, there are still several challenges to translate such advances into the public debate, education and practical learning. This paper contributes towards closing this gap by reviewing the approaches that can be found in the existing literature and by interviewing 11 experts across five countries to help define educational strategies, competencies and resources needed for the successful implementation of Trustworthy AI in Higher Education (HE) and to reach students from all disciplines. The findings are presented in the form of recommendations both for educators and policy incentives, translating the guidelines into HE teaching and practice, so that the next generation of young people can contribute to an ethical, safe and cutting-edge AI made in Europe.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to propose a taxonomy of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy to support AI literacy education and research.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study makes use of the facet analysis technique and draws upon various sources of data and information to develop a taxonomy of AI literacy. The research consists of the following key steps: a comprehensive review of the literature published on AI literacy research, an examination of well-known AI classification schemes and taxonomies, a review of prior research on data/information/digital literacy research and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 1,031 metadata records on AI literacy publications. The KH Coder 3 software application was used to analyse metadata records from the Scopus multidisciplinary database.
            
            
              Findings
              A new taxonomy of AI literacy is proposed with 13 high-level facets and a list of specific subjects for each facet.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The proposed taxonomy may serve as a conceptual AI literacy framework to support the critical understanding, use, application and examination of AI-enhanced tools and technologies in various educational and organizational contexts.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The proposed taxonomy provides a knowledge organization and knowledge mapping structure to support curriculum development and the organization of digital information.
            
            
              Social implications
              The proposed taxonomy provides a cross-disciplinary perspective of AI literacy. It can be used, adapted, modified or enhanced to accommodate education and learning opportunities and curricula in different domains, disciplines and subject areas.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The proposed AI literacy taxonomy offers a new and original conceptual framework that builds on a variety of different sources of data and integrates literature from various disciplines, including computing, information science, education and literacy research.},

	abstract = {The growing impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on Humanity is unavoidable, and therefore, “AI literacy” is extremely important. In the field of education—AI in education (AIED)—this technology is having a huge impact on the educational community and on the education system itself. The present study seeks to assess the level of AI literacy and knowledge among teachers at Portalegre Polytechnic University (PPU), aiming to identify gaps, find the main opportunities for innovation and development, and seek the degree of relationship between the dimensions of an AI questionnaire, as well as identifying the predictive variables in this matter. As a measuring instrument, a validated questionnaire based on three dimensions (AI Literacy, AI Self-Efficacy, and AI Self-Management) was applied to a sample of 75 teachers in the various schools of PPU. This revealed an average level of AI literacy (3.28), highlighting that 62.4\% of responses are at levels 3 and 4 (based on a Likert scale from 1 to 5). The results also demonstrate that the first dimension is highly significant for the total dimensions, i.e., for AI Literacy, and no factor characterizing the sample is a predictor, but finding a below-average result in the learning factor indicates a pressing need to focus on developing these skills.},

In this study, we explored tensions in teachers’ and students’ opinions about what constitutes learning and cheating with AI. Using qualitative methods, we asked Pre-K through postsecondary writing teachers (n = 16) and a linguistically diverse group of students (n = 12) to consider examples of how students might use ChatGPT, rank them in order of how much they thought each student learned and cheated, and explain their rankings. Our study yielded three findings. First, teachers and students used similar criteria to determine their rankings. Second, teachers and students arrived at similar conclusions about learning with ChatGPT but different conclusions about cheating. Finally, disagreements centered on four main tensions between (1) using ChatGPT as a shortcut versus as a scaffold; (2) using ChatGPT to generate ideas versus language; (3) getting support from ChatGPT versus analogous support from other sources; and (4) learning from ChatGPT versus learning without. These findings underscore the importance of student voice in co-constructing norms around responsible AI use.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This study aims to investigate the perceptions of programming instructors among the Information Technology faculty members at AL al-Bayt University regarding the effectiveness of ChatGPT in supporting the programming instructional process. This study also aims to explore their experiences concerning the potential benefits and adverse impacts of such technology on students and instructors.

Background: Successfully integrating ChatGPT into programming instruction requires addressing its advantages, disadvantages, and concerns of such emerging AI-based technology. However, balancing the advantages and disadvantages, as well as addressing the concerns of using ChatGPT, poses critical challenges. This research posits that the appropriate use of ChatGPT for programming instruction, along with a careful weighing of its potential benefits against potential negative impacts, presents a promising solution and is essential for its success. However, little is known about integrating ChatGPT into programming instructional methods and their possible effects because of insufficient results from the literature for generalization. Pedagogical designs considering teaching strategies and appropriate measures should be added to the literature on integrating AI chatbots for programming instruction.

Methodology: The research data were collected in this study through in-depth interviews with programming instructors from the School of Information Technology at AL al-Bayt University. A qualitative research design was adopted in this study to arrive at in-depth perceptions of IT programming instructors on integrating ChatGPT into programming instruction. Convenience sampling was used to select 12 programming instructors among IT faculty members who had familiarity with ChatGPT during their programming instruction experience. A total of 26 one-on-one interviews with the participants were conducted personally to elicit detailed and precise information on the advantages and disadvantages of using ChatGPT for programming instruction. Each interview consisted of questions that aimed to investigate the opinions and experiences of programming instructors on ChatGPT’s potential and capabilities to complement traditional teaching methods, enhance students’ programming learning, and support instructors in their instruction. The data were accurately read and coded to identify relevant themes and patterns from the participants’ answers to the research questions. A qualitative thematic analysis was conducted to analyze the collected transcribed data through participant interviews. 

Contribution: This study is the first to focus on the perceptions of programming instructors and contributes to the ongoing discourse on the integration of AI, particularly ChatGPT, in programming education. The contribution lies in highlighting the positive and negative aspects of using ChatGPT and discussing the potential complementary role of ChatGPT alongside traditional teaching methods. The participants’ perceptions reported by this study provide valuable insights and evidence that could serve as a guide for the programming instructional process.

Findings: The perceptions result in this study demonstrated several advantages of ChatGPT that make it useful for the programming instruction process, including practical code applications, personalized and interactive learning, a wide range of programming problems and alternative solutions, accessibility, no programming knowledge required, debugging and feedback capabilities, and clear code explanations. Indeed, the perceptions of the participants revealed that ChatGPT can enhance students’ learning by providing personalized and interactive programming practices, assisting them in coding and program writing, helping them practice the best solutions for real-life programming problems, and creating their own programs and solutions. The participants’ perceptions also revealed the ability of ChatGPT to support the efficiency of programming instructors and save their time and effort by providing new instructional practices, helping address the individual learning needs of their students, assisting in performance assessment, and recommending lesson plans and teaching strategies. By contrast, several perceptions on the potential drawbacks and negatives of using ChatGPT in programming education were reported, including inaccurate responses, undesired responses, response integrity, limited programming resources, technology limitation, unstructured learning, and a lack of real programming elements. Similarly, several concerns were revealed, including ethical and transparent use, privacy and security of students’ data, social impact and replacement of human interaction, over-reliance, and controlling students’ online behavior. Overall, the participants suggested a complementary role for ChatGPT that balances its potential benefits against its negative impacts to best enhance traditional programming teaching methods. 

Recommendations for Practitioners: The perceptions recommend practitioners develop new teaching strategies, curriculum designs, in-class activities, and course outlines for programming curricula incorporating ChatGPT efficiently. Practitioners also need to mitigate the adverse effects of ChatGPT and embrace such AI technologies rather than banning them in several ways. Additional effort is required from instructors to assign programming tasks that require applying programming knowledge and critical thinking instead of simple or trivial tasks that can be obtained directly. Instructors and students should be upskilling their competencies and practices to meet the critical thinking and question-asking competencies required to satisfy the new demands of AI technology with appropriate support from their institutes. IT faculties need to adopt a teaching approach with a complementary role for ChatGPT that balances its potential benefits against its negative impacts to best enhance traditional programming teaching methods and maximize its benefits for students and instructors.

Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers need to understand the factors enhancing the integration of ChatGPT and the ways of designing and implementing teaching strategies compatible with such AI technologies. Researchers are recommended to explore the impact of ChatGPT on other learners and subjects and its effects on their critical thinking and creativity. 

Impact on Society: The perceptions in this study are helpful for instructors, students, and curriculum developers, provide additional knowledge on integrating AI chatbots into their courses, and offer valuable input for developing effective use of AI in programming instruction and pedagogical practices. The perceptions could positively influence the job market and contribute to the development of human capital by equipping learners with the latest technologies and programming technologies.

Future Research: Additional research should be conducted to explore and measure the effect of ChatGPT on students’ engagement and class collaboration. Further experimental studies on other topics in different environmental variables are also recommended.},

At this time, there is no valid and reliable measurement tool that can be used to assess AI-learning gains. However, the existence of such a tool would be important to enable quality assurance and comparability. In this study, a validated AI-literacy-assessment instrument, the “scale for the assessment of non-experts’ AI literacy” (SNAIL) was adapted and used to evaluate an undergraduate AI course. We investigated whether the scale can be used to reliably evaluate AI courses and whether mediator variables, such as attitudes toward AI or participation in other AI courses, had an influence on learning gains. In addition to the traditional mean comparisons (i.e., t-tests), the comparative self-assessment (CSA) gain was calculated, which allowed for a more meaningful assessment of the increase in AI literacy. We found preliminary evidence that the adapted SNAIL questionnaire enables a valid evaluation of AI-learning gains. In particular, distinctions among different subconstructs and the differentiation constructs, such as attitudes toward AI, seem to be possible with the help of the SNAIL questionnaire.},

The results of regression analysis indicate a positive association between the inclination to utilize ChatGPT for enhancing one's community and proficiency in information literacy and privacy literacy. However, an unexpected observation emerges as data literacy skills do not exhibit a significant relationship with this inclination, despite ChatGPT's standing as a data science innovation. Moreover, age, gender, educational attainment, and internet usage patterns are identified as influential factors in these associations. These findings hold substantial importance in comprehending the intricate dynamics of how diverse literacies and individual and community-related variables mutually shape each other's development.},

            The emergence of increasingly powerful AI technologies calls for the design and development of K-12 AI literacy curricula that can support students who will be entering a profoundly changed labor market. However, developing, implementing, and scaling AI literacy curricula poses significant challenges. It will be essential to develop a robust, evidence-based AI education research foundation that can inform AI literacy curriculum development. Unlike K-12 science and mathematics education, there is not currently a research foundation for K-12 AI education. In this article we provide a component-based definition of AI literacy, present the need for implementing AI literacy education across all grade bands, and argue for the creation of research programs across four areas of AI education: (1) K-12 AI Learning \& Technology; (2) K-12 AI Education Integration into STEM, Language Arts, and Social Science Education; (3) K-12 AI Professional Development for Teachers and Administrators; and (4) K-12 AI Assessment.},

In a notable development in 2022, South Korea took a pioneering step by overhauling its curriculum with a primary focus on enhancing students' AI skills. However, despite these efforts, a persistent challenge remains: many students continue to harbor unfavorable perceptions and attitudes toward AI. The existing educational methods have proven insufficient in addressing this issue. Consequently, this study embarked on a quest to identify effective strategies for cultivating a more positive outlook on AI among middle school students. To tackle this challenge head-on, an experiential learning-based AI education program was meticulously designed and implemented for middle school students in Korea. The study rigorously evaluated the program's impact on students' attitudes toward AI. The results unveiled a significant improvement in students' perceptions of AI following the intervention, providing solid empirical evidence of the efficacy of the experiential learning-based AI education program in reshaping middle school students' attitudes toward AI. This research underscores the paramount importance of practical, hands-on experiences in education as a potent means to bridge the gap between knowledge and perception. It offers invaluable insights that can guide the development of AI education curricula worldwide, emphasizing the indispensable role of experiential learning approaches in nurturing positive attitudes and beliefs about AI among students.},

              Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing many industries and becoming increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life. To empower children growing up with AI to navigate society’s evolving sociotechnical context, we developed three middle school AI literacy curricula:
              Creative AI, Dancing with AI,
              and
              How to Train Your Robot.
              In this paper we discuss how we leveraged three design principles—active learning, embedded ethics, and low barriers to access – to effectively engage students in learning to create and critique AI artifacts. During the summer of 2020, we recruited and trained in-service, middle school teachers from across the United States to co-instruct online workshops with students from their schools. In the workshops, a combination of hands-on unplugged and programming activities facilitated students’ understanding of AI. As students explored technical concepts in tandem with ethical ones, they developed a critical lens to better grasp how AI systems work and how they impact society. We sought to meet the specified needs of students from a range of backgrounds by minimizing the prerequisite knowledge and technology resources students needed to participate. Finally, we conclude with lessons learned and design recommendations for future AI curricula, especially for K-12 in-person and virtual learning.},

In this paper, we introduce the “AI Course Design Planning Framework” as a course planning framework to structure the development of domain-specific AI courses at the university level. The tool evolves non-specific course planning frameworks to address the context of domain-specific AI education. Following a design-based research approach, we evaluated a first prototype of the tool with instructors in the field of AI education who are developing domain-specific courses in this area. The results of our evaluation indicate that the tool allows instructors to create domain-specific AI courses in an efficient and comprehensible way. In general, instructors rated the tool as useful and user-friendly and made recommendations to improve its usability. Future research will focus on testing the application of the tool for domain-specific AI course developments in different domain contexts and examine the influence of using the tool on AI course quality and learning outcomes.},

After reviewing the literature on AI literacy projects, we found that most educational practices in this area are based on teaching programming fundamentals, primarily to K-12 students. This leaves out citizens and those who are primarily interested in understanding the implications of automated decision- making systems, rather than in learning to code. To address these gaps, this article explores the methodological contributions of responsible AI education practices that focus first on stakeholders when designing learning experiences for different audiences and contexts. The article examines the weaknesses identified in current AI literacy projects, explains the stakeholder-first approach, and analyzes several responsible AI education case studies, to illustrate how such an approach can help overcome the aforementioned limitations. The results suggest that the stakeholder-first approach allows to address audiences beyond the usual ones in the field of AI literacy, and to incorporate new content and methodologies depending on the needs of the respective audiences, thus opening new avenues for teaching and research in the field.},

            This study explores university students’ perceptions of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on familiarity, their willingness to engage, potential benefits and challenges, and effective integration. A survey of 399 undergraduate and postgraduate students from various disciplines in Hong Kong revealed a generally positive attitude towards GenAI in teaching and learning. Students recognized the potential for personalized learning support, writing and brainstorming assistance, and research and analysis capabilities. However, concerns about accuracy, privacy, ethical issues, and the impact on personal development, career prospects, and societal values were also expressed. According to John Biggs’ 3P model, student perceptions significantly influence learning approaches and outcomes. By understanding students’ perceptions, educators and policymakers can tailor GenAI technologies to address needs and concerns while promoting effective learning outcomes. Insights from this study can inform policy development around the integration of GenAI technologies into higher education. By understanding students’ perceptions and addressing their concerns, policymakers can create well-informed guidelines and strategies for the responsible and effective implementation of GenAI tools, ultimately enhancing teaching and learning experiences in higher education.},

	abstract = {Recent studies demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can discriminate based on classes like race and gender. In this work, we present an approach to evaluate bias present in automated facial analysis algorithms and datasets with respect to phenotypic subgroups. Using the dermatologist  approved Fitzpatrick Skin Type classification system, we characterize the gender and skin type distribution of two facial analysis benchmarks, IJB-A and Adience. We find that these datasets are overwhelmingly composed of lighter-skinned subjects (79.6\% for IJB-A and 86.2\% for Adience) and introduce a new facial analysis dataset which is balanced by gender and skin type. We evaluate 3 commercial gender classification systems using our dataset and show that darker-skinned females are the most misclassified group (with error rates of up to 34.7\%). The maximum error rate for lighter-skinned males is 0.8\%. The substantial disparities in the accuracy of classifying darker females, lighter females, darker males, and lighter males in gender classification systems require urgent attention if commercial companies are to build genuinely fair, transparent and accountable facial analysis algorithms.},

Such a discipline requires moving beyond a conceptual framework to a multilevel competency model with associated competency assessments. This approach to an AI Literacy could guide future development of instructional content as we prepare a range of groups (i.e., consumers, coworkers, collaborators, and creators). We propose here a research matrix as an initial step in the development of a roadmap for AI Literacy research, which requires a systematic and coordinated effort with the support of publication outlets and research funding, to expand the areas of competency and assessments.},

On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 18 existing peer‐reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e, know and understand, use, evaluate, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy.},

Informal learning spaces like museums are particularly well-suited for such public science communication efforts, but there is little research investigating how to design AI learning experiences for these spaces. This paper explores how to design museum experiences that communicate key concepts about AI, using collaboration, creativity, and embodiment as inspirations for design. We present the design of five low-fidelity AI literacy exhibit prototypes and results from a thematic analysis of participant interactions during a co-design workshop in which family groups interacted with the prototypes and designed exhibits of their own. Our findings suggest new topics and design considerations for AI-related exhibits and directions for future research.},

We introduce three key roles related to Data and AI Literacy: the informed prosumer, the skilled user, and the expert creator. Moreover, we argue that Data and AI Awareness as the lowest level of understanding and recognizing is a necessary prerequisite but not a sufficient condition to Data and AI Literacy. We rather equate Data and AI Literacy with Data and AI Readiness. Further work will focus on defining the core knowledge, skills and competences of the taxonomy.},

	abstract = {Analysis of recent research and publications has shown that there is a serious problem in Ukrainian society regarding the use of artificial intelligence. The analysis of ZN.UA survey data showed that the majority of respondents do not know what artificial intelligence is and do not use it. Therefore, there are certain prejudices regarding the use of artificial intelligence in education. The concept of “artificial intelligence literacy” as a component of digital competence needs further research. Literacy in the field of artificial intelligence can be the basis for creating methods of using artificial intelligence in secondary education in Ukraine. The article presents the main components of literacy in the field of artificial intelligence. The author proposes to adapt the experience of digital story writing to the secondary education of Ukraine. At the same time, digital storytelling involves the use of artificial intelligence services as aids. It is shown that the toolkit of the European cloud of open science contains not only cloud services of open science, but also services of artificial intelligence (which are both cloud-based and based on the principles of open science). For example, the basic principles of working with the artificial intelligence service AI-GeoSpecies (included in the European cloud of open science) are considered. Within the framework of the performed research, an intermediate section of the ascertaining stage of the pedagogical experiment was conducted. It was found that teachers need further professional development measures on the topic of using artificial intelligence services. There is a need to create methods for secondary education using artificial intelligence in the educational process. The attitude of teachers towards artificial intelligence services is positive. Educators have repeatedly used artificial intelligence and know the interpretation of this term. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.},

The design of the curriculum was guided by the following pedagogical goals: (1) to respond to the capacity-building need for critical sociotechnical competencies in AI workforce pathways; and (2) to broaden participation in AI pathways through intentional instructional design to center equity in learning experiences. We provide an overview of the 30-hour learning sequence’s instructional design, and our “4D Framework,” which we use as a heuristic to help students conceptualize and inspect AI systems. We then provide a focused description of one of three 8-hour modules that make up the sequence. Finally, we present evidence of promise from an exploratory study of TechHive:AI with a small sample of students, and discuss insights from implementation, including from our use of established resources for AI learning within the learning sequence as well as those created by our team.},

We evaluated our Conversational Agent Interface for MIT App Inventor and workshop curriculum with respect to 8 AI competencies from the literature. Furthermore, we analyze teacher (n=9) and student (n=47) feedback from workshops with the interface and recommend that future work (1) leverages design considerations to optimize engagement, (2) collaborates with teachers, and (3) addresses a range of student abilities through pacing and opportunities for extension.

This case study employed a mixed-method approach and integrated AI into maker education to enhance students' motivation, career interest, confidence, collaboration, and AI literacy across low to high cognitive domains. The study involved 35 secondary school students in an AI maker program, where AI-driven recycling bins were employed as a project-based learning intervention. The results demonstrated a positive impact on students' motivation, AI literacy, and collaboration.

Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

Design/methodology/approach Data for this study include student interviews (called “talk backs”), journal reflections and final technology presentations. Findings Broadly, the data suggests that critical race algorithmic literacies prepare Black students to critically read the algorithmic word (e.g. data, code, machine learning models, etc.) so that they can not only resist and survive, but also rebuild and reimagine the algorithmic world. Originality/value While critical race media literacy draws upon critical race theory in education – a theorization of race, and a critique of white supremacy and multiculturalism in schools – critical race algorithmic literacy is rooted in critical race technology theory, which is a theorization of blackness as a technology and a critique of algorithmic anti-blackness as the organizing logic of schools and AI systems.},

	abstract = {BackgroundThe increasing focus on education as an evidence-based practice requires that educators can effectively use data to inform their practice. At the level of classroom instructional decision making, the nature of the specific knowledge and skills teachers need to use data effectively is complex and not well characterized. Being able to characterize this requisite knowledge and skills supports definition and measurement of data literacy. Evolving from empirical analyses, an emergent conceptual framework of knowledge and skills is proposed for the construct, data literacy for teaching. The framework is based on a domain analysis, which is the first step of an evidence-centered design process for data literacy. The framework is contextualized in existing research, with an objective of having it ground future work in the development of instruments to measure data literacy.PurposeThis article reports on work to develop a conceptual framework to undergird research, development, and capacity building around data literacy for teaching. The emergent nature of the framework is intended to inform the discussions around data literacy so that continued refinement of operational definitions of the construct will emerge. Without such operational definitions, measurement of progress toward teacher data literacy is not possible.Research DesignThe conceptual framework is based on a sequence of qualitative studies that sought to determine the nature of knowledge and skills that are required for teachers to be considered data literate. A first study examined the ways that the knowledge and skills around the use of data were characterized in practical guides, books, and manuals on data use, formative assessment, and related topics. These characteristics were integrated with definitions of data literacy elicited from experts. A second study examined the licensure and certification documents required by states for teacher candidates for their treatment of data- and assessment-related knowledge and skills. The synthesis of these studies and their components have yielded an evolving conceptual framework for a new construct: data literacy for teachers.ConclusionsThe conceptual framework described in this article reflects an evolving effort to understand what it means for teachers to be data literate—that is, what knowledge and skills are required for teachers to use data effectively and responsibly set within an iterative inquiry cycle. The work posits that the construct comprises three interacting domains (data use for teaching, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge), six components of the inquiry cycle (identify problems, frame questions, use data, transform data into information, transform information into a decision, and evaluate outcomes), and, finally, 59 elements of knowledge and skills embedded within those components. However, the complex construct requires additional discussion from policy, research, and practitioners to refine and reorganize it and to expand it beyond a cognitive focus on knowledge and skills to include beliefs/values, identity, and epistemic elements. Next steps will include structuring an ongoing discussion about the nature of the framework and expansion beyond domain analysis through the evidence-centered design process to the development of a suite of instruments to measure the construct.},

However, these works are limited for several reasons: they have typically focused on evaluating a specific model for a specific education scenario (e.g., generating explanations), or have considered models that are already outdated (e.g., OpenAI’s Codex\&nbsp;[3] is no longer publicly available since March 2023). Consequently, there is a lack of systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models, ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios in programming education. These scenarios are designed to capture distinct roles these models could play, namely digital tutors, assistants, and peers, as discussed above. More concretely, we consider the following six scenarios: (1) program repair, i.e., fixing a student’s buggy program; (2) hint generation, i.e., providing a natural language hint to the student to help resolve current issues; (3) grading feedback, i.e., grading a student’s program w.r.t. a given rubric; (4) peer programming, i.e., completing a partially written program or generating a sketch for the solution program; (5) task creation, i.e., generating new tasks that exercise specific types of concepts or bugs; (6) contextualized explanation, i.e., explaining specific concepts or functions in the context of a given program. Our study uses a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation to compare the performance of these models with the performance of human tutors. We conduct our evaluation based on 5 introductory Python programming problems with a diverse set of input/output specifications. For each of these problems, we consider 5 buggy programs based on publicly accessible submissions from geeksforgeeks.org \&nbsp;[5] (see Figure\&nbsp;1); these buggy programs are picked to capture different types of bugs for each problem. We will provide a detailed analysis of the data and results in a longer version of this poster. Our preliminary results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors’ performance for several scenarios.},

	abstract = {The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and its increased use in everyday life have exacerbated
the need to understand its underlying processes, and to raise awareness about its shortcomings and faults.
Consequently there has been an increased effort to teach basic concepts of AI and machine learning (ML) from
an early age. Digital games have been shown to be effective as teaching and learning tools, and there are
ongoing efforts to increase AI literacy through educational digital games. To this effect, this work describes the
process followed to extrapolate the design of such an educational game directly from the pedagogical needs
emerging from stakeholders. Seven focus groups and workshops were conducted in Greece, Malta and
Norway, with 55 teachers, researchers, practitioners and policy-makers, and 22 primary and secondary
education students in total. These workshops identified seven goals which informed the design of a game for
AI literacy called ArtBot. The game design process and the final interface and gameplay loop of ArtBot are
explained in relation to these goals. The game was subsequently deployed across a variety of platforms, to
enable dissemination to a broad audience in classrooms and elsewhere. The game was part of the tools
developed in the framework of the LearnML Erasmus+ project. A preliminary online survey was used to gauge
how well the game was received by teachers and students, with an overall positive result. A longer-term data
collection of the game usage statistics has been initiated and will be analysed over the course of the game
dissemination.},

	abstract = {K-12 artificial intelligence (AI) education requires cultivating students’ computational thinking in the school curriculum so as to transfer their computational thinking to diverse problems and authentic contexts. However, students may be limited by traditional computational thinking development activities because they may have a lower degree of computational thinking efficacy for persistent learning of AI when encountering difficulties (computational thinking efficacy in learning AI). Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the relationships among Chinese secondary school students’ computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, their AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the mediation effect. Data were gathered from 509 Chinese secondary school students, and the confirmatory factor analyses showed that the measures had high reliability and validity. The results revealed that AI literacy was positively related to students’ computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, which was mediated by more sophisticated approaches to learning AI, contributing to the current understanding of learning AI. It is crucial to focus on students’ AI literacy and deep approaches (e.g., engaging in authentic AI contexts with systematic learning activities for in-depth understanding of AI knowledge) rather than surface approaches (e.g., memorizing AI knowledge) to develop their high-level computational thinking efficacy in learning AI. Implications for designing the AI curriculum are discussed.},

We experimentally manipulate user search/watch history by our custom programming. A controlled laboratory experiment is then conducted to examine whether exposure to algorithmically recommended content reinforces and polarizes political opinions. Results suggest that political self-reinforcement, as indicated by the political emotion-ideology alignment, and affective polarization are heightened by political videos – selected by the YouTube recommender algorithm – based on participants’ own search preferences. Suggestions for how to reduce algorithm-induced political polarization and implications of algorithmic personalization for democracy are discussed.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to change the future of work by improving employee task performance. Unlocking this potential requires that organizations prioritize developing employee AI competencies. Our understanding of AI competencies required to engage with AI-based systems effectively, however, is limited. The concept of AI literacy serves as a starting point to map and organize the competencies needed to use, explore, and communicate (with) AI. This short paper extends previous conceptualizations of AI literacy by exploring its dimensions and characteristics in organizational settings, both conceptually and empirically. We present insights into a multimethod taxonomy development process and a preliminary taxonomy of AI literacy. Our results strengthen and extend the conceptualization of the functional, critical, and sociocultural dimensions of AI literacy. We identify potential relationships between these dimensions and find that sociocultural AI literacy plays a significant role in enabling employees to engage with AI effectively at work.},
