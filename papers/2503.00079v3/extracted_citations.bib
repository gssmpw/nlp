	abstract = {The explosion of AI across all facets of society has given rise to the need for AI education across domains and levels. AI literacy has become an important concept in the current technological landscape, emphasizing the need for individuals to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to engage with AI systems. This systematic review examined 47 articles published between 2019 and 2023, focusing on recent work to capture new insights and initiatives given the burgeoning of the literature on this topic. In the initial stage, we explored the dataset to identify the themes covered by the selected papers and the target population for AI literacy efforts. We identified that the articles broadly contributed to one of the following themes: a) conceptualizing AI literacy, b) prompting AI literacy efforts, and c) developing AI literacy assessment instruments. We also found that a range of populations, from pre-K students to adults in the workforce, were targeted. In the second stage, we conducted a thorough content analysis to synthesize six key constructs of AI literacy: Recognize, Know and Understand, Use and Apply, Evaluate, Create, and Navigate Ethically. We then applied this framework to categorize a range of empirical studies and identify the prevalence of each construct across the studies. We subsequently review assessment instruments developed for AI literacy and discuss them. The findings of this systematic review are relevant for formal education and workforce preparation and advancement, empowering individuals to leverage AI and drive innovation.},

The principles that define computational literacy also serve as an analytical framework to examine competitive big pictures, and I use them to consider the plausibility, power, and limitations of other important contemporary trends in computationally centered education, notably computational thinking and coding as a social movement. While both of these trends have much to recommend them, my analysis uncovers some implausible assumptions and counterproductive elements of those trends.

	abstract = {BackgroundThe increasing focus on education as an evidence-based practice requires that educators can effectively use data to inform their practice. At the level of classroom instructional decision making, the nature of the specific knowledge and skills teachers need to use data effectively is complex and not well characterized. Being able to characterize this requisite knowledge and skills supports definition and measurement of data literacy. Evolving from empirical analyses, an emergent conceptual framework of knowledge and skills is proposed for the construct, data literacy for teaching. The framework is based on a domain analysis, which is the first step of an evidence-centered design process for data literacy. The framework is contextualized in existing research, with an objective of having it ground future work in the development of instruments to measure data literacy.PurposeThis article reports on work to develop a conceptual framework to undergird research, development, and capacity building around data literacy for teaching. The emergent nature of the framework is intended to inform the discussions around data literacy so that continued refinement of operational definitions of the construct will emerge. Without such operational definitions, measurement of progress toward teacher data literacy is not possible.Research DesignThe conceptual framework is based on a sequence of qualitative studies that sought to determine the nature of knowledge and skills that are required for teachers to be considered data literate. A first study examined the ways that the knowledge and skills around the use of data were characterized in practical guides, books, and manuals on data use, formative assessment, and related topics. These characteristics were integrated with definitions of data literacy elicited from experts. A second study examined the licensure and certification documents required by states for teacher candidates for their treatment of data- and assessment-related knowledge and skills. The synthesis of these studies and their components have yielded an evolving conceptual framework for a new construct: data literacy for teachers.ConclusionsThe conceptual framework described in this article reflects an evolving effort to understand what it means for teachers to be data literate—that is, what knowledge and skills are required for teachers to use data effectively and responsibly set within an iterative inquiry cycle. The work posits that the construct comprises three interacting domains (data use for teaching, content knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge), six components of the inquiry cycle (identify problems, frame questions, use data, transform data into information, transform information into a decision, and evaluate outcomes), and, finally, 59 elements of knowledge and skills embedded within those components. However, the complex construct requires additional discussion from policy, research, and practitioners to refine and reorganize it and to expand it beyond a cognitive focus on knowledge and skills to include beliefs/values, identity, and epistemic elements. Next steps will include structuring an ongoing discussion about the nature of the framework and expansion beyond domain analysis through the evidence-centered design process to the development of a suite of instruments to measure the construct.},

It emphasised conceptual building, highlighted project work in application development and initiated teaching ethics through application development. Thirty-six university students with diverse academic backgrounds joined and completed this programme, which included 7 hours on machine learning, 9 hours on deep learning and 14 hours on application development. Together with the project work, the results of the tests, surveys and reflective writings completed before and after these courses indicate that the programme successfully enhanced participants’ conceptual understanding, literacy, empowerment and ethical awareness. The programme will be extended to include more participants, such as senior secondary school students and the general public. This study initiates a pathway to lower the barrier to entry for AI literacy and addresses a public need.

            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is at the top of the agenda for education leaders today in educating the next generation across the globe. However, public understanding of AI technologies and how to define AI literacy is under‐explored. This vision poses upcoming challenges for our next generation to learn about AI. On this note, an exploratory review was conducted to conceptualize the newly emerging concept “AI literacy”, in search for a sound theoretical foundation to define, teach and evaluate AI literacy. Grounded in literature on 18 existing peer‐reviewed articles, this review proposed four aspects (i.e, know and understand, use, evaluate, and ethical issues) for fostering AI literacy based on the adaptation of classic literacies. This study sheds light on the consolidated definition, teaching, and ethical concerns on AI literacy, establishing the groundwork for future research such as competency development and assessment criteria on AI literacy.},

              The purpose of this paper is to propose a taxonomy of artificial intelligence (AI) literacy to support AI literacy education and research.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This study makes use of the facet analysis technique and draws upon various sources of data and information to develop a taxonomy of AI literacy. The research consists of the following key steps: a comprehensive review of the literature published on AI literacy research, an examination of well-known AI classification schemes and taxonomies, a review of prior research on data/information/digital literacy research and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 1,031 metadata records on AI literacy publications. The KH Coder 3 software application was used to analyse metadata records from the Scopus multidisciplinary database.
            
            
              Findings
              A new taxonomy of AI literacy is proposed with 13 high-level facets and a list of specific subjects for each facet.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The proposed taxonomy may serve as a conceptual AI literacy framework to support the critical understanding, use, application and examination of AI-enhanced tools and technologies in various educational and organizational contexts.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The proposed taxonomy provides a knowledge organization and knowledge mapping structure to support curriculum development and the organization of digital information.
            
            
              Social implications
              The proposed taxonomy provides a cross-disciplinary perspective of AI literacy. It can be used, adapted, modified or enhanced to accommodate education and learning opportunities and curricula in different domains, disciplines and subject areas.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The proposed AI literacy taxonomy offers a new and original conceptual framework that builds on a variety of different sources of data and integrates literature from various disciplines, including computing, information science, education and literacy research.},
