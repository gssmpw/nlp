\section{Additional Experiment Details}

\subsection{LLM Experiment Details}
\label{subsec:llm-details}
All LLMs used are obtained from \href{https://huggingface.co/models}{Hugging Face} checkpoints.
Time and compute power requirements vary, the largest llama-3-70b model takes around 2 hours on NVIDIA A6000 GPU to obtain all results in \cref{sec:experiment}.

\subsection{Human Experiment Details}

\paragraph{Participant instructions.}
We use keys \textit{F} and \textit{J}, which are roughly symmetric on a standard English keyboard, to collect participant responses.
Half of the participants see the following instruction:

\textit{In this study, you will be presented with two statements followed by a question. Your task is to answer either Yes or No to the question, based on the information provided in the statements.
    Please respond quickly and accurately by pressing "F" for Yes, and "J" for No.}

To mitigate the possible bias introduced by the dominant hand, we have the other half of the participants see instruction with reversed keys:

\textit{In this study, you will be presented with two statements followed by a question. Your task is to answer either Yes or No to the question, based on the information provided in the statements.
    Please respond quickly and accurately by pressing "F" for No, and "J" for Yes.}

\paragraph{Participant wage.}
We offer participants an hourly wage of 1.5 times Prolific's minimum wage.
The duration is determined by the median completion time among all participants.
