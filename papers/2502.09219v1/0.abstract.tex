In this paper, we study the problem of visual question answering (VQA) where the image and query are represented by ASP programs that lack domain data.  We provide an approach that is orthogonal and complementary to existing knowledge augmentation techniques where we abduce domain relationships of image constructs from past examples.
After framing the abduction problem, we provide a baseline approach, and an implementation that significantly improves the accuracy of query answering yet requires few examples.
