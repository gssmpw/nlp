In this paper, we introduced a practical heuristic algorithm designed to infer domain relationships from a logical representation of data specifically for visual question answering. Our algorithm is highly efficient, requiring just a single pass over the data, and it significantly enhances accuracy compared to using a logical representation that does not leverage domain information.
Despite its strong practical performance, an important limitation of our approach is that there are no theoretical guarantees for the solutions it obtains.
A promising direction for future research focused on addressing this limitation is to refine our approach by incorporating meta-cognitive AI~\cite{wei2024met} techniques.
