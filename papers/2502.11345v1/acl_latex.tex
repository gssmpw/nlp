\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Textual documents are commonly connected in a hierarchical graph structure where a central document links to others with an exponentially growing connectivity. Though Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel at capturing such \emph{graph hierarchy}, they cannot model the rich textual semantics within documents. Moreover, text contents in documents usually discuss topics of different specificity. Hierarchical Topic Models (HTMs) discover such latent \emph{topic hierarchy} within text corpora. However, most of them focus on the textual content within documents, and ignore the graph adjacency across interlinked documents.
%Hierarchical Topic Models (HTMs) discover such latent \emph{topic hierarchy} within text corpora, but most of them ignore the graph adjacency across interlinked documents. 
We thus propose a Hierarchical Graph Topic Modeling Transformer to integrate both topic hierarchy within documents and graph hierarchy across documents into a unified Transformer. Specifically, to incorporate topic hierarchy within documents, we design a topic tree and infer a \emph{hierarchical tree embedding} for hierarchical topic modeling. To preserve both topic and graph hierarchies, we design our model in hyperbolic space and propose \emph{Hyperbolic Doubly Recurrent Neural Network}, which models ancestral and fraternal tree structure. Both hierarchies are inserted into each Transformer layer to learn unified representations. Both supervised and unsupervised experiments verify the effectiveness of our model. %Code and datasets are submitted at \url{https://rb.gy/z3xrm5}.
