\section{Conclusion}

We design GTFormer, a topic model with topic and graph hierarchies. We design Hyperbolic Doubly RNN for tree embedding. Topic and graph hierarchies are inserted in Transformer. %Experiments verify the strength of GTFormer.%One limitation is that we assume the corpus contains documents of different topic specificity. 
%A positive impact is that we can use GTFormer to quickly discover the main topics in a large corpus. %A limitation is that we assume the corpus is truthful. If it has fake news, they may appear in the topics, causing potential negative impact. To mitigate it, we could use fake news detection model to remove fake documents, then apply our model. %on the remaining truthful documents. 
%A future work is to explore other language models for topic modeling.
