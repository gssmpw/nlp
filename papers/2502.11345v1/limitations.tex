\section*{Limitations}

Here we identify two limitations in terms of training corpus and language.

\textbf{Training corpus.} We assume the corpus is truthful. If it has fake news, they may appear in the topics, causing potential negative impact. To mitigate it, we could use fake news detection model to remove fake documents, then apply our model on the remaining truthful documents.

\textbf{Language.} Corpora used in this paper mainly consist of English vocabulary. The language models are also mostly trained on English-based corpora. Since our model is corpus-agnostic, extracting multilingual information may be feasible with an appropriate corpus.
