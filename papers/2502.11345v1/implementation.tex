\section{Implementation Environment}
\label{sec:implementation_environment}

Here we introduce the detailed implementation details and environment for reproducibility purpose. For our model, we choose hyperparameters based on the performance on validation set (Document classification task in the main paper explains how we split validation set). The results in the main paper are obtain by 5 independent runs. The standard deviations reported in the main paper are 1-sigma error bars and are obtained by calling its corresponding function in Excel library. All the experiments were done on Linux server with an NVIDIA A40 GPU with 46,068 MiB. Its operating system is CentOS Linux 7 (Core). We implemented our proposed model GTFormer using Python 3.10 as programming language and PyTorch 2.0.0 as deep learning library. Other frameworks include NumPy 1.23.1, sklearn 0.23.2, and scipy 1.5.2. We emphasize that the main focus of our model is effectiveness, instead of running efficiency. But for completeness, we still make a short comment on execution time. Our model is efficient, on the largest dataset Web, the training takes less than 40 hours to converge. We will release code and datasets upon publication.
