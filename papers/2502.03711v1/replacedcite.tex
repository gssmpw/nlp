\section{Related Work}
Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, InstructGPT, and LLaMA ____, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but also face challenges, such as hallucinations and sensitivity to input perturbations. To mitigate hallucinations, techniques like chain-of-thought ____ and step-by-step generation ____ have been proposed. Other strategies include augmenting generation with semantic retrieval ____, generating context directly ____, and crafting multi-step chains using tools like PromptChainer ____ or probabilistic programs ____. Self-consistency ____ and gradient-based sampling ____ further improve reliability by refining decoding processes. Modular architectures in legal and financial domains demonstrate how domain-specific tools and workflows can overcome context limitations and achieve competitive performance ____.

\paragraph{Perturbations in LLMs}
LLMs are highly sensitive to noisy inputs, which can impact real-world performance ____, with existing benchmarks often failing to assess robustness accurately ____. ____ found that LLMs encode query answerability within their hidden states, suggesting potential avenues for decoding improvements. Similarly, ____ demonstrated that LLMs' hidden states contain signals useful for detecting truthfulness. ____ highlighted the limitations of parametric memory in recalling long-tail knowledge and advocated for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to improve knowledge retention and efficiency.

\caption{\label{tab:overview}
Overview of the 12 question-answering datasets studied in this work, the domain coverage, and examples of the question-answer format. These datasets span traditional QA formats such as {\color{BrickRed} \textbf{Extractive}}, {\color{ForestGreen} \textbf{Multiple Choice}}, and {\color{Mulberry} \textbf{Abstractive}}. Our experiments treat all scenarios as text generation tasks, albeit with different prompting templates to align responses with the ground truth answer.
