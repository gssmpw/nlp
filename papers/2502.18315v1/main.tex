\begin{abstract}
The extraction of information from semi-structured text, such as resumes, has long been a challenge due to the diverse formatting styles and subjective content organization. Conventional solutions rely on specialized logic tailored for specific use cases. However, we propose a revolutionary approach leveraging structured Graphs, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning. By abstracting intricate logic into Graph structures, we transform raw data into a comprehensive Knowledge Graph. This innovative framework enables precise information extraction and sophisticated querying. We systematically construct dictionaries assigning skill weights, paving the way for nuanced talent analysis. Our system not only benefits job recruiters and curriculum designers but also empowers job seekers with targeted query-based filtering and ranking capabilities.

\section{Introduction}
%
In the contemporary digital landscape, semi-structured data constitutes a significant portion of textual information, encompassing diverse documents such as invoices, resumes, business documents, and technical reports \cite{ganguly2012graph}. Unlike structured data, these documents lack a standardized format, leading to varied and subjective organizational structures. This variability poses a substantial challenge for traditional unstructured language models and logic-based parsing systems, rendering them insufficient in comprehensively addressing the intricate nuances of human-written styles.

Amidst this complexity, the recruitment landscape has transformed dramatically, with a surge in online resume submissions facilitated by platforms like Info Edge Limited. However, this digital influx has introduced a new challenge: the overwhelming volume of resumes, making it arduous and time-consuming for recruiters to sift through this extensive pool \cite{maheshwari2010approach}. Conventional resume information extraction systems have predominantly relied on techniques like hidden Markov models, pattern matching, and tokenization. These methods primarily focus on storing extracted information in structured formats to simplify search and retrieval, constructing classifiers for effective candidate screening \cite{finn2004multi},  \cite{johnston2001information}.

In contrast, our research delves into enhancing information extraction from semi-structured data, a domain where conventional models designed for unstructured data fall short. Drawing inspiration from the burgeoning field of graph-based approaches, our work explores the rich potential of knowledge discovery within these intricate data structures. Graph-based representations, as evidenced in various domains \cite{concepts2006technique}, have demonstrated their versatility in solving an array of complex problems, from large-scale network systems to semantic search, cybersecurity, social networks, and chemical compound analysis. Our innovative methodology revolves around constructing graphs that encapsulate fundamental structural insights, utilizing the wealth of information extractable from these graphs through sophisticated Deep Learning Methods.

Contributions:

Our study makes significant contributions to the realm of talent analytics and information extraction from semi-structured data. The key contributions of our work include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Structured Information Encoding: We adeptly extract nuanced details, encompassing individual profiles, skills, organizational affiliations, and project experiences from resumes. These diverse data points are meticulously encoded into a Weighted Graph structure. This transformation provides a robust structural framework for both unstructured and semi-structured data, enabling comprehensive analysis.

\item Skill-Project Edge Weighting: Leveraging the specifics of experience and project descriptions, we apply weighted connections to skill-project edges. This innovative approach enables us to discern the nuanced expertise of individuals, refining the edges pertaining to person-skill relationships and organization-skill associations.

\item Graph Query Capabilities: Our methodology equips users with powerful querying capabilities. Users can seamlessly perform simple queries like “top C++ candidates,” facilitating efficient candidate selection. Moreover, complex queries such as “C++ 8-10, Java 6-8, Python 2-3” are supported, enabling precise and targeted searches for resumes/jobseekers that match specific skill criteria.

In the subsequent sections, we delve deeper into our methodology, detailing the techniques and frameworks utilized to achieve these impactful contributions. Through our research, we empower talent analytics and recruitment processes by bridging the gap between unstructured data complexity and meaningful insights.\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}
In the dynamic landscape of resume information extraction, diverse methodologies have been explored, each with distinct approaches and advantages. Traditional techniques like keyword search-based methods, rule-based methods, and semantic-based methods have been prominent, yet they often struggle to grasp the intricate nuances of skills and experiences due to the ever-evolving nature of job descriptions and applicant backgrounds \cite{chen2018two}.

Recent strides have introduced innovative methods leveraging graph-based structures for skill processing.\cite{velampalli2016novel} pioneered a graph-based approach utilizing the MapReduce Programming model, enabling the extraction of common skill-sets from extensive resume datasets. Their foundational work integrated graph theory into talent analytics, offering a promising avenue for nuanced skill assessment.

The integration of sentiment analysis into skill evaluation marks a groundbreaking development. \cite{maheshwari2010approach}
introduced a methodology focused on feature selection, enhancing the efficiency of the resume selection process. Their research showcased a substantial reduction (50-94\%) in the number of features recruiters needed to review, highlighting the potential of advanced techniques in streamlining hiring.

 Additionally, \cite{nasr2019assessment} proposed a method combining the modified Boyer-Moore Method and Dice metrics-based string similarity verification. This hybrid approach empowers employees to sift through overwhelming resume databases efficiently, ensuring accurate query results.

The emergence of video resumes has presented novel challenges and opportunities. \cite{chen2018two} introduced a framework for processing video resumes, analyzing the formation of personality traits and hirability impressions. This multimodal approach, integrating visual and verbal cues, provides a holistic understanding of candidates, revolutionizing how recruiters assess potential hires.

In recent years, the fusion of natural language processing and deep learning techniques has significantly enhanced resume parsing and skill extraction. \cite{johnston2001information} proposed methods enhancing resume parsing through natural language processing techniques, offering a more nuanced understanding of applicant qualifications. \cite{jones2021deep} delved into semantic resume parsing and skill extraction using deep learning, providing a more sophisticated approach to understanding the context and relevance of skills mentioned in resumes.

Furthermore, \cite{wang2022graph} introduced a graph-based resume analysis method tailored for job matching. Their approach utilized graph structures to represent both job requirements and applicant skills, enabling a more comprehensive and accurate matching process. This innovative method has opened new horizons in the realm of resume analysis and job matching.

In our pioneering work, we have taken a significant leap by attributing weights to sentiment words associated with skills. This innovative step enables us to attach these sentiment weights to edges within the graph structure. This nuanced approach not only refines the ranking method for jobseekers and organizations but also opens avenues for more granular skill evaluation. By integrating these latest advancements with our innovative graph-based methodology, we aim to revolutionize talent analytics, providing a comprehensive and accurate means of assessing candidates' skills and experiences.
\section{Proposed Methodology}

In this section, we explain the methodology that we will follow to extract information from the Resumes which will be useful for better ranking of JobSeekers based on their skills, projects and organizations.

First the resume is parsed using techniques which include conversion of the document to text, identification of specific sections of the document using regular expression parsing for generic heading keywords and whitespace patterns, Part-Of-Speech tagging, regular expression parsing  for absolutely identifiable entities, gazetteer matching for well known words and Named Entity Recognition for Person Names, Locations, Skills and Organizations.
We then identify the sections of name and address, skillsets, projects and organizations and retrieve those text blobs. Then we build the knowledge graph which will capture the relations of people, skills, organizations and projects. We however do not identify and trying to normalize the projects as we are not interested in unifying the project descriptions which can be different by different jobseekers for the same job including the title of the project. As we are only interested in the signals in the project description we need not unify or normalize the projects.

 \caption{Single JobSeeker Single Project}
 \label{fig:f1}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Building Gazetteers}
We create a mini-gazetteer of positive keywords with different weights of positivity for different skills which we call skill-sentiment-gazetteer. For example, in the software domain design, scalability, robust, debugging, distributed, client-server etc., are strong keywords which indicate that the project requires greater skill than a project without such keywords. In the management domain team player, lead, cohesive, align, hire etc., are keywords with strong positive influence on the work involved in the project. We employ sentiment analysis and concordance extraction for retrieving such strong keywords.

\subsubsection{Building the Knowledge Graph}
The sections identified in the resume are used to build a knowledge graph in the following step-wise method. 


\begin{enumerate}
    
\item The name of the jobseeker and his/her attributes form the identity of the jobseeker which is represented in the node $<$JobSeeker1$>$ and the skills of the jobseeker are parsed and normalized there by enabling us to build skill nodes in the graph. Eg. $<$C++$>$ node in Figure \ref{fig:f1}.//


\item The details of the project/experience that the jobseeker has put in the resume are parsed for organization/client details thereby making the organization node and the project node. 

\item The parsed project/experience text is searched for mention of skill and keywords are looked up against the aforementioned skill-sentiment-gazetteer to deduce weights of the particular skill which we assign to the edge from the skill to the project.

\item The edge from the jobseeker to the skill is weighted as the average of the weights of the particular skill in different projects thereby allowing us to calculate overall strength of the skill that the candidate has.

\item The edge from the Organization to the skill is also deduced as the average of all the skill-project edges of different jobseekers who were in a particular project using the skill.

\item We also extract duration which is a strong indicator of the development of a skill overtime for a person. The duration is also used to add to the weight of the jobseeker-skill edge.
\end{enumerate}

The figures \ref{fig:f1},\ref{fig:f2},\ref{fig:f3},\ref{fig:f4} show how the graph is built progressively as we build the graph from each jobSeeker’s resume.

\section{Implementation Details}

Our implementation process begins with the construction of a comprehensive skills dictionary. We aggregate skills from various internet sources, including career sites (accessible through APIs), Wikipedia utilizing wikibots, and datasets employing the conceptual graph method \cite{velampalli2016novel}. Skills are categorized into distinct domains such as "programming languages," "operating systems," "middleware technologies," "database technologies," "scripting languages," and "web technologies." To eliminate ambiguities, we utilize wikibots to extract morphological or conventional variations of skill words, ensuring normalized representation. For instance, mentions of "c++" and "cpp" are standardized to "c++." Additionally, we create a skill-sentiment gazetteer by identifying positive keywords from sentiment classification datasets \cite{MohammadKZ2013} and utilizing word embeddings from sources like Google-News-Vectors Word2Vec \cite{mikolov2013word2vec} and Glove \cite{pennington2014glove}. We employ a gold dataset of resumes, ensuring parity in project details, to extract keywords typically mentioned around skills. Positive words like "highly" within contexts like "distributed" or "scaling" signify highly positive sentiments, enabling the creation of a <skill, keyword, sentiment> triple dictionary.




\subsection{Dataset Processing:}

We utilize resumes from the paper \cite{velampalli2016novel} as our dataset. Each resume undergoes processing following the methodology outlined in Figure 1. Initially, the document is converted into plain text format using Apache Tika. Standard NLP techniques are applied for minimal stop word removal, skill normalization, and organization normalization. Section identification is performed through pattern recognition techniques and section header matching. We extract project details, skills sections, and names from the resumes. Each jobseeker is assigned a unique identity. POS tagging using SpaCy, regular expression-based entity matching, skill gazetteer matching, and Named Entity Recognition are employed to identify entities. The processed information is then transformed into JSON files containing the relevant keys and values.

\subsection{Graph Construction:}

The JSON structure serves as the foundation for building the graph, utilizing Neo4j, a popular graph database. We assess the positivity of keywords and the frequency of positive words, assigning weights to specific $<$skill, project$>$ edges. The weight assignment is based on initial bootstrap values ranging from 0 to 1, denoting different classes of keywords in the skill-sentiment gazetteer. The overall sentiment for a single project description is calculated as the average sentiment weight value of its constituent words. If multiple skills are described, the same sentiment weight value is assigned to each corresponding $<$skill, project$>$ edge. The weights on $<$jobseeker, skill$>$ edges are learned from $<$skill, project$>$ edges, normalizing as similar resumes are processed, ensuring accurate quantification of $<$jobseeker, skill$>$ relationships.






\begin{verbatim}
{
  "jobseekerid": {
    "org1"{
      "project1": {
        "title": "project title",
        "duration": "duration",
        "details": {...filtered text…},
      }
      "project2": {
        "title": "project title",
        "duration": "duration",
        "details": {...filtered text…},
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

This JSON structure is used to build the graph using the steps mentioned in the section “Proposed Methodology”. We use popular graph databse Neo4j to build the graph. We detect the positivity of the keywords and the number of times the positive words have been used to assign weights to particular $<$skill, project$>$ edge. The weight to positivity is calculated by initial bootstrap values of 0 to 1 assigned to different classes of keywords in the skill-sentiment gazetteer. The overall sentiment from a single project description will be the average over the sentiment weight values of each of its constituent words. If multiple skills are described in the description we assign same sentiment weight value to each $<$skill, project$>$ edge. Since the weights on  $<$jobseeker, skill$>$ edges are learnt from $<$skill, project$>$ edges, as more number of similar resumes are parsed these weights normalize resulting in a better quantification of the $<$jobseeker, skill$>$ edges.

These results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our graph-based methodology in resume information extraction, enabling recruiters to make more informed decisions in the hiring process.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

 We presented the first study of a method of adding sentiment signals to skills from resumes. We built a system that effectively extracts information from resumes and using systematically built dictionaries assigns weights to skills at a project level. The graph built from such information enables us to rank and query various combinations of requirements that can be of use for hiring. In the future, we plan to use Graph Neural Networks which enable efficient similarity searching. We also plan to enrich this graph topology to represent stochastic job shifts and then perform DeepWalk  to find patterns of job shifts which enable finding patterns of retainable employees and  volatile employees in various technology skill sets. It will also help organizations to determine predictable associative times of their workforce and use retention methods or augment with similar or complementing workforce for business continuity.
