Diffusion bridges have shown potential in paired image-to-image
(I2I) translation tasks. However, existing methods are limited by
their unidirectional nature, requiring separate models for forward
and reverse translations. This not only doubles the computational
cost but also restricts their practicality. In this work, we introduce
the Bidirectional Diffusion Bridge Model (BDBM), a scalable approach
that facilitates bidirectional translation between two coupled distributions
using a single network. BDBM leverages the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation
for bridges, enabling it to model data distribution shifts across
timesteps in both forward and backward directions by exploiting the
interchangeability of the initial and target timesteps within this
framework. Notably, when the marginal distribution given endpoints
is Gaussian, BDBM's transition kernels in both directions possess
analytical forms, allowing for efficient learning with a single network.
We demonstrate the connection between BDBM and existing bridge methods,
such as Doob\textquoteright s $h$-transform and variational approaches,
and highlight its advantages. Extensive experiments on high-resolution
I2I translation tasks demonstrate that BDBM not only enables bidirectional
translation with minimal additional cost but also outperforms state-of-the-art
bridge models. Our source code is available at \href{https://github.com/kvmduc/BDBM}{https://github.com/kvmduc/BDBM}.
