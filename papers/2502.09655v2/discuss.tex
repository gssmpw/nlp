We introduced the Bidirectional Diffusion Bridge Model (BDBM), a novel
framework for bidirectional image-to-image (I2I) translation using
a single network. By leveraging the Chapman-Kolmogorov Equation, BDBM
models the shared components of forward and backward transitions,
enabling efficient bidirectional generation with minimal computational
overhead. Empirical results demonstrated that BDBM consistently outperforms
existing I2I translation methods across diverse datasets.

Despite these strengths, BDBM has so far been applied exclusively
to the image domain. Extending it to other domains, such as text,
presents an exciting direction for future research. In particular,
exploring BDBM for multimodal tasks like image$\leftrightarrow$text
generation would be a promising avenue.
