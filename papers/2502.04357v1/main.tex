\begin{abstract}
Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial strides in structured tasks through Reinforcement Learning (RL), demonstrating proficiency in mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, applying RL in broader domains like chat bots and content generation --- through the process known as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) --- presents unique challenges. Reward models in RLHF are critical, acting as proxies that evaluate the alignment of LLM outputs with human intent. Despite advancements, the development of reward models is hindered by challenges such as computational heavy training, costly evaluation, and therefore poor reproducibility. \textbf{We advocate for using embedding-based input in reward model research as an accelerated solution to those challenges.} By leveraging embeddings for reward modeling, we can enhance reproducibility, reduce computational demands on hardware, improve training stability, and significantly reduce training and evaluation costs, hence facilitating fair and efficient comparisons in this active research area. We then show a case study of reproducing existing reward model ensemble research using embedding-based reward models. We discussed future avenues for research, aiming to contribute to safer and more effective LLM deployments.

\section{More Results}
\label{appdx:more_results}
\paragraph{Performance Comparison: Embedding-based reward models v.s. LLM-based reward models.}
In our main text, we presented the results with the Gemma 2B model when comparing the performance of different reward modeling approaches. We now provide the results using the Gemma 7B and LLaMA3 8B models as complementary empirical supports. The observations concluded in our main test still hold true on those experiment setups.

\paragraph{Additional results reproducing reward model ensemble with embedding-based reward models.}
In our main text, we presented the results with the Gemma 2B model when reproducing reward model ensemble papers. We now provide complementary results using the Gemma 7B and LLaMA3 8B models in response generations. The observations concluded in our main test still hold true on those experiment setups.
