This work introduces \textit{K-Paths}, a novel path retrieval framework that extracts relevant and diverse reasoning paths from large biomedical knowledge graphs.
K-Paths enables LLMs to effectively reason about and predict unobserved interactions between emerging drugs and diseases. 
By constructing concise subgraphs, K-Paths also significantly reduce the computational burden of training GNNs on large-scale KGs, achieving up to a 90\% reduction in graph size without significant loss in performance.
While demonstrated here for predicting drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, we propose that K-Paths is potentially generalizable to other biomedical tasks, such as protein-protein interaction prediction.
We acknowledge a key limitation: K-Paths relies on interaction types learned from existing knowledge.
This may restrict its ability to identify novel interactions not yet represented in the biomedical network or training data.
Furthermore, a knowledge graph with sparse or biased representation of entities could negatively impact K-Paths' performance when predicting interactions involving such entities.
Despite these limitations, K-Paths provides valuable insights into biomedical interactions by enhancing model explainability and extracting biologically meaningful reasoning paths.
We believe this work lays a foundation for future exploration of integrating LLMs and KGs in biomedical applications, paving the way for more efficient and interpretable solutions in drug discovery and other related fields.
