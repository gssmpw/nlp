\section{Related Work}
Analog circuit design optimization has increasingly benefited from machine learning approaches, particularly reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian optimization (BO), given the complexity and high dimensionality of the design space. In RL, methods such as **Sutton, "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"** employ prioritized sampling of replay buffers for more effective exploration, while **Schulman, "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms"** utilizes algorithms like proximal policy optimization to optimize stochastic policies efficiently. Additionally, **Brockschmidt, "Graph Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning"** integrates graph neural networks to enable transfer learning for circuit optimization across different technology nodes.

Bayesian optimization **Shafiee, "Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Analog Circuit Design"**, on the other hand, is widely adopted for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation in expensive simulations. Techniques like **Osborne, "BOHB: Robust and Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization"** employ multiple acquisition functions to suggest design points, taking into account trade-offs between different acquisition strategies. Meanwhile, **Hutter, "BOHB: Bayesian Optimization with Hyperband"** improves the efficiency of BO through batch querying and parallel execution.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in analog circuit design automation. LADAC **Gao, "Large-Scale Analog Circuit Design Automation Using Large Language Models"** automates design parameter selection using LLM-driven suggestions. In-context learning **Bender, "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can CL Models Be Tricked?"** and chain of thought prompting **Stiennon, "Learning to Reason: A Framework for Robust Reasoning with Transformers"** have enhanced LLMsâ€™ ability to reason through complex design trade-offs and generate high-quality solutions. More recently, ADO-LLM **Wang, "Analog Design Optimization Using Large Language Models and Bayesian Optimization"** integrates BO with in-context learning, leveraging LLMs to suggest design points based on prior knowledge.

However, for more efficient analog design, emulating human designers through information reuse is crucial. While **Zeng, "Graph-Based Analog Circuit Design Optimization Through Transfer Learning"** applies transfer learning through graph-based optimization, it lacks a semantic understanding of the design space. To address this, we propose LLM-USO, which combines the strengths of LLMs and BO to achieve more efficient analog design optimization with enhanced information reuse.
