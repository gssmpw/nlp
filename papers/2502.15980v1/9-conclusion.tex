\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents {\tool}, a novel interactive text-to-SQL annotation system that enables users to create high-quality, schema-specific text-to-SQL datasets.
{\tool} integrates multiple functionalities, including schema customization, database synthesis, query alignment, dataset analysis, and additional features such as confidence scoring.
A user study with 12 participants demonstrates that by combining these features, {\tool} significantly reduces annotation time while improving the quality of the annotated data.
{\tool} effectively bridges the gap resulting from insufficient training and evaluation datasets for new or unexplored schemas.
