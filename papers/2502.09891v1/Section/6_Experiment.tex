\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:exp}

Our experiments aim to answer following research questions (RQs):

\begin{itemize}
    \item {\it RQ1}: How does ArchRAG perform compared with existing baselines on specific and abstract QA tasks?
    \item {\it RQ2}: How efficient is the ArchRAG approach? 
    \item {\it RQ3}: What is the quality of our LLM-based attributed communities, and how does it impact the performance of RAG?
    \item {\it RQ4}: How robust is ArchRAG?
\end{itemize}
