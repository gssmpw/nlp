% Large language models (LLMs) augmented with external data have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in completing question-answer (QA) tasks.
%
% A typical such approach is the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which has received plenty of attention because of its high trustworthiness and interpretability.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) for question-answer (QA) tasks.
%
The state-of-the-art RAG approaches often use the graph data as the external data since they capture the rich semantic information and link relationships between entities.
%
However, existing graph-based RAG approaches cannot accurately identify the relevant information from the graph and also consume large numbers of tokens in the online retrieval process.
% 
To address these issues, we introduce a novel graph-based RAG approach, called \underline{A}tt\underline{r}ibuted \underline{C}ommunity-based \underline{H}ierarchical \underline{RAG} (ArchRAG), by augmenting the question using attributed communities, and also introducing a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method.
%
To retrieve the most relevant information from the graph for the question, we build a novel hierarchical index structure for the attributed communities and develop an effective online retrieval method.
% 
Experimental results demonstrate that ArchRAG outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and token cost.
