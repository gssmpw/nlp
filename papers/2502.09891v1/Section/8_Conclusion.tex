\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose ArchRAG, a novel graph-based RAG approach, by augmenting the question using attributed communities from the knowledge graph built on the external corpus, and building a novel index for efficient retrieval of relevant information.
%
Our experiments show that ArchRAG is highly effective and efficient.
% 
In the future, we will explore fast parallel graph-based RAG methods to process large-scale external corpus.

%In the future, we will explore novel RAG methods for processing other modalities of data and also develop efficient algorithms.
