\section{Discussions on WeVibe's Limitation and Future Work}
\label{sec:Limitations of WeVibe}
The amount of elastic deformation of the shelf surface might bring extra variation on the shelf vibration response, leading to more data collection on some specific locations. WeVibe performs worse at some locations such as location 1 shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Evaluation1} and location 5 shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Evaluation Real}. At these locations, some more weight classes are required to provide better estimation. It is probably because that there is a little amount of elastic deformation happened on these locations when the item weight changes, leading to more variances of the final weight change estimation.

On the other hand, WeVibe's weight change estimation does not work for one location while the weight at the other location changes. If the weight changes at location 1, for example, the whole structure of the shelf changes as well, influencing the vibration patterns across all locations, not just where the weight change occurred. This interdependency between multiple locations introduces complexity in accurately isolating the impact of weight changes at the area occupied by the same type of item, particularly in densely stocked shelves.

Therefore, to address these challenges, we would like to incorporate our vibration physics-informed model with existing sensing modality in the future. Integrating complementary technologies such as camera could significantly enhance the precision and reliability of WeVibe. By leveraging camera, we can provide real-time visual confirmation of item movements and weights, continuously updating and refining our weight estimation model to account for the elastic deformation. Furthermore, camera is also helpful on collecting weight samples with more various item layouts on the shelf, allowing us to do a more rigorous empirical study on the relationship between item weight on a single shelf and vibration response. Compared with item weight changes at different locations on the shelf, considering one shelf as "one" location is more compelling in the real-world scenario.
