We introduce WeVibe, an innovative system that leverages audio-induced shelf vibrations to estimate weight changes in autonomous stores with minimal sensor use and data collection effort. Our approach utilizes structural dynamics to create a scalable, cost-effective solution that outperforms traditional methods by reducing the need for extensive data collection and sensor deployment. We established a physics-informed linear relationship between shelf vibration responses and item weight across different shelf locations through empirical studies and theoretical analysis. This relationship enables WeVibe to quickly adapt to new locations with minimal data, significantly lowering the barrier for deployment in real-world store settings. Our evaluation demonstrates that WeVibe achieved a mean absolute error of up to 48.15g and a standard deviation of 44.96g with one sensor and 10\% samples of three weight classes for each location, which can correctly differentiate weight change bigger than 100g in most cases. In the real item-layout setting, WeVibe can successfully detect if one protein bar is taken or put back at best, confirming the effectiveness of our physics-informed model. We hope our work inspires more adoption of ubiquitous vibration sensing under different structures, not only limited by the gondola shelf.
