\section{Introduction}
\ifx\ItIsIEEEDoc\undefined In \else In \fi the digital age, a huge amount of information presented on the Internet often exists in complex multi-record formats, especially on news websites. A record is defined as a separate entity on a webpage, for example, for news resources it is one news item, that includes a title, publication date and possibly other characteristics. A multi-record page is a page containing several records. In the news domain, this might be a page of some category, which usually displays several news items. A page with only a single record (news item) is called detailed. Extracting data from multi-record pages poses a significant problem, especially given that traditional methods and datasets are mostly focused on single-record or detailed pages. This paper presents a novel approach to extracting information from multi-record web pages, especially those located on Russian-language news websites. This article aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction from such intricate web environments by building a large dataset of over 13,000 pages and applying neural methods such as the MarkupLM model. Despite the numerous approaches to solving the problem of information extraction, this article will focus on methods that do not require a visual representation of the page (including generating a representation from the HTML code) and instead rely only on HTML code.
