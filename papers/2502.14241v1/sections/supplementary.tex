\textbf{<0 Introduction> (20 minutes)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item Hello, my name is []. I am a researcher at the [] lab. 

\item This study is part of a project aimed at understanding how people use AR for productive work. The primary objective of this study is to gather feedback on your experiences with an AR device in your everyday work environments.

\item For the study, upon obtaining your consent to participate, we will first ask you to complete a demographics survey, which includes questions about your background, device usage habits, and experiences with AR and VR. 

\item We will then introduce you to the AR device. 

\item Afterwards, we will ask you to use the device for at least 10 sessions over the upcoming two weeks, one session per day, with each session lasting at least 30 minutes. 

\item Following each session, we request that you document your experience in a diary survey.
Note that in total, this amounts to around a 40-45 minute commitment per day. 

\item Finally, you will be asked to participate in a 30-45 minute semi-structured interview to reflect on your overall experience.

\item Please note that your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you can interrupt your involvement at any time without the need for justification. 

\item In the course of the study, we will collect your survey responses, as well as some photographs of your virtual workspace and environment. Towards the conclusion of the study, we will also record our interview with you. 

\item These interview recordings will be transcribed and, together with the survey data, will be analyzed by our research team. Our plan is to publish our findings cumulatively and anonymously.

\item Do you have any questions at this point?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Answer questions.
\item Administer consent form.
\item Administer background questionnaire.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{<1 Device Setup and Instructions> (30 minutes)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item For our study, you will be using the Sightful Spacetop EA device. Before I go into the detailed study tasks, let me introduce the device.

\item The Spacetop device is effectively a laptop without a screen. Instead of a screen, its virtual contents are displayed via a pair of augmented reality glasses. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Demonstrate powering on and off the device.
\item Demonstrate basic system functions, 
such as connecting to networks, 
adjusting display brightness,
changing device settings, capturing screenshots, 
and accessing applications through the dock.
\item Demonstrate interactions for window management, including opening, closing, positioning, centering, and resizing of windows.
\end{enumerate}

\item Participants were allotted supervised time to familiarize themselves with the device, receiving assistance from the experimenter as needed. The study proceeded to the next stage only after participants confirmed their readiness.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{<2 Study Tasks Explanation> (10 minutes)}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
\item Now, let us go into the study tasks in more detail. 

\item Over the next two weeks, please use the device at least once a day for a minimum of 30 minutes, for a total of 10 days. If you miss more than two days in a row, we will, unfortunately, have to discontinue the study.

\item You are encouraged to complete additional sessions beyond the minimum. We will pay you \$15 for each extra session.

\item Feel free to use the device at any time or place and for whatever task you choose.

\item After each session, we would like you to complete a diary survey, reflecting on your usage experience. 
You will receive a link to the survey via email shortly after the onboarding session. 
We have also written them on the device for your convenience. Please try to complete the survey immediately after using the device, or as soon as possible afterward.

\item Do you have any questions at this point?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Answer questions.
\end{enumerate}

\item Lastly, if you have any questions or trouble with the device at any point, contact us immediately. 

\end{enumerate}
