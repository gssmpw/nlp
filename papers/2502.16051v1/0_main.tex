\begin{abstract}
Current medical language model (LM) benchmarks often over-simplify the complexities of day-to-day clinical practice tasks and instead rely on evaluating LMs on multiple-choice board exam questions. 
Thus, we present an expert-created and annotated dataset 
spanning five critical domains of decision-making in mental healthcare: treatment, diagnosis, documentation, monitoring, and triage. 
This dataset — created without any LM assistance — is designed to capture the nuanced clinical reasoning and daily ambiguities mental health practitioners encounter, reflecting the inherent complexities of care delivery that are missing from existing datasets. 
Almost all 203 base questions with five answer options each have had the decision-irrelevant demographic patient information removed and replaced with variables (e.g., AGE), and are available for male, female, or non-binary-coded patients. 
For question categories dealing with ambiguity and multiple valid answer options, we create a preference dataset with uncertainties from the expert annotations. 
We outline a series of intended use cases and demonstrate the usability of our dataset by evaluating eleven off-the-shelf and four mental health fine-tuned LMs on category-specific task accuracy, on the impact of patient demographic information on decision-making, and how consistently free-form responses deviate from human annotated samples.

\section*{Impact Statement}

The MENTAT dataset represents a significant step forward in AI evaluation for psychiatry, providing a clinician-annotated, real-world benchmark that moves beyond traditional exam-style questions. By making the raw dataset (fully anonymized), processing code, evaluation framework, and final evaluation sets publicly available, we enable researchers to rigorously test models while allowing for easy modifications and extensions to fit various psychiatric AI applications. This ensures that MENTAT remains a flexible, transparent, and adaptable tool for AI alignment, fairness, and interpretability research.

A major ethical consideration in dataset creation is what to include and exclude—decisions that inevitably shape AI model development. We deliberately did not use LM-generated content, ensuring that all data comes from human clinical expertise rather than AI-reinforced biases. While this approach enhances credibility, bias risks remain—particularly in expert judgments and demographic representation. Although we sought diverse annotators, biases inherent to psychiatric practice or subtle algorithmic tendencies may still persist. By systematically varying demographic attributes, we provide a lens to study how AI models respond to different patient profiles, reinforcing the need for bias mitigation before deployment.

A critical risk is that a good model performance on MENTAT could inadvertently encourage premature AI deployment in psychiatric care. As AI models improve, there may be economic pressures to automate diagnosis, triage, and billing, potentially leading to job displacement and diminished human oversight. Without rigorous safety measures, AI-driven psychiatric tools could reinforce systemic biases, misdiagnose patients, or fail to recognize mental health emergencies. Ethical AI in psychiatry must prioritize human-in-the-loop validation, regulatory oversight, and transparent reporting of model limitations.

By establishing a higher standard for AI evaluation in psychiatry, we hope to guide responsible AI development while preventing premature deployment that could compromise patient care. MENTAT is a foundation for safer, fairer, and clinically meaningful AI—one that must augment, not replace, human expertise in mental healthcare.
