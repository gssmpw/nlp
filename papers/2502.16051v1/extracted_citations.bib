More than 194k high-quality AIIMS &amp; NEET PG entrance exam MCQs covering 2.4k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects are collected with an average token length of 12.77 and high topical diversity. Each sample contains a question, correct answer(s), and other options which requires a deeper language understanding as it tests the 10+ reasoning abilities of a model across a wide range of medical subjects &amp; topics. A detailed explanation of the solution, along with the above information, is provided in this study.}
