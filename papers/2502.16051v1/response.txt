Numerous benchmarks and datasets have been introduced to train or evaluate AI systems for medical applications
ranging from genetics, radiology, cardiology, and EMR applications **Radinsky et al., "Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification"**__**Kohli et al., "MedQA: A Dataset of Medical Questions with Answers"**
to medical exam-like content such as MedQA ____, MMMU ____, NEJM Image Challenges ____, and Path-VQA ____, alongside exam-based tasks like MedMCQA ____ and MMLU ____.
Broader efforts include MedS-bench ____ for LMs in clinical contexts and Google’s Gemini initiative ____ or state-of-the-art graduate-level and human expert benchmarks ____.

In mental health, researchers have compiled datasets of counseling sessions **Adhikary et al., "Counseling Session Summarization"**,
explored AI-driven diagnostic reasoning ____, and automated clinical documentation ____. 
They have also investigated therapy referrals ____, peer support ____, patient attitudes ____, and augmented care via automated psychotherapy, diagnosis, and biometric stress analysis ____, with broader safety considerations ____, concrete safety concerns in mental health emergencies ____, and demographic biases ____ remaining active concerns.

Unlike the existing exam-style benchmarks and multi-specialty medical datasets, our work focuses specifically on capturing the everyday ambiguities of mental healthcare tasks that often lack a single “correct” answer supported by extensive human expert input without intentionally contaminating the data with LM assistance. 
Thus, our work complements large datasets **Lample et al., "Large Scale Multitask Learning"**__**Zhang et al., "Medical Text Classification"**
that focus on scale.
While prior efforts have explored broader medical applications or aggregated data from exams, clinical notes, and research publications, our evaluation-first approach emphasizes diverse expert annotations, real-life psychiatric decision-making, and open-source availability, specifically within mental health. 
Finally, we evaluate the impact of demographic diversity on a wide variety of tasks such as triage and documentation—an analysis often overlooked by more extensive, general-purpose medical benchmarks.
