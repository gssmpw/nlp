        Comparison of fluid simulation results using Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) with varying numbers of basis functions ($r$).**  
        The leftmost column (MC) represents the Monte Carlo (ground truth) simulation. The remaining columns depict reconstructions using DMD with increasing numbers of basis functions ($r = 2, 9, 28, 61, 105, 130, 150$). Rows correspond to different time steps ($t = 100, 150, 200, 250, 300$). As $r$ increases, the reconstruction quality improves, capturing more details of the plume-like fluid structure over time.}
