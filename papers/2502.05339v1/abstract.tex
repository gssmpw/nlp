% We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, accurate, and versatile subspace simulations. Our approach introduces temporal-aware subspaces by approximating the Koopman operator, which encapsulates the temporal evolution of fluid dynamics. This method enables efficient prediction of future fluid states with a single repeated matrix multiplication, eliminating the need for traditional time-integration.

% We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the techniqueâ€™s robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, super-resolution, and time-reversal.

% Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing approaches. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables creative control over simulation dynamics, empowering artists with tools for temporal and spatial modulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.

We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, memory-efficient, and user-controllable subspace simulation. We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that \emph{evolves} a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence.
