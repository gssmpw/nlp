%We recover the classical Augustin information when all matrices in the optimization problem \eqref{eq_problom} share the same eigenbasis. 
%The Augustin information was proposed by \citet{Augustin1969}.
%\citet{Augustin1978} also proposed a fixed point iteration, which was later proved to asymptotically converge
