\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
This paper presents a solution to the distributed bearing formation tracking control problem of multiple quadrotor vehicles with a limited sensor set, where only one leader knows its global position. Building upon our previous work on formation tracking control under relaxed graph topologies and leader-follower formation control with collision avoidance, we have expanded this theory to a team of quadrotors by developing a hierarchical control strategy using only inter-agent bearing measurements. This approach enables precise tracking of time-varying trajectories under relaxed graph topologies, requiring each quadrotor to connect with as few as one neighbor. The proposed method was validated by numerical simulations and practical experiments with three drones. Here, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated even in the presence of disturbances. Future work includes implementing a controller using onboard vision systems while considering a limited field of view.
