We have introduced an analogue of nonnegative matrix factorization for manifold-valued data, which we refer to as CC-NMDF. Our CC-NMDF incorporates the geometry of the underlying manifold domain to learn manifold-valued factors that faithfully represent characteristic features of the data in the original domain. At the same time, our method operates on a tangent space of the underlying manifold, so it only requires the computation of relatively few manifold mappings. We provide an iterative algorithm to compute CC-NMDF, which alternates between solving a linear system and a multiplicative update. In our experiments, we find that CC-NMDF produces manifold-valued factors that are interpretable as characteristic features of the input dataset. Our work opens the door to adapting variants of NMF to manifold-valued data, enabling more powerful and interpretable processing of these data that remain faithful to the geometry of the data. Future work on manifold NMF-type methods should also investigate how to choose an appropriate base point for general manifolds, since data on compact manifolds may not admit a base point that satisfies our proposed heuristic.
