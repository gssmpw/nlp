% - publication bias & spin generally in medical literature (outside of NLP)
\paragraph{Spin in medical literature} Classification and prevalence of spin in medical literature has been studied extensively. 
In this literature, spin is commonly defined in one or more of the following ways: (1) Distorting the interpretation of results to present them more favorably, resulting in misleading conclusions; (2) Discrepancies between results and their favorable interpretation; (3) Attributing causality when the study design does not support it; and (4) Inappropriate extrapolation of results ____.

A systematic review revealed that spin is more prevalent in trials with nonsignificant primary outcomes and those with a higher risk of bias, such as nonrandomized studies ____. For instance, $\sim$60\% of RCTs with nonsignificant primary outcomes that were evaluated featured spin in their abstracts. 
Beyond RCTs, spin has also been identified as a common issue in systematic reviews and meta-analyses ____. Research has demonstrated the presence of spin across various medical disciplines, including oncology ____, psychiatry and psychology ____, dental care ____, wound care ____, cardiovascular medicine ____, rheumatology ____, obesity research ____, and emergency medicine ____.

% - NLP for detecting spin 
\paragraph{NLP for detecting spin} One of the earliest efforts in automated spin detection was by ____, who proposed a pipeline that used rule-based and deep learning methods to identify key entities and comparative sentences (e.g., ``Treatment A was better than treatment B in terms of efficacy.'') to analyze RCT abstracts from PubMed.
This laid the foundation for subsequent research, including the creation of a corpus of biomedical articles annotated for spin ____ and the development of DeSpin, a prototype tool designed to assist authors and reviewers in detecting spin in RCT abstracts ____. 
DeSpin adopted a combination of rule-based methods and machine learning models---BERT ____, BioBERT ____, and SciBERT ____---to extract trial design information and identify spin. 
Our work extends this line of inquiry, evaluating modern LLMs for spin-related tasks.

% - NLP for summarizing/simplifying medical texts
\paragraph{NLP for simplifying medical texts} Several studies have explored the use of NLP technologies to simplify medical texts, which are often laden with jargon, to make them more accessible to lay readers ____. Recent advancements in deep learning and LLMs have enabled the simplification of medical abstracts ____ and patient notes, including radiology reports ____. An interactive tool has also been developed to provide simplified summaries of medical articles, assisting lay readers in understanding complex medical texts ____. Additionally, efforts have been made to improve evaluation methods for medical text simplification by creating high-quality corpora ____. However, existing work does not address spin in medical literature.
