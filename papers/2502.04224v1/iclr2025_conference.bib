The dataset includes: (1) 269,648 images and the associated tags from Flickr, with a total of 5,018 unique tags; (2) six types of low-level features extracted from these images, including 64-D color histogram, 144-D color correlogram, 73-D edge direction histogram, 128-D wavelet texture, 225-D block-wise color moments extracted over 5x5 fixed grid partitions, and 500-D bag of words based on SIFT descriptions; and (3) ground-truth for 81 concepts that can be used for evaluation. Based on this dataset, we highlight characteristics of Web image collections and identify four research issues on web image annotation and retrieval. We also provide the baseline results for web image annotation by learning from the tags using the traditional k-NN algorithm. The benchmark results indicate that it is possible to learn effective models from sufficiently large image dataset to facilitate general image retrieval.},

abstract = {Deep learning models for graphs have achieved strong performance for the task of node classification. Despite their proliferation, currently there is no study of their robustness to adversarial attacks. Yet, in domains where they are likely to be used, e.g. the web, adversaries are common. Can deep learning models for graphs be easily fooled? In this work, we introduce the first study of adversarial attacks on attributed graphs, specifically focusing on models exploiting ideas of graph convolutions. In addition to attacks at test time, we tackle the more challenging class of poisoning/causative attacks, which focus on the training phase of a machine learning model.We generate adversarial perturbations targeting the node's features and the graph structure, thus, taking the dependencies between instances in account. Moreover, we ensure that the perturbations remain unnoticeable by preserving important data characteristics. To cope with the underlying discrete domain we propose an efficient algorithm Nettack exploiting incremental computations. Our experimental study shows that accuracy of node classification significantly drops even when performing only few perturbations. Even more, our attacks are transferable: the learned attacks generalize to other state-of-the-art node classification models and unsupervised approaches, and likewise are successful even when only limited knowledge about the graph is given.},

abstract = {In Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the graph structure is incorporated into the learning of node representations. This complex structure makes explaining GNNs' predictions become much more challenging. In this paper, we propose PGM-Explainer, a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) model-agnostic explainer for GNNs. Given a prediction to be explained, PGM-Explainer identifies crucial graph components and generates an explanation in form of a PGM approximating that prediction. Different from existing explainers for GNNs where the explanations are drawn from a set of linear functions of explained features, PGM-Explainer is able to demonstrate the dependencies of explained features in form of conditional probabilities. Our theoretical analysis shows that the PGM generated by PGM-Explainer includes the Markov-blanket of the target prediction, i.e. including all its statistical information. We also show that the explanation returned by PGM-Explainer contains the same set of independence statements in the perfect map. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that PGM-Explainer achieves better performance than existing explainers in many benchmark tasks.},

abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as revolutionary technologies for machine learning tasks on graphs. In GNNs, the graph structure is generally incorporated with node representation via the message passing scheme, making the explanation much more challenging. Given a trained GNN model, a GNN explainer aims to identify a most influential subgraph to interpret the prediction of an instance (e.g., a node or a graph), which is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem over graph. The existing works solve this problem by continuous relaxation or search-based heuristics. But they suffer from key issues such as violation of message passing and hand-crafted heuristics, leading to inferior interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a RL-enhanced GNN explainer, RG-Explainer, which consists of three main components: starting point selection, iterative graph generation and stopping criteria learning. RG-Explainer could construct a connected explanatory subgraph by sequentially adding nodes from the boundary of the current generated graph, which is consistent with the message passing scheme. Further, we design an effective seed locator to select the starting point, and learn stopping criteria to generate superior explanations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets show that RG-Explainer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN explainers. Moreover, RG-Explainer can be applied in the inductive setting, demonstrating its better generalization ability.},

abstract = {Graph-based classification methods are widely used for security analytics. Roughly speaking, graph-based classification methods include collective classification and graph neural network. Attacking a graph-based classification method enables an attacker to evade detection in security analytics. However, existing adversarial machine learning studies mainly focused on machine learning for non-graph data. Only a few recent studies touched adversarial graph-based classification methods. However, they focused on graph neural network, leaving collective classification largely unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap in this work. We consider an attacker's goal is to evade detection via manipulating the graph structure. We formulate our attack as a graph-based optimization problem, solving which produces the edges that an attacker needs to manipulate to achieve its attack goal. However, it is computationally challenging to solve the optimization problem exactly. To address the challenge, we propose several approximation techniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and compare them with a recent attack designed for graph neural networks using four graph datasets. Our results show that our attacks can effectively evade graph-based classification methods. Moreover, our attacks outperform the existing attack for evading collective classification methods and some graph neural network methods.},

abstract = {Graph databases have become a common infrastructure component. Yet existing systems either operate on offline snapshots, provide weak consistency guarantees, or use expensive concurrency control techniques that limit performance.In this paper, we introduce a new distributed graph database, called Weaver, which enables efficient, transactional graph analyses as well as strictly serializable ACID transactions on dynamic graphs. The key insight that allows Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal scalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called refinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps with a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency only when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain explorer that is 8x faster than Blockchain.info, and achieves 10.9x higher throughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4x lower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads.},
