We propose the first provably robust XGNN (\emph{\name}) against graph perturbation attacks. {\name} first generates multiple hybrid subgraphs for a given graph (via hash mapping) such that only a bounded number of these subgraphs can be affected when the graph is adversarially perturbed. 
We then build a robust voting classifier and a robust voting explainer to aggregate the prediction and explanation results on the hybrid subgraphs. 
Finally, we can derive the robustness guarantee based on the built voting classifier and voting explainer against worst-case graph perturbation attacks  with bounded perturbations. Experimental results on multiple datasets and GNN classifiers/explainers validate the effectiveness of our {\name}.   
{In future work, we will enhance the certified robustness with better subgraph generation strategies and design node permutation invariant certified defenses.}
