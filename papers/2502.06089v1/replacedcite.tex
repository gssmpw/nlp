\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Computable Learnability.}
Following the work of ____, who showed that the learnability of certain basic learning problems is undecidable within ZFC, ____ formally integrated the notion of computability within the standard PAC learning framework of ____.
This novel set-up,  called \emph{computable} PAC (CPAC) learning, requires that both learners and the hypotheses they output be computable.
With follow-up works by ____ and ____, CPAC learnability in the binary classification setting was shown to be fully characterized by the finiteness of the \emph{effective} VC dimension, formally defined by ____.
Computability has since been studied in the context of different learning problems: ____ extended CPAC learning to continuous domains, ____ and ____ to online learning, and  ____ to adversarially robust learning.


\paragraph{Multiclass Learnability.}
While the study of computable learnability is a very recent field of study, multiclass learnability has been the subject of extensive research efforts in the past decades.
In the binary classification setting, the VC dimension characterizes PAC learnability ____.
However, the landscape of learnability in the multiclass setting is much more complex.
The PAC framework was extended to the multiclass setting in the works of ____ and ____, which gave a lower bound with respect to the Natarajan dimension, and an upper with the graph dimension.
Later, ____ generalized the notion of dimension for multiclass learning, and provided a meta-characterization of learnability: (only) dimensions that are \emph{distinguishers} characterize learnability in the finite label space setting, with distinguishers encompassing both the Natarajan and graph dimensions.
____ later generalized the Sauer-Shelah-Perles Lemma for these families of functions.
____, originally ____, identified ``good'' and ``bad'' ERMs with vastly different sample complexities, which, in the case of infinite label space, leads to learning scenarios where the ERM principle fails.
____ introduced a new dimension, the DS dimension, which they proved was a necessary condition for learnability. 
The breakthrough work of ____ closed the problem by showing it is also sufficient for arbitrary label space.
Different multiclass methods and learning paradigms have moreover been explored by ____.
Finally, multiclass PAC learning has also been studied in relation to boosting ____, universal learning rates ____, sample compression  ____ and regularization ____.
