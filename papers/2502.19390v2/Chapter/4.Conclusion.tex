\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose missing MRI generative
model that utilizes multi-modal contrastive learning and an additional segmentation decoder.
Our model effectively leverages crucial information from integrated multi-source modalities through the multi-modal contrastive learning.
By incorporating the segmentation decoder, we enhance the precision of tumor region generation.
Through high SSIM scores, we have demonstrated that our model generated high-quality images. Furthermore, the reported visual results of the generated images further confirms the effectiveness of our model.
Consequently, our method achieved superior performance in the BraSyn challenge, highlighting its efficacy in generating accurate and reliable target modality images.
