        \textbf{Workflow for Dental Panoramic Radiograph Collection and Assessment Study.}
        Dental panoramic radiographs were collected from three geographic locations, totaling $\num{6669}$ studies: $\num{5245}$ from the Netherlands, $\num{1173}$ from Brazil, and $\num{251}$ from Taiwan.
        The initial data repositories before exclusion was much larger, with ``$\approx$'' denoting their original sizes.
        Data from the Netherlands were divided into a training set for artificial intelligence (AI) training and validation, and a test set designated as the \emph{internal test set}.
        Both the Brazil and Taiwan data sets were utilized exclusively as \emph{external test sets} for evaluation.
        The AI system was trained and validated on $\num{4044}$ imaging cases from the Netherlands, and was tasked with analyzing all three test sets to assess its generalizability.
        Additionally, both AI and dentists read a randomly selected subset of the Taiwan data to facilitate a comparative analysis of performance.
