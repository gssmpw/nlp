        \textbf{Comparison of AI System Performance with Human Readers on Dental Finding Assessment in Taiwan.}
        This figure presents the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the AI system alongside the performance of 4 human readers on the Taiwan* test subset.
        Each plot displays a specific dental finding, with the shaded vertical areas representing the 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for sensitivity along the ROC curve.
        The AI system’s operating point, indicated by ``×'', was determined by maximizing the $\textrm{F}_2$ score on a held-out validation set, tailored for screening scenarios.
        Figure insets magnify the critical regions of interest within each graph, providing a detailed view of performance near the operating point.
