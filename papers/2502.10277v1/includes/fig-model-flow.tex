        \textbf{Overview of the Data Modalities and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Workflow.}
        This schematic illustrates the AI process flow, beginning with dental panoramic radiographs (DPRs) as the primary input and culminating in a detailed finding assessment that labels whether each of the 8 findings is present in each of the 32 teeth (hence 256 binary labels per image).
        The AI system operated through three main stages: dental finding localization, tooth index classification, and post-processing.
        For AI training, we utilized contour labels annotated by general dental practitioners on the Netherlands training set.
        Note that only positive finding labels are shown in the finding assessment in the workflow, and for each positive finding, it is indicated by a finding type and a tooth number, which was annotated using the \emph{FDI World Dental Federation} notation, or, \emph{ISO-3950} notation in this study.
        The FDI notation categorizes teeth into four quadrants, each having eight teeth, resulting in a number ranging from 11 to 48.
