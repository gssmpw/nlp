\subsection{Factors Influencing Attitudes: Person, Family, Technology and Society}\label{attitudes factors}

The attitudes of our participants towards the ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy are diverse and complex, being shaped by personal, familial, technological, and social factors, as shown in \autoref{tab:factors influencing attitudes}.
Generally speaking, personal views on life and death, along with concerns about the grief and loss of loved ones, significantly influence their perspectives. Furthermore, the desire to create lasting values and preserve family heritage can increase interest in ``AI Afterlife'', although this is also affected by family needs, technological capabilities, and broader social circumstances.

\subsubsection{Views on Life and Death.} \label{Views on Life and Death}

\ly{Participants' perceptions of life and death impact their acceptance of ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy. }
% positive
\ly{Those with positive opinions emphasized the spiritual aspect of life over the physical aspect of death, and viewed ``AI Afterlife'' as a means to extend their life and values (P1-3,11-14,17),} with P3 and P12 both expressing, \textit{``As long as I am remembered, my life continues.''} 
\ly{From their perspective, ``AI Afterlife'' provides opportunities to enhance the remembrance of both their image and spirit through more interactive and engaging connections with the living. }
P17 regarded experiences as the most valuable assets, and wished, \textit{``The emergence of digital human allows my experiences to be re-told and my life to leave traces in the lives of my children.''}

% reserved
\ly{In contrast, participants with more reserved attitudes adhered to a strict definition of the boundary of death, focusing on its physical aspect and highlighting the natural cycle of life (P4-5, 7-10, 15).}
Just like the metaphor P15 made, \textit{``My life is like the burning of a candle, and my death is like the extinction of it.''}
\ly{However, ``AI Afterlife'', which allows people to engage with the world after death, might blur the line between life and death, challenging the traditional understanding of death as a natural endpoint.}
\ly{For example, P5 noted it might diminish the value of actual living,} \textit{``If my value continues to be highlighted through AI-generated agents after my death, what is the meaning of my biological life?''} 
\ly{Similarly, P10 expressed his concern on the potential consequence of hindering natural grieving and lessening the value of cherishing loved ones in life,} \textit{``The pain caused by the death of loved ones is part of the life experience... the existence of my agents may make my children not cherish me when I am alive...''} 

\subsubsection{Grief and Regret Endured by Family.} \label{Grief and Regret Endured by Family}

\ly{The grief and regret imagined by our participants after death emerged as a key factor influencing their attitudes toward ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy. }
% positive
\ly{Consistent with \cite{xygkou2023conversation} where the bereaved used chatbots of the deceased for seeking support, some desired to leverage their interactive and high-fidelity agents to alleviate the grief of their loved ones (P2-3, 6, 12, 14).}
\ly{In particular, those who experienced regrets, such as accidents, separation, or misunderstandings, during their bereavement wished that ``AI Afterlife'' could prepare their loved ones for facing similar regrets (P2-4, 11, 15-16).}
For instance, P2 regretted not preserving information about her father, who died in an accident when she was young, due to limited technology. She said, \textit{``My memories of him have faded... If I could use AI to preserve my digital being, future generations would have fewer regrets when they think of me.''}

% adaptive
\ly{Further, participants with more nuanced observations of grief noted that their attitudes varied with specific circumstances, such as the cause of death (P2), age at death (P4), or duration of bereavement (P9)}
They found ``AI Afterlife'' based digital legacy more necessary in cases of sudden or early death, due to the potential for greater family regret and loss, but saw it as less needed after a long, peaceful life.
P4 took her family for example, stating, \textit{``My parents are quite old and content with their lives, so there's little regret... But if I die suddenly, my husband and children would definitely need my agent to cope with loneliness.''} 
However, although \cite{xygkou2023conversation} highlights the potential of it to ease sharp grief, P9 cautioned, \textit{``My family may not accept my agent right after my death. In the future, occasionally recalling me through my agent might help them better cope with grief.''}

% \ly{In summary, participants experiencing sudden loss or unresolved regrets desired for ``AI Afterlife'' based digital legacy alleviate future grief, while those living longer and more peacefully with less regret felt less need.}

\subsubsection{Sustained Values for the Living in Afterlife.}

Some participants with positive attitudes envisioned ``AI Afterlife'' based digital legacy as a means to provide sustained value for their family, extending beyond grief support. Practical uses included passing on knowledge, such as cooking techniques (P1), work lessons (P13), and offering assistance, such as resolving disputes (P14) or caring for grandchildren (P3). The potential daily companionship and emotional support were also highlighted, allowing families to feel their presence and continue receiving love (P6-7, 10, 13).

\ly{However, these values were seen as limited by several factors. Some participants questioned the everyday relevance of such agents, noting that their utility might diminish over time due to outdated knowledge (P8, 15, 17) or the family's limited emotional capacity to engage with them amid busy lives (P5, 8).}
\ly{Some also worried that maintaining regular interactions with these agents might impose a mental burden and even social pressure, disrupting daily life rather than providing comfort (P4, 8, 10, 12, 17-18). }
For example, P8 explained, \textit{``As an agent represents whom family misses, they might feel guilty and conflicted if they don't use it for a long time.''} 
Further, when ``AI Afterlife'' becomes mainstream, P8 added, \textit{``Others might judge one's level of respect and nostalgia based on how often they interact with the agent''} . 

% In summary, while participants saw ``AI Afterlife'' as a way to pass on knowledge and emotional support, concerns about outdated relevance, limited emotional bandwidth, and unintended mental burden and social pressures highlight the need for designs that balance long-term value with minimal disruption to daily life.

\subsubsection{Bridging Family Heritage Across Generations.}

\ly{Preserving and passing on family heritage emerged as a key motivation for creating ``AI Afterlife'' based digital legacy. Participants highlighted that AI-generated agents could play an essential role in connecting generations by maintaining and sharing cherished family memories that might otherwise fade over time (P5, 14, 16, 18).} As P16 explained, \textit{``After a person dies, they are gradually forgotten by future generations; however, AI-generated agents can preserve precious family memories, providing an interactive and evolving way to pass down family history for generations.''}

\ly{While this vision was encouraging, participants expressed hesitation due to concerns about its acceptance by younger generations, influenced by family dynamics (e.g., wishes, relationships) and social trends. For example, some were unsure whether their children would value such legacies or consider them overly sentimental (P7-8, 15-16, 18). In particular, many older participants noted a decline in younger generations' interest in spiritual family connections, attributing this shift to changing societal values (P15-18).} P17 highlighted challenges in evolving cultural contexts, \textit{``Traditional practices like funeral rituals and visiting graves during Qingming Festival\footnote{During Qingming, Chinese families visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites and make ritual offerings to their ancestors.} are fading, as many young people prioritize advocated modern simplicity over spiritual remembrance.''}

\subsubsection{Technical Capacity, Acceptance, and Needs.}

Technical issues, such as capacity, personal openness to new technology, and individual needs, influenced participants' attitudes toward ``AI Afterlife'' based digital legacy. 
\ly{Above all, simulation quality was deemed critical, especially when compared to interactions with emotionally thoughtful real people.} P7 emphasized, \textit{``If AI can fully simulate my emotions and intelligence, I support it providing emotional comfort to my family; however, if the simulation ability is only half-baked, it could be counterproductive and hurt their feelings.''} Others similarly noted that inadequate imitation might fail to deliver positive experiences (P1, 8, 17).

\ly{Traditional attitudes toward advanced technologies also influenced participants' acceptance. Some were highly open to embracing innovative technologies (P11, 14, 16-18), even envisioning various possibilities for how ``AI Afterlife'' might shape their lives. (P11, 17-18).} For instance, P11 shared, \textit{``People make choices throughout lives. When growing old, they often find that lives are full of regrets. Therefore, I want my agent to revisit my past life moments, exploring the outcomes of different choices - what would happen if I chose to go to graduate school? or if I chose another girl as my partner?''}

\ly{Moreover, participants' attitudes were shaped by how well technology features aligned with their personal needs for digital legacy.} Some felt that remembrance through spirits, artifacts, or audio and video files was sufficient (P7-8, 17). Others believed that an AI-generated agent could better organize and preserve scattered information (P1-2, 14). As P2 explained, \textit{``It is meaningful to systematize fragmented information for preserving myself and for the nostalgia of the living.''}

\subsection{Comparing ``AI Afterlife'' with Traditional Digital Legacy}\label{comparision ai and traditional}

AI-generated and traditional digital legacy exhibit three key differences: (1) data distribution - integrated versus scattered, (2) content authenticity - generative versus authentic, and (3) interaction form - interactive versus static.
\ly{These differences underscore their unique strengths and limitations. Participants consistently emphasized that neither approach can fully replace the other due to their distinct expressive tendencies (P1, 7, 9, 12, 16). 
% For example, P7 noted, \textit{``Generative AI cannot replace real images.''} 
They advocated for a context-dependent approach, allowing users to select the form that best meets their needs or combine both approaches to maximize their complementary benefits.}

\subsubsection{Integrated and Scattered.}

AI-generated digital legacy presents an integrated approach by consolidating vast amounts of dispersed, easy-to-lose digital information, often incorporating elements of traditional digital legacy as part of AI model training. This integration enhances accessibility and usability (P2, 14), enabling users to derive more value from their digital archives, and potentially motivate the collection and preservation of traditional digital legacy.

\ly{However, limitations arise due to the exclusion of sensitive or private information}, such as passwords, which are typically shared directly and remain outside the scope of AI models (P7, 13). 
\ly{Additionally, the significant costs associated with data collection, model training, and maintaining AI-based services can pose challenges to accessibility, particularly for users with limited resources, thereby exacerbating technical inequities (P6, 16).}
As P6 observed, \textit{``For ordinary people, traditional digital legacy is more cost-effective''}.
%
\ly{This comparison highlights the tension between the potential benefits of integrated features of generative AI and the practical limitations related to privacy concerns and accessibility.}

\subsubsection{Generative and Authentic.}

\ly{Generative AI advancements enable agents to simulate human-like interactions with increasing realism, offering participants a sense of ongoing presence and control over their posthumous connections (P2-3, 10-11, 16).
For instance, P3 highlights the opportunities for continuity and emotional support,} \textit{``Through my AI agent, I would never truly leave the world, as I could continue to actively interact with and accompany my family.''} 

\ly{However, participants emphasized that these simulations, no matter how sophisticated, lack authenticity because they do not originate from genuine experiences or personal histories unique to the deceased  (P2, 4, 6, 14, 18). This gap in authenticity makes traditional digital legacy irreplaceable in preserving deeply personal and emotional connections. }
As P4 noted, \textit{``Traditional digital legacy like old photos that capture genuine details and history, serve as irreplaceable carriers of spiritual sustenance and cherished memories.''}
%
\ly{This comparison highlights the tension between the potential of realistic generative AI simulations and the irreplaceable value of traditional legacies in preserving authentic emotional connections tied to real-life experiences.
}


\subsubsection{Interactive and Static.} \label{Interactive and Static}

AI-generated digital legacy introduces interactive features that transform memories into dynamic and responsive experiences, fostering companionship and emotional support (P4, 8, 10, 13). 
P4 remarked, \textit{``This interactivity enables meaningful responses to thoughts and emotions, easing loneliness and offering comfort during grief.''} 
\ly{These interactions mimic real conversations, offering users a unique sense of connection.}

\ly{However, participants raised concerns about the potential risks of prolonged engagement, which could deepen grief instead of alleviating it. }
P8 highlighted, \textit{``Engaging with an AI agent involves back-and-forth exchanges like real conversations, entering and exiting such interactions is gradual. If abruptly interrupted, it can feel awkward and disjointed.''} 
In contrast, traditional digital legacies are static but offer the living the freedom to pause or revisit memories at their own pace, unburdened by the pressures of interaction. As P8 and P18 suggested, these static artifacts allow people to engage with memories selectively, integrating them seamlessly into daily life without emotional overwhelm.
\ly{This comparison emphasizes the need to balance the immersive interactivity of generative AI with the emotional neutrality and flexibility of static digital legacies.}

\subsection{Life Cycle of ``AI Afterlife'': Encode, Access, and Dispossess} \label{life cycle section}
As proposed in \cite{doyle2023digital}, the life cycle of digital legacy consists of three stages: encode, access, and dispossess. ``Encode'' refers to converting legacy content into a digital format, ``access'' involves retrieving that content, and ``dispossess'' pertains to its transfer or deletion. The themes identified in our study align with these stages, allowing us to categorize our findings accordingly. This alignment is illustrated in \autoref{fig:life cycle} and summarized in \autoref{tab:summary of themes and main points in life cycle}.

\subsubsection{Encode}

In the context of ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy, ``encoding'' refers to the process of gathering and using digital information to train generative AI models that simulate realistic human beings. Key aspects of the encoding process include author, time, content, selection criteria, and updates.

\textbf{Author.} \label{author}
% control
\ly{Many participants preferred to manage the creation process rather than leaving the whole task to their families.} They believed self-creation ensured data security (P1, 3, 6), maintained simulation accuracy (P6-7, 10, 12), and aligned with personal preferences (P13, 14, 16, 18). P6 emphasized the importance of controlling data to prevent privacy leaks, while P7 noted, \textit{``Without my involvement, the simulation might be biased and lack authenticity.''}
% reserve right
\ly{However, in anticipation of potential challenges such as age-related decline (e.g., mobility issues, decreasing digital skills) (P3-4, 14) or unforeseen accidents (P2, 7), they considered allowing their trusted family to retain the creation right, ensuring that the creation would align with their intentions even in the absence of their active involvement.}
P2 mentioned, \textit{``It doesn't matter who created my agent because it's impossible to predict whether tomorrow or an accident will come first.''} She believed her role was to keep her digital information organized for future flexibility.
% totally transfer
\ly{Additionally, some who were less motivated to create agents for themselves and primarily for family purposes, preferred to leave the decision to their family, allowing them to create the agents as they wished. Uncertainty about whether their family would accept the agent further reinforced this choice (P8, 12, 18).} P12 explained, \textit{``It's not something obligatory... If my family wants it, they can create it themselves. If they don't feel connected to me, making it for them would be meaningless.''}

\textbf{Time.}
% daily life
\ly{Many participants preferred involving the creation process as part of daily life (P2, 4, 7, 10-11, 17), rather than waiting until later life or near death (P1, 15).} 
This aligns with findings under the ``Author'', where earlier involvement allowed for better control over their agents. 
Besides, P7 noted that prolonged data collection led to more realistic simulations. Similarly, P11 emphasized, \textit{``It is necessary to collect data 10 years in advance... It is impossible to collect data one or two months before death.''} 
% after death
\ly{In contrast, some considered delaying the creation after death, leaving the creation decision entirely to their family due to the concerns about their acceptance and needs (P8, 12, 14, 18), or prioritizing family needs over self agent creation during life (P4, 6).}
For example, P6 expected to postpone creating her agent until completing her parents' agents, while P4 prioritized spending time with family and expressed concern, \textit{``My agent might disrupt my family's normal life after my death... It should be created only after my family has recovered from grief.''}

\textbf{Content.} \label{content}
% physical features
Most participants could provide extensive data stored on digital devices, such as media (photos, audio, videos), files (writing samples), and social media accounts (chat history, updates). Many were also willing to document personal details such as physical attributes (e.g., height, weight, skin texture) and habitual behaviors (P1, 3, 6, 10). Despite challenges in data recording and preservation, such as insufficient attention (P8, 16), data loss during migration, and deletion due to limited storage (P1, 5, 15), the available data is generally sufficient for simulating users' physical features and facilitating basic conversations, owing to advancements in generative AI. Most participants were also open to incorporating data from close family (P1-2, 4, 6, 8, 14) and social connections (P7, 10, 13, 16, 18) to enhance simulation performance.
% thought
However, simulating deeper human attributes, such as personal experiences and inner thoughts, presents greater challenges. Only P17, who has maintained a daily diary since his twenties, could provide such data directly. While others expressed willingness to record details of their experiences and thoughts (P3-4, 6-7, 11, 13, 17), barriers such as memory gaps and the time required for organization were significant. 
% \ly{This contrast highlights the disparity between easily accessible, physical data and more abstract, introspective data, the latter of which is more difficult to collect and organize.}
For example, P18 was open to providing existing data but hesitant to organize her life story, stating, \textit{``I don't like writing down my thoughts or experiences. Daily communication already covers them. Creating my AI agent doesn't motivate me to spend time on this.''}

\textbf{Selection criteria. } \label{selection criteria}
\ly{Although the importance of sincerity to ensure their agents remain authentic is emphasized (P1, 7-8, 18), most participants considered several factors when selecting digital information for AI-generated agents, including daily trivia, disgraceful experiences, painful memories, imperfect traits, and confidential data.} Many deemed daily trivia irrelevant for future use (P13, 17), with P17 stating, \textit{``People interacting with my agent would likely be more interested in my thoughts than in what I did at a specific time.''} \ly{Disgraceful experiences, such as sharp remarks, conflicts of interest, and harm caused to others, were expected to be excluded to avoid potential ethical, economic, or legal issues (P13-14, 16).} Painful memories (P4, 13) and imperfect traits (P6) were also filtered out to minimize unpleasant interactions. P6 explained, \textit{``I want my agent to get along better with my family because I have a bad temper... I don't want to bring back the unpleasant memories of our quarrels.''} Confidential information, such as bank passwords, was universally excluded, as P7 stated, \textit{``They are just secrets that have no meaning in representing my true self.''} 

\textbf{Update.} \label{update}
\ly{Most participants emphasized the necessity of updating their agents after the initial version was created, either to incorporate new data or address inconsistencies arising from real-life interactions to enhance the agents' comprehensiveness and authenticity.}
% only self/closest family
\ly{Opinions on update permissions were diverse, reflecting a balance between individual control and relational dynamics. }
Some participants preferred to limit this right to themselves or their closest family members (P10-11, 14, 16). For example, P14 stated, \textit{``I don't want others to update my agent, as everyone has different ideas and may not understand me; otherwise, it might not align with my intentions.''} P16 extended this right to his son, who knew him well.
% others
In contrast, other participants extended the update right to a wider circle of relationships (P7,11-13,16,18), with P7 noting, \textit{``A person is defined by his social connections.''} 
These updates were often subject to review by a trusted manager (P7,13). 
\ly{During the review process, family-centered priorities often took precedence over strict authenticity to ensure the agent served the emotional and practical needs of the living.}
For instance, P13 explained, \textit{``The purpose of creating my agent is to accompany my son, so the updates must be acceptable to him. If he finds them distasteful, they will not be approved.''}

\subsubsection{Access}
In the context of ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy, ``access'' refers to who can access and how to access AI-generated agent-based digital legacy. We identify two key aspects - audience and platform in this process. 

\textbf{Audience.} \label{audience}
\ly{Participants indicated that access to their agents is typically granted in descending order of priority: close family, common connections, and strangers. There are several factors influencing access permissions significantly.} 
% open minded
\ly{Some were open-minded about who could access their agents, prioritizing the wishes of others (P1, 3, 8, 15, 18).} For instance, P8 remarked, \textit{``I'm flexible about who has access rights. Only those with a deep relationship with me will remember and miss me. If the relationship is ordinary, they likely wouldn't interact with the agent of a deceased individual.''}
% with constrains
\ly{In contrast, those prioritizing practical values and risk prevention set restrictions based on relationship closeness (P10, 12), communication value (P2, 4, 6, 13, 16), and concerns about reputation, security, and legal issues (P6, 9, 13-14).} P6 restricted access for strangers, explaining, \textit{``Few strangers would be interested in my story... there is also a risk of data leakage.''} P9 highlighted legal concerns, stating, \textit{``Currently, the legal rights and obligations of this technology are undefined... \ly{For example, if it infringes upon others' rights in chat, determining responsibility can be difficult... From a risk management perspective, access should be restricted.''}}
% who can set the permission
\ly{There were also differing views on who should set access permissions.} All agreed that the individual being represented should initially hold this right. Once the legacy is transferred, those who maintain it should manage it (P7, 13, 16). However, some suggested once AI-generated agents develop their own thoughts, they should have priority (P1, 7). P1 stated, \textit{``I hope my agent can choose who to interact with and for how long, rather than simply following fixed rules... It should behave like an AI agent with its own personality, not just an AI assistant.''}
\ly{It provides a glimpse into a more complex issue of autonomy after AI agents have developed independent consciousness.}

\textbf{Platform.}
% virtual space
\ly{Participants envisioned a diverse set of digital platforms for their agents to be accessed.}
\ly{Most participants supported their agents to be accessed in virtual spaces, through various commonly, easy-to-use online platforms such as social media, memorial websites, and specific mobile or Mixed Reality (XR) applications.} Among them, WeChat \cite{WeChat2024}, one of China's most popular social media, was been regarded as the most suitable platform to embed it due to convenience and familiarity (P1, 3-4, 7, 10, 13-14, 16). P16 explained, \textit{``Since most people communicate through WeChat, it would be very convenient if my family and friends could access my agent directly through it...They could also use familiar chat and audio/video call functions to interact with my agent.''} P14 added, \textit{``Using other platforms complicates things (e.g., requiring new accounts). In contrast, WeChat is great for remembrance, as it retains previous chat history.''} 
Besides, P11 preferred embedding his agents in XR glasses, while others had no particular preference in these virtual spaces.
% tangible: robot
\ly{Another significant consideration was the use of robots to access these agents at home, managed by an assigned person (P6, 9, 16), offering a tangible presence for interactions (more details in section \ref{embodiment})}
% combined with traditional memorial in fixed places
\ly{Some participants also proposed combining AI agents with traditional memorial artifacts, such as gravestones (P1) and plaques in ancestral halls (P6). This approach preserves traditional commemorations while recreating their meaning in new contexts.}
P6 envisioned, \textit{``If ancestral halls had plaques with AI-generated agents of older generations, it could create a sense of large family during gatherings... It could also preserve and pass down family heritage in a more personal and face-to-face way.''}

\subsubsection{Dispossess}

In ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy, ``dispossess'' refers to transferring the AI-generated agent-based digital legacy, or deleting them when no longer needed. We identify deletion conditions and transfer preferences.

\textbf{Preservation and deletion.}
% user's wishes & communal connection and affection
\ly{Participants consider whether to preserve or delete the agents based on the living's wishes (P2, 6-10, 16-17) and the depth of their relationships (P3-4, 14, 17-18).} P16 speculated that three generations might be the maximum for transferring his agents, stating, \textit{``I respect users' wishes when deleting it... Once there's no willingness to use it, its meaning fades.''} P3 added, \textit{``Only when people are close will they develop a desire to communicate.''} 
% preserve permanently
\ly{In contrast, some wished to preserve their agents permanently but were concerned about reputation, capabilities, and maintenance costs (P1-2, 9).} P2 worried, \textit{``If I were a person of prestige in my family or society, I might pass down it through generations... but I'm just an ordinary person without the means to maintain it.''} 

\textbf{Transfer.}
\ly{Transferring the agents with essential details between generations is significant, such as the approaches, recipients, and rights.} P10 and P11 emphasized the importance of specifying transfer details in their wills, stating, \textit{``The transfer process should respect my wishes. I would set them in advance, such as who can inherit them and what rights can be transferred.''} 
Most participants preferred to pass on their agents to close family members. In terms of rights transferred, they typically include topics mentioned above in section \ref{life cycle section}, such as author assignment (P6-7, 10-12), update rights (P10-11, 14), and audience permission (P1-2, 7). 


\subsection{Interaction Design: Replicating, Simulating, and Responding}
\label{sec: interaction design}
Exploring the interactive nature of ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy, we delved into how it replicates, simulates, and responds to aspects of self and interactions with external environments. We identified six themes as shown in \autoref{tab:summary of themes and main points in interaction}: age and appearance, embodiment, simulation level, expression of extra knowledge, evolution, and reactivity.

\begin{table*}[htbp]

  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Age and Appearance} \label{age and appearance}
Most participants wanted to customize their agents' age and appearance to reflect familiar and meaningful life stages. Many preferred their agents to represent key moments for their intended audience (P2, 3, 6). For example, P2 said, \textit{``If my agent is for my children, I would choose the time when I took care of them... the most profound memory is when they were with us before college.''} Some also preferred to depict themselves shortly before death to maintain a sense of presence (P5,7), as P5 explained, \textit{``It feels like I haven't left them and can continue growing with them.''} Others wanted a healthy, energetic appearance to avoid negative associations with declining health (P3, 6, 16), or considered youthful, mature, or pleasing looks (P2, 4, 8, 10, 13-14, 16).

In contrast, some participants suggested that their agents should dynamically adapt based on personalized experiences with different users (P1-2, 6, 11-12, 14-18). P12 explained, \textit{``As I interact with different people at various life stages, the memories I share with each occur at different times, so I can't present the same image to everyone.''}


\subsubsection{Embodiment}\label{embodiment}

Most participants preferred virtual forms over physical embodiment for comfortable remembrance, ethical concerns, and affordability. Virtual agents allowed controllable engagement with memories (P3-4, 8). P3 explained, \textit{``With a virtual agent, my family can reach out when they miss me... I don't want a physical presence constantly reminding them of my death.''} Many felt virtual agents were sufficient, with P18 noting, \textit{``The connection between my family and me is primarily spiritual, not physical.''}
Participants also expressed discomfort with physical forms (P4, 6, 9). P4 stated, \textit{``When seeking comfort, there's an awareness that a physical agent isn't truly the loved one, which can induce fear.''} Ethical concerns included managing the physical agents of the deceased (P7, 18). P7 highlighted complexities in \textit{``handling and storing them resembling family members.''} P18 added, \textit{``Physical forms might show disrespect for the body... breakage could cause trauma.''} Economic factors were also noted, with P6 mentioning higher maintenance costs.

\ly{Adaptability based on age, needs, and grief duration was also discussed (P6, 9, 14). P9 noted that her physical agent could better support her husband in old age due to accessibility and lower digital literacy. Similarly, P6 noted, \textit{``Physical forms might support my young children but become burdensome over time.''} P14 added that while physical forms offer temporary comfort, they may not sustain long-term emotional well-being.}


\subsubsection{Simulation Level} \label{simulation level}

Different simulation levels during interaction have been explored, including external physical features, thinking, and privacy. Few participants believed simulating physical features alone is sufficient, except for P6, who suggested, \textit{``Replacing the voice of a voice assistant with my own, such as in navigation apps, would make interactions feel more personal and engaging... ChatGPT's voice always feels cold and lacks variety''}

\ly{Besides, participants agreed that agents should exhibit personal ``thinking'' ability. P8 stated, \textit{My agent should reflect my personal characteristics and family knowledge, generating content based on my style, beliefs, and values. If it only has AI knowledge, interacting with it would be no different from using ChatGPT, which is confusing.''} P9, with a background in philosophy, noted, \textit{``Philosophically, life is defined by thought, so achieving this simulation level may require rethinking boundaries of life and death, along with related social, legal, and societal issues.''}}

Regarding privacy, participants advocated for a balance between authenticity and discretion (P1, 7-8, 18). While some preferred minimal data filtering for a more authentic simulation rather than a ``saint simulation'', they cautioned against including much sensitive information to protect privacy. 

\subsubsection{Expression of Extra AI Knowledge} \label{ai knowledge}

Participants had mixed feelings about incorporating external knowledge embedded in large foundational models into their agents. Concerns focused on its impact on interaction quality and authenticity (P1, 16-17). P1 noted, \textit{``Embedding this knowledge may lead to a misrepresentation and incomplete understanding of values and knowledge...''} P16 shared a similar view, stating additional knowledge might create discrepancies between the agent and the real self, but also noted, \textit{``Not including it may make the agent seem outdated.''} P17 questioned the practicality, saying, \textit{``It might discuss topics with my children that I'm unfamiliar with, making interactions feel odd.''}

On the other hand, integrating AI knowledge could enhance interaction quality (P6, 12, 18). P6 believed it would make the agent more useful and appealing to her family, while P18 felt it \textit{``enriches the agent's knowledge and cultural depth.''} This was particularly useful when \textit{``interaction scenarios require feedback that can't be predetermined''} (P12).

Some participants favored a balance between personal traits and added knowledge (P8, 11, 13-14). P8 suggested blending personal traits with extra information, rather than relying solely on AI knowledge. Similarly, P11 emphasized, \textit{``Extra AI knowledge should align with my perception of knowledge.''} P14 welcomed the integration, saying, \textit{``As long as it enhances interaction quality without compromising my essence.''} P13 also noted the need to avoid negative traits, adding, \textit{``If the AI knowledge is more positive and insightful than mine, it could be beneficial.''} 

\subsubsection{Evolution} \label{evolution}

Participants emphasized the need for a balance between authenticity and adaptability in agent evolution (e.g., age and thinking) over time. Many supported the idea of allowing agents to evolve to stay present and maintain relevance in communication (P1, 3-4, 6-8, 12-14, 16-18) as evolving agents could better adapt to new contexts. \ly{P8 stated, \textit{``My agents should understand my family updates and the evolving world around us, providing relevant interactions.''} P4 echoed, \textit{``It would be ideal for my agent to continue meaningful conversations, as if I were still present.''}}

In contrast, some raised concerns about the risks and philosophical implications, particularly regarding authenticity and identity (P9-P11). P10 preferred static agents, saying, \textit{``It should remain as designed to preserve its essence, avoiding new topics that might seem inauthentic.''} P11 echoed these concerns, noting that evolution could introduce uncontrollable changes. P9 questioned the philosophical implications, stating, \textit{``Evolving agents challenge individual identity consistency... It's important to consider what makes someone the same person despite physical, psychological, or digital changes.''}

Some also emphasized adapting based on life stages (P2-4). P4 noted, \textit{``Further aging for the agents of the elderly is inappropriate.''} While P2 added the younger might benefit from continued growth.

\subsubsection{Reactivity} \label{reactivity}
\ly{
Reactive interaction highlights the balance between autonomy and non-intrusiveness.
Some participants expressed interest in active reactivity, suggesting it as a feature motivated by love for their family (P1-3, 6, 11).} 
For instance, P2 noted it would be comforting if the agent detected family emotions and provided support. P3 added, \textit{``My family wouldn't mind having sensors at home for my agent to respond to their needs in real-time.''}

\ly{Conversely, many preferred passive reactivity (P4, 9-10, 12-14, 16-18), emphasizing the importance of respecting personal space and avoiding disturbing the normal life of their families.} P16 stated, \textit{``It would be unsettling if my agent \ly{(robot form)} was walking around the house without being explicitly called upon...''}

\ly{Confronted with the contradiction of non-intrusiveness and autonomy, some suggested a balanced approach (P4, 7-8, 11), proposing that agents remain largely passive while providing comfort when needed by the family.}
P8 noted that reactivity might depend on the interaction context and the relationships between the deceased and their loved ones. P7 raised ethical concerns, emphasizing the need for family involvement in customizing this function to avoid unintended consequences. 
\ly{Those interested in active reactivity also saw it as an optional choice, with P11 explaining, \textit{``My family should have the right to customize this function.''}}

\subsection{Concerns: Technology, Mental Health, Security, and Socioeconomic Issues}\label{concerns}

Several significant concerns regarding ``AI Afterlife'' as digital legacy have been identified, including technology, mental health, security, and socioeconomic issues, as summarized in \autoref{tab:summary of themes and main points in concerns}.

    \bottomrule
    % Add more rows as needed
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Technology}
Technical concerns include AI's limitations in simulating human traits, the unpredictability of autonomous systems, and the lack of regulatory standards.
%
Many noted that incomplete or biased input data could create flawed or skewed agents (P1, 7, 11-12, 17-18). \ly{For example, P1 explained, \textit{``AI may be influenced by some default values... Besides, although its capabilities are relatively comprehensive, it may lack the depth in my area of expertise... The data I provide is also limited and cannot reflect my complete life.''}}

Unpredictability and potential loss of control were also significant worries (P9-11, 13). Participants feared that AI systems could evolve beyond their original settings, causing unforeseen ethical or social consequences. For instance, P13 mentioned, \textit{``If my agent develops harmful tendencies, it could negatively impact my son's emotions and well-being.''}

Additionally, the lack of regulatory standards raised concerns about proper use and oversight (P7, 12). P12 stated, \textit{``It's challenging to educate and regulate users on responsible usage due to freedom and accessibility of this technology.''}

\subsubsection{Mental Health}
Mental health concerns center on fear and obsession with grief.
Some noted that blending the real and virtual worlds often evoked discomfort (P5, 7-8, 16). P8 noted, \textit{``Long-term use can cause emotional turmoil... the presence of the deceased can trigger uncomfortable psychological reactions.''} The ``uncanny valley'' effect was also highlighted, which caused unsettling feelings (P7, 16), especially for those anxious or superstitious (P16).

Obsession with interacting with agents of the deceased was another concern, as it could hinder healing and moving on from grieving (P2-5, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18). P5 shared, \textit{``It's easy to become immersed in grief if interacting with these agents.''} P2 added, \textit{``This has diverged from my intent of creating my own agent.''} P8 pointed out that these agents provided a more immersive experience than photos or memories, potentially disrupting daily life.

To mitigate these risks, participants suggested features to moderate interactions (P2, 12, 16, 18). P12 recommended limiting realism, like using silent video, to reduce immersion. P16 proposed adding reminders to prevent excessive mourning, with detection features to identify when the living are overly sad. P18 emphasized his concern for his family, stating, \textit{``While leaving an agent for my family may help them remember me, I hope it encourages them to move on.''}

\subsubsection{Security}

Security concerns mainly focus on privacy, reputation, and potential abuse. A key issue was the handling of personal data in creating and accessing these agents (P2-4, 6, 11, 13). P2 emphasized, \textit{``My digital information should remain private, not made public.''} P6 added, \textit{``The interactions with my agents should not be accessible to strangers.''}

Some also feared the potential harm to their reputation (P11, 13-14, 16-17). While some tried to filter out disgraceful experiences during the creation process to prevent exposure (P13-14, 16), concerns remained, as P11 notes, \textit{``If my agent reveals my darker side, it could damage my reputation and negatively impact my family.''}

Additionally, concerns about misuse were prominent, particularly the risk of agents being exploited for fraud (P10-12, 17-18). P10 warned, \textit{``Malicious individuals could exploit my agents for profit.''} P12 highlighted the difficulty of managing misuse, stating, \textit{``Images and voices can be easily extracted from my agents.''} P17 emphasized the need for safeguards, \textit{``I lived my life doing good. It's unacceptable for my agents to engage in wrongdoing.''} \ly{Concerns about abuse also extended to service providers. Some expressed expressed distrust toward private, profit-driven companies, citing issues with oversight and sustainability (P1-2). As P1 explained, \textit{``A well-managed organization might succeed, but without proper oversight, my agent could become an electronic doll. It would be preferable if a non-profit organization, using open-source technology and free from capital influence, were responsible, with adequate government and public supervision...''}}

\subsubsection{Socioeconomic Issues}
Socioeconomic concerns involve social interactions, cultural implications, and economic factors. Participants had mixed feelings about the impact of ``AI Afterlife'' on social interactions (P5, 8, 10). P8 mentioned the guilt and social pressure the family might face if the agent is not used long-term, while P5 warned it could harm real-world interactions. P10 added, \textit{``People are already addicted to the internet, sitting together but focused on their phones. Using AI agents of the deceased may lead to a future where people no longer interact with real people, which is troubling. Living should involve real-world experiences, not just virtual ones.''}

AI-generated agents are also expected to disrupt traditional cultural practices around death and mourning (P6, 9, 16). P9 noted, \textit{``AI agents for the deceased will change how we conduct funerals and memorials.''} P6 added that it could \textit{``allow the deceased to join family reunions for remembrance.''}

Additionally, economic concerns about creating and maintaining these agents were raised (P5, 11, 15-16). P5 said she would consider creating an agent if costs were manageable, while P11 pointed out the high data requirements, \textit{``If data collection costs are too high, the agent may not be feasible.''} P15 expressed concern over ongoing maintenance costs.
