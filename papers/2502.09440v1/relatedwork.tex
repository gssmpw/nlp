A similar-in-spirit result for vertex coloring is proven in~\cite{assadi2022deterministic}, which shows that deterministic algorithms cannot color a graph with $\exp(\Delta^{o(1)})$ colors in a single pass. Since vertex coloring is fairly hard, designing an adversary entails finding \textit{some} set of vertices that is a clique from the perspective of a deterministic algorithm. With the independent set problem, however, we must design an adversary that removes \textit{all} large independent sets from the perspective of a deterministic algorithm. Due to this difference, deterministic algorithms can easily find independent sets of size $\frac n{\poly(\Delta)}$ in our setting (whereas no deterministic algorithm can find a coloring using at most $\poly(\Delta)$ colors). We show that they cannot do better than quadratic, up to a polylog factor. 

More generally, there has also been a significant interest in finding independent sets in graph streams\ \cite{ahn2015correlation, assadi2024log, halldorsson2010streaming, chen2023sublinear, cormode2017independent, bhore2022streaming, bakshi2019weighted}. Independent sets in the \textit{online streaming} model are studied in~\cite{halldorsson2016streaming}. Under this model, they devise a deterministic algorithm with performance ratio $O(2^{\Delta})$, which they prove is also tight. We provide an adjacent result in the \textit{semi-streaming} model, which does not require an algorithm to maintain a feasible solution at all times. Additionally,\ \cite{cormode2018independent} studied independent sets in vertex-arrival streams, where each element in the input stream is a vertex along with its incident edges to earlier vertices. They show that the maximum independent set problem in the vertex-arrival model is not much easier than the problem in the edge-streaming model. 

Independent sets have also been studied in more tangential settings.\ \cite{cormode2018approximating} studied the problem of finding the Caro-Wei bound itself that other algorithms (such as the one in\ \cite{halldorsson2010streaming}) achieve, and\ \cite{bhore2022streaming} studied the geometric independent set problem in the streaming model.
