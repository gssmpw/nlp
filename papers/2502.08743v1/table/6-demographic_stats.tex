     \qFour{}
     & 4.08  & 3 & 2.92 &
     Most Participants are not highly motivated to read privacy policies, but there is significant variation, suggesting some individuals are very motivated while others are not.  
     \\\hline

      \qFive{}
      & 4.12	& 3	& 2.88 &
      Participants are generally unlikely to spend time understanding privacy policies, but again, responses varied widely.
     \\\hline
     
     \qSix{}
      & 6.39	& 7	& 3.00 &
      Participants tend to focus more on the general overview rather than specific sections, but the responses vary greatly.
     \\\hline
     
     \qSeven{}
      & 6.63	& 7	& 2.51 & Participants feel moderately confident in managing privacy settings, with relatively less variation in responses.
     \\\hline
     
    \qEight{}
     & 5.87	& 6	& 3.01 &
     Participants feel moderately comfortable using privacy tools, but some are much more comfortable than others.
    \\\hline

    \qNine{}
     & 7.59	& 8	& 2.33 &
     Control over personal information is very important to most participants, with lower variability in responses. 
    \\\hline
    
    \qTen{}
     & 5.39	& 5	& 2.70 &
     Participants are moderately proactive about updating their privacy settings, but responses are somewhat varied.
    \\\hline
    
    \qEleven{}
     & 4.44	& 4	& 2.46 & 
     Participants are generally uncomfortable sharing personal information online, but comfort levels vary across individuals.
    \\\hline
    
    \qTwelve{}
     & 7.06	& 8	& 2.58 &

    \qThirteen{}
     & 6.84	& 7	& 2.67 &
     Participants are fairly likely to act (e.g., change settings) when concerned about a privacy policy, though responses vary.
\\\hline

     \qFourteen{}
     & 6.48	& 7	& 2.67 &
     Participants show moderate interest in learning about tools to better understand privacy policies, but interest levels vary.
