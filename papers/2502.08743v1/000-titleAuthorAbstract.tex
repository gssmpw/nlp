%``Dr. Burnett's Formula'':
%1. What's the problem
In general, Terms of Service (ToS) and other policy documents are verbose and full of legal jargon, which poses challenges for users to understand.
%2. Why is the problem a problem
To improve user accessibility and transparency, the ``Terms of Service; Didn't Read'' (ToS;DR) project condenses intricate legal terminology into summaries and overall grades for the website's policy documents.
Nevertheless, uncertainties remain about whether users could truly grasp the implications of simplified presentations.
%3. What did we do about it?
We conducted an online survey to assess the perceived understandability and severity of randomly chosen cases from the ToS;DR taxonomy.
%Participants completed a survey on the Prolific platform, where they evaluated five cases and were instructed to rephrase one case using their choice of words.
Preliminary results indicate that, although most users report understanding the cases, they find a bias towards service providers in about two-thirds of the cases.
%4. What did does that do for the world OR what are 1-2 interesting things we found out?
The findings of our study emphasize the necessity of prioritizing user-centric policy formulation.
This study has the potential to reveal the extent of information imbalance in digital services and promote more well-informed user consent.
