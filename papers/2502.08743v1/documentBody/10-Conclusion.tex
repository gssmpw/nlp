\section{Conclusion
\draftStatus{not great, but barring audits, R+R DONE}
}

Our main findings are as follows.
First, the text describing cases found on \tosdr{} is understandable to laypersons overall, though several cases received low understandability and low consensus on understandability.
Meanwhile, prior work has consistently shown people's confusion and inability to understand whole policies.
This suggests that this text can be explanatory for approaches that use such a taxonomy to classify text.
Second, severity scores seemed to indicate that the cases systematically favor the Service Provider.
Third, many cases had low consensus on severity, which could be a reflection of natural variation in attitudes.
Our results suggest that rewriting those cases may help, but educational interventions about such concepts may help \textit{more}.
Fourth, we observe an interplay between severity and understandability ratings that indicate the need for further study.
By enhancing the clarity and accessibility of privacy terms, organizations have the opportunity to cultivate a more knowledgeable user community, resulting in increased trust and user empowerment in managing privacy-related issues.
