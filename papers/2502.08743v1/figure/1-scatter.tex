    Scatterplot of Average Severity (AVG\_S) vs Average Understandability (AVG\_UA).
  }
  \Description{The scatter plot is a reflection of the varied responses for the average values of understandability and severity. As understandability increases, the severity shows greater variability, indicating that participants respond with a wider range of severity for cases they find more understandable.}

  \FIXED{JED: List of demands for this figure:
  1. export this figure as a pdf, this is a bitmapped representation and is thus bad for zooming
  2. Remove the chart title so that it fits nicer on the page
  3. Relabel things from UA to U, since that is the notation we use elsewhere in the paper.
  4. Clarify in the caption what a dot is here (I think it is a case)
