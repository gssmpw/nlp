    \caption{Relationship between average Understandability scores and average Severity scores.
    To read the figure, when the understandability score was 1, the mean severity score was 4, and when the severity score was 1, the mean understandability score was about 8, and so on.
    Note that as the understandability score increases from 1 to 10, the average severity score correspondingly rises from 4 to 6.3.

    \Description{The figure is of a line chart, with two data series, one for understandability, the other severity. Each categorical X-axis position is given by a rating for one of the data series. On the numerical Y-axis is the average value of the OTHER data type for all cases receiving the X-axis rating. In the figure, we broadly see a trend for understandability that starts high, goes down, then back up. Severity starts low and goes up before plateauing.}

    \FIXED{JED@Anyone: List of demands for this figure:
    1. There is a spelling error in the X-axis label (comparative)
    2. Put the legend in the chart area so that we can make the image smaller on the page
    3. specify the Y axis to be from 2 or 3 to 9 or 10 so that we zoom in on the relevant portion a bit more.
    4. Widen the chart area, so it fills the page a bit better by having a wider aspect ratio.
    5. Remove the title

    Finally,
    6. Export this figure as a pdf, this is a bitmapped representation and is thus bad for zooming.
    7. Clarify and extend what I wrote in the caption since I am guessing this is on the $|S|$ data, as opposed to $S$, otherwise the ranges would be different. Without being sure, it is hard for me to finish the last part of the caption (what the reader is supposed to see in the figure)
