\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}
This paper introduces a novel approach to low-level task interaction for generalised image fusion, addressing a largely overlooked aspect of the field. By integrating a shared reconstruction task and an RGB-based joint dataset, we effectively reduce task and domain discrepancies, establishing a collaborative training framework. Our model, supported by a cross-fusion gating mechanism, demonstrates superior generalisation and robust fusion performance. Additionally, GIFNet pioneers the application of fusion techniques to single-modality enhancement, representing a significant advancement in the image fusion research.
