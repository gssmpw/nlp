\section{Conclusion and Limitations} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we propose VB-Com, a novel humanoid locomotion control framework that successfully combines the strengths of both vision and blind policies to enhance the performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, unstructured environments.  VB-Com achieves dynamically switching between vision and blind policies based on return estimations, enabling the robot to navigate more efficiently in complex terrains against perception. Extensive evaluations on obstacles and dynamic terrains demonstrate that VB-Com outperforms both vision-only and blind-only policies. Additionally, the system's deployment on Unitree G1 and H1 robots confirms its practical viability. This work underscores the potential of policy composition to tackle the limitations of traditional approaches and improve the robustness and adaptability of perceptive humanoid locomotion.

A key limitation of this work is that the performance upper bound is constrained by the simulated terrains encountered during training. Specifically, for unobserved gap terrains, the proposed method may fail if no suitable steppable terrain is available when the robot attempts a larger step for recovery. To address this limitation, future work will explore the incorporation of additional sub-policies to better handle such challenging scenarios and further improve the robustness of the system.
