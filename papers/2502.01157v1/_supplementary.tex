\section{Per Scene metrics}
\input{tab/mipnerf_table}
\input{tab/db_table}
\Cref{tab:mipnerf360_all,tab:db_all} summarize the error metrics collected for our evaluation of all considered techniques.
These include results for both Mip-NeRF360~\cite{mipnerf360} and Deep Blending~\cite{deepblending} scenes.
However, 3DGRT~\cite{3dgrt} is excluded from per-scene comparisons as these values are not reported in the original paper, and the code is not publicly available.
