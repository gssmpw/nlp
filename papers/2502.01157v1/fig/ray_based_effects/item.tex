{\bf Ray-based effects -- }
Ray tracing simplifies the implementation of many effects which are difficult to approximate with rasterization.
To motivate our work, we show here examples of integrating reflections, refractions, and non-linear camera models into our rendering pipeline.
Each would be complicated to achieve with rasterization, but requires only minor modification to our rendering code.
