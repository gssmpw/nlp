    {\bf Ray tracing foams -- }
    When a ray {\color{figred}(red)} enters a cell, we iterate through all the planar cell faces to identify the face through which the ray exits.
    This exit intersection is the first intersection along the ray with a normal vector less than 90 degrees from the ray direction~{\color{figgreen}(green)}; other intersections are considered back-facing~{\color{figblue}(blue)} and ignored.
    As the faces each correspond to a neighboring cell, the tracing then proceeds by stepping into the cell associated with the exit intersection and repeating the process.
