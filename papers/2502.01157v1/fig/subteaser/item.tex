(left) In a stable foam, the pressure inside each bubble is roughly equal.
The interfaces between bubbles settle into shapes that balance forces, leading to polygonal cells resembling Voronoi patterns (right).
Our representation is nothing but a dense Voronoi tessellation of 3D space, where each point belongs to exactly one Voronoi cell.
The position of Voronoi sites is differentiable, making it amenable to gradient-based optimization.
