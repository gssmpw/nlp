        {\bf Ablations -- } 
        We qualitatively analyze the impact of excluding various components from our method. 
        For better visualization, we zoom in on specific image regions and present their corresponding error maps.
        \textit{No SFM}: While the method performs relatively well without initialization, it degrades in sparsely covered regions of the training views. 
        \textit{No Densify+SFM}: Without densification, the method significantly underperforms, leading to under-represented scenes. 
        \textit{No Quantile}: Disabling the quantile loss introduces floaters, degrading rendering quality. 
        \textit{No Pruning}: Ceasing point pruning has minimal impact due to the low number of prunable points.
