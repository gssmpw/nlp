\section{Conclusions}
% In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to investigate the necessity of sophisticated robust training methods for RAG systems as model capacity increases. 
% Our analysis reveals that while complex robust training methods, significantly enhance the performance of smaller models, their necessity diminishes significantly as model capacity increases. Advanced LLMs demonstrate inherent robustness, performing well even with randomly selected documents. This suggests that as models evolve, simpler document selection strategies may suffice, reducing the need for complex training methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing RAG systems, emphasizing the importance of aligning training strategies with model capabilities.
In this study, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary for RAG systems as model capacity grows. Our extensive experiments consistently show that while sophisticated training methods significantly enhance weaker models' performance, their benefits diminish dramatically in more powerful models. Through the systematic analysis, we find that advanced models inherently possess strong confidence calibration, cross-dataset generalization, and effective attention patterns even with simple training. These findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.
