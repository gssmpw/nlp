\paragraph{Heterogeneous MMAB (HMMAB)}
HMMAB is one of the standard models in multi-player multi-armed bandits with collision literature; to name a few, ____.
Among them, ____ was the first to study the HMMAB, where they proposed a decentralized algorithm with $O(\log^2 T)$ regret.
Later on, the regret bound of this model was improved to \(O(M^3K\log T)\) by____ and further to \(O(M^2K\log T)\) by____ that is the state-of-the-art result.
We are the first to introduce the hint mechanism to HMMAB.


\paragraph{Bandits with Hints}
Learning algorithms with hints (or predictions) are part of the emerging literature on learning-augmented methods, as seen in works like____, etc. The hint mechanism was initially explored in the basic stochastic multi-armed bandits model by____. Later, ____ examined a more realistic hint mechanism, which includes failure noise, for the same model. Additionally, ____ investigated the impact of hints in adversarial bandits. We are the first to study the hint mechanism in a multi-agent scenario.
