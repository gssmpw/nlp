\paragraph{Heterogeneous MMAB (HMMAB)}
HMMAB is one of the standard models in multi-player multi-armed bandits with collision literature; to name a few, \citet{rosenski2016multi,boursier2019sic,mehrabian2020practical,bistritz2018distributed,shi2021heterogeneous}.
Among them, \citet{bistritz2018distributed} was the first to study the HMMAB, where they proposed a decentralized algorithm with $O(\log^2 T)$ regret.
Later on, the regret bound of this model was improved to \(O(M^3K\log T)\) by~\citet{mehrabian2020practical} and further to \(O(M^2K\log T)\) by~\citet{shi2021heterogeneous} that is the state-of-the-art result.
We are the first to introduce the hint mechanism to HMMAB.


\paragraph{Bandits with Hints}
Learning algorithms with hints (or predictions) are part of the emerging literature on learning-augmented methods, as seen in works like~\citep{lykouris2021competitive,purohit2018improving,mitzenmacher2022algorithms}, etc. The hint mechanism was initially explored in the basic stochastic multi-armed bandits model by~\citet{yun2018multi}. Later, \citet{lindstaahl2020predictive} examined a more realistic hint mechanism, which includes failure noise, for the same model. Additionally, \citet{bhaskara2023bandit} investigated the impact of hints in adversarial bandits. We are the first to study the hint mechanism in a multi-agent scenario.
