\section*{Limitations}
The main limitation of the dataset is the availability of only binary judgment labels (positive or negative). We do not manually label which part of the statement in the negative sample is unsupported, nor do we manually label the evidence in the documents that the statement in the positive sample is supported. However, key segments labeling and modifications in the LLM augmentation phase are available, which compensates for the limitation to some extent.

The main limitation of the experiments is the lack of more experiments on other test sets for the model obtained from training to show the generalization performance. This limitation comes from the lack of relevant Chinese datasets. We will continue to track the relevant Chinese datasets proposed and conduct experiments.
