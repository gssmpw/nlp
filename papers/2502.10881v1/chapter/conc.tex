\section{Conclusion}
 
In this work, we propose the first large-scale Chinese dataset \textsc{CiteCheck} for citation faithfulness detection. To solve the high-cost problem caused by the lack of negative samples when constructing the dataset using strong RAG systems, we propose the method of data augmentation with two-stage manual annotation. This method allows us to construct a dataset with a balanced number of positive and negative samples at a relatively low cost and guarantees the quality of the dataset. We conduct experiments and validate the quality of the dataset in two aspects: (1) the test samples consisting of the original samples are challenging for detection, and (2) the training samples consisting of the original positive samples and the augmented negative samples can be effectively applied for training.
