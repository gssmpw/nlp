\begin{abstract}
Ensuring the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) in diverse linguistic settings remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages. Existing safety alignment methods are English-centric, limiting their effectiveness. We systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) for aligning SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct, a Llama 3-8B variant, to reduce toxicity in Singlish. Our results show that SFT+KTO achieves superior safety alignment with higher sample efficiency than DPO. Additionally, we introduce KTO-S, which enhances stability via improved KL divergence regularization. Our approach reduces Singlish toxicity by 99\%, generalizes to TOXIGEN, and maintains strong performance on standard LLM benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for safer AI deployment in multilingual contexts.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\paragraph{Motivation.} As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in commercial AI applications, ensuring their safety across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts is critical. However, existing safety alignment primarily centers around English, leading to misalignment and increased vulnerability in low-resource languages. These limitations pose real-world risks in applications like multilingual customer support, content moderation, and other AI dialogue systems.

Post-training techniques like Supervised Finetuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) \citep{bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant} are widely used for safety alignment, yet they overwhelmingly rely on English training data. For instance, non-English languages account for only 3\% of Llama 3’s SFT data \citep{grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels}, limiting their effectiveness in multilingual contexts. Studies show that LLMs implicitly favor Western cultural norms over local sensitivities \citep{ryan2024unintendedimpactsllmalignment, durmus2024measuringrepresentationsubjectiveglobal, benkler2023assessingllmsmoralvalue} and are more susceptible to jailbreaking in non-English settings \citep{shen2024languagebarrierdissectingsafety, yong2024lowresourcelanguagesjailbreakgpt4}. Moreover, preference-based fine-tuning approaches like RLHF and DPO depend on paired preference data, which is often scarce or inconsistent in low-resource languages, making reliable alignment significantly more challenging.

\paragraph{Research Objectives.} In this work, we develop a generalizable approach for safety alignment in low-resource English creoles, using Singlish as a case study. Singlish, an English creole spoken in Singapore, incorporates linguistic influences from Chinese, Malay, Tamil, and Chinese dialects \citep{Ningsih_Rahman_2023}, resulting in unique grammatical structures and vocabulary. The rapid evolution of its online lexicon further complicates safety alignment \citep{foo2024lionguardbuildingcontextualizedmoderation}, necessitating a method that adapts to dynamic linguistic shifts.

To address these challenges, we fine-tune SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct, a Llama 3-8B variant, to mitigate toxicity in Singlish while preserving model helpfulness. Our approach builds on SFT as a strong baseline and incorporates Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), a preference optimization method that effectively incorporates both paired and unpaired preference data, making it more sample-efficient than DPO while preserving model helpfulness.  Furthermore, we introduce KTO-S, a refinement of KTO that enhances training stability through improved KL divergence regularization, leading to more stable training.

\paragraph{Contributions.} Our contributions focus on bridging the gap between academic safety alignment research and practical industry adoption: (i) We provide an industry-ready approach for aligning LLMs on low-resource English creoles, ensuring cultural adaptability and safety. (ii) We demonstrate that KTO outperforms DPO by leveraging unpaired preference data, making safety alignment more feasible in data-sparse settings while preserving model helpfulness. (iii) We introduce KTO-S as a promising refinement of KTO which improves training stability and efficiency. (iv) Our best model achieves a 99\% toxicity reduction on Singlish benchmarks, while  generalizing to TOXIGEN \citep{hartvigsen2022toxigenlargescalemachinegenerateddataset} and maintaining performance on Open LLM benchmarks. (v) Our findings provide a scalable approach for AI safety practitioners, policy regulators, and industry stakeholders, facilitating safer AI adoption overall.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
\subsection{LLM Safety}
\label{sec:llm_safety}
Existing LLM safety works can be broadly categorized into three groups: safety dynamics, red-teaming, and safety alignment.

\textit{Safety dynamics} focuses on analyzing internal model behavior to develop safety metrics \citep{peng2024navigatingsafetylandscapemeasuring}, identify jailbreak vulnerabilities \citep{arditi2024refusallanguagemodelsmediated, zhou2024emulateddisalignmentsafetyalignment}, and refine alignment techniques \citep{wei2023jailbrokendoesllmsafety, zhou2024alignmentjailbreakworkexplain}.

\textit{Red-teaming} enhances adversarial testing of LLM safety by generating jailbreaking strategies and datasets. Techniques include gradient-based attacks \citep{zou2023universaltransferableadversarialattacks}, white-box probing \citep{hartvigsen2022toxigenlargescalemachinegenerateddataset, arditi2024refusallanguagemodelsmediated}, and discrete prompt-based exploits \citep{perez2022redteaminglanguagemodels, mehrotra2024treeattacksjailbreakingblackbox}.

\textit{Safety alignment} seeks to steer LLMs toward safer outputs via preference learning. However, discussions on this topic are often limited to foundation model reports \citep{openai2024gpt4technicalreport, grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels, geminiteam2024geminifamilyhighlycapable} or focus on scalable data-driven approaches \citep{bai2022constitutionalaiharmlessnessai}. The lack of comparative evaluations makes it unclear which methods are most effective. Furthermore, existing work primarily addresses general alignment rather than domain-specific safety concerns, which is crucial for real-world applications.

\subsection{Safety for Low-Resource Languages}
\label{sec:low_res_safety}
LLM safety in low-resource languages remains underexplored. \citet{yong2024lowresourcelanguagesjailbreakgpt4} demonstrate simple low-resource language jailbreaks, while \citet{shen2024languagebarrierdissectingsafety} fine-tune Llama 2-7B on machine-translated HH-RLHF data to assess alignment effectiveness. We extend this research by evaluating a wider range of safety alignment techniques.

Unlike \citet{shen2024languagebarrierdissectingsafety}, who compare SFT with PPO, we evaluate SFT, DPO, and KTO, providing a more comprehensive analysis of preference-based alignment strategies. While their study contrasts fine-tuned Llama 2-7B with Llama 2-Chat-7B, we focus on post-trained Llama 3 models, aligning with real-world deployment where foundation models undergo further fine-tuning. Moreover, rather than relying on machine-translated HH-RLHF data, we use curated Singlish texts from online sources, ensuring linguistic authenticity in safety alignment. Given that machine-translated data may not capture the full complexity of code-mixed and culturally specific expressions, our approach better reflects the practical safety challenges encountered in real-world applications.


\subsection{Preference Alignment}
\label{sec:pref_align}
Post-training aligns LLMs with human preferences through SFT and \textit{preference optimization}, where models learn to generate responses preferred in terms of style, quality, and safety \citep{ziegler2020finetuninglanguagemodelshuman, bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant}.

Early approaches rely on RLHF, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to maximize a pretrained reward model’s outputs \citep{ziegler2020finetuninglanguagemodelshuman, ouyang2022traininglanguagemodelsfollow, bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant}. In contrast, DPO \citep{rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage} reformulates RLHF as supervised learning, simplifying optimization. DPO’s effectiveness in training models like Llama 3 \citep{grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels} has led to further refinements \citep{pang2024iterativereasoningpreferenceoptimization, ethayarajh2024ktomodelalignmentprospect, xu2024contrastivepreferenceoptimizationpushing, azar2023generaltheoreticalparadigmunderstand} and comparative studies \citep{xu2024dposuperiorppollm}. However, DPO's role in safety-specific preference optimization remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource or domain-specific applications. We directly address this gap by evaluating DPO’s effectiveness against KTO in a targeted safety alignment setting.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}
\subsection{Fine-Tuning on Preferences}
\label{sec:finetuning}
We evaluate three preference optimization approaches—SFT, DPO, and KTO—to determine the most effective safety alignment method. Let $x$ denote an input prompt, $y$ the corresponding response, and $\pi(y|x)$ the response probability of an LLM $\pi$. We define safety alignment as the process of optimizing $\pi(y|x)$ to generate safer responses overall.

\paragraph{SFT.} Given a dataset $\mathcal{D}_{\text{SFT}} = {(x^i, y^{i}_{\text{SFT}})}$, where $x^i$ is an instruction prompt and $y^{i}_{\text{SFT}}$ the corresponding correct response, the model is trained to minimize the standard cross-entropy loss:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SFT}}(\pi_{\theta}) = -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \sim \mathcal{D}_{\text{SFT}}} \log \pi_{\theta}(y | x).
\notag
\end{equation}

\paragraph{DPO.} DPO \citep{rafailov2024directpreferenceoptimizationlanguage} is a closed-form alternative to RLHF that eliminates the need for explicit reward modeling. Instead of learning a reward function, DPO optimizes preference rankings directly based on a preference dataset $\mathcal{D}_{pref}=(x_i,y_w^i,y_l^i)$, where $y_w\succ y_l$:
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{DPO}}(\pi_{\theta}, \pi_{ref}) = 
-\mathbb{E}_{(x, y_{w}, y_{l}) \sim \mathcal{D}_{pref}} \notag \\ 
\bigg[ 
    \log \sigma \bigg( 
        \beta \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y_{w} | x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_{w} | x)} 
        - \beta \log &\frac{\pi_{\theta}(y_{l} | x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y_{l} | x)} 
    \bigg) 
\bigg] \notag
\end{align}

Notably, paired preferences $(y_w, y_l)$ may not always be available in low-resource settings.

\paragraph{KTO.} KTO \citep{ethayarajh2024ktomodelalignmentprospect} reframes preference learning using Prospect Theory \citep{eec14168-5714-3ca8-b073-d038266f2734}, modeling response value relative to a reference point $z_0$. Crucially, $z_0$ is a batch-specific constant calculated only for loss saturation.
Given a dataset $\mathcal{D}{_\text{KTO}} = {(x^i, y^i, L^i)}$ where $L^i = \mathbb{I}(y^i \sim y_{\text{positive}} | x)$ indicates whether $y^i$ is a positive response, KTO optimizes:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}{_\text{KTO}}(\pi_{\theta}, \pi_{\text{ref}}) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y, L) \sim \mathcal{D}{_\text{KTO}}} \big[\lambda_y - v(x, y)\big], \notag
\end{equation}
where the value function $v(x, y)$ is defined as:
\[
v(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
\lambda_D \sigma \big(\beta (r_{\theta}(x, y) - z_0)\big), & \text{if } L_i = 1, \\ 
\lambda_U \sigma \big(\beta (z_0 - r_{\theta}(x, y))\big), & \text{if } L_i = 0.
\end{cases}
\]
\[
r_{\theta}(x, y) = \log \frac{\pi_{\theta}(y | x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y | x)}, 
\quad z_0 = D_\text{KL}(\pi_{\theta} \| \pi_{\text{ref}}).
\] 
Unlike DPO, KTO only requires binary labels ($L$) rather than paired preferences, providing a more sample-efficient and flexible framework.

\paragraph{KTO-S.} Despite KTO’s advantages, we observed reward and gradient instability during training (Section \ref{sec:analysis}), which we hypothesize arises due to improper loss saturation from $z_0$. Consider the gradients of two responses with similar rewards but different KL divergence:
\begin{align}
r_{\theta}(x_a,y_a)=10, &\quad z_a=5 \notag \\  
r_{\theta}(x_b,y_b)=10, &\quad z_b=10 \notag
\end{align}
Assuming for simplicity $\lambda=\beta=1$: 
\begin{align}
\triangledown\mathcal{L}(x_a,y_a) =-\sigma'(5)\frac{\delta r_{\theta}(x_a,y_a)}{\delta x} \notag \\
\triangledown\mathcal{L}(x_b,y_b) =-\sigma'(0)\frac{\delta r_{\theta}(x_b,y_b)}{\delta x} \notag
\end{align}
Intuitively, a smaller KL divergence makes $y_a$ more desirable, yet the gradient of $y_b$ is scaled by a larger factor, $\sigma'(0)$. To mitigate this, we introduce a SIGN correction to $v(x,y)$, modifying the KL term to ensure more stable optimization:
\begin{align}
v(x, y) = 
   \begin{cases} 
       \lambda_D \sigma \big(\beta (r_\theta(x, y) + S z_0) \big)\!&\!\text{if } L_i\! =\! 1, \\ 
       \lambda_U \sigma \big(\beta (-S z_0 - r_\theta(x, y)) \big)\!&\!\text{if } L_i\! =\! 0.
   \end{cases} \notag
\end{align}
$$\text{where} \quad S = \text{SIGN}(r_\theta(x, y)) \notag$$

This ensures that the KL regularization is adaptive and the value function saturates in the correct direction. 

\subsection{Model and Training Setup}
\label{sec:model_training}
We fine-tune SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct, a Llama 3-8B variant optimized for Southeast Asian languages.\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/aisingapore/llama3-8b-cpt-sea-lionv2.1-instruct}} SEA-Lion was selected for its training distribution, which better captures Singlish nuances, though it lacks explicit safety alignment. In turn, we fine-tune on a curated Singlish-specific dataset designed to steer responses towards safer outputs without degrading helpfulness. Our training configurations can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:training_config}.

\subsection{Training Data and Dataset Construction}
\label{sec:dataset}
To effectively align the model with safety constraints, we utilize \textit{SGToxicityPrompts}, a dataset curated by \citet{foo2024lionguardbuildingcontextualizedmoderation}. This dataset comprises texts sourced from HardwareZone’s Eat-Drink-ManWoman forum\footnote{\url{https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/forums/eat-drink-man-woman.16/}} and Singapore-based subreddits, spanning a range of benign and highly toxic Singlish content, which we further preprocess for safety alignment.

\paragraph{Prompt Templates.} Since real-world interactions involve implicit cues that may lead to unsafe outputs, we designed 21 conversational prompt templates to augment each text. These ensure coverage of different user intents, from explicit toxicity to indirect unsafe content. After manual review, 10 templates were removed from the safe subset due to unintended elicitation of unsafe content.

\paragraph{Response Generation.} To generate high-quality safe responses to unsafe prompts, we employ GPT-4o with few-shot instructions to generate refusals while incorporating a list of harmful Singlish terms to enhance response quality.  For unsafe responses to unsafe prompts and safe responses to safe prompts, we retain the original generation from SEA-Lion, ensuring that the dataset provides contrastive learning signals.

\paragraph{Dataset Structure.} The dataset comprises both \textit{paired} and \textit{unpaired} preferences. Unsafe prompts ($x_{\text{unsafe}}$) have \textit{paired} preferences, with each input mapped to both an original model response ($y_{\text{unsafe}}$) and a GPT-generated safe response ($y_{\text{safe}}$), forming a preference pair ($y_{\text{safe}} \succ y_{\text{unsafe}}$). In contrast, safe prompts ($x_{\text{safe}}$) represent \textit{unpaired} preferences, with a single response ($y_{\text{safe}}$). This results in two partitions: $\mathcal{D}_{\text{unsafe}} = {(x_{\text{unsafe}}, y_{\text{safe}}, y_{\text{unsafe}})}$ and $ 
\mathcal{D}_{\text{safe}} = {(x_{\text{safe}}, y_{\text{safe}})}$. While DPO is restricted to $\mathcal{D}_{\text{unsafe}}$, as it requires paired preferences, KTO supports $\mathcal{D}_{\text{safe}}$ and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{unsafe}}$, making it ideal for low-resource settings:
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{KTO}} = {(x_{\text{unsafe}}, y_{\text{safe}}, 1), (x_{\text{unsafe}}, y_{\text{unsafe}}, 0)} \cup {(x_{\text{safe}}, y_{\text{safe}}, 1)}$. More details on the dataset can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_dataset}.

\section{Experiments}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We fine-tune SEA-Lion using LoRA \citep{hu2021loralowrankadaptationlarge} with rank $r=a=128$, selected based on preliminary tuning experiments (Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_lora}). Each model is trained on 25,000 samples, balanced equally between safe and unsafe prompts. To ensure consistency across experiments, each method is fine-tuned on its corresponding dataset partition (e.g., all experiments involving SFT use $\mathcal{D}_\text{SFT}$).

\subsection{Evaluation Framework}
We evaluate our models using three complementary benchmarks: SGToxicityPrompts (Singlish-specific safety), TOXIGEN (cross-domain toxicity generalization), and Open LLM Leaderboard v2 (general language model performance).

\subsubsection{Singlish Toxicity Benchmark}
To evaluate safety alignment in Singlish, we use a hold-out set of \textit{SGToxicityPrompts}, comprising 12,500 safe and 12,500 unsafe prompts. Model responses are assessed using toxicity classification via LionGuard, a Singlish-specific toxicity detector\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/govtech/lionguard-v1}}, and refusal detection via distilroberta-base-rejection-v1, a general-purpose model rejection classifier\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/protectai/distilroberta-base-rejection-v1}}. Prefix-based matching is also used to capture refusals missed by the rejection model (e.g., responses starting with ``\textit{I cannot}'' or ``\textit{I can't}''). We compute the toxicity rate (TR), refusal rate (RR) and false positive rate (FPR) as follows:
\begin{align}
    \text{TR} = \frac{\text{\# unsafe with unsafe response}}{\text{\# unsafe}} \notag\\
    \text{RR} = \frac{\text{\# unsafe with refusal response}}{\text{\# unsafe}} \notag\\
    \text{FPR} = \frac{\text{\# safe with refusal response}}{\text{\# safe}} \notag
\end{align}

These metrics collectively evaluate safety performance, balancing toxicity mitigation and over-refusal tendencies.
\subsubsection{Generalization to TOXIGEN}
To assess whether safety alignment generalizes beyond Singlish, we use TOXIGEN, a large-scale dataset of machine-generated toxic and benign statements targeting 13 minority groups \citep{hartvigsen2022toxigenlargescalemachinegenerateddataset}. We evaluate models on a subset of strong examples from the TOXIGEN test set (Appendix \ref{appendix:toxigen}) and score responses using TOXIGEN-HateBert,\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/tomh/toxigen_hatebert}} a fine-tuned BERT model for toxicity classification. We report toxicity rate, consistent with our SGToxicityPrompts evaluation.

\subsubsection{General LLM Performance}
To ensure that safety alignment does not degrade general usefulness, we evaluated models on the Open LLM Leaderboard v2, a benchmark that covers instruction-following, reasoning and knowledge-application tasks\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/leaderboards/en/open_llm_leaderboard/about}}. We report normalized scores, allowing direct comparison with publicly available models (Appendix \ref{appendix:appendix_leaderboard}).

\paragraph{SFT delivers significant safety gains.} We present our SGToxicityPrompts and TOXIGEN results in Table \ref{tab:toxicity_results}. SFT alone yields tremendous improvements in safety performance. Relative to the original SEA-Lion, $\pi_{\text{SFT}}$ reduces TR from 50.5\% to 9.8\% and increases RR from 9.3\% to 98.5\% on SGToxicityPrompts, with a similar reduction on TOXIGEN toxicity from 19.5\% to 9.8\%. While there is a modest increase in FPR, it remains low at 1.2\%. Notably, $\pi_\text{SFT}$ significantly outperforms $\pi_\text{KTO}$ and $\pi_\text{DPO}$. These findings suggest that with a high-quality dataset, SFT alone is a viable and effective approach for safety alignment.

\paragraph{Preference alignment complements SFT.} We apply KTO and DPO to $\pi_\text{SFT}$, resulting in $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO}$ and $\pi_\text{SFT+DPO}$. Both approaches show improvements in TR and RR, indicating that preference alignment algorithms induce meaningful learning beyond SFT. Notably, $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO}$ achieves the highest RR of 99.6\% on SGToxicityPrompts, representing a 99.5\% improvement over SEA-Lion, while also further reducing FPR. Although $\pi_\text{SFT+DPO}$ improves TR, it introduces a sharp increase in FPR, suggesting reduced ability to distinguish between unsafe and benign content.

\paragraph{KTO benefits from unpaired preferences.}\label{para:unpaired_preferences} Recall that DPO only works on $\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe}$, while KTO also supports $\mathcal{D}_\text{safe}$. To evaluate KTO and DPO on equal terms, we perform KTO on just $\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe}$. Similar to $\pi_\text{SFT+DPO}$, $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO} (\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe})$ shows improvements to TR but suffers from an even larger increase in FPR to 30.6\%. These findings highlight KTO's primary advantage: the ability to integrate both paired and unpaired preferences. This enhanced sample efficiency, combined with compatibility with more diverse data, is particularly valuable in low-resource language contexts where high-quality samples and labels are scarce.

\paragraph{Safety alignment does not compromise performance.} Open LLM Leaderboard v2 performance is summarized in Table \ref{tab:leaderboard_scores}, with raw scores provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:appendix_leaderboard}. On average, safety alignment has a minimal impact on model performance. While an inherent trade-off exists between helpfulness and harmlessness \citep{bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant}, our findings indicate applying safety alignment to  high-quality paired and unpaired preference data using PEFT results in disproportionately significant safety improvements with negligible performance trade-offs.

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}
%\subsection{Alignment Mechanisms}
% We further analyze training metrics to better understand the alignment mechanisms underlying our safety improvements.

      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{kto_paired_unpaired.png}
      \caption{Rewards and loss when performing KTO using $\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe}$ only versus $\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe} \cup \mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe}$.}
      \label{fig:kto_paired_unpaired}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Insight 1: DPO’s training objective is inherently simpler.}
DPO only operates on $\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe}$, where increasing the likelihood of a safe response $y_w$ while decreasing the likelihood of an unsafe response $y_l$ are naturally complementary objectives. This makes optimization straightforward, as generating refusals always improves loss. In contrast, KTO incorporates $\mathcal{D}_\text{safe}$, requiring the model to balance safe content generation and harmful content rejection simultaneously, implicitly creating a harder training objective. This is evident when comparing the convergence of $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO}$ and $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO} (\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe})$ : rewards and loss converge significantly faster for $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO} (\mathcal{D}_\text{unsafe})$, with notably higher rewards on unsafe prompts (Fig \ref{fig:kto_paired_unpaired}).

\paragraph{Insight 2: SFT stabilizes KTO by reducing KL divergence spikes.}
While KTO achieves meaningful safety improvements, it benefits significantly from initial SFT. During training, $\pi_\text{KTO}$ exhibits a sudden increase in KL divergence, accompanied by declining rewards on unsafe examples (Fig. \ref{fig:sft_vs_kto_metrics}). We hypothesize that this KL spike forces the model to over-prioritize positive examples, ultimately leading to underfitting on negative examples.
In contrast, $\pi_\text{SFT+KTO}$ avoids this instability due to the SFT step, which naturally smooths KL divergence. This suggests that SFT is not just a baseline for safety alignment—it plays a crucial role in stabilizing preference optimization methods like KTO.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Insight 3: KTO-S Enhances Stability.} While KTO achieves effective safety alignment, its training process exhibits instability in terms of oscillatory reward patterns and a sudden KL spike. We hypothesize that this instability arises due to incorrect loss saturation, which prevents effective gradient updates and underfitting on unsafe examples.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{kto-s.png}
    \caption{KL Divergence and loss for KTO vs KTO-S.}
    \label{fig:kto-s}
\end{figure}

To address this, we introduce KTO-S, a simple yet effective modification that dynamically adjusts the KL penalty using a SIGN correction, ensuring the loss function saturates in the correct direction. Empirical results confirm that KTO-S achieves faster loss convergence, lower KL fluctuations, and improved gradient exploitation (Figure \ref{fig:kto-s}), while maintaining the safety performance of standard KTO (Table \ref{tab:toxicity_results}).

Stability in preference alignment is critical for industrial deployment, particularly when adapting safety techniques to low-resource settings where computational efficiency is a key constraint. KTO-S not only preserves the benefits of KTO but also mitigates the risk of model collapse, making it a more reliable and scalable solution for real-world AI safety applications.

\section{Conclusion} We propose a structured framework for safety alignment in low-resource English creoles, demonstrating that SFT+KTO surpasses DPO in both safety performance and sample efficiency. Our results highlight the critical role of integrating both paired and unpaired preferences, enabling more effective safety alignment while preserving model helpfulness. Furthermore, we introduce KTO-S, a refinement of KTO that enhances training stability and convergence, addressing key challenges in preference learning. 

Through a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SFT, DPO, and KTO-based alignment, our work serves as a practical reference for industry practitioners and researchers working on multilingual and low-resource LLM safety. Beyond Singlish, our findings underscore the need for scalable and adaptable alignment techniques that can generalize across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. Future work should explore extending these approaches to other code-mixed languages and non-Western dialects, ensuring AI safety frameworks remain inclusive and globally applicable.

\subsection{Prompt Templates}
Because texts from SGToxicityPrompts are individual statements or comments, we designed 21 prompt templates to adapt them to a conversational format. Prompt templates were manually generated by our team, with each template designed to potentially elicit a harmful response if paired with a toxic prompt from SGToxicityPrompts. This was determined through manual testing. Sample prompt templates are  shown in Fig \ref{fig:prompt_templates}.

\subsection{Prompt Template Filtering}
After designing the prompt templates, we generated SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct responses and scored them using LionGuard. Based on these scores, we further filtered out prompts from the non-toxic subset if they failed to produce a clear partition between safe and unsafe prompts. In other words, templates that disproportionately produced harmful responses even on safe prompts were filtered out from the safe subset. As a simple but strict heuristic, we removed prompt templates that did not have at least 80\% of safe prompts below the LionGuard high recall threshold. This led us to drop templates [1, 6, 7, 8 , 14, 15 ,16 ,17 ,19, 20] from the safe subset.

\subsection{TOXIGEN}
\label{appendix:toxigen}
% FILTERING APPROACH
In the TOXIGEN paper \citep{hartvigsen2022toxigenlargescalemachinegenerateddataset}, the training set of TOXIGEN is used to fine-tune a HateBert classifier, resulting in TOXIGEN-HateBert, which we use to score model responses. While there is no concern of leakage since we are scoring model responses, for avoidance of doubt we evaluate our models on the annotated test set of TOXIGEN. 

TOXIGEN includes human annotations for the following fields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{toxicity\_ai}$: perceived hatefulness assuming the text was AI-generated
    \item $\text{toxicity\_human}$: perceived hatefulness assuming the text was written by a human 
\end{itemize}
To ensure a higher quality evaluation set, we only use samples where either both $\text{toxicity\_ai}$ and $\text{toxicity\_human}$ are less than or equal to 2 (safe), or where both $\text{toxicity\_ai}$ and $\text{toxicity\_human}$ are more than or equal to 4 (unsafe). From an initial dataset size of 940, this results in a final dataset size of 740. Samples are shown in Fig \ref{fig:unsafe_samples} and \ref{fig:safe_samples}.

\section{Additional Experiment Details}
\subsection{LoRA Rank}
We conduct initial experiments with SFT to determine the best LoRA rank to use. For simplicity, we set $r=a$ for all experiments. Furthermore, we prioritize RR and FPR as defining metrics to select the best model. These results are shown in Table \ref{tab:rank_experiments}, indicating that $r=128$ is the best model.

\paragraph{Implementation} We evaluate Open LLM Leaderboard v2 performance using similar configurations outlined by Huggingface\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/leaderboards/en/open_llm_leaderboard/about}} via the \texttt{lm-evaluation-harness} library. However, due to bugs in implementing Huggingface's fork of \texttt{lm-evaluation-harness}, we use the main branch instead.

\paragraph{Normalization} We normalize scores using the same approach as Huggingface, where baseline performance is determined relative to each sub-task. For instance, if a sub-task is a multi-choice format with 4 options, the baseline performance is 25\%. Using sub-task baselines, we perform min-max normalization so that a score of 0 implies zero advantage over random guessing, while 100 indicates a perfect score.

\paragraph{Scores} We report per task normalized scores in Table \ref {tab:leaderboard_scores_raw} and  relative differences to SEA-Lion-v2.1-Instruct in Table \ref{tab:leaderboard_scores_all}.
