\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Games using LLMs.} With the advancement of LLMs, recent works examine their capabilities in playing games or assisting humans in gameplay~\cite{hu2024survey}. Classical games like Go~\cite{silver2017mastering}, chess~\cite{feng2024chessgpt}, Poker~\cite{huang2024pokergpt} have been used as initial testbeds for evaluating models' planning and decision-making abilities. More recently, more works have explored other genres for more dynamic and complex situations like text-based games~\cite{xiao2024llms, AGI-BY-2028, kazemi2024boardgameqa}, communication games~\cite{guan2025richelieu,xu2025learning}, and modern strategic video games~\cite{zhang2023creative,hu2024pok,qi2024civrealm,rao2024collaborative,ma2025large}. 
%such as Civilization~\cite{qi2024civrealm}, Minecraft~\cite{zhang2023creative,rao2024collaborative}, Pok√©mon~\cite{hu2024pok, huang2024pokergpt}, and Starcraft~\cite{ma2025large}. 
% Other research has also explored LLM capabilities in. 
In comparison, \benchmarknameonly{} takes inspiration from real-life text puzzle games and emphasizes evaluating LLM's capabilities in simple logic reasoning. Additionally, each game come with different level of difficulty for assessing the models' robustness.

\paragraph{Text-based Reasoning.} Text-based reasoning has been extensively studied across various domains, including commonsense reasoning~\cite{rajani2019explain,bhargava2022commonsense,zhao2023large}, mathematical reasoning~\cite{patel2021nlp,zhao2022multihiertt,lu2023mathvista}, logical reasoning~\cite{pan2023logic}, causal reasoning~\cite{wang2024causalbench,jin2024cladder}, and agent-based reasoning~\cite{motwani2024malt}. While existing benchmarks assess different aspects of reasoning, they often evaluate these abilities in isolation. In contrast, $\benchmarknameonly$ assesses LLMs' capacity for integrating multiple reasoning skills, offering a richer evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses.
% These studies primarily focus on leveraging pre-trained NLP models to enhance reasoning capabilities.
