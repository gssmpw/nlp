\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Games using LLMs.} With the advancement of LLMs, recent works examine their capabilities in playing games or assisting humans in gameplay____. Classical games like Go____, chess____, Poker____ have been used as initial testbeds for evaluating models' planning and decision-making abilities. More recently, more works have explored other genres for more dynamic and complex situations like text-based games____, communication games____, and modern strategic video games____. 
%such as Civilization____, Minecraft____, Pok√©mon____, and Starcraft____. 
% Other research has also explored LLM capabilities in. 
In comparison, \benchmarknameonly{} takes inspiration from real-life text puzzle games and emphasizes evaluating LLM's capabilities in simple logic reasoning. Additionally, each game come with different level of difficulty for assessing the models' robustness.

\paragraph{Text-based Reasoning.} Text-based reasoning has been extensively studied across various domains, including commonsense reasoning____, mathematical reasoning____, logical reasoning____, causal reasoning____, and agent-based reasoning____. While existing benchmarks assess different aspects of reasoning, they often evaluate these abilities in isolation. In contrast, $\benchmarknameonly$ assesses LLMs' capacity for integrating multiple reasoning skills, offering a richer evaluation of model strengths and weaknesses.
% These studies primarily focus on leveraging pre-trained NLP models to enhance reasoning capabilities.
