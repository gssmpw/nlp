\begin{abstract}
How effectively can LLM-based AI assistants utilize their memory (context) to perform various tasks? Traditional data benchmarks, which are often manually crafted, suffer from several limitations: they are static, susceptible to overfitting, difficult to interpret, and lack actionable insights--failing to pinpoint the specific capabilities a model lacks when it does not pass a test. In this paper, we present a framework for automatically generating a comprehensive set of tests to evaluate models' abilities to use their memory effectively. Our framework extends the range of capability tests beyond the commonly explored (passkey, key-value, needle in the haystack) search, a dominant focus in the literature. Specifically, we evaluate models on atomic tasks such as searching, recalling, editing, matching, comparing information in context memory, and performing basic operations when inputs are structured into distinct blocks, simulating real-world data. Additionally, we design composite tests to investigate the models' ability to maintain state while operating on memory. Our benchmark enables an interpretable, detailed assessment of memory capabilities of LLMs.

%How capable are LLM-based AI assistants in using their context (memory) to perform various tasks? It is known that Data benchmarks, which are mostly manually crafted, are static, prone to being overfitted on, not so interpretable and not actionable (they do not suggest what exact capabilities are missing if the model fail the tests). In this paper, we design a framework to automatically generate a range of atomic and composite tests to gauge the capabilities of the models in using their context. Our framework significantly expands the set of capabilities beyond simple key-value search capability which is used in the literature. We evaluate models' ability to search, recall, edit, match, compare information in the context memory, and perform simple operations when the input is structured into different blocks (which represent how in real world data is created). We also test how the models can keep state as parsing the context memory.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% This paper contributes to the advancement of Machine Learning by introducing a systematic and programmable evaluation framework for assessing the contextual processing capabilities of large language models. Our work provides insights into model strengths and limitations in handling various atomic and composite tasks, offering a structured way to analyze model behavior. These contributions can guide future research in improving model efficiency and reliability.

% We do not foresee any direct ethical concerns or negative societal consequences arising from this work. Our evaluation methodology is designed to be model-agnostic and does not involve sensitive data or high-stakes applications.
