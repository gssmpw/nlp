%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Search}} \\ \hline
String search (binary test) & Is the string $x$ in memory? $x$ could be a word or a sequence.\\ \hline
Key-value search & What is the word or phrase that is paired with keyword $x$?\\ \hline
Batch search & For each of the keywords in the batch $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k$, perform the search and return the batch of corresponding responses.   \\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Recall and Edit}}    \\ \hline
Snapshot & Share a snapshot of the entire memory (as a verbatim copy). \\ \hline
Replace all & Share the entire memory after replacing all occurrences of $x$ with~$y$. \\ \hline
Overwrite positions & Share the entire memory after overwriting the words that are on particular positions (e.g., every $k^{\text{th}}$ word) with~$y$. \\ \hline
Functional updates & Update every $x$ with the output of a function $f(x)$.\\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Match and Compare}}    \\ \hline
Compare positions (binary test) & Does $x$ appear before $y$? \\ \hline
Find duplicates & Which word/string has duplicates in memory? \\ \hline
Count & How many times is $x$ repeated in memory? \\ \hline
Check association (binary test) & Check if both $x$ and $y$ are associated with the same tag in memory (assuming every term is associated with a tag).\\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Spot the Differences}}    \\ \hline
Compare two lists & Give two lists $X$ and $Y$ of the same length (e.g., same number of words), report the difference (i.e., $X - Y$). \\ \hline
Identify the odd group & Given multiple sets, identify which one is different (assuming $n-1$ identical sets with shuffled elements, and $1$ set with some differences). \\ \hline
Patch the difference & A sequence of words is repeated multiple times, and then there is a partial sequence. What is the next $k^{\text{th}}$ element in the sequence? \\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Compute on Sets and Lists}}    \\ \hline
Group membership & Given $k$ sets, identify which set includes $x$. \\ \hline
Group association & Check if $x$ and $y$ belong to the same set. \\ \hline
Iterate & Given $k$ lists, return the last element in each list.  \\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Stateful Processing}}    \\ \hline
Quantity & Keep track of the total quantity of items, based on a sequence of addition and subtraction operations (e.g., ``add~10, subtract~2, add~7, ...''). \\ \hline
Set & Keep track of the items in a set, based on a sequence of addition and removal operation (e.g., ``add~apple, pear; add~orange; remove~apple; add~lime, ...''). \\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Processing Data Blocks}}    \\ \hline
Search, recall, and edit & The input contains alternating labeled lists of elements (e.g., ``L1: a, b, c; L2: h, f, i; L1: d, z, k; ...''). For a given list label (e.g., L1 or L2) and a specified element within that list, return all the elements that appear after that specified element in the same list. \\ \hline
%
\multicolumn{2}{l}
{\textbf{Composite-State Tracking (Theory of Mind)}}    \\ \hline
State tracking across data blocks & Perform ``Stateful Processing'' for multiple agents, and report the final set state for each agent. The input provides a list of operations by $k$ agents over time, including both independent actions (add/remove) and interactive actions (swap) (e.g., ``Alice: add apple, pear, remove orange, add banana; Bob: add peach, berry, remove kiwi; Charley: add lime; Bob: remove peach, swap berry with Alice for banana; ...''). \\ \hline

\caption{List of memory tests. We divide the tests into different categories based on the core expected capability for passing the test. Most the initial tests are atomic, i.e., the expected capability cannot be broken down into other meaningful capabilities. The tests at the bottom of the list are composite tests and require the model to have multiple atomic capabilities at the same time in order to succeed.}
