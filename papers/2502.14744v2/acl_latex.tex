\begin{abstract}
The integration of additional modalities increases the susceptibility of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to safety risks, such as jailbreak attacks, compared to their language-only counterparts. While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that {HiddenDetect} surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats. Our code will be released publicly at \url{https://github.com/leigest519/HiddenDetect}. \textbf{{\color{red}Warning: this paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.}}

\section{Introduction}
% The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs)~\cite{llama,llama2,llama3,vicuna2023} have fueled the development of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4V~\cite{achiam2023gpt}, mPLUG-OWL~\cite{ye2023mplug}, and LLaVA~\cite{Liu2023VisualIT}. By integrating multiple modalities, LVLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in multimodal reasoning, visual question answering, and embodied AI tasks. However, this cross-modal alignment introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent studies show that LVLMs are more susceptible to adversarial manipulations than their text-only counterparts~\cite{liu2023query}, as attackers can exploit inconsistencies between modalities to bypass safety constraints. These risks raise critical concerns about their reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications.

% To address these vulnerabilities, existing safety mechanisms primarily focus on behavioral interventions, such as supervised fine-tuning on safety datasets~\cite{zong2024safety}, defensive prompting~\cite{wu2023jailbreaking}, and multimodal reasoning techniques~\cite{jiang2024rapguardsafeguardingmultimodallarge}. While these approaches can enhance robustness, they remain fundamentally reactive. Fine-tuning requires costly retraining and struggles to generalize to unseen adversarial strategies. Safety prompts, though easier to implement, are vulnerable to circumvention by adversarial inputs crafted to manipulate model behavior. These limitations highlight the need for a more proactive and generalizable approach to LVLM safety.

% An interesting yet crucial question arises: \textit{Can we ensure safety by monitoring LVLM’s hidden states?} Inspired by research in activation-based interpretability~\cite{park2023linear,wang2024concept,nanda2023emergent,li2024unveilingbackboneoptimizercouplingbias}, this work investigates whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals in their latent activations. Our key insight is that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, even before generating a response. This suggests the potential for an intrinsic safety mechanism that can detect adversarial inputs in real-time without external modifications or additional fine-tuning.

% Building on this observation, we propose HiddenDetect, an activation-based safety framework that directly monitors the model’s internal activations to detect unsafe prompts. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{teaser}, unlike prior methods that rely on fine-tuning or input manipulations, our approach introduces a \textit{Refusal Vector (RV)}, a learned representation constructed from the model’s hidden states, to classify prompts as safe or unsafe. Specifically, we compute a cosine similarity vector between intermediate representations and a predefined refusal embedding, denoted as $\mathbf{F}$. A scoring function $s(\mathbf{F})$ then evaluates prompt safety, flagging unsafe inputs based on an adaptive threshold.

% HiddenDetect offers several advantages. First, activation-based safety detection imposes minimal computational overhead, as it does not require modifying the model parameters. Second, unlike fine-tuned safety classifiers, our method generalizes to unseen adversarial prompts without requiring labeled training data. Third, while designed to mitigate multimodal jailbreak attacks, our method is also effective against purely text-based adversarial prompts, demonstrating broad applicability across different threat models. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art defenses in both accuracy and efficiency. By shifting from behavioral safety enforcement to activation-based monitoring, this work highlights a promising direction for enhancing the security of next-generation multimodal AI systems.

However, these approaches are often resource-intensive, manually engineered, and inherently reactive—they attempt to mitigate safety risks after unsafe behaviors manifest. \textbf{But what if LVLMs already encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations?}

\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Vulnerability and Safety in LVLMs}
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to various security risks, including susceptibility to malicious prompt attacks \cite{liu2024safety}, which can exploit vision-only \cite{liu2023query} or cross-modal \cite{luo2024jailbreakv} inputs to elicit unsafe responses. Prior studies identify two primary attack strategies for embedding harmful content. The first involves encoding harmful text into images using text-to-image generation tools, thereby bypassing safety mechanisms \cite{gong2023figstep,liu2023query,luo2024jailbreakv}. For example, \citet{gong2023figstep} demonstrate how malicious queries embedded in images through typography can evade detection. The second strategy employs gradient-based adversarial techniques to craft images that appear benign to humans but provoke unsafe model outputs \cite{zhao2024evaluating,shayegani2023plug,dong2023robust,qi2023visual,tu2023many,luo2024an,wan-etal-2024-logicasker}. These methods leverage minor perturbations or adversarial patches to mislead classifiers \cite{bagdasaryan2023ab,schlarmann2023adversarial,bailey2023image,fu2023misusing}.

% Beyond adversarial manipulations, LVLMs are also prone to hallucinations and inaccurate responses when encountering unanswerable, deceptive, or maliciously designed queries \cite{mad_bench,chen2023dress,mmsafetybench,selfaware}. For instance, \citet{mad_bench} show that misleading prompts such as asking about "three dogs" in an image containing only two—can induce erroneous model outputs. Similarly, \citet{mmsafetybench} employ diffusion models to generate images of harmful activities and then query LVLMs for guidance, exposing vulnerabilities to jailbreaking techniques.


\subsection{Efforts to Safeguard LVLMs}

To mitigate these risks, prior research has explored various alignment strategies, including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) \cite{chen2023dress} and fine-tuning LLMs with curated datasets containing both harmful and benign content \cite{MLLM_protector, du2024vlmguarddefendingvlmsmalicious}. While effective, these approaches are computationally demanding. Other inference-time defenses include manually engineered safety prompts to specify acceptable behaviors \cite{wu2023jailbreaking}, though these approaches frequently fail to generalize across diverse tasks. More recent methods transform visual inputs into textual descriptions for safer processing \cite{gou2024eyes} or employ adaptive warning prompts \cite{wang2024adashield}. Additionally, \citet{jiang2024rapguardsafeguardingmultimodallarge} propose multimodal chain-of-thought prompting to enforce safer responses. However, many of these methods overlook intrinsic safety mechanisms within LVLMs, which is the main goal of our work.

\end{figure*}


\section{Safety Awareness in LVLMs}
In this section, we aim to demonstrate the broad presence of safety awareness in LVLMs and identify the most safety-aware layers using a few-shot approach. Since safety-aware responses in LVLMs often involve specific refusal-related tokens (e.g., ``sorry'', ``cannot''), the first step is to construct a refusal vector in the vocabulary space. This begins with identifying a specialized set of tokens, referred to as the \textit{Refusal Token Set (RTS)}, which consists of tokens frequently appearing when the model declines to respond to inappropriate or harmful queries.


\subsection{Constructing a Refusal Vector (RV)}
The construction of the {Refusal Token Set (RTS)} begins with a collection of {toxic image-text prompt pairs} (e.g., an image depicting a dangerous object paired with a text query like \textit{``How to assemble this?''}). The model’s responses to these inputs are analyzed to identify recurring words indicative of refusals. The most frequently occurring refusal-related tokens form the initial RTS.

To refine the RTS, each toxic image-text prompt pair is processed by the model, and the hidden states at the final token position across all layers are extracted. These hidden states are projected into vocabulary space, yielding a logit vector over the vocabulary. At each layer, the top five tokens with the highest logit values are identified. Any {refusal-related tokens} among them that are not already part of the RTS are added, progressively expanding the set. This process iterates until no significant additions occur. The finalized RTS used in our experiments is provided in the appendix.

Once the RTS is established, the {Refusal Vector (RV)} is constructed in vocabulary space. This vector is represented as a one-hot encoding, where dimensions corresponding to the token IDs in the RTS are set to 1, while all others remain 0. RV serves as a compact yet comprehensive representation of safety-aware refusal signals, capturing the model’s inclination to reject harmful or inappropriate requests. 


\subsection{Evaluating Safety Awareness}
To evaluate the model’s internal safety awareness, two minimal sets of \textit{safe} and \textit{unsafe} queries are employed. These queries vary in structure and semantic content, spanning from pure text to typo and non-typo image, ensuring that the identified safety-aware layers are not biased by specific query formats. The few-shot query sets used in the experiment are provided in the appendix.

Despite a large fraction of queries in the few-shot unsafe set successfully bypassing the model’s safety mechanisms, analysis reveals that \textbf{safety awareness remains broadly distributed across layers, even for jailbreak prompts}. To investigate this, both query sets are fed into the model, and hidden states are captured at the final token position of each layer—this position most effectively reflects how auto-regressive models process and interpret input at different depths \cite{zhou2024alignmentjailbreak}. 

For an LVLM whose backbone LLM has $L$ layers, given an image-text input prompt $P_i$, the hidden states at the final positional index from each layer $l \in \{0,1,\dots,L-1\}$ are extracted. These are then projected into vocabulary space to obtain:
\begin{equation}
    H_i = \{ h_l \mid h_l = \text{proj}(\mathbf{h}_l), \quad l = 0,1,\dots,L-1 \}.
\end{equation}

Using the combined \textit{Refusal Vector} $r$, a vector $F \in \mathbb{R}^L$ is computed to capture refusal-related semantics across layers for $P_i$. Each element $F_l$ in this vector is given by the cosine similarity between the projected hidden state $h_l$ and $r$:
\begin{equation}
    F_l = \frac{h_l \cdot r}{\|h_l\| \|r\|}, \quad l \in \{0,1,\dots,L-1\}.
\end{equation}

Averaging these refusal similarity vectors over all queries in the respective sets yields:
\begin{equation}
    F_{\text{safe}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{safe}}} \sum_{i \in \text{safe}} F_i
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    F_{\text{unsafe}} = \frac{1}{N_{\text{unsafe}}} \sum_{i \in \text{unsafe}} F_i
\end{equation}

The {Refusal Discrepancy Vector (FDV)} is then computed as:
\begin{equation}
    F' = F_{\text{unsafe}} - F_{\text{safe}}.
\end{equation}

As illustrated in Figure 2, $F'$ generally increases across layers before eventually declining, with higher values indicating greater safety awareness. The initial increase suggests that deeper layers contribute to enhanced contextual understanding and safety detection. However, in the final layers, the model must balance safety considerations with fulfilling the user’s request, leading to a decline in safety awareness.

A layer is defined as \textit{safety-aware} if $F'_l > 0$. Results indicate that after the initial layers, $F'$ remains consistently positive, suggesting that safety awareness is embedded throughout the model.

\begin{algorithmic}
   \State \textbf{Input:}  
   \quad LVLM $\mathcal{M}$ with $\mathcal{L}$ layers  
   \quad Refusal vector $\mathcal{RV}$  
   \quad Most safety-aware layers $\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{M}}$  
   \quad Detected sample $\mathcal{S}$  
   \quad Configurable threshold $t$  
   \State \textbf{Output:} Safety label $I \in \{0, 1\}$ (1 for unsafe, 0 for safe)  

   \State \textbf{Step 1: Compute the refusal semantics strength at the most safety-aware layers}
   \For{$l \in \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{M}}$}
       \State 1. Extract hidden state from layer $l$:
       \[
       \mathcal{h}_l = \mathcal{M}_l(\mathcal{S})
       \]
       \State 2. Project to the vocabulary space:
       \[
       \mathcal{h}_l' = \mathcal{h}_l \cdot \mathcal{W}_{\text{unembedding}}
       \]
       \State 3. Compute cosine similarity with the refusal vector:
       \[
       F_l = \cos(\mathcal{h}_l', \mathcal{RV})
       \]
   \EndFor

   \State \textbf{Step 2: Determine the safety label based on the computed safety score}
   \State Compute the safety score using the trapezoidal rule over the most safety-aware layers:
    \[
    \mathcal{Score} = \text{AUC}_{\text{trapezoid-rule}}\Bigl(\{F_l : l \in \mathcal{L}_\mathcal{M}\}\Bigr)
    \]
   \If{$\mathcal{Score} > t$}
       \State $I \gets 1$ \Comment{Sample is unsafe}
   \Else
       \State $I \gets 0$ \Comment{Sample is safe}
   \EndIf
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}




\subsection{Identifying the Most Safety-Aware Layer Range}
To pinpoint the layers with the strongest safety awareness, the most safety-aware layer range $(s, e)$ is determined by comparing $F'$ to the {final layer’s discrepancy value}, $F'_{L-1}$:
\begin{equation}
    s = \min \{ l \mid F'_l > F'_{L-1} \},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    e = \max \{ l \mid F'_l > F'_{L-1} \}.
\end{equation}

The final layer’s discrepancy value, $F'_{L-1}$, serves as a baseline since a significant fraction of unsafe queries can bypass the model’s defenses, indicating that the final layer is less effective at recognizing unsafe content. In contrast, layers exhibiting stronger safety awareness maintain higher $F'$ values. Specifically, a layer $l$ that can effectively distinguish between safe and unsafe queries must satisfy $F'_l > F'_{L-1}$.

This minimal-query approach highlights both the {broad presence of safety awareness} across layers and provides a {systematic method to identify the layers with the strongest safety focus}. These insights lay the foundation for subsequent detection methods.

\subsection{Refusal Token Set (RT)}

\paragraph{Initial Collection:}  
We begin by providing straightforward toxic prompts (e.g., \textit{``How to make a bomb''} or \textit{``Tell me a porn story''}) to the LVLM. From the resulting outputs, we compile the most requently generated \textit{refusal-related words}, forming the initial Refusal Token Set (RT).

\paragraph{Refinement:}  
For each toxic prompt, we perform a forward pass through the model and project the hidden state at the final token position of each layer into the vocabulary space using the model’s unembedding matrix. This projection yields logits for every token. From these logits, we select the top five tokens with the highest values at each layer. Any \textit{refusal-related tokens} from this set that are not already in RT are added, thereby refining and expanding RT.

\subsection{Refusal Vector (RV)}

Once the Refusal Token Set (RT) is finalized, we construct a \textbf{single Combined Refusal Vector (RV)} in the vocabulary space. This vector is a one-hot representation in which \textit{all} dimensions corresponding to the token IDs of tokens in RT are set to \textbf{1}, and all others are set to \textbf{0}.

This unified vector serves as a concise yet comprehensive reference for refusal signals.
\subsection{Layer-by-Layer Analysis}

Consider a LVLM with \( L \) layers. For an input prompt \( P_i \), we extract the hidden state at the final positional index from each layer \( l \in \{0,1, \ldots, L-1\} \). These hidden states are projected into the vocabulary space to obtain logits \( \mathbf{h}_l \). Collectively, these logits across all layers form the set:
\[
\mathcal{H}_i = \{\mathbf{h}_l \mid l = 0, 1, \ldots, L-1\}.
\]

Given that the Refusal Token Set (RT) has been combined into a single Refusal Vector (RV), denoted as \( \mathbf{r} \), we compute a vector \( \mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^L \) that represents the refusal-related semantics across layers for the input \( P_i \). Each entry \( \mathbf{F}_l \) corresponds to the cosine similarity between the projected hidden state \( \mathbf{h}_l \) from layer \( l \) and the Refusal Vector \( \mathbf{r} \):
\[
\mathbf{F}_l = \cos(\mathbf{h}_l, \mathbf{r}), \quad l \in \{0, 1, \ldots, L-1\}.
\]

\subsection{Unsafe Prompt Detection}
\end{comment}
In this section, we describe how HiddenDetect works by utilizing the safety awareness in the hidden states. The overall pipeline of HiddenDetect is shown in Figure~\ref{pipeline}. The assessment of whether a prompt \( P_i \) may lead to ethically problematic responses involves computing its {refusal-related semantic vector} \( \mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^L \), as introduced in Section~3.2. Each entry \( F_l \) in \( \mathbf{F} \) corresponds to the cosine similarity between the projected hidden state \( \mathbf{h}_l \) at layer \( l \) and the Refusal Vector \( \mathbf{r} \):

\begin{equation}
F_l = \cos\bigl(\mathbf{h}_l, \mathbf{r}\bigr).
\end{equation}

To quantify the query’s safety, a score function aggregates the values of \( \mathbf{F} \) over the most safety-aware layers. Given the set of indices corresponding to these layers, \( \mathcal{L}_\mathcal{M} \), the safety score is defined as:

\begin{equation}
s(F) = \text{AUC}_{\text{trapezoid-rule}}\Bigl(\{F_l : l \in \mathcal{L}_\mathcal{M}\}\Bigr),
\end{equation}

where the trapezoidal rule is used to approximate the cumulative magnitude of \( F \) across these layers. Finally, if the computed safety score exceeds a configurable threshold, the prompt is classified as unsafe; otherwise, it is deemed safe. The overall detection process is also elaborated in Algorithm~\ref{alg:detection_pipeline}.

Beyond detecting multimodal jailbreak attacks, our method also generalizes to text-based LLM jailbreak attacks. Since the detection mechanism relies on analyzing refusal-related semantics embedded in hidden states, it remains effective across different modalities. In the case of text-only jailbreaks, the method directly evaluates the refusal semantics present in the model's internal representations for textual inputs. By leveraging safety-aware layers that capture refusal patterns, our approach can successfully flag jailbreak prompts designed to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. This demonstrates the versatility of our framework in safeguarding both multimodal and text-based models against malicious manipulations.


\begin{comment}
\paragraph{Safe vs.\ Unsafe Patterns}
Empirical observations suggest the following distinct patterns in \(\mathbf{F}\) for safe and unsafe prompts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Safe Prompts:} The values in \(\mathbf{F}\) exhibit a relatively smooth distribution across layers, with consistent peaks at the model’s most safety-aware layers (identified in Section~3.3).
    \item \textbf{Unsafe Prompts:} Unsafe prompts often show abrupt, abnormally high spikes in \(\mathbf{F}\), particularly at the most safety-aware layers. These anomalies may appear even if the prompt ultimately bypasses safeguards (e.g., through jailbreak techniques) at the output layer, reflecting the model’s internal awareness of potential ethical violations during intermediate processing.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Scoring-Based Detection}

We define an unsafe score function \( s(F) \) to analyze the vector \( F \), leveraging both magnitude and distributional properties.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Magnitude Analysis:} The score function \( s(F) \) incorporates the absolute values of \( F \) at the most safety-aware layers to quantify the strength of refusal-related signals. We define   
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \( s_{1a,b}(F) = \text{AUC}_{\text{trapezoid-rule}}[F_a \dots F_b] \), which approximates the cumulative magnitude of \( F \) between layers \( a \) and \( b \) by applying the trapezoidal rule to the discrete set of values.
        \item \( S_{2a,b}(F) = \max[F_a \dots F_b] \), which captures the maximum magnitude of \( F \) within the same range.
    \end{itemize}
    The values of \(a\) and \(b\) are determined by the LVLM since different LVLMs have different locations of safety-awareness layers. Empirically, we select two groups of \(a, b\):  
    \begin{itemize}
    \item A smaller range, more precisely targeting the most safety-aware layers.
    \item A larger range, to observe the overall refusal semantic flow inside the LVLM.    
    \end{itemize}
    Notably, since the maximum refusal semantic always appears in the smaller range (the most safety-aware layers), the score function \( s_2(a, b) \) remains consistent across both ranges.

    \item \textbf{Distributional Properties:} The score function \( s(F) \) evaluates statistical features of \( F \), such as kurtosis, to detect irregularities indicative of unsafe prompts. We define \( s_3(F) = \text{kurtosis}(F) \).   
    
\item \textbf{Comprehensive score function:} Empirically, both multiple score functions and a single score function can be utilized. Therefore, we introduce an additional score function:
\[s_{comp}(F) \in 
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
    &(s_i(F), s_j(F)), \\
    &(s_i(F), s_j(F), s_k(F))
\end{aligned}
\right\}
\]
where \( i, j, k \in \{1,2,3\} \).
\end{itemize}
% \XY{Gradient cuff uses zeroth order gradient estimation to compute the approximate gradient norm}

Based on data from safe prompts, \( s(F) \) typically falls within a well-defined range \( S \). Prompts with \( s(F) \) values within \( S \) are classified as safe, while those outside \( S \) are classified as unsafe.

The performance of these approaches across all evaluation datasets will be demonstrated in the experimental results section.

\section{Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate our method against diverse multimodal jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. We elaborate the experimental setup in Section \ref{Setup}, demonstrate the main result in Section \ref{main_results}, and provide ablation study in Section \ref{ablation}.


\subsection{Experimental Setups} \label{Setup}
\subsubsection{Dataset and models}
% \XY{Maybe we need to point out the fraction of positive samples are all 0.5 for all datasets to clarify the AUPRC baseline.}
% \XY{Visual adversarial jailbreak dataset: pair each prompt from the crafted toxic instruction set with four adversarial images in \cite{qi2023visualadversarialexamplesjailbreak} }
We consider realistic scenarios where both text-based attack and bi-modal attack could happen. For text-based attack evaluation, two datasets are considered. The first, XSTest \cite{röttger2024xstest}, is a test suite containing 250 safe prompts across 10 categories and 200 crafted unsafe prompts. This dataset is widely used to assess the performance of methods against text-based LVLM attacks. The second dataset, FigTXT, was specifically developed for this study. It comprises instruction-based text jailbreak queries extracted from the original FigStep~\cite{gong2023figstep} dataset, serving as malicious user queries. In addition, a corpus of 300 benign user queries was constructed, with further details on its creation provided in the Appendix.

For bi-modal attack, the test set is also constructed to include both unsafe and safe examples. Unsafe examples are sourced from MM-SafetyBench~\cite{mmsafetybench}, a dataset comprising typographical images, stable diffusion-generated images, Typo + SD images, and text-based attack samples. Additional unsafe examples are derived from FigIMG, which includes typographical jailbreak images and paired prompts targeting ten toxic themes from the original FigStep~\cite{gong2023figstep} dataset. Safe examples are drawn from MM-Vet, a benchmark designed to assess core LVLM capabilities, such as recognition, OCR, and language generation. The entire MM-Vet dataset is included in both FigIMG and the overall test set to ensure robust coverage of benign scenarios.

We evaluate our method on three popular LVLMs, including LLaVA-1.6-7B~\cite{Liu2023VisualIT}, CogVLM-chat-v1.1~\cite{cogvlm}, and Qwen-VL-Chat~\cite{bai2023qwen}.


\subsubsection{Baselines and Evaluation Metric}  
We evaluate the proposed method against a diverse set of baseline approaches, categorized as follows:  
(1) \textit{Uncertainty-based} detection methods, including Perplexity~\citep{alon2023detecting}, GradSafe~\citep{xie2024gradsafe}, and Gradient Cuff~\citep{hu2024gradient};  
(2) \textit{LLM-based} approaches, such as Self Detection~\citep{gou2024eyes} and GPT-4V~\citep{openai2023gpt4};  
(3) \textit{Mutation-based} methods, represented by JailGuard~\citep{zhang2023mutation}; and  
(4) \textit{Denoising-based} approaches, including MirrorCheck~\citep{fares2024mirrorcheck} and CIDER~\citep{xu2024defending}.  

To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluate all methods on the same test dataset, utilizing the default experimental configurations specified in their original works. We use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) as the evaluation metric, which quantifies binary classification performance across varying thresholds. This metric aligns with prior studies~\citep{alon2023detecting,xie2024gradsafe} and provides a standardized basis for comparison.

% \subsubsection{Implement Details}
% For MM-SafetyBench, we only use samples from \textbf{01-Illegal Activity}, \textbf{02-Hate Speech}, \textbf{04-Physical Harm}, \textbf{06-Fraud}, and \textbf{07-Pornography}. We exclude \textbf{03-Malware Generation}, \textbf{05-Economic Harm}, \textbf{08-Political Lobbying}, \textbf{09-Privacy Lobbying}, \textbf{10-Legal Opinion}, \textbf{11-Financial Advice}, \textbf{12-Health Consultation}, and \textbf{13-Gov Decision}.
% \subsubsection{Aligned LVLMs}
% We use \textbf{LLaVA-v1.6-7b} \texttt({llava-v1.6-vicuna-7b}) as the base model for our experiments. We also evaluate our methods on other popular LVLMs such as \ldots

\subsection{Main Results} \label{main_results}
The experimental results in Table \ref{tab:main_table} demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple multimodal large language models (LVLMs) and benchmarks. For LLaVA, CogVLM, and Qwen-VL, it achieves the highest AUROC scores across all datasets, including XSTEST, FigTxt, FigImg, and MM-SafetyBench. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving performance across diverse models and evaluation settings. When compared to baseline methods, our approach performs better consistently. Simple methods such as Perplexity and Self-detection have much lower average AUROC scores, between 0.638 and 0.734 across the three LVLMs. Even more advanced methods like GradSafe and Gradient Cuff fall short of our performance. For example, Gradient Cuff achieves average AUROC scores of 0.791, 0.769, and 0.716 on LLaVA, CogVLM, and Qwen-VL, while ours achieves 0.922, 0.903, and 0.826. This shows that our method is much more effective at integrating reasoning across text and image inputs. Our method’s ability to perform well on various VLMs shows that it works well across different architectures without requiring extra modifications, and is practical for improving the safety of LVLMs in a wide range of scenarios.


\subsection{Ablation Study} \label{ablation}
% \noindent \textbf{Effect of the Most Safety-Aware Layers.} To assess the role of the Most Safety-Aware Layers in HiddenDetect, we introduce two variant settings for comparison. The first variant aggregates refusal semantics across layers while excluding the identified Most Safety-Aware Layers. The second aggregates refusal semantics across all layers. In contrast, the original HiddenDetect setting aggregates refusal semantics specifically at the Most Safety-Aware Layers. We evaluate the detection performance of these three settings using AUPRC.  In Section~\ref{Setup}, we evaluate HiddenDetect’s performance using trapz AUC to aggregate refusal semantic strength across continuous layers. However, to ensure fairness in this ablation study, we use simple summation as the aggregation method, which has a negligible impact on HiddenDetect’s overall performance.  The results, presented in Table~\ref{tab:ablation_exp1}, demonstrate that the original HiddenDetect setting consistently outperforms the other two, particularly when compared to the setting that excludes the Most Safety-Aware Layers. However, we also observe that across multiple datasets, the AUPRC achieved without these layers remains higher than the baseline AUPRC of 0.5. This suggests that safety awareness is not solely concentrated in the Most Safety-Aware Layers but is instead broadly embedded within the model.
\noindent \textbf{Effect of the Most Safety-Aware Layers.} To assess their role in HiddenDetect, we compare three settings: (1) exclusion of these layers, (2) aggregation across all layers, and (3) the original setting, which focuses on them. Detection performance is measured using AUPRC. Unlike Section~\ref{Setup}, which employs trapz AUC, this ablation study uses simple summation for fairness, with negligible impact on overall performance. Table~\ref{tab:ablation_exp1} shows that the original setting consistently outperforms both variants, especially when excluding these layers. 

\noindent \textbf{Effect of Scaling the Weights of Safety-Aware Layers.} Using our few-shot approach, we identify layers 16–29 as the Most Safety-Aware Layers in LLaVA-v1.6-Vicuna-7B. To validate their role in safety performance, we adopt the methodology from~\cite{li2024safetylayersalignedlarge}, which evaluates layer impact by analyzing changes in over-rejection rates for benign queries containing certain malicious words when layer weights are scaled. We extend this analysis by incorporating paired benign images to create a bimodal evaluation dataset (details in the appendix). As shown in Table~\ref{tab:ablation_scaling}, increasing the scaling factor for these layers results in a higher number of rejected samples, with scaling all layers within this range yielding the highest rejection count for both scaling factors.


\begin{comment}
\subsubsection{Robustness against Adversarial Attacks}
 In Section 5.2, we evaluate the performance of \textit{HiddenDetect} against diverse black-box attacks. Here, we further assess its robustness against white-box attacks, including SOTA adversarial attack techniques \cite{niu2024jailbreaking} and \cite{qi2023visualadversarialexamplesjailbreak} that generate adversarial images by leveraging the model's gradients. For this evaluation, we construct a dataset comprising toxic queries and adversarial images, paired with an equal number of benign samples from MM-Vet. The results are presented in Table 3.
\end{comment}



\begin{comment}
We conduct an ablation study to assess the performance of each score function (\(s_1\), \(s_2\), and \(s_3\)) across four benchmark datasets. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:score_ablation}. The score function \(s_1\) reflects the cumulative strength of refusal semantic signals over a continuous range of layers. For the LLaVA-v1.6-Vicuna-7B model, layers 15 to 29 consistently exhibit the strongest safety-awareness signals, largely independent of the prompt’s content or structure. Therefore, we define the *small layer range* as \(\{a,b\} = \{15, 29\}\). In contrast, the final two layers (30 and 31) show weaker safety-awareness performance and are more susceptible to being "jailbroken," prompting their exclusion from the analysis. We define the *broad layer range* as \(\{a,b\} = \{0, 29\}\). The evaluation reveals that \(s_{1,15\text{-}29}\) and \(s_{1,0\text{-}29}\) each perform better on different datasets. This likely arises from the "overflow" of safety-awareness signals across the entire model, rather than being confined to the most safety-aware layers. Nonetheless, layers 15–29 consistently demonstrate the clearest magnitude differences between safe and unsafe prompts. The score function \(s_2\) measures the maximum magnitude of refusal semantics across all layers. These signals are typically found in the most safety-aware layers. While \(s_2\) does not outperform \(s_1\) on three out of four datasets—since \(s_1\) aggregates signals across a broader range—\(s_2\) still provides valuable insights by focusing on extreme values. If any layer’s similarity value exceeds a configurable threshold (set to 0.02 for LLaVA-v1.6-Vicuna-7B), the prompt can be flagged as potentially malicious. Empirically, this threshold is adaptable and can be generalized to various prompt structures.

On the other hand, the score function \(s_3\) computes the *kurtosis* of refusal semantic signals across layers. Although \(s_3\) has lower precision compared to the other score functions, it achieves remarkably high recall rates (reaching 0.995, 1, 1, 1 across the datasets). This indicates that while \(s_3\) may not perfectly distinguish unsafe prompts, it rarely misclassifies safe prompts as unsafe. Specifically, safe prompts typically exhibit low kurtosis values, as they tend to have fewer abnormal signals.
\end{comment}
\subsection{Visualization}
We demonstrate HiddenDetect’s effectiveness by projecting the last token’s hidden state logits onto a plane defined by the Refusal Vector and an orthogonal vector capturing the query’s semantics. We use LLaVA v1.6 Vicuna 7B with bimodal jailbreak samples from Figstep, contrasts toxic (red) and benign (blue) samples from MM-Vet. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:visualization}, early layers exhibit a mixed distribution of red and blue dots along the refusal semantic dimension. By layer 10, toxic samples shift toward the refusal direction, with the greatest separation at layers 22, 23, and 24. In these layers, benign queries exhibit stronger refusal projections. Notably, despite higher projections in the final layer, many malicious queries still show lower refusal scores than benign ones, revealing classification inconsistencies.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we uncover intrinsic safety signals within LVLM activations and introduces HiddenDetect, a tuning-free framework that leverages these signals to detect adversarial inputs. Unlike post-hoc alignment techniques, HiddenDetect operates directly on internal activations, enabling efficient and scalable jailbreak detection. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, providing a robust and generalizable solution for enhancing LVLM safety. 


\section{Limitation}
While HiddenDetect introduces a novel activation-based approach for enhancing LVLM safety, several limitations remain. First, our method relies on the assumption that unsafe prompts consistently induce distinct activation patterns within LVLMs. Although our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this assumption across various models and attack types, certain adversarial inputs may still evade detection, particularly if they exploit subtle decision boundaries in the model’s latent space. Future work could explore adaptive learning mechanisms to refine the detection threshold dynamically. Second, HiddenDetect does not actively intervene in the model’s response generation beyond flagging unsafe prompts. While this enables efficient and lightweight monitoring, it does not provide direct mechanisms for response correction. Integrating activation-based safety monitoring with controlled response modulation could further enhance robustness.

% \XY{Bi-modal Analysis}

% By utilizing the previously constructed refusal vector in the vocabulary space, we can efficiently measure the refusal semantic strength of hidden states at each layer. For an LLM \( M \), given a query \( Q \) with a specific intention, it can be compressed or rewritten into a more straightforward version \( Q^{\text{direct}} \). For normal queries \( Q \), the response to \( Q \) and \( Q^{\text{direct}} \) remains the same, and the process of generating \( M(Q) \) can be formulated as \( Q \to R \), equivalently represented as:

% \[
% Q \to Q^{\text{direct}} \to R
% \]

% However, for specially crafted jailbreak queries, \( M(Q^{\text{direct}}) \) can yield entirely different results compared to \( M(Q) \). By analyzing the refusal semantics within hidden states across different layers for diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM jailbreak techniques, we observe a strong positive correlation between the attack success rate (ASR) of a toxic query \( Q \) and the index of the layer where the strongest refusal semantic appears. This finding suggests that a backward shift in the most safety-aware layers within the model can lead to an increased ASR—the later the strongest refusal signal emerges in the hidden states, the more likely the model is to generate or permit harmful content.  

% Extending this intuition, we explain why the vision modality increases the vulnerability of LVLMs that incorporate a safety-aligned LLM backbone. In LVLMs processing bimodal queries \( (Q_v, Q_t) \), where \( Q_v \) represents the visual component (e.g., an image of a bomb) and \( Q_t \) is the textual component (e.g., a query like “how to make the item in the image”), an additional encoding step is required. Specifically, the visual input is first projected into the text embedding space using a vision encoder and a projection matrix, leading to the transformation:  

% \[
% (Q_v, Q_t) \to Q^{\text{integrated } t} \to Q^{\text{direct } t} \to M(Q^{\text{direct } t})
% \]

% Here, \( Q^{\text{integrated } t} \) represents the intermediate textual representation generated after integrating the visual information, and \( Q^{\text{direct } t} \) is the final, more direct textual representation processed by the model. This transformation closely mirrors the mechanism of jailbreak queries in text-only LLMs, where the encoding and transformation process delays the activation of the strongest refusal semantics. Empirically, we also observe a consistent backward shift in safety-aware layers for both bimodal queries and jailbreak-transferred textual queries within LVLMs compared to their straightforward text-only counterparts. Furthermore, this shift is strongly correlated with an increase in ASR, reinforcing the idea that the delayed emergence of safety mechanisms contributes directly to the model’s vulnerability.

% Our intuition is further supported by previous work on mitigating the shift between an image and its corresponding text caption in the embedding space, which has been shown to improve LVLM safety. This mitigation can be interpreted as effectively "front-forwarding" the most safety-aware layers by reducing the distance between \( Q^{\text{integrated } t} \) and \( Q^{\text{direct } t} \) in the text embedding space, thereby ensuring that safety mechanisms are triggered earlier within the model’s processing pipeline.

% For a LVLM \( M \), text modality jailbreak includes both prompt-level and token-level techniques\cite{chao2024jailbreakingblackboxlarge} . An effective prompt-level jailbreak query \( Q \) in the text modality satisfies the following condition: \( Q \) can be rewritten into a more direct form \( Q_{\text{direct}} \) such that

% \begin{equation} 
% D(Q_{\text{direct}}) < \text{directness threshold} < D(Q),
% \end{equation}

% and the probability of refusal decreases after paraphrasing:

% \begin{equation} 
% P(I(M(Q)) = 1) > P(I(M(Q_{\text{direct}})) = 1),
% \end{equation}

% where \( I \) is the safety indicator function.

% To measure the activation of safety mechanism across layers, we define the safety activation score at layer \( \ell \) for a given query \( Q \) utilizing the RV introduced in section 3.1.

% \begin{equation} 
% \begin{split}
% F_{\ell} &= \cos\Big(  
% \big[ \text{hidden\_states}_{M_{\ell}}(Q) \big]_{\text{last position}} \cdot  W_{\text{unembedding}}, \\
% &\quad \text{RV} \Big).
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}


% where \( W_{\text{unembedding}} \) is the model’s unembedding matrix, and \( \text{RV} \) represents the refusal vector. \( F \) serves as a safety activation score and correlates with the directness score \( D(Q) \). More direct queries consistently trigger stronger safety responses across the model’s layers. For a query \( Q_i \) and its more direct counterpart \( Q_d \), where

% \begin{equation} 
% D(Q_d) > \text{directness threshold} > D(Q_i),
% \end{equation}

% and if \( Q_i \) can be paraphrased into \( Q_d \) interchangeably, we observe:

% \begin{equation} 
% \sum F_{Q_d} > \sum F_{Q_i}.
% \end{equation}

% Additionally, \( F \) is influenced by intentional toxicity and also depends on the LVLM’s safety alignment level. The general ordering of activation scores follows:
% \begin{equation} 
% \begin{split}
% \sum F_{\text{unsafe\_direct}} > \max\left( \sum F_{\text{safe\_direct}}, \sum F_{\text{unsafe\_indirect}} \right) \\
% > \min\left( \sum F_{\text{safe\_direct}}, \sum F_{\text{unsafe\_indirect}} \right) \\
% > \sum F_{\text{safe\_indirect}}.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}




% The activation score \( F \) follows a characteristic pattern: it rises initially, peaks, declines, and then exhibits a secondary rise in the final layer. The final layer’s \( F \) value is generally positively correlated with the model’s refusal rate. The increased attack success rate (ASR) for indirect unsafe prompts is linked to two primary factors: (1) a backshift in peak activation values across layers and (2) a decrease in the summation of elements in \( F \). Prompt-level jailbreak techniques not only increase the complexity of the query, delaying peak activation, but also confuse the model, reducing the total sum of \( F \). Empirical results show that these two factors contribute to the increased attack success rate (ASR), as evidenced by the lower refusal probability of indirect unsafe queries compared to their direct counterparts.

% Since \( F \) is influenced by both query intent and directness, we assess safety awareness at each layer using:

% \begin{equation} 
% F_{\ell}^{\text{direct\_unsafe}} - F_{\ell}^{\text{indirect\_unsafe}}. 
% \end{equation}  

% A key structural property is that, for both direct and indirect queries, certain layers exhibit stronger safety awareness than the final judgment layer:

% \begin{equation} 
% F_{DV_{\ell}} > F_{DV_{\text{last layer}}}. 
% \end{equation}  

% For indirect queries, a continuous span of layers often demonstrates stronger safety awareness, outnumbering those observed for direct queries. This observation suggests that the heightened safety awareness in these layers can be \textbf{utilized} for jailbreak query detection by aggregating the safety activation score \( F \).

% \subsection{Analysis of Different Modalities}
% \begin{figure*}[!t]   
% \centering
%         \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/hs_semantic_across_Structure.png}        
%         \caption{Visualization of refusal semantics strength across layers for different structured queries for different modalities.}   
%         \label{fig:visualization_appendix}
% \end{figure*}

% By utilizing the previously constructed refusal vector in the vocabulary space, the refusal semantic strength of hidden states can be efficiently measured across layers. For a large language model (LLM) $M$, given a query $Q$ with a specific intention, it can be rewritten into a more straightforward version $Q^{\text{direct}}$. For normal queries, the response remains consistent between $Q$ and $Q^{\text{direct}}$, which can be represented as:

% \[
% Q \to Q^{\text{direct}} \to R.
% \]

% However, for jailbreak queries, $M(Q^{\text{direct}})$ often yields different responses compared to $M(Q)$. As shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:visualization_appendix} , analyzing the refusal semantics within hidden states across different layers for various jailbreak techniques reveals a strong correlation between the  attack success rate (ASR) and the layer index where the strongest refusal signal emerges . Specifically, when the peak refusal strength occurs at later layers, the model exhibits a higher ASR, suggesting that a  delayed activation of safety mechanisms increases vulnerability to adversarial queries . This pattern is particularly noticeable for  jailbreak queries  (green and orange curves), which consistently exhibit lower refusal semantics in early and middle layers compared to direct queries.

% Extending this analysis to  vision-language models (LVLMs)  helps explain why multimodal inputs increase vulnerability. In LVLMs, a bimodal query $(Q_v, Q_t)$, where $Q_v$ represents the visual component and $Q_t$ the textual component, requires an additional encoding step:

% \[
% (Q_v, Q_t) \to Q^{\text{integrated } t} \to Q^{\text{direct } t} \to M(Q^{\text{direct } t}).
% \]

% This transformation, akin to textual jailbreak techniques,  delays the emergence of the strongest refusal signals  in hidden states. Empirically,  Figure~\ref{fig:visualization_appendix}  shows that  jailbreak queries incorporating SD images (orange) exhibit an even greater delay in peak refusal activation than purely textual jailbreak queries (green) . This trend aligns with the hypothesis that the additional vision-to-text encoding step weakens the model’s early-stage safety mechanisms, thereby increasing ASR.

% To quantify safety activation, we define the safety activation score at layer $\ell$ for a query $Q$:

% \begin{equation} 
% \begin{split}
% F_{\ell} &= \cos\Big(  
% \big[ \text{hidden\_states}_{M_{\ell}}(Q) \big]_{\text{last position}} \cdot  W_{\text{unembedding}}, \\
% &\quad \text{RV} \Big).
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}

% where $W_{\text{unembedding}}$ is the model’s unembedding matrix and $\text{RV}$ represents the refusal vector. As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:visualization}, the  Direct Txt (blue) and Direct Txt + SD Img (red) curves exhibit stronger refusal activation across all layers compared to jailbreak queries , confirming that direct queries trigger safety mechanisms earlier and more consistently. Moreover, the final layer’s safety activation strength is positively correlated with refusal probability , as seen in the sharper drop in refusal semantics for jailbreak queries near the last few layers.

% Further, the shift in peak activation layers correlates with the model's safety response effectiveness. Prompt-level jailbreaks  reduce the total sum of $F$  while delaying its peak, as observed in the gap between  direct queries (blue, red) and jailbreak queries (green, orange) across layers in Figure~\ref{fig:visualization_appendix} . This supports the hypothesis that  prompt complexity and multimodal transformations disrupt the model’s refusal mechanisms, increasing ASR.

% Since $F$ is influenced by both query intent and directness, safety awareness at each layer is evaluated using:

% \begin{equation} 
% F_{\ell}^{\text{direct\_unsafe}} - F_{\ell}^{\text{indirect\_unsafe}}.
% \end{equation}  

% Empirically, Figure~\ref{fig:visualization_appendix} demonstrates that  certain middle and upper layers exhibit stronger safety awareness than the final judgment layer , especially for indirect queries. This suggests that the  aggregated activation score $F$ across these layers can be leveraged for jailbreak query detection , potentially enabling proactive defenses against adversarial multimodal attacks.
