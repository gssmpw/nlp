\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\begin{nobreakwords}
In this paper, we introduce \toolnospace, a novel framework that leverages the multi-agent prompting capabilities of LLMs for efficient code generation in problem-solving tasks. \tool integrates three agents—planning, coding, and debugging—to effectively solve programming problems. It harnesses the power of simulation for plan verification and debugging, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches by a wide margin. Future work will focus on extending this approach to other domains such as mathematical reasoning and question answering broadening its scope and impact.
