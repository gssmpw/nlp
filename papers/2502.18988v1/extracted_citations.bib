abstract = {Recommender systems' (RSs) research has mostly focused on algorithms aimed at improving platform owners' revenues and user's satisfaction. However, RSs have additional effects, which are related to their impact on users' choices. In order to avoid an undesired system behaviour and anticipate the effects of an RS, the literature suggests employing simulations. In this article we present a novel, well grounded and flexible simulation framework. We adopt a stochastic user's choice model and simulate users' repeated choices for items in the presence of alternative RSs. Properties of the simulated choices, such as their diversity and their quality, are analysed. We state four research questions, also motivated by identified research gaps, which are addressed by conducting an experimental study where three different data sets and five alternative RSs are used. We identify some important effects of RSs. We find that non-personalised RSs result in choices for items that have a larger predicted rating compared to personalised RSs. Moreover, when a user's awareness set, which is the set containing the items that she can choose from, increases, then choices are more diverse, but the average quality (rating) of the choices decreases. Additionally, in order to achieve a higher choice diversity, increasing the awareness of the users is shown to be a more effective remedy than increasing the number of recommendations offered to the users.},

abstract = {Eli Pariser coined the term 'filter bubble' to describe the potential for online personalization to effectively isolate people from a diversity of viewpoints or content. Online recommender systems - built on algorithms that attempt to predict which items users will most enjoy consuming - are one family of technologies that potentially suffers from this effect. Because recommender systems have become so prevalent, it is important to investigate their impact on users in these terms. This paper examines the longitudinal impacts of a collaborative filtering-based recommender system on users. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first paper to measure the filter bubble effect in terms of content diversity at the individual level. We contribute a novel metric to measure content diversity based on information encoded in user-generated tags, and we present a new set of methods to examine the temporal effect of recommender systems on the user experience. We do find that recommender systems expose users to a slightly narrowing set of items over time. However, we also see evidence that users who actually consume the items recommended to them experience lessened narrowing effects and rate items more positively.

These optimization metrics differ markedly from, for example, the so-called news factors journalists traditionally use to make editorial decisions. Social networks, video platforms and search engines thus create content hierarchies that reflect not only user interest but also their own monetization goals. This sometimes has unintended, societally highly problematic effects: Optimizing for metrics like dwell time, watch time or “engagement” can promote disinformation and propaganda content.

In this setting, an online user is the environment; neither the reward function nor the environment dynamics are clearly defined, making the application of RL challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for recommendation systems, where we develop a generative adversarial network to imitate user behavior dynamics and learn her reward function. Using this user model as the simulation environment, we develop a novel Cascading DQN algorithm to obtain a combinatorial recommendation policy which can handle a large number of candidate items efficiently. In our experiments with real data, we show this generative adversarial user model can better explain user behavior than alternatives, and the RL policy based on this model can lead to a better long-term reward for the user and higher click rate for the system.},

  abstract = {Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure game, a model of incentives induced by algorithms, including modern factorization and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic choices, e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization, significantly affect the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer use of creator behavior models, like exposure games, for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit. Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content, and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure games, and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets. Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups.},

  abstract = {Recommender systems operate in an inherently dynamical setting. Past recommendations influence future behavior, including which data points are observed and how user preferences change. However, experimenting in production systems with real user dynamics is often infeasible, and existing simulation-based approaches have limited scale. As a result, many state-of-the-art algorithms are designed to solve supervised learning problems, and progress is judged only by offline metrics. In this work we investigate the extent to which offline metrics predict online performance by evaluating eleven recommenders across six controlled simulated environments. We observe that offline metrics are correlated with online performance over a range of environments. However, improvements in offline metrics lead to diminishing returns in online performance. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of recommenders varies depending on the amount of initial offline data available. We study the impact of adding exploration strategies, and observe that their effectiveness, when compared to greedy recommendation, is highly dependent on the recommendation algorithm. We provide the environments and recommenders described in this paper as Reclab: an extensible ready-to-use simulation framework at https://github.com/berkeley-reclab/RecLab.},
