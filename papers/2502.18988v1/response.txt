ingame-theoretic solution concepts, researchers have shown that ubiquitous shortest path planning may cause or worsen traffic congestion ____, and possibly affect cities' economies ____. 

Finally, the model of recommendation which we explain in the next section is novel but has some similarity to previous work on machine teaching ____. The goal of machine teaching is to select the optimal dataset that will allow a learner to learn the optimum. Recent work has extended machine teaching to reinforcement learning ____. Our work is similar to machine teaching because we assume knowledge of a target distribution (like an optimum) to which we would like the system of $Q$-learning agents to converge on. It is also similar to machine teaching because the recommender in our model is capable of influencing the experiences of agents (picking data). Our model crucially differs from machine teaching because it involves picking the states for $Q$-learners rather than feeding them data (a state, action, reward, next state tuple for a reinforcement learner). Furthermore, our model has many $Q$-learners interacting in a congestion game such that what is optimal for an individual learner may not be socially optimal, leading to pluralistic notions of optimality.
