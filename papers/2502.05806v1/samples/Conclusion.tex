\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a Tree-structured Strategy with Answer Distribution Estimator for goal-oriented visual dialogue. Following the ``divide and conquer'', TSADE generates question to exclude half of the candidate objects based on the answer distribution provided by the ADE in each round. We design two rewards within the RL framework to implement this strategy. The \emph{binary} reward aims to find the target with fewer round, while the \emph{candidate-minimization} focuses on selecting higher-quality successful dialogues. Experimental results on the GuessWhat?! and VisDial dataset show that our method can effectively generate more useful questions and improve the accuracy of the model. 
However, while existing visual-language models perform well at processing visual-language and abstract thinking, they are still incapable of understanding the physical world and performing practical planning.
In future work, we aim to study the goal-oriented visual dialogue towards embodied AI agents and applications, and pay special attention to the question generation techniques of machines to facilitate more comprehensive collaboration between human and AI agents.
%However, there still exists problems to be solved in the future, such as improving the agent's understanding about the internal relationships of visual information to implement the question generation strategy. One can utilize the powerful language comprehension ability of Large Language Model to address this issue.
