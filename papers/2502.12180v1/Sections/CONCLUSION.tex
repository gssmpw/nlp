\section{CONCLUSION}
In this study, we propose ClusMFL, a novel framework designed to address modality incompleteness in multimodal federated learning. ClusMFL enhances local data representation with the FINCH clustering algorithm, mitigates missing modality effects through supervised contrastive loss and modality completion loss, and employs a modality-aware aggregation strategy to adaptively integrate client contributions. Extensive experiments on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that ClusMFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe modality incompleteness, though at a slightly higher computational cost. Future research will explore the incorporation of additional modalities to further enhance the proposed framework's applicability.
