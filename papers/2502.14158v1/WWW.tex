%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Graph neural networks have been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for effectively learning graph-structured data on the \textit{web} and mining content from it. %the \textit{wide web}. for downstream task analysis. 
Current leading graph models require a large number of labeled samples for training, which unavoidably leads to overfitting in few-shot scenarios. Recent research has sought to alleviate this issue by simultaneously leveraging graph learning and meta-learning paradigms. However, these graph meta-learning models assume the availability of numerous meta-training tasks to learn transferable meta-knowledge. Such assumption may not be feasible in the real world due to the difficulty of constructing tasks and the substantial costs involved. Therefore, we propose a \textbf{S}i\textbf{M}ple yet effect\textbf{I}ve approach for graph few-shot \textbf{L}earning with f\textbf{E}wer tasks, named \textbf{SMILE}. We introduce a dual-level mixup strategy, encompassing both within-task and across-task mixup, to simultaneously enrich the available nodes and tasks in meta-learning. Moreover, we explicitly leverage the prior information provided by the node degrees in the graph to encode expressive node representations. Theoretically, we demonstrate that SMILE can enhance the model generalization ability. Empirically, SMILE consistently outperforms other competitive models by a large margin across all evaluated datasets with in-domain and cross-domain settings. Our anonymous code can be found \href{https://github.com/KEAML-JLU/SMILE}{\textcolor{red}{here}}.
