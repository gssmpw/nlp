\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach, called SMILE, for graph few-shot learning with fewer tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel dual-level mixup strategy, including within-task and across-task mixup, for enriching the diversity of nodes within each task and the diversity of tasks. Also, we incorporate the degree-based prior information to learn expressive node embeddings. Theoretically, we prove that SMILE effectively enhances the model's generalization performance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and the results suggest that SMILE significantly outperforms other baselines, including both in-domain and cross-domain few-shot settings.
