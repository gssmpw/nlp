\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conc}
This paper presents \sysname, a new inference work to employ multiple edge devices to jointly execute the model inference task. \sysname incorporates the flexible combinatorial optimization to automatically decide the partition scheme, which can reduce inference time cost, and yield desirable performance (up to 2.39$\times$) under various benchmark settings. 
% Our future work will consider (1) designing and implementing a more robust DDP algorithm which can adapt to the time-varying characteristics of the runtime environment (e.g., bandwidth fluctuation); (2) conducting a larger-scale comparative study of \sysname and other inference frameworks under more heterogeneous settings.
