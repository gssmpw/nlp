\section * {Ethical Considerations}

This work demonstrates the potential of using synthetic data for creating style embeddings in languages lacking such resources, increasing access to broader communities. However, it is important to recognize that the synthetic data generated by large language models may reflect and reinforce existing biases inherent in these models \citep{lisa}. While our approach shows significant promise, ongoing efforts should ensure that such synthetic datasets are evaluated for fairness and bias to promote more equitable outcomes.
