\section{Generation Prompts and Details}
\label{sec:appendix:generationdetails}

Below we detail the structure of our prompts and inference parameters used for two multilingual synthetic data generation methods.

\subsection{Extracting Topics from C4}
\label{sec:extracttopic}

We use the same topic extraction method as \citet{patel2024styledistancestrongercontentindependentstyle}, which is derived from the C4 dataset \citep{t5andc4}, to identify 50,000 topics through zero-shot prompting with GPT-4 \citep{gpt4}. These 50,000 fine-grained, unique topics ensure that each sentence pair has a distinct context across various features and languages. We perform topic sampling with a \texttt{temperature} setting of 1.0 and \texttt{top\_p} = 0.0.

\vspace{1em}
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
What is the fine-grained topic of the following 
text: 
 {sentence} Only return the topic. 
\end{verbatim}}
\vspace{1em}

\noindent The fine-grained topic is used as part of the attributed prompt in Section \ref{sec:genposandneg} to ensure diverse generations.

\subsection{Generating Positive and Negative Example Sentences for Each Style} 

We use the same prompt as \citet{patel2024styledistancestrongercontentindependentstyle} to generate positive and negative example sentences in English. We then translate these sentence pairs into the target languages using the DeepL API. The only exception is Hindi, which we translate using Google Translate API due to DeepL's limited language support.

\subsection{Direct Generating Positive and Negative Example Sentences for Each Style Feature into Target Language}
\label{sec:genposandneg}

For direct generation in target language method (method 2), we use the following prompt with \texttt{temperature} setting of 1.0 and \texttt{top\_p} = 1.0

\vspace{1em}
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
Generate a pair of {target language} sentences with
and without sarcasm with the following attributes:
 1. Topic: {topic}
 2. Length: {sentence_length}
 3. Point of view: {point_of_view}
 4. Tense: {tense}
 5. Type of Sentence: {sentence_type}
 
Ensure that the generated sentences meet the
following conditions:
 1. There is no extra information in one sentence
 that is not in the other. 
 2. The difference between the two sentences is 
 subtle. 
 3. The two sentences have the same length.
 {special_conditions_for_style_feature}
 
Use Format:
 With sarcasm: [sentence in {target language}]
 Without sarcasm: [sentence in {target language}]
 
Your response should only consist of the two sentences,
without quotation marks.
\end{verbatim}}
