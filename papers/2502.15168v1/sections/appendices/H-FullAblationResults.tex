\section{Ablation Full Results}

Table \ref{table:ablationeval} contains full results of the ablation study for \textsc{mStyleDistance} embeddings on the SoC benchmarks under three generalization conditions: Out of Domain, Out of Distribution, and No Language Overlap. For multilingual SoC, we use all four style features: simplicity, formality, toxicity, and positivity. For the cross-lingual variant, we only use formality.
