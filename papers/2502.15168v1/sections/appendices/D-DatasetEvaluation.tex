\section{Dataset Evaluation}
\label{sec:appendix:dataseteval}

In Table \ref{table:dataseteval}, we show the full results of human and synthetic evaluations on our synthetic dataset. Our synthetic dataset is comparable to a reference dataset compiled by \citet{scherrer-2020-tapaco} on feature presence, fluency, diversity, and similarity. Note that baselines shown for feature presence and fluency are just 0.5 to represent random guessing.
