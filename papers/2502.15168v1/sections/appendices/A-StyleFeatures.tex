\section{Style Features and Definitions}
\label{sec:appendix:stylefeatures}
% We list all style features selected for our synthetic dataset below along with the positive and negative prompts (used for constructing a full prompt for generating positive and negative examples as shown in Appendix \ref{sec:genposandneg}) and definitions (used to help define the style feature to human annotators in the annotation interface in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:humanannotation}).

The style features addressed in our experiments included most of the %were based on 
40 style features in the %presented in 
\citet{patel2024styledistancestrongercontentindependentstyle} dataset.
In Table \ref{table:stylefeaturestable}, we list the 40 style features with an `Excluded in' column indicating the languages where each feature is not applicable and was therefore omitted from our dataset.
