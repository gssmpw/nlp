Style embeddings are useful for stylistic analysis and style transfer; however, only English style embeddings have been made available. We introduce Multilingual \textsc{StyleDistance} (\textsc{mStyleDistance}), a multilingual style embedding model trained using synthetic data and contrastive learning. We train the model on data from nine languages and create a multilingual STEL-or-Content benchmark \citep{styleemb} that serves to assess the embeddings' quality. We also employ our embeddings in an authorship verification task involving different languages. Our results show that \textsc{mStyleDistance} embeddings outperform existing models on these multilingual style benchmarks and generalize well to unseen features and languages. We make our model publicly available at \url{https://huggingface.co/StyleDistance/mstyledistance}.
