\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced a novel approach to learning multilingual style embeddings from synthetic examples, and contribute a two benchmarks for evaluating the quality of multilingual style representations. We show that {\sc mStyleDistance} embeddings are able to distinguish style from content better than other English and multilingual embeddings, and generalize well to unseen features and languages. The authorship verification evaluation shows that {\sc mStyleDistance} embeddings also offer strong performance on multilingual downstream tasks. % We will make our models and datasets publicly available as resources upon publication.
