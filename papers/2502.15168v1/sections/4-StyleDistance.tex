\section{Training \textsc{mStyleDistance}}
\label{sec:styledistance}

Following the contrastive training approach of \citet{patel2024styledistancestrongercontentindependentstyle}, we construct feature-specific triples for each language $l \in L$ which contain: an anchor text ($a$); a text with the same style as $a$ but different content ({\tt pos}); a distractor text ({\tt neg}) which is a paraphrase of $a$ or {\tt pos}, but different in style from $a$. We use the multilingual \texttt{xlm-roberta-base} as our base model and train with a triplet loss \citep{Conneau2019UnsupervisedCR,tripletloss}. We ensure half of our triplets are \textit{cross-lingual}, i.e. the {\tt pos} and {\tt neg} texts are randomly sampled from a different language than the anchor text. Full training details can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:trainingdetails}.
