\section * {Limitations}

Our synthetic data generation approaches rely on direct generation or machine translation techniques, both of which have limitations for languages other than English. Most of the languages included in our multilingual and cross-lingual STEL-or-Content and authorship evaluations are not really low-resource, so our evaluations may not  reflect performance in languages  with less resources. Furthermore, our approach  only targets the 33-40 style features (depending on the language) we generated data for, and cannot account for the  wide range of possibilities for style. While these drawbacks may limit our approach, our ablation experiments show strong generalization capabilities to unseen languages and style features indicating promising generalized performance.
