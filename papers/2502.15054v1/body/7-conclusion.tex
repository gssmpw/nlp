In this work, we introduced GiGL (Gigantic Graph Learning), an open-source library designed for scalable GNN training and inference on billion-scale graphs. Beyond the library itself, we provided insights into GiGLâ€™s role in powering critical applications at Snapchat, contributing to over 35 product launches.
We also shared key lessons learned from developing and deploying GNNs at scale, covering topics from both infrastructure and modeling perspectives.
By open-sourcing GiGL, we aim to support the broader graph ML community while fostering collaboration around scalable graph learning and real-world GNN applications.
