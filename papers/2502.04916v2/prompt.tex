\noindent\textbf{[Context]}\hlc[cyan!50]{\texttt{I am currently working on a task focused on establishing traceability between software requirements and regulatory codes\footnote{\textit{Note that we use regulatory codes to mean provisions, since the former was used in the literature~\cite{cleland:2010}}}. 
This involves analyzing and mapping requirements to relevant GDPR regulations, ensuring that our software development aligns with regulatory compliance. Below are the main regulatory codes that I want you to remember at first: \{The 26 regulatory codes with their descriptions + a 27th code capturing the ``ELSE'' value indicating no trace link.\} }}
\newline 
\textbf{[Examples]} \hlc[pink!50]{\texttt{Here are five sample traceability examples. I've also added my rationale for tracing regulatory codes to the requirements for your reference. \{Five example requirements along with their trace links and the rationale behind selecting these links. Requirement: TEXT. trace links: LIST, rational behind choosing these codes: TEXT.\}}}
\newline 
\textbf{[Instruction]} \hlc[olive!50]{\texttt{Find the trace links for a given requirement and provide the rationale behind your choice extended from the examples I provided. Please consider regulatory codes which I have not used in the examples. Pay attention to the roles (AS\_ROLE) in the requirement, if there are any. Remember, regulations' text focus on personal data, but try to consider all types of data, role, or functionalities in a software system. Pay attention to commonsense and indirect relations between requirement and regulations. Aim to include regulations even if they have a low likelihood of being traced, prioritizing recall over precision. Choose at least one regulation for each requirement.}}
\newline 
\textbf{[Output Indicator]} \hlc[violet!50]{List of alphabetical order of regulatory codes (if any) similar to the examples I provided to you. Newline to explain the rational behind the choice(s).}
