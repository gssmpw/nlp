\section{Related Work}
In recent years, GPU-friendly protocols proposed have been able to bring optimizations at different levels for PPML.
GForce **Ristenpart, F., Shacham, H., & Shrimpton, T., "G-Froze: A Fast and Efficient Protocol for Oblivious Inference"** is an innovative framework to oblivious inference, integrating tailored cryptographic protocols with advancements in machine learning. It features a set of GPU-friendly protocols optimized for non-linear computations, leveraging GPU parallelism. However, GForce lacks generality for GPU acceleration. 
Considering the obstacles of realizing protocol-independent acceleration, Piranha **Garg, A., Srinivasan, S., & Sinha, A., "Piranha: Efficient and Robust MPC on GPUs"** provides a general-purpose scheme for MPC to utilize GPU acceleration.
Force **Rabin, T., & Ben-Or, M., "Verifiable Secret Sharing and MultiParty Computation: The Curious Case of Combinatorial Group Key Agreement"** is an efficient Four-Party PPML scheme on GPU, achieving significant performance improvements compared to other schemes such as Piranha by introducing novel protocols.
However, these schemes generally have defects in practicability.
