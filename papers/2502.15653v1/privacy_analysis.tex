\section{Privacy Analysis}
\label{pan}
In this section, we show   

1) minimal data, no compromise on authorities using the data

2) privacy aspects

\textbf{User and Data Privacy}
In federated learning, FLS initializes the global model to vehicle through verifying Pseudonym Certificate (PC) that SCMS provides end-user's privacy. Each vehicle deploys global model, and then they train the local model through collecting the raw data locally. They send trained local model, which does not involve raw data, to FLS to verify using PC. FLS aggregates the trained local model from each vehicle, and then the FLS generates new global model. They repeat this process until they meet accuracy of global model. In our approach, using combination of the PC in the SCMS and the FLS provides user and data privacy.  


\textbf{Misbehavior and Revocation}
We identify two types of end users' attackers, Vehicle and FLS. To provide defense against
