\section{conclusion and future work}
\label{conclusion}
The Security Credential Management System (SCMS) is an advanced Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for vehicular networking, involving multiple authorities and distributed operations. It utilizes a distributed PKI system to ensure privacy-preserving management. Acknowledging its critical role in vehicular communications, we introduce Blockchain-Based Trust Management (BBTM) as an enhanced version of SCMS PKI management. BBTM builds on the existing functionalities of the Global Certificate Chain File (GCCF) and Global Policy File (GPF) within the Policy Generator (PG) of SCMS, enhancing security and integrity through blockchain technology, which offers high transaction integrity and resilience against compromises. Our experiments with Hyperledger Fabric demonstrate that BBTM achieves suitable transaction performance and execution overheads for GCCF and GPF. This work extends the current SCMS design for vehicular networks, with future directions focusing on developing a framework for various advanced PKI designs that rely on multiple authorities for distributed operations, particularly those emphasizing privacy and compromise resilience.
