Within the realm of geophysical sciences, super-resolution/downscaling is a challenge that scientists continue to tackle. There have been several works involved in downscaling applications such as river mapping **Liu et al., "Super-Resolution Mapping Based on Spatial–Spectral Correlation for Spectral Imagery"**____**, coastal risk assessment **Li et al., "A Cascaded Spectral–Spatial CNN Model for Super-Resolution River Mapping With MODIS Imagery"**____**, estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed images **Rodriguez et al., "Improving Super-Resolution Flood Inundation Mapping for Multi spectral Remote Sensing Image by Supplying More Spectral Information"**____ and downscaling of satellite based precipitation estimates ____ to name a few. We direct the reader to **Brunner et al., "Deep Learning–based Downscaling of Summer Monsoon Rainfall Data over Indian Region"** for a comprehensive review of satellite based downscaling applications and methods. Pertaining to our objective of downscaling \acp{WFM}, we can draw comparisons with several existing works. 

In what follows, we provide a brief review of functionally adjacent works to contrast the novelty of our proposed model and its role in addressing gaps in literature. 

When it comes to downscaling \ac{WFM}, several works use statistical downscaling techniques. These works downscale images by using statistical techniques that utilize relationships between neighboring water fraction pixels. For instance, **Kim et al., "Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Based on the Convolutional Neural Network"** treat the super-resolution task as a sub-pixel mapping problem, wherein the input fraction of inundated pixels must be exactly mapped to the output patch of inundated pixels. 
% In doing so, they are able to apply a discrete particle swarm optimization method to maximize the Flood Inundation Spatial Dependence Index (FISDI). 
**Huang et al., "Improving Super-Resolution Flood Inundation Mapping for Multi spectral Remote Sensing Image by Supplying More Spectral Information"** improved upon these approaches by including a spectral term to fully utilize spectral information from multi spectral remote sensing image band. **Zhu et al., "Super Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using a Generative Adversarial Network"** on the other hand also include a spectral correlation term to reduce the influence of linear and non-linear imaging conditions. All of these approaches are applied to water fraction obtained via spectral unmixing ____ and are designed to work with multi spectral information from MODIS. However, we develop our model with the intention to be used with water fractions directly derived from the output of satellites. One such example is NOAA/VIIRS whose output was used by **Brunner et al., "Deep Learning–based Downscaling of Summer Monsoon Rainfall Data over Indian Region"**.

%     \item[____] Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Based on the Convolutional Neural Network
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item SRMCNN (Super-resolution mapping CNN) is proposed to obtain fine-scale land cover maps from coarse remote sensing images. Specifically, an encoder-decoder CNN is used to determined the labels (i.e., land cover classes) of the subpixels within mixed pixels.
%         \item There were three main parts in SRMCNN. The first part was a three-sequential convolutional layer with ReLU and pooling. The second part is up-sampling, for which a multi transposed-convolutional layer was adopted. To keep the feature learned in the previous layer, a skip connection was used to concatenate the output of the corresponding convolution layer. The last part was the softmax classifier, in which the feature in the antepenultimate layer was classified and class probabilities are obtained.
%         \item The loss: the optimal allocation of classes to the subpixels of mixed pixel is achieved by maximizing the spatial dependence between neighbor pixels under constraint that the class proportions within the mixed pixels are preserved.
%         \item (Preferred), this paper is designed to classify background, Building, Low Vegetation, or Tree in the land. But we can easily adapt to our problem and should compare with this paper.

When it comes to downscaling water fraction maps, several works use a variety of techniques including **Kim et al., "Super-Resolution Land Cover Mapping Based on the Convolutional Neural Network"** which was adapted for our problem by **Huang et al., "Improving Super-Resolution Flood Inundation Mapping for Multi spectral Remote Sensing Image by Supplying More Spectral Information"**, and **Zhu et al., "Super Resolution Land Cover Mapping Using a Generative Adversarial Network"**.
