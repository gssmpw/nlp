ABSTRACT = {Floods are one of the most wide-spread, frequent, and devastating natural disasters that continue to increase in frequency and intensity. Remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and near-real time (NRT) information due to its high-spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation. However, the efficacy of flood inundation mapping with SAR is susceptible to reflections and scattering from a variety of factors including dense vegetation and urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR along with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of inundation in heterogeneous areas. Three machine learning classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual-polarized SAR only and dual-polarized SAR along with HAND to map inundated areas. Three study sites along the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The binary classification analysis (inundated as positive vs. non-inundated as negative) revealed significant improvements when incorporating HAND in several metrics including classification accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive predictive value (PPV), but true negative rate (TNR) fell &minus;14.4%. By incorporating HAND, a significant number of areas with high SAR backscatter but low HAND values were detected as inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected but to a lesser extent as evident in the metrics. This study demonstrates that HAND could be considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.},

abstract = {The study of flood inundation is significant to human life and social economy. Remote sensing technology has provided an effective way to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of inundation. Remotely sensed images with high temporal resolutions are widely used in mapping inundation. However, mixed pixels do exist due to their relatively low spatial resolutions. One of the most popular approaches to resolve this issue is sub-pixel mapping. In this paper, a novel discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) based sub-pixel flood inundation mapping (DPSO-SFIM) method is proposed to achieve an improved accuracy in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale. The evaluation criterion for sub-pixel inundation mapping is formulated. The DPSO-SFIM algorithm is developed, including particle discrete encoding, fitness function designing and swarm search strategy. The accuracy of DPSO-SFIM in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale was evaluated using Landsat ETM+images from study areas in Australia and China. The results show that DPSO-SFIM consistently outperformed the four traditional SFIM methods in these study areas. A sensitivity analysis of DPSO-SFIM was also carried out to evaluate its performances. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of medium-low spatial resolution images in inundation detection and mapping, and thereby support the ecological and environmental studies of river basins.}

abstract = {As one of the costliest and most frequent natural disasters, flood is a major threat to human lives and property. Flood forecasting, simulation, and monitoring plays an important role in disaster relief and mitigation. With the support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) global 375-m flood products in near real-time, daily composition, and 5-day composition have been developed and derived flood extent represented in water fractions from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20. The products have shown good quality for the spatial distribution of floodwater. However, the moderate spatial resolution is a limiting factor when obtaining inundation detail. Moreover, no vertical information on the floodwater is included in the products. Based on water’s self-leveling nature, it is feasible to construct the vertical structure of floodwater using the VIIRS 375-m water fractions and high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) such as the 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)/DEM through a downscaling process (Li et al., 2013). With impact factors including topography, land cover, tree cover, river network and watershed, the downscaling process has been integrated into a model called the Downscaling Model. By using the 30-m SRTM/DEM, the model can downscale the VIIRS 375-m floodwater fraction products into 30-m flood extent and water depth products. These products include flood information in both horizontal and vertical directions and thus are called 3-D flood products in this study. This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the model with the results evaluated against high-resolution satellite images from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and GeoEye, aerial photos, and river gauge observations. Evaluation results indicate reliable quality and promising performance of the model and the downscaled flood products. A routine system has been set up at the Cooperative Institute for Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at University of Wisconsin-Madison to generate experimental VIIRS downscaled flood extent and water depth products over the Continental USA (CONUS). The routinely generated VIIRS 30-m floodwater depth maps are available at: https://floods.ssec.wisc.edu/?products=VIIRS-3Dflood.}

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a method for downscaling the spatial resolution of daily satellite-based precipitation estimates (SPEs) from 10 km to 1 km. The method deliberates a set of variables that have close relationships with daily precipitation events in a Random Forest (RF) regression model. The considered variables include cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER) an cloud water path (CWP), derived from MODIS, along with maximum and minimum temperature (Tx, Tn), derived from CHIRTS. Additionally, topographic features derived from ALOS-DEM are also investigated to improve the downscaling procedure. The approach consists of two main steps: firstly, the RF model training at the native 10 km spatial resolution of the studied SPEs (i.e., IMERG) using rain gauge observations as targets; secondly, the application of the trained RF model at a 1 km spatial resolution to downscale IMERG from 10 km to 1 km over a one-year period. To assess the reliability of the method, the RF model outcomes were compared with the rain gauge records not considered in the RF model training. Before the downscaling process, the CC, MAE and RMSE metrics were 0.32, 1.16 mm and 6.60 mm, respectively, and improved to 0.48, 0.99 mm and 4.68 mm after the downscaling process. This corresponds to improvements of 50%, 15% and 29%, respectively. Therefore, the method not only improves the spatial resolution of IMERG, but also its accuracy.},

However, these global soil moisture products, normally retrieved from microwave remote sensing data, are typically not suitable for regional hydrological and agricultural applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions, due to their coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, various downscaling methods have been proposed to improve the coarse resolution soil moisture products. The purpose of this paper is to review existing methods for downscaling satellite remotely sensed soil moisture. These methods are assessed and compared in terms of their advantages and limitations. This review also provides the accuracy level of these methods based on published validation studies. In the final part, problems and future trends associated with these methods are analyzed.},

pages={1341-1369},
abstract={During coastal storms, forecasters and researchers use numerical models to predict the magnitude and extent of coastal flooding. These models must represent the large regions that may be affected by a storm, and thus, they can be computationally costly and may not use the highest geospatial resolution. However, predicted flood extents can be downscaled (by increasing resolution) as a post-processing step. Existing downscaling methods use either a static extrapolation of the flooding as a flat surface, or rely on subsequent simulations with nested, full-physics models at higher resolution. This research explores a middle way, in which the downscaling includes simplified physics to improve accuracy. Using results from a state-of-the-art model, we downscale its flood predictions with three methods: (1) static, in which the water surface elevations are extrapolated horizontally until they intersect the ground surface; (2) slopes, in which the gradient of the water surface is used; and (3) head loss, which accounts for energy losses due to land cover characteristics. The downscaling methods are then evaluated for forecasts and hindcasts of Hurricane Florence (2018), which caused widespread flooding in North Carolina. The static and slopes methods tend to over-estimate the flood extents. However, the head loss method generates a downscaled flooding extent that is a close match to the predictions from a higher-resolution, full-physics model. These results are encouraging for the use of these downscaling methods to support decision-making during coastal storms.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

abstract="Deep neural networks with a massive number of layers have made a remarkable breakthrough on single image super-resolution (SR), but sacrifice computation complexity and memory storage. To address this problem, we focus on the lightweight models for fast and accurate image SR. Due to the frequent use of residual block (RB) in SR models, we pursue an economical structure to adaptively combine RBs. Drawing lessons from lattice filter bank, we design the lattice block (LB) in which two butterfly structures are applied to combine two RBs. LB has the potential of various linear combinations of two RBs. Each case of LB depends on the combination coefficients which are determined by the attention mechanism. LB favors the lightweight SR model with the reduction of about half amount of the parameters while keeping the similar SR performance. Moreover, we propose a lightweight SR model, LatticeNet, which uses series connection of LBs and the backward feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal can achieve superior accuracy on four available benchmark datasets against other state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory requirements.",

Besides, super-resolution of any arbitrary scale factor is a critical issue in practical applications, which has not been well solved in the previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight information multi-distillation network (IMDN) by constructing the cascaded information multi-distillation blocks (IMDB), which contains distillation and selective fusion parts. Specifically, the distillation module extracts hierarchical features step-by-step, and fusion module aggregates them according to the importance of candidate features, which is evaluated by the proposed contrast-aware channel attention mechanism. To process real images with any sizes, we develop an adaptive cropping strategy (ACS) to super-resolve block-wise image patches using the same well-trained model. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in term of visual quality, memory footprint, and inference time.
