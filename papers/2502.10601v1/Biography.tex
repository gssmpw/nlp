\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Akshay Aravamudan}
is a PhD student at the Florida Institute of Technology. His research areas of interest include machine learning, stochastic point processes for the study of information diffusion and influence characterization in social media, machine learning for hydrology and machine learning on the edge. Before joining FIT’s Center for Advanced Data Analytics \& Systems (CADAS), he obtained his M.S. in Computer Engineering at the Florida Institute of Technology.

\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{Efthymios I. Nikolopoulos}
is an Associate Professor of Civil \& Environmental Engineering at Rutgers University, New Brunswick. He received his Engineering Diploma from the Technical University of Crete, Greece, his M.Sc. degree from the University of Iowa, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Connecticut, U.S. He has also worked as a postdoc at the University of Padova, Italy. His expertise is in the modeling and monitoring of hydrometeorological and hydrologic extremes (extreme precipitation, floods, droughts, debris flows). His main research goal is to improve the understanding and predictability of hydrologic extremes and develop methods to mitigate their impacts.

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
