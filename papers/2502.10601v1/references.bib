abstract = {Optical imagery can reveal spectral properties of forest canopy, which rarely allows for finding accurate correspondence of canopy features with soils and hydrology. In Amazonia non-floodable swampy forests can not be easily distinguished from non-floodable terra-firme forests using just bidimensional spectral data. Accurate topographic data are required for the understanding of land surface processes at finer scales. Topographic detail has now become available with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. This new digital elevation model (DEM) shows the feature-rich relief of lowland rain forests, adding to the ability to map rain forest environments through many quantitative terrain descriptors. In this paper we report on the development of a new quantitative topographic algorithm, called HAND (Height Above the Nearest Drainage), based on SRTM-DEM data. We tested the HAND descriptor for a groundwater, topographic and vegetation dataset from central Amazonia. The application of the HAND descriptor in terrain classification revealed strong correlation between soil water conditions, like classes of water table depth, and topography. This correlation obeys the physical principle of soil draining potential, or relative vertical distance to drainage, which can be detected remotely through the topography of the vegetation canopy found in the SRTM-DEM data.}

abstract = {A method to assess global land surface water (fw) inundation dynamics was developed by exploiting the enhanced fw sensitivity of L-band (1.4 GHz) passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The L-band fw (fwLBand) retrievals were derived using SMAP H-polarization brightness temperature (Tb) observations and predefined L-band reference microwave emissivities for water and land endmembers. Potential soil moisture and vegetation contributions to the microwave signal were represented from overlapping higher frequency Tb observations from AMSR2. The resulting fwLBand global record has high temporal sampling (1–3 days) and 36-km spatial resolution. The fwLBand annual averages corresponded favorably (R = 0.85, p-value < 0.001) with a 250-m resolution static global water map (MOD44W) aggregated at the same spatial scale, while capturing significant inundation variations worldwide. The monthly fwLBand averages also showed seasonal inundation changes consistent with river discharge records within six major US river basins. An uncertainty analysis indicated generally reliable fwLBand performance for major land cover areas and under low to moderate vegetation cover, but with lower accuracy for detecting water bodies covered by dense vegetation. Finer resolution (30-m) fwLBand results were obtained for three sub-regions in North America using an empirical downscaling approach and ancillary global Water Occurrence Dataset (WOD) derived from the historical Landsat record. The resulting 30-m fwLBand retrievals showed favorable spatial accuracy for water (commission error 31.46\%, omission error 30.20\%) and land (commission error 0.87\%, omission error 0.96\%) classifications and seasonal wet and dry periods when compared to independent water maps derived from Landsat-8 imagery. The new fwLBand algorithms and continuing SMAP and AMSR2 operations provide for near real-time, multi-scale monitoring of global surface water inundation dynamics and potential flood risk.}

ABSTRACT = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide fundamental depictions of the three-dimensional shape of the Earth’s surface and are useful to a wide range of disciplines. Ideally, DEMs record the interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere using a discrete two-dimensional grid, with complexities introduced by the intervening hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and anthroposphere. The treatment of DEM surfaces, affected by these intervening spheres, depends on their intended use, and the characteristics of the sensors that were used to create them. DEM is a general term, and more specific terms such as digital surface model (DSM) or digital terrain model (DTM) record the treatment of the intermediate surfaces. Several global DEMs generated with optical (visible and near-infrared) sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as well as single/multi-beam sonars and products of satellite altimetry, share the common characteristic of a georectified, gridded storage structure. Nevertheless, not all DEMs share the same vertical datum, not all use the same convention for the area on the ground represented by each pixel in the DEM, and some of them have variable data spacings depending on the latitude. This paper highlights the importance of knowing, understanding and reflecting on the sensor and DEM characteristics and consolidates terminology and definitions of key concepts to facilitate a common understanding among the growing community of DEM users, who do not necessarily share the same background.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

abstract = {The study of flood inundation is significant to human life and social economy. Remote sensing technology has provided an effective way to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of inundation. Remotely sensed images with high temporal resolutions are widely used in mapping inundation. However, mixed pixels do exist due to their relatively low spatial resolutions. One of the most popular approaches to resolve this issue is sub-pixel mapping. In this paper, a novel discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) based sub-pixel flood inundation mapping (DPSO-SFIM) method is proposed to achieve an improved accuracy in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale. The evaluation criterion for sub-pixel inundation mapping is formulated. The DPSO-SFIM algorithm is developed, including particle discrete encoding, fitness function designing and swarm search strategy. The accuracy of DPSO-SFIM in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale was evaluated using Landsat ETM+images from study areas in Australia and China. The results show that DPSO-SFIM consistently outperformed the four traditional SFIM methods in these study areas. A sensitivity analysis of DPSO-SFIM was also carried out to evaluate its performances. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of medium-low spatial resolution images in inundation detection and mapping, and thereby support the ecological and environmental studies of river basins.}

However, most existing studies focus on building more complex networks with a massive number of layers. Recently, more and more researchers start to explore the application of Transformer in computer vision tasks. However, the heavy computational cost and high GPU memory occupation of the vision Transformer cannot be ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Efficient Super-Resolution Transformer (ESRT) for SISR. ESRT is a hybrid model, which consists of a Lightweight CNN Backbone (LCB) and a Lightweight Transformer Backbone (LTB). Among them, LCB can dynamically adjust the size of the feature map to extract deep features with a low computational costs. LTB is composed of a series of Efficient Transformers (ET), which occupies a small GPU memory occupation, thanks to the specially designed Efficient Multi-Head Attention (EMHA). Extensive experiments show that ESRT achieves competitive results with low computational cost. Compared with the original Transformer which occupies 16,057M GPU memory, ESRT only occupies 4,191M GPU memory. All codes are available at https://github.com/luissen/ESRT.},

abstract = {Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in terms of both reconstruction accuracy and computational performance for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR) input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity of the overall SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from publicly available datasets and show that it performs significantly better (+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude faster than previous CNN-based methods.},

abstract={During coastal storms, forecasters and researchers use numerical models to predict the magnitude and extent of coastal flooding. These models must represent the large regions that may be affected by a storm, and thus, they can be computationally costly and may not use the highest geospatial resolution. However, predicted flood extents can be downscaled (by increasing resolution) as a post-processing step. Existing downscaling methods use either a static extrapolation of the flooding as a flat surface, or rely on subsequent simulations with nested, full-physics models at higher resolution. This research explores a middle way, in which the downscaling includes simplified physics to improve accuracy. Using results from a state-of-the-art model, we downscale its flood predictions with three methods: (1) static, in which the water surface elevations are extrapolated horizontally until they intersect the ground surface; (2) slopes, in which the gradient of the water surface is used; and (3) head loss, which accounts for energy losses due to land cover characteristics. The downscaling methods are then evaluated for forecasts and hindcasts of Hurricane Florence (2018), which caused widespread flooding in North Carolina. The static and slopes methods tend to over-estimate the flood extents. However, the head loss method generates a downscaled flooding extent that is a close match to the predictions from a higher-resolution, full-physics model. These results are encouraging for the use of these downscaling methods to support decision-making during coastal storms.},

However, these global soil moisture products, normally retrieved from microwave remote sensing data, are typically not suitable for regional hydrological and agricultural applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions, due to their coarse spatial resolution. Therefore, various downscaling methods have been proposed to improve the coarse resolution soil moisture products. The purpose of this paper is to review existing methods for downscaling satellite remotely sensed soil moisture. These methods are assessed and compared in terms of their advantages and limitations. This review also provides the accuracy level of these methods based on published validation studies. In the final part, problems and future trends associated with these methods are analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {This study proposes a method for downscaling the spatial resolution of daily satellite-based precipitation estimates (SPEs) from 10 km to 1 km. The method deliberates a set of variables that have close relationships with daily precipitation events in a Random Forest (RF) regression model. The considered variables include cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud effective radius (CER) an cloud water path (CWP), derived from MODIS, along with maximum and minimum temperature (Tx, Tn), derived from CHIRTS. Additionally, topographic features derived from ALOS-DEM are also investigated to improve the downscaling procedure. The approach consists of two main steps: firstly, the RF model training at the native 10 km spatial resolution of the studied SPEs (i.e., IMERG) using rain gauge observations as targets; secondly, the application of the trained RF model at a 1 km spatial resolution to downscale IMERG from 10 km to 1 km over a one-year period. To assess the reliability of the method, the RF model outcomes were compared with the rain gauge records not considered in the RF model training. Before the downscaling process, the CC, MAE and RMSE metrics were 0.32, 1.16 mm and 6.60 mm, respectively, and improved to 0.48, 0.99 mm and 4.68 mm after the downscaling process. This corresponds to improvements of 50%, 15% and 29%, respectively. Therefore, the method not only improves the spatial resolution of IMERG, but also its accuracy.},

abstract = {As one of the costliest and most frequent natural disasters, flood is a major threat to human lives and property. Flood forecasting, simulation, and monitoring plays an important role in disaster relief and mitigation. With the support from the JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Proving Ground and Risk Reduction (PGRR) Program, the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) global 375-m flood products in near real-time, daily composition, and 5-day composition have been developed and derived flood extent represented in water fractions from Suomi-NPP and NOAA-20. The products have shown good quality for the spatial distribution of floodwater. However, the moderate spatial resolution is a limiting factor when obtaining inundation detail. Moreover, no vertical information on the floodwater is included in the products. Based on water’s self-leveling nature, it is feasible to construct the vertical structure of floodwater using the VIIRS 375-m water fractions and high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) such as the 30-m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)/DEM through a downscaling process (Li et al., 2013). With impact factors including topography, land cover, tree cover, river network and watershed, the downscaling process has been integrated into a model called the Downscaling Model. By using the 30-m SRTM/DEM, the model can downscale the VIIRS 375-m floodwater fraction products into 30-m flood extent and water depth products. These products include flood information in both horizontal and vertical directions and thus are called 3-D flood products in this study. This paper presents a comprehensive introduction to the model with the results evaluated against high-resolution satellite images from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), Sentinel-2, and GeoEye, aerial photos, and river gauge observations. Evaluation results indicate reliable quality and promising performance of the model and the downscaled flood products. A routine system has been set up at the Cooperative Institute for Satellite Studies (CIMSS) at University of Wisconsin-Madison to generate experimental VIIRS downscaled flood extent and water depth products over the Continental USA (CONUS). The routinely generated VIIRS 30-m floodwater depth maps are available at: https://floods.ssec.wisc.edu/?products=VIIRS-3Dflood.}

Thanks to the powerful representation capabilities of the deep networks, numerous previous ways can learn the complex non-linear mapping between low-resolution (LR) image patches and their high-resolution (HR) versions. However, excessive convolutions will limit the application of super-resolution technology in low computing power devices. Besides, super-resolution of any arbitrary scale factor is a critical issue in practical applications, which has not been well solved in the previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight information multi-distillation network (IMDN) by constructing the cascaded information multi-distillation blocks (IMDB), which contains distillation and selective fusion parts. Specifically, the distillation module extracts hierarchical features step-by-step, and fusion module aggregates them according to the importance of candidate features, which is evaluated by the proposed contrast-aware channel attention mechanism. To process real images with any sizes, we develop an adaptive cropping strategy (ACS) to super-resolve block-wise image patches using the same well-trained model. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in term of visual quality, memory footprint, and inference time.

abstract="Deep neural networks with a massive number of layers have made a remarkable breakthrough on single image super-resolution (SR), but sacrifice computation complexity and memory storage. To address this problem, we focus on the lightweight models for fast and accurate image SR. Due to the frequent use of residual block (RB) in SR models, we pursue an economical structure to adaptively combine RBs. Drawing lessons from lattice filter bank, we design the lattice block (LB) in which two butterfly structures are applied to combine two RBs. LB has the potential of various linear combinations of two RBs. Each case of LB depends on the combination coefficients which are determined by the attention mechanism. LB favors the lightweight SR model with the reduction of about half amount of the parameters while keeping the similar SR performance. Moreover, we propose a lightweight SR model, LatticeNet, which uses series connection of LBs and the backward feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal can achieve superior accuracy on four available benchmark datasets against other state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory requirements.",

ABSTRACT = {Floods are one of the most wide-spread, frequent, and devastating natural disasters that continue to increase in frequency and intensity. Remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and near-real time (NRT) information due to its high-spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation. However, the efficacy of flood inundation mapping with SAR is susceptible to reflections and scattering from a variety of factors including dense vegetation and urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR along with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of inundation in heterogeneous areas. Three machine learning classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual-polarized SAR only and dual-polarized SAR along with HAND to map inundated areas. Three study sites along the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The binary classification analysis (inundated as positive vs. non-inundated as negative) revealed significant improvements when incorporating HAND in several metrics including classification accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive predictive value (PPV), but true negative rate (TNR) fell &minus;14.4%. By incorporating HAND, a significant number of areas with high SAR backscatter but low HAND values were detected as inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected but to a lesser extent as evident in the metrics. This study demonstrates that HAND could be considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.},

ABSTRACT = {Early flood warning and real-time monitoring systems play a key role in flood risk reduction and disaster response decisions. Global-scale flood forecasting and satellite-based flood detection systems are currently operating, however their reliability for decision-making applications needs to be assessed. In this study, we performed comparative evaluations of several operational global flood forecasting and flood detection systems, using 10 major flood events recorded over 2012–2014. Specifically, we evaluated the spatial extent and temporal characteristics of flood detections from the Global Flood Detection System (GFDS) and the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS). Furthermore, we compared the GFDS flood maps with those from NASA’s two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. Results reveal that: (1) general agreement was found between the GFDS and MODIS flood detection systems, (2) large differences exist in the spatio-temporal characteristics of the GFDS detections and GloFAS forecasts, and (3) the quantitative validation of global flood disasters in data-sparse regions is highly challenging. Overall, satellite remote sensing provides useful near real-time flood information that can be useful for risk management. We highlight the known limitations of global flood detection and forecasting systems, and propose ways forward to improve the reliability of large-scale flood monitoring tools.},

ABSTRACT = {The State of Iowa, located in the Midwestern United States, has experienced an increased frequency of large floods in recent decades. After extreme flooding in the summer of 2008, the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) was established for advanced research and education specifically related to floods. IFC seeks to improve Iowa’s flood hazard awareness through the development of easily accessible, high-quality mapping products. Mapping initiatives consist of two model development approaches: (1) statewide floodplain delineation using one-dimensional (1D) models, and (2) urban flood mapping using detailed one-dimensional/two-dimensional (2D) coupled models. The statewide floodplain project will benefit Iowans through the creation of a comprehensive set of floodplain maps developed under a single consistent methodology. These will be important tools in evaluating flood risk, regulating floodplains, and participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. Detailed urban flood analyses are used to develop inundation map libraries. These map libraries are meant to supplement National Weather Service river stage flood forecasts by providing a visual representation of potential flood extent according to predicted river stage at stream gage locations.},
