    \caption{\textbf{[5.1 Results]} Segmentation masks generated with different SAM strategies including (1) using a standalone image (\textit{Auto Mask}), (2) an image with a ground truth bounding box (\textit{GT BBox}), (3) an image with ground truth points (\textit{GT Points}), and (4) an image with a generated bounding box (\textit{GDINO BBox}). The bounding box for \textit{GDINO BBox} is generated using Grounding DINO~\cite{liu2023grounding}, which takes an image and prompt to produce a bounding box.}
