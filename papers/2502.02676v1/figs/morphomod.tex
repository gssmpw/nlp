    \caption{A diagram of MorphoMod---the proposed automated visible watermark removal method with mask refinement and generative inpainting. MorphoMod consists of three main phases: (1) \textit{segment}, (2) \textit{inpaint}, and (3) \textit{restore}. In \textit{segment}, an input image $\inputim$ and dilation parameter $\dilation$ are used to produce a refined and dilated mask $\dilateout$. The input image, a prompt $\prompt$, and the refined mask are then used to \textit{inpaint} the detected region resulting in a cleaned image $\xhat$. In \textit{restore}, this cleaned image, the input image, and the refined mask are used to generate the final restored image with the removed watermark $\restoreout$.}
