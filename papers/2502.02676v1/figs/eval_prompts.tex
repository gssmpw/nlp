    \caption{Visible watermark removal performance of MorphoMod using various prompts [P1-P10]. In some instances, inpainting introduces unintended artifacts (e.g., added text in prompts P1, P3, P6, and P7). Despite this, the original watermark is successfully removed, demonstrating all prompts achieve the intended goal. }
