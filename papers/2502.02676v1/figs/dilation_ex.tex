    \caption{\textbf{[Experiment 1]} Visible watermark removal results of MorphoMod on various datasets. The left-hand side of the image demonstrates removal that is imperceptible, and the right-hand side of the image demonstrates removal that \textit{is} perceptible. For instance, the dog being generated on the baseball field (\textit{LOGO-G}). A human would be able to quickly notice that something is not right in this image. These results highlight an important area for future work: how to ensure the generated areas are imperceptible to the human eye? What metrics could be used to evaluate this?}
