\paragraph{Safety Alignment of LLMs.}
Safety alignment ensures that LLMs adhere to human values, reducing their susceptibility to malicious instructions ____. ____ identified particular ``safety layers” that differentiate malicious from normal queries, revealing distinct behaviors when models process adversarial versus benign prompts. Common alignment methods include RLHF ____ and DPO ____, but researchers have also explored alternatives. For instance, Safety Arithmetic____ is a training-free technique employing parameter arithmetic to suppress harmful outputs while promoting safer ones, and SAFEPATCHING____ refines alignment by selectively adjusting model parameters. Another training-free approach ____ can even reverse an LLM’s safety alignment.

\paragraph{Markov chains and LLMs.}
While they may seem unrelated, Markov chains and LLMs share a core principle. Autoregressive LLMs can be viewed as Markov chains with a large but finite state space, and their token-by-token generation mirrors the “memorylessness” property of Markov processes. ____ formally demonstrated that an LLM with vocabulary size $D$ and context length $K$ can be represented by a Markov chain of size $O(D^K)$, offering a theoretical lens for studying convergence and generalization properties in LLMs.

\paragraph{Group theory and LLMs.}  
Group theory focuses on symmetry, manifesting in phenomena from crystal structures to fundamental forces\footnote{Not to be confused with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) ____ by ____.}. In the LLM context, it has been used to test algebraic properties—such as closure, identity, inverse, and associativity—revealing that LLMs often fail to maintain these properties under various testing regimes ____. For instance, LLMs may produce skewed outputs or show abrupt performance drops beyond certain sequence lengths. Conversely, ____ explored a more constructive angle, illustrating how carefully curated training data can help LLMs learn and uphold algebraic structures more reliably.
