Petri Nets (PN) are widely used for modeling concurrent and distributed systems, but face challenges in modeling adaptive systems. To address this, we have formalized 'rewritable' PT nets (RwPT) using \texttt{Maude}, a declarative language with sound rewriting logic semantics. Recently, we introduced a modular approach that utilizes algebraic operators to construct large RwPT models. This technique employs composite node labeling to outline symmetries in hierarchical organization, preserved through net rewrites.
Once stochastic parameters are added to the formalism, we present an 
automated process to derive a \emph{lumped} CTMC from the quotient graph generated by an RwPT.
%model.
%To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, 
%We use a fault-tolerant manufacturing system as a case study.
%The main intent is to show the advantages of such a hybrid modelling approach and to discuss some raised concerns. This work may be a preliminary step towards defining a \texttt{Maude}-based modelling framework for dynamically reconfigurable distributed systems.
