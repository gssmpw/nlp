\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for addressing the delayed feedback issue: an influence function-empowered framework for delayed feedback modeling (IF-DFM). IF-DFM estimates the parameter changes caused by delayed conversions and newly arrived data, enabling quick updates to the model parameters. By approximating the effect of retraining, IF-DFM avoids sample duplication and does not rely on additional auxiliary models. Additionally, we propose a new algorithm to accelerate the computation of parameter changes by modeling the original problem as an efficient and scalable stochastic optimization problem. Our approach is applicable in both online and offline contexts. Extensive experiments validate that IF-DFM effectively mitigates the delayed feedback issue while incorporating new data to adjust to evolving user interests.
