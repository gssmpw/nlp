\section{Limitations and Future Work}
{
While IF-DFM effectively mitigates the delayed feedback problem in CVR tasks, it still relies on gradient information from the target data and assumes the availability of a complete training set. Future work will focus on refining group influence estimation by incorporating higher-order Taylor expansions, which can more accurately capture parameter changes and reduce computational errors. Additionally, we plan to explore causal inference methods to address the label reversals that arise in delayed feedback scenarios, improving label accuracy without auxiliary models. Furthermore, addressing data sparsity remains a critical challenge, and we aim to develop advanced data augmentation and synthetic data generation techniques to enhance model robustness and ensure reliable performance even with limited data.}
