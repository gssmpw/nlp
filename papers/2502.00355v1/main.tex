\begin{abstract}
  We present a class of diffusion-based algorithms to draw samples from high-dimensional probability distributions given their unnormalized densities. Ideally, our methods can transport samples from a Gaussian distribution to a specified target distribution in finite time. Our approach relies on the stochastic interpolants framework to define a time-indexed collection of probability densities that bridge a Gaussian distribution to the target distribution. Subsequently, we derive a diffusion process that obeys the aforementioned probability density at each time instant. Obtaining such a diffusion process involves solving certain Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs. We solve these PDEs using the theory of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDE) together with machine learning-based methods. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively draw samples from distributions that conventional methods struggle to handle.

\section*{Checklist}


% %%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
%The checklist follows the references. For each question, choose your answer from the three possible options: Yes, No, Not Applicable.  You are encouraged to include a justification to your answer, either by referencing the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline description (1-2 sentences). 
%Please do not modify the questions.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page limit. Not including the checklist in the first submission won't result in desk rejection, although in such case we will ask you to upload it during the author response period and include it in camera ready (if accepted).

%\textbf{In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the Checklist section heading above along with the questions/answers below.}
% %%% END INSTRUCTIONS %%%


 \begin{enumerate}


 \item For all models and algorithms presented, check if you include:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item A clear description of the mathematical setting, assumptions, algorithm, and/or model. [Yes]
   \item An analysis of the properties and complexity (time, space, sample size) of any algorithm. [Not Applicable]\\
   Some numerical results about the time complexity of the algorithm are described in Appendix H.2. However, a complete analysis of complexity is difficult due to the presence of neural network training.
   \item (Optional) Anonymized source code, with specification of all dependencies, including external libraries. [Yes]\\
   Codes are provided as supplementary materials.
 \end{enumerate}


 \item For any theoretical claim, check if you include:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item Statements of the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results. [Yes]
   \item Complete proofs of all theoretical results. [Yes]\\
   Proofs are included in Appendix E.
   \item Clear explanations of any assumptions. [Yes]     
 \end{enumerate}


 \item For all figures and tables that present empirical results, check if you include:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item The code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL). [Yes]\\
   Codes are provided as supplementary materials.
   \item All the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen). [Yes]\\
   Implementation details are given in Appendix~F.   
         \item A clear definition of the specific measure or statistics and error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times). [Yes]
         \item A description of the computing infrastructure used. (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider). [Yes]
 \end{enumerate}

 \item If you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets, check if you include:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item Citations of the creator If your work uses existing assets. [Yes]
   \item The license information of the assets, if applicable. [Yes]
   \item New assets either in the supplemental material or as a URL, if applicable. [Not Applicable]
   \item Information about consent from data providers/curators. [Not Applicable]
   \item Discussion of sensible content if applicable, e.g., personally identifiable information or offensive content. [Not Applicable]
 \end{enumerate}

 \item If you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects, check if you include:
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item The full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots. [Not Applicable]
   \item Descriptions of potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals if applicable. [Not Applicable]
   \item The estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation. [Not Applicable]
