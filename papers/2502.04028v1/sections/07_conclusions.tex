\edits{We introduced \algoabb, a novel approach for policy learning in cooperative MARL tasks, leveraging meta coordination graphs to model and dynamically adapt to the richness of interactions in complex multi-agent environments. By explicitly capturing higher-order and indirect relationships, \algoabb\ extends beyond traditional coordination graph formulations. Through its dynamic generation of graph structures, \algoabb\ adapts to evolving agent behaviors and coordination graph dynamics, enabling it to learn more effective and nuanced cooperative strategies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of \algoabb\ across a range of challenging multi-agent scenarios, including environments that strongly exhibit miscoordination issues such as relative overgeneralization. The results highlighted \algoabb's ability to perform significantly better in MACO environments and also scale to larger and more complex tasks, such as SMACv2, without sacrificing sample efficiency. Additionally, its adaptability and improved coordination capabilities underscore the importance of modeling diverse interaction patterns, making \algoabb\ a robust and versatile approach for MARL.} There are several promising directions for future research to build upon the foundations laid by \algoabb. Enhancing the interpretability of the MCGs generated by \algoabb\ would help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of multi-agent interactions. Developing methods to visualize and interpret these emergent graphs would provide deeper insights into the learned coordination strategies, making it more accessible to practitioners. Also, extending it to larger multi-agent systems with hundreds or thousands of agents would be valuable for real-world applications such as large-scale simulations or swarm robotics.
