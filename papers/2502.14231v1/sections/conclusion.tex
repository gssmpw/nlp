This paper introduces a sampling-based online planning method tailored for drone interception scenarios. 
Our approach combines efficient sampling techniques with parallel trajectory optimization, leveraging a neural network policy to enhance computational speed. 
The method begins by generating multiple initial trajectories towards sampled candidate target positions. 
% By avoiding traditional non-linear optimization in favor of a sampling and rejection strategy, we achieve rapid trajectory optimization, crucial for high-rate online replanning in dynamic environments. 
We employ a neural network-based planning policy for rapid trajectory optimization together with iterative traversal time adaptation, enabling high-rate online replanning towards dynamic target drones.
This method has been validated in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its capability for high-rate online replanning in dynamic environments.
