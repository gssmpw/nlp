\subsection{Cultural Awareness of Generation Models}

We define that a model has a high level of \textit{cultural awareness} if it can generate semantically correct results for text prompts that contain specific concepts related to a particular culture. Multicultural awareness involves understanding of linguistic and semantic features \cite{wibowo2023copal}, as well as correctly semantic matching of concepts from different cultures \cite{10.1162/tacl_a_00634}. Earlier, a tendency towards Western culture in generative models has been noted \cite{bhatia2024localconceptsuniversalsevaluating, 10.1145/3600211.3604711, berg-etal-2022-prompt}. As language is a conduit of culture \cite{ventura2023navigating}, many NLP studies have focused on the issue of cultural awareness. This includes the task of adaptive translation \cite{peskov-etal-2021-adapting-entities}, offensive language detection \cite{zhou-etal-2023-cultural, 10100717}, dialog systems operation \cite{cao-etal-2024-bridging} and other tasks \cite{hershcovich-etal-2022-challenges}. The development of visual-language models (VLM) has led to a transfer of cultural awareness issues for the multimodal architectures \cite{nayak2024benchmarkingvisionlanguagemodels}. This problem was considered in the context of the visual question answering (VQA) task \cite{10.1145/3590773, romero2024cvqaculturallydiversemultilingualvisual}, image-text retrieval and grounding \cite{bhatia2024localconceptsuniversalsevaluating}. With the addition of a new modality, the problem of cultural awareness has become more acute. For example, there are different levels of understanding of concepts from regional cultures among modern VLMs \cite{nayak2024benchmarkingvisionlanguagemodels}. 
%One of the reasons for this is that text translations are used to create training datasets. Images, on the other hand, do not change and do not introduce new visual concepts (2).
In text-to-image generation, quality metrics have long focused on the aesthetics and photorealism of generated results, while ignoring cultural awareness \cite{kannen2024aestheticsculturalcompetencetexttoimage} Several studies have identified significant gaps in the level of multicultural awareness for the most popular T2I models. As far as we know, our work represents the first comprehensive approach to the issue of cultural awareness in relation to Russian culture in the T2I task.

\subsection{Multicultural Benchmarks}

Benchmarks for evaluating the multicultural and multilingual abilities of generative models primarily emerged in NLP tasks. Due to the fact that most existing language models are designed primarily for English, several studies have focused on assessing the linguistic and grammatical features of other languages \cite{cahyawijaya-etal-2021-indonlg, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.13078, mukherjee-etal-2024-multilingual-text, kim-etal-2024-click, fenogenova-etal-2024-mera, taktasheva2024rublimprussianbenchmarklinguistic}. These benchmarks were designed to expand the range of multilingual knowledge tested in language models, as previously translated English-language datasets have overlooked various cultural and linguistic features \cite{kim-etal-2024-click}. This is especially important for common languages, which, nevertheless, have limited resources in terms of accessible open information on the Internet \cite{cahyawijaya-etal-2021-indonlg, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.13078}. The main types of tasks included in such benchmarks were question answering \cite{kim-etal-2024-click}, natural language generation \cite{cahyawijaya-etal-2021-indonlg}, multilingual dialog generation \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.13078}, text style transfer \cite{mukherjee-etal-2024-multilingual-text}, and many other tasks \cite{fenogenova-etal-2024-mera}.

The next significant step forward was the development of multimodal benchmarks for evaluating multilingual VLMs \cite{NEURIPS2022_6a386d70, pmlr-v162-bugliarello22a, nayak2024benchmarkingvisionlanguagemodels, romero2024cvqaculturallydiversemultilingualvisual, inoue2024heronbench}. The range of benchmark tasks here primarily includes visual question answering (VQA) \cite{pmlr-v162-bugliarello22a, nayak2024benchmarkingvisionlanguagemodels, romero2024cvqaculturallydiversemultilingualvisual, inoue2024heronbench}, as well as cross-modal retrieval, grounded reasoning, and grounded entailment tasks \cite{pmlr-v162-bugliarello22a}. Among the findings regarding the results of applying these benchmarks, it has been noted that the quality of modern VLM models varies depending on geographic and cultural categories \cite{nayak2024benchmarkingvisionlanguagemodels}. In addition, efforts have been made to combine text collected from the Internet with text generated by a pre-trained image captioning model.

Due to the fact that the T2I task primarily requires an assessment of visual cultural characteristics, not much work has been done in this area. Currently, existing benchmarks are limited in terms of the number of languages and cultural categories they cover \cite{kannen2024aestheticsculturalcompetencetexttoimage}.In addition, they do not support the Russian language, despite its relatively high level of usage on the Internet\footnote{\url{https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language}}. In this work, we are, to the best of our knowledge, the first to conduct a comprehensive cultural analysis in order to create a benchmark dataset for assessing the quality of image generation incorporating elements of Russian culture.

\subsection{Ethics and Social Biases in Generative AI}

Insufficient cultural awareness of image generation models can lead to the spread of social biases, misinformation, and offensive content \cite{10.1145/3600211.3604711, Cho2023DallEval, 10.5555/3666122.3668580}. A number of studies have focused on reducing the biases in generative models that are based on factors such as race, skin color, gender, geography, and social status \cite{9656762, 10.1145/3600211.3604711, NEURIPS2023_ae9500c4, 10.1145/3630106.3658968, Clemmer_2024_WACV}. Cultural stereotypes were also seen as undesirable in favor of greater globalization \cite{berg-etal-2022-prompt, 10.1613/jair.1.15388}. Although we agree that cultural stereotypes can be offensive and need to be eliminated, knowledge about the specific cultural features should be retained by the model. For this reason, in our work we create a benchmark using expert knowledge to test the model's ability to capture real cultural features, while avoiding offensive stereotypes.
