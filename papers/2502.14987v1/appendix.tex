\subsection{Optimizing for Latency in Memcached}

In \cref{fig:bayesopt_mcd_min99} we demonstrate the flexibility of the controller's optimization criteria through a change of its reward penalty function to focus on minimizing tail latency instead at a cost to greater energy use. In this case, the function is simplified to $Rp = m\_latency$ in order to reflect performance optimization instead. Fig.~\ref{fig:bayesopt_mcd_min99} illustrates that the Bayesian process was also able to consistently performance-focused ITR-delay,  DVFS settings that lowered the 99\% tail latency by up to 30\% in Linux, however at a higher energy cost of up to 40\%. This result also demonstrates the potential of exploring alternate reward functions that may consist of different combinations of performance and energy criteria.

\subsection{Optimizing for Latency in Silo} Fig.~\ref{fig:bayesopt_mcdsilo_min99} shows that similar to memcached, the controller can still largely lower overall 99\% latency by 50 \% while increasing its overall energy use for a new application across both OSes.
