\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
Our work seeks to validate a set of conjectures about how combining queuing and processing efficiency can result in diverse set of energy-efficient system settings. Further, to confirm our conjecture that one can exploit stable demand curves in SLA-driven applications; we have also proposed an example controller design that utilizes a black-box search strategy to automatically find these "sweet spots". Our results demonstrate its applicability across offered loads, applications, OSes and even hardware.
