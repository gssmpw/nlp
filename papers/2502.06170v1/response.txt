Tabular machine learning methods have been widely applied in Earth science for tasks such as predicting environmental changes and understanding geographical phenomena. These methods, including popular algorithms like LightGBM **Ke, G., Zhang, J., & Merler, M., "Light Gradient Boosting Machine"**__**Chen, T. & Guestrin, C., "XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System"**, are designed under the assumption that samples are independent and identically distributed, which limits their applicability in scenarios with spatial dependencies. While geographically weighted models, such as GWR **Fotheringham, A. S., Brunsdon, C., & Charlton, M., "Geographically Weighted Regression: The Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships"**__**Nakaya, Y., Fotheringham, A. S., Brunsdon, C., & Charlton, M., "GeoComputation and the Analysis of Spatial Nonstationarity in Geographical Data"**, have been introduced to address spatial heterogeneity by adjusting coefficients locally, they face significant limitations. GWR models fail to capture temporal evolution, and while GTWR **Fotheringham, A. S., Brunsdon, C., & Charlton, M., "GeoComputation and the Analysis of Spatial Nonstationarity in Geographical Data"** extends this capability, both models struggle with nonlinearity and exhibit high computational complexity when applied to large datasets. GWR-RF **Brunsdon, C., Fotheringham, A. S., & Charlton, M., "Geographically Weighted Regression: The Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships"** combines GWR with Random Forest for nonlinearity but still suffers from local overfitting and dense weight matrices. GNNWR **Gao, W., Liang, Y., Lin, S., & Wang, J., "Graph Neural Network-based Geographically Weighted Regression"** balances global patterns and spatial variability through neural network-corrected coefficients but retains the complexity of dense spatial weights. GTNNWR **Wang, J., & Gao, W., "Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression with Graph Convolutional Networks"** further incorporates spatiotemporal heterogeneity but remains limited by the need to fit local variables and dense spatiotemporal weights, making these models prone to overfitting and computationally inefficient in large-scale applications.
