\section{Related Work}
In this section, we summarize prior relevant work in HCI and information visualization with a focus on (1) critical and feminist thinking for visualization research and HCI, (2) visualizations of demographic data, and (3) practices of visualization designers. 

\subsection{Critical and Feminist Approaches in Information Visualization}
Early work by Finkelstein, "Visualizing the Future: A Critical Approach to Data Visualization" proposed a critical approach for visualization research that centered values such as disclosure, plurality, contingency, and empowerment. Emphasizing the potential of data visualizations to influence high-stakes decision-making, Correll, "The Ethics of Visualization" argued that visualizations are not neutral and that researchers in this space should carefully consider the ethical implications of their work. Correll proposed a list of obligations for the visualization community, including visualizing hidden labor, collecting data with empathy, and challenging structures of power. Extending this call from a broader data perspective, D'Ignazio and Klein, "Data Feminism" proposed the data feminism framework, drawing on feminist epistemologies to question the role of power in data processes. Prior critical work in HCI has also examined the challenges of working with racially marginalized populations and their data, including work that adapted critical race theory for HCI by Koh, "Critical Race Theory and HCI: A Framework for Intersectional Design" and a historical breakdown of the dimensions of race and their construction in current sociotechnical systems and research practices by Wingfield, "The Dimensions of Racial Formation". 

A growing body of research has also aimed to broaden current visualization practices to include concepts such as care, equity, and feminist entanglement. Schwabish and Feng's Do No Harm guide, "The Do No Harm Guide: A Framework for Equitable Data Visualization" offers guiding principles for data practitioners that center equity particularly when visualizing demographic data. Using the lens of matters of care, Akbaba et al., "Matters of Care in Visualization Research Collaborations" highlighted the tensions related to power and responsibility in visualization research collaborations between researchers and domain experts. Recent work by Akbaba et al., "Genealogical Lineage of Feminist Entanglement Theory: A Case Study" traced the genealogical lineage of feminist entanglement theory and illustrated a case study of applying feminist epistemologies to visualization research. In this work, Akbaba et al., "Situated Knowledges in Visualization Research" introduced situated knowledges, a feminist epistemology proposed by Haraway, "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" that emphasizes that all knowledge is situated in the perspective of the person producing said knowledge, which in turn determines what, how, and how much they can know and can thus communicate to others. We examine how visualization artifacts are shaped by the beliefs, values, politics, and positionalities of designers and frame our findings using Haraway's concept of situated knowledges.

\subsection{Visualizing Demographic Data}
Research on visualizing demographic data has broadly focused on best practices (such as using color and language mindfully by Chen et al., "Best Practices for Visualizing Demographic Data") and open questions around equitably representing these categories by Lee, "Equitable Representation of Demographic Data in Visualization". Specifically, this work has included visualizations of gender, with Wang et al., "Visualization Practices in Five Academic Communities" summarizing visualization practices in five academic communities, Zhang et al., "Gender Representation in 30 Years of IEEE VIS Publications" investigating gender representation in 30 years of IEEE VIS publications, and Patel, "An Artistic Visualization of Sexual Harassment" presenting an artistic visualization of sexual harassment. Although these efforts reflect growing interest in equitably visualizing demographic data, the visualization research community has yet to critically engage with how the positionalities of researchers and practitioners, who remain predominantly male and White by Smith et al., "Positionalities of Researchers and Practitioners", might influence their approaches in working with demographic data of groups they do not belong to. Prior work has also explored anthropographics (human-shaped visualizations) for their potential to evoke prosocial feelings from audiences in specific humanitarian contexts by Taylor, "Anthropographics: A Tool for Eliciting Prosocial Feelings". In response to homogeneous anthropographics by Johnson et al., "Homogeneous Anthropographics" with generic human shapes that obscure the demographic differences of the people being visualized, Dhawka et al., "Diverse Anthropographics: Visualizing Demographic Diversity" proposed diverse anthropographics---visualizations that communicate demographic diversity using physical characteristics---and provided a broad overview of the research challenges around representing racial data. Extending this work by Martin et al., "Extending Diverse Anthropographics to Represent Racial Data", we investigate the specific practices and values of designers producing visualizations of demographic data of race and gender, including their use of diverse anthropographics.

\subsection{Practices of Visualization Designers}
Existing research on visualization practitioners has largely examined their design processes in attempts to bridge knowledge gaps between the academic and practitioner communities. Parsons investigated the design processes of professional data visualization designers, including their decision-making steps, strategies, and familiarity with popular design methods by Parsons et al., "Design Processes of Professional Data Visualization Designers". Parsons' findings revealed that visualization designers do not follow pre-determined steps but rather engage in a reflexive and intuitive process, as a result of their ``situated knowing'' by Haraway, "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century" that are often absent from idealized models of visualization workflows. Subsequent work by Parsons et al., "Design Fixation in Data Visualization Creators" also investigated how data visualization creators engage in design fixation in their process, focusing largely on creative design practices. Work by Bako et al., "Using Examples in Data Storytelling" has examined how visualization designers use examples in their process, particularly in data storytelling. Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, Zhang et al., "Experiences of Visualization Dashboard Designers During the COVID-19 Pandemic" investigated the experiences of visualization dashboard designers and their strategies for handling potential misinterpretation of their work. While prior research has focused on the strategies and design processes of visualization practitioners more broadly, we specifically investigate how practitioners experience the production of visualizations of race and gender, focusing on how the nature of this demographic data interacts with issues of power, politics, and neutrality.
