%\paragraph{Model Editing}
% Large language model and vision language models are strong foundation models but are still prone to mistakes and their knowledge can get outdated, consequently it is important to develop efficient updates that preserve unrelated knowledge.  
% The main line of work in this area focuses on LLM editing, where previous factual knowledge has changed and the model must be updated effectively on those changes. 
\looseness=-1\textbf{Continual Learning.} Our work falls within the continual learning literature, where a model needs to be updated incrementally as new data arrive, accumulating knowledge over tasks and reducing forgetting of previously acquired information ____.

Our method adapts only the vision encoder, preserving language capabilities.

\textbf{Continual Learning with Few-Shot Updates.} ____ posits that an ideal continual learning solution would enable continual correction of model's mistakes at a lower computational cost than retraining from scratch.

Few-shot updates can also be viewed through the lens of model editing____. MEND____ scales model editing to large language models by transforming the gradient obtained from fine-tuning, through a low-rank decomposition fed to auxiliary networks designed to make fast, local edits to a pre-trained model, requiring a set of unrelated examples to prevent forgetting.

However, ROME does not scale to continual updates or non-association types of updates. ____ studied multi-modal editing, showing negligible deterioration in multi-modal task performance when updating language models but severe forgetting when updating vision encoders. To the contrary, our method focuses on adapting the vision encoder rather than updating the factual knowledge in the LLM, yet achieving strong performance gains and negligible forgetting.
%According to____, an ideal continual learning solution should enable continual correction of model errors at a lower computational cost than full retraining. However, most few-shot continual learning approaches focus on classification and do not scale to large multimodal models. Prior works update the vision encoder only on the first task ____, calibrate covariance matrices based on semantic similarity ____, or introduce minimal updates with transfer and cross-classification losses to mitigate forgetting ____. Few-shot updates can also be framed as model editing ____, where MEND ____ transforms fine-tuning gradients via low-rank decomposition for localized edits, and ROME ____ applies causal tracing to update factual knowledge but does not scale to continual learning. Recent work on multimodal editing ____ shows severe forgetting when updating vision encoders. In contrast, our approach adapts the vision encoder rather than modifying LLM factual knowledge, achieving strong performance with negligible forgetting.

SPU____ localizes updates to the first feed-forward layer of each transformer block, inspired by knowledge neuron theory____. Our approach generalizes updates to all layers, selecting relevant parameters and maintaining gradient norms, combined with LoRA on selected attention heads for adaptivity and stability,  achieving SOTA performance on continual fewshot multimodal tasks.

Regarding continual updating of CLIP while maintaining its generalization performance and reducing forgetting, SPU____ treats layers of the transformers differently. Inspired by knowledge neuron theory____, SPU localizes updates to the first feed-forward layer of each transformer block, updating only the relevant parameters for the task at hand. In our approach, we select and identify relevant parameters for the current data, generalizing updates to all layers while preserving the specificity of each layer. We choose masks that maintain the gradient norm of parameter updates and combine them with LoRA on selected attention heads, striking a balance between adaptivity and stability.

 % ____ survey on continual learning for large language models. The authors propose a novel multi-staged categorization scheme for continual learning techniques, which includes continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and alignment. They discuss challenges such as computation-efficient continual learning and controllable forgetting
% ____ investigated continual multi-modal learning of LLM on multiple VQA datasets where the vision encoder remain frozen. While it shows that updating LLM continually has little forgetting on lanugo understanding tasks it can have significant effect on language generation tasks.
% ____ studied continual instruction tunning where VQA datasets are received sequentially and proposed a method where the project head is expanded for each new task, while the LLM and vision encoder remain frozen.
% ____ proposes a method for updating continually vision language models using a pseudo rehearsal strategy. The method only updates the language projection layer while the vision encoder and the LLM remain frozen.
%  \textbf{Only LoRA variants - no continual updates.} Another line of work focus on updating the model for a new task or dataset with parameter efficient finetuning. Low Rank Adapters (LoRA)____ approximates the parameter updates by a low rank matrix, achieving similar performance on the target task by optimizing only 1\% of the parameters compared to the full model. The original version of LoRA updated only attention layers. Subsequently, several extensions have been proposed to enhance LoRA which modify all layers. Various options are available including  adapting the learning rate____ of the low rank matrix, using an adaptive rank____ or decomposing the update matrix into magnitude and direction____. These approaches focus solely on efficiently updating the network without considering the impact on model performance for other unrelated tasks or enforcing any locality to specific layers or parameters. It is worth noting that LoRA drop____ attempts to localize the updates to specific layers.  It initially allows a few iterations of LoRA updates and then assesses the impact of each low-rank update on individual layers and selectively updates only those layers where the change exceeds a specified threshold. However, this selectivity remains at the layer level and depends on the change introduced by a few full updates.
% In contrast,  we treat each layer differently based on its structure and assess the relevance of individual parameters to the task at hand. We then holistically combine the importance and relevance of these parameters with low-rank updates.
