\section{Conclusion}

We conducted the first systematic study of plagiarism in LLM-generated research documents. Through an expert-led evaluation, we discovered significant levels of plagiarism in these documents. We demonstrated the inadequacy of current automated plagiarism detection methods, 
while our case studies revealed sophisticated forms of content misappropriation that passed through multiple layers of filtering and expert review. 
Our findings raise important concerns about potential wide-spread use of LLMs for research ideation and highlights the need for better plagiarism detection methods.
