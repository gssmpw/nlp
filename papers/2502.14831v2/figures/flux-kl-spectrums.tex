\caption{Spectrums for FluxAE autoencoders trained with different KL regularization strengths. KL regularization is a double-edged sword: it pushes the latents distribution closer to standard Gaussian (the distribution the reverse diffusion process starts with), so that the LDM has less work to do~\cite{LSGM}, but it also introduces high-frequency components into the latents due to the random noise addition, which LDM is forced to model as well.}
