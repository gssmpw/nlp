\caption{Comparison between the reconstructions from a family of FluxAE autoencoders with different bottleneck sizes trained in identical conditions (with different KL regularization strengths), and also RGB. One can note two things: 1) the latent space of an autoencoder, in general, exhibits a different power profile from RGB; and 2) the coefficient magnitudes of high frequencies in the spectrum increase with the channel sizes.} 
% \willi{A question would be if \regname can fix also AE versions with better reconstructions and more channels, i.e. does the optimal tradeoff rise from 16 to 32 or 64 channels after we apply regularization?}
