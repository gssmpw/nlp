\caption{\textbf{Effect of DCT spectrum cutting.} We plot reconstruction metrics on ImageNet for the baseline FluxAE and its finetuned version, with and without \regname. As more high-frequency DCT coefficients are removed from the latents, the AE with regularization consistently achieves the best reconstruction quality.}
