\section*{Impact Statement}

This work focuses on improving the representations in autoencoders that serve as a backbone for latent diffusion training, ultimately enhancing generative performance.
Our improvements can facilitate beneficial applications such as boosting creativity, supporting educational content creation, and reducing computational overhead in generative workflows.
Beyond these considerations, we do not identify additional ethical or societal implications beyond those already known to accompany large-scale generative modeling.
