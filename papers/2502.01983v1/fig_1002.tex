    \caption{Top left: This diagram represents the $2$-cocycle condition~\eqref{item:Cath_cocycle} in Cathelineau's $\kk$-vector space.
    Top right: Two lines crossing is virtual, but the additive vertex contributes $\langle b,a\rangle = \langle a,b \rangle$. Bottom left: the additive vertex on the left hand side gives $\langle ac, bc\rangle$ while the additive vertex on the right hand side gives $c\langle a,b\rangle$. This cobordism implies that they are equal.
    Bottom right: These two isotopies imply that one may pull the red multiplicative line away from black additive line.
