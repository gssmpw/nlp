#Annotating the nine coordinates 


# Convention -- 10 means the first coordinate is 1 and the second is 0
#More specifically, let us call player 1's action v1v2 and player 2's action w1w2 
#ECh vi/wi can take values in {0,1}
#All are sums 
# phi1  = v1w1 (i.e. 1 iff both v1 and w1 are 1) -bottom right 4 elements
#phi2 = v1w2  (intersection of bottom two rows and middle columns)
#phi3 = v1 (bottom two rows)
#phi4 = v2w1 (middle rows and right columns)
#phi5 = v2w2 (middle row and middle cols)
#phi6 = v2 (middle two rows)
#phi7 = w1 (right cols)
#phi8 = w2 ( middle cols)
#phi9 = 1
