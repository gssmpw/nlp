However, one of the remaining difficulties in the literature is that most of theoretical works assume full information of the payoff matrices, while in applications, the leader often has no prior knowledge about the follower’s payoff matrix, but may gain information about the follower’s utility function through repeated interactions. In this paper, we study the problem of learning the optimal leader strategy in Stackelberg (security) games and develop novel algorithms as well as new hardness results.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={01}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Peng, Binghui and Shen, Weiran and Tang, Pingzhong and Zuo, Song}, year={2019}, month={Jul.}, pages={2149-2156} }

In this work, we propose a novel concave formulation for pure-strategy bidding in first-price auctions, and use it to analyze natural Gradient-Ascent-based algorithms for this problem. Importantly, our analysis goes beyond regret, which was the typical focus of past work, and also accounts for the strategic backdrop of online-advertising markets where bidding algorithms are deployed---we provide the first guarantees of strategic-robustness and incentive-compatibility for Gradient Ascent.Concretely, we show that our algorithms achieve [EQUATION] regret when the highest competing bids are generated adversarially, and show that no online algorithm can do better. We further prove that the regret reduces to O(log T) when the competition is stationary and stochastic, which drastically improves upon the previous best of [EQUATION]. Moving beyond regret, we show that a strategic seller cannot exploit our algorithms to extract more revenue on average than is possible under the optimal mechanism. Finally, we prove that our algorithm is also incentive compatible---it is a (nearly) dominant strategy for the buyer to report her values truthfully to the algorithm as a whole. Altogether, these guarantees make our algorithms the first to simultaneously achieve both optimal regret and strategic-robustness.The full paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07363.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 25th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation}, pages = {893}, numpages = {1}, keywords = {auctions, gradient descent, convex formulation}, location = {New Haven, CT, USA}, series = {EC '24} }

abstract = {We study the problem of characterizing optimal learning algorithms for playing repeated games against an adversary with unknown payoffs. In this problem, the first player (called the learner) commits to a learning algorithm against a second player (called the optimizer), and the optimizer best-responds by choosing the optimal dynamic strategy for their (unknown but well-defined) payoff. Classic learning algorithms (such as no-regret algorithms) provide some counterfactual guarantees for the learner, but might perform much more poorly than other learning algorithms against particular optimizer payoffs.In this paper, we introduce the notion of asymptotically Pareto-optimal learning algorithms. Intuitively, if a learning algorithm is Pareto-optimal, then there is no other algorithm which performs asymptotically at least as well against all optimizers and performs strictly better (by at least Ω(T)) against some optimizer. We show that well-known no-regret algorithms such as Multiplicative Weights and Follow The Regularized Leader are Pareto-dominated. However, while no-regret is not enough to ensure Pareto-optimality, we show that a strictly stronger property, no-swap-regret, is a sufficient condition for Pareto-optimality.Proving these results requires us to address various technical challenges specific to repeated play, including the fact that there is no simple characterization of how optimizers who are rational in the long-term best-respond against a learning algorithm over multiple rounds of play. To address this, we introduce the idea of the asymptotic menu of a learning algorithm: the convex closure of all correlated distributions over strategy profiles that are asymptotically implementable by an adversary. Interestingly, we show that all no-swap-regret algorithms share the same asymptotic menu, implying that all no-swap-regret algorithms are "strategically equivalent".},
