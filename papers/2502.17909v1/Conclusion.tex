\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \tool, an innovative system for automated fact sheet generation. This system is designed to create fact sheets from natural language requests and datasets. \tool generates fact ideas based on our proposed taxonomy and produces visualizations for each fact, which are then assembled into a comprehensive fact sheet. Additionally, we offer an AI-enhanced platform for users to personalize these fact sheets. User evaluations indicate a preference for \tool-generated fact sheets in terms of content detail and visual appeal. Further studies on our customization module have yielded positive usability results. Future efforts will concentrate on improving \tool's personalization capabilities and infusing it with domain-specific knowledge to cater for more advanced use cases.
