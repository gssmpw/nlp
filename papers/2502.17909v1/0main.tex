%% Abstract section.
\abstract{%
With the proliferation of data across various domains, there is a critical demand for tools that enable non-experts to derive meaningful insights without deep data analysis skills. To address this need, existing automatic fact sheet generation tools offer heuristic-based solutions to extract facts and generate stories. However, they inadequately grasp the semantics of data and struggle to generate narratives that fully capture the semantics of the dataset or align the fact sheet with specific user needs. Addressing these shortcomings, this paper introduces \tool, a novel tool designed for the automatic generation and customisation of fact sheets. \tool applies the concept of collaborative AI workers to transform raw tabular dataset into comprehensive, visually compelling fact sheets. We define effective taxonomy to profile AI worker for specialised tasks. Furthermore, \tool empowers users to refine these fact sheets through intuitive natural language commands, ensuring the final outputs align closely with individual preferences and requirements. Our user evaluation with 18 participants confirms that \tool not only surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in automated fact sheet production but also provides a positive user experience during customization tasks.

We demonstrate \tool's functionality using the Tourism dataset. \tool first processes the dataset and the user's initial ideas to automatically generate a fact sheet. Users can then dynamically modify the fact sheet through natural language requests, prompting \tool to generate new content and update the fact sheet accordingly.
