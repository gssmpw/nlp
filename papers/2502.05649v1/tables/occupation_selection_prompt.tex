    \texttt{For each occupation, provide three values:} \\
    \texttt{(1) An explanation of why it is stereotypically associated with a specific gender based on common societal beliefs or biases (not your own opinion).} \\
    \texttt{(2) The gender that is typically biased toward this occupation (male or female).} \\
    \texttt{(3) The appropriate article (a or an) for the occupation. Provide the results in dictionary (JSON) format, where the key is the occupation and the value is a sub-dictionary with three fields: 'reason', 'gender', and 'article'.} \\
