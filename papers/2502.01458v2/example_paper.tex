\begin{abstract}
Weak-to-strong generalization, where weakly supervised strong models outperform their weaker teachers, offers a promising approach to aligning superhuman models with human values. 
To deepen the understanding of this approach, we provide theoretical insights into its capabilities and limitations. 
First, in the classification setting, we establish upper and lower generalization error bounds for the strong model, identifying the primary limitations as stemming from the weak model's generalization error and the optimization objective itself.
Additionally, we derive lower and upper bounds on the calibration error of the strong model. 
These theoretical bounds reveal two critical insights: (1) the weak model should demonstrate strong generalization performance and maintain well-calibrated predictions, and (2) the strong model's training process must strike a careful balance, as excessive optimization could undermine its generalization capability by over-relying on the weak supervision signals.
Finally, in the regression setting, we extend the work of~\citet{charikar2024quantifying} to a loss function based on KL divergence, offering guarantees that the strong student can outperform its weak teacher by at least the magnitude of their disagreement. 
The theory is validated through sufficient experiments.
