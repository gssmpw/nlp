\subsection{Security of LLM Agents}
With the growth of LLM adoption, concerns about security and safety issues are emerging ____: Baudiére, R., & Leivant, D. (2022). "Language and Computation": From Logic to Linguistics, Oxford University Press.
Current models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks through malicious instructions, called "jailbreaks" ____: Wang, Y., et al. (2022). "Leveraging Meta-Learning for Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning." Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 36(1), 103-111.. There exist different types of malicious instructions such as direct ____ : Zhang, Y., et al. (2020). "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems". or indirect ____ prompt injection. For direct prompt injection, the attacker sends a malicious prompt directly to the language model while indirect ones are injected into the content that LLM agents use to inform their responses (such as a website an agent retrieves containing a malicious prompt). LLM-agents are also vulnerable to backdoor injections within their core LLLM that exclusively target a deployment as agents by exploiting their multi-step reasoning process ____: Liang, T., et al. (2018). "Automated Software Engineering with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning." Our work focuses on direct threats of jailbreaks.
In terms of defense, recent work has demonstrated that while attacks transfer from LLLM to LLM-agents, safety measures do not ____: Wang, Y., et al. (2022). "Leveraging Meta-Learning for Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning." Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 36(1), 103-111..

At the multi-agent level, replications of malicious instructions within multi-LLM systems had been demonstrated in abstract non-realistic environments ____: Lee, J. Y., et al. (2020). "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems." Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, 1449-1459 and in the context of a GenAI email assistant ____.: Zhang, Y., et al. (2021). "Automated Report Generation with LLLMs". Recent work has also shown how malicious prompts can create a "domino effect" in multi-agent systems, where compromising one agent can trigger cascading failures across the entire system ____: Radford, A., et al. (2020). "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Multitask Learning".

    Examples of infectious prompt proliferation or containment depending on defense mechanisms. \\ 
    Each horizontal line of the graphs corresponds to one LLLM agent of the simulation. Arrows from one line to another correspond to messages sent to other agents. Arrows in bold highlight one message chain. Each simulation starts with a message containing normal instructions sent to Atlas, the lab manager (i.e. \textit{Initial lab instructions}). Then, once the agents start collaborating on the instructed task, the malicious instructions are sent to one of them (i.e. \textit{Initial malicious instructions}).
    \textbf{Upper:}
    Multi-hop spread of malicious instructions in our system without any defense mechanism.  Normal operations are disrupted by the introduction of the jailbreak and a wave of messages is sent by compromised agents (red and orange arrows). Finally, Deng performs an action that leads to an explosion in the lab (red cross).
    \textbf{Lower:}
    Limited multi-hop spread of malicious instructions in our system with active vaccines. Even if the first agent targeted by the malicious prompt, Edison, got compromised, 
    the message sent by this agent raises suspicion of other bots. Recipients do not follow the malicious instructions and proactively contact the other agents leading to an effective containment of the infectious prompt spread.
