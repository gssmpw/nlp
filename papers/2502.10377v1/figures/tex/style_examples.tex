\textbf{Style Image Samples. }We showcase exemplar images of various designs across various styles and types of rooms from our \dataset benchmark style image collection~(top rows), paired with their open-vocabulary semantic segmentation masks~(bottom rows). These images span a variety of interior spaces--including kitchens, living rooms, and bedrooms--and illustrate the core challenge of \ours: transferring the appearance of each semantically matched region~(e.g., cabinets, couches, and beds) from a style image to real-world 3D scenes. Our method leverages these semantic masks to ensure each object is stylized with the correct instance-level textures while maintaining photo-realism and multi-view consistency.
