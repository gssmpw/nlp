\caption{\textbf{Semantic Appearance Transfer}. 
The style and source images are first noised back to step $T$ using DDPM inversion~\cite{huberman2024edit}. During the generation of the stylized output, the extended self-attention layer transfers style information from the style to the output latent. This process is further guided by a semantic matching mask, which allows for precise control.
