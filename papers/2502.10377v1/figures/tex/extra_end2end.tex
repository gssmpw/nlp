    \caption{\textbf{Additional Results on Video/Multiview Appearance Transfer}. We showcase three frames from a new indoor sequence stylized by \ours, followed by a 3D reconstruction of these stylized images using an off-the-shelf algorithm. Despite dynamic viewpoint changes and scene complexity, \ours consistently enforces semantic correspondences and preserves geometric integrity across all frames, enabling high-quality multi-view edits for practical applications such as interior design or virtual staging.}
