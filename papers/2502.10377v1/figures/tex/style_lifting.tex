    \caption{\textbf{Results on two-view NVS with warp-and-refine}. Given a single input view and a target viewpoint, each method attempts to synthesize the target frame by warping and refining the source image. \ours recovers more accurate geometry and fewer artifacts, while also preserving finer scene details. By contrast, baseline methods struggle with consistent edge alignment and realism, showing noticeable artifacts and incomplete regions.}
