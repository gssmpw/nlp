\caption{\textbf{Multi-view Style Lifting}. Stereo correspondences are extracted from the original image pair $(\img_{src}^i, \img_{src}^j)$ and used to warp the stylized image $\hat{\img}^i$ to the second image, $\img^j_w$. To address missing pixels from warping, we train a warp-and-refine model to complete the stylized image $\hat{\img}^j$. This model is applied across multiple views within our auto-regressive framework.}
