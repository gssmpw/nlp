% Evaluation을 section으로 따로 빼지 말고 4.3 Ranking Evaluation, ... 이렇게 하기

\subsection{Ranking Evaluation}
We evaluated the retriever and ranker using Mean Average Precision (MAP@k) and Success@k \cite{Manning2008IR}. MAP@k measures the ranking quality by averaging precision over relevant results up to rank $k$, while Success@k indicates the proportion of queries with at least one relevant result in the top $k$. The high Success@k score indicates that relevant chunks are retrieved, while the improved MAP@k highlights better ranking of those retrieved chunks.
