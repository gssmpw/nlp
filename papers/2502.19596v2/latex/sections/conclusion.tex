In this work, we presented a low-resource approach to RAG for domain expert QA, utilizing heterogeneous data sources. We showed that our data generation pipeline, guided by expert-driven prompting, facilitates an effective RAG system by converting multi-modal raw data. By enhancing the retrieval phase with re-ranker, we demonstrated that the final answers are both accurate and traceable to relevant sources. These findings highlight the potential of RAG in data-scarce domains and its applicability to specialized knowledge-intensive tasks. As future work, we are exploring open-source Vision models to better handle multi-modal questions, addressing current limitations discussed in Section \ref{sec:limitation}.
