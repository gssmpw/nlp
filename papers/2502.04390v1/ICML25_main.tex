\section*{Impact Statement}
Our work reveals a fundamental and concerning limitation of current AI systems: when LLMs encounter contradictory information, they suffer catastrophic corruption of unrelated knowledge, even in large-scale models. This vulnerability contrasts sharply with human cognition's remarkable flexibility in handling contradictory information. Interestingly, this distinction might hint at why human cognition seems to favor accumulation and contextualization of conflicting knowledge (e.g., ``before'' vs ``after''), despite the tension it creates, rather than direct overwriting. This cognitive pattern \textit{might} suggest that direct knowledge editing poses inherent risks that even evolutionary processes had to work around.

\textit{This finding has critical implications for AI deployment:} Any AI system operating in the real world will inevitably encounter contradictory information, whether through natural knowledge evolution (e.g., medical guidelines updates) or potential adversarial attacks (e.g., coordinated misinformation campaigns). \textit{Our work demonstrates that such contradictions don't just affect related knowledge - they can corrupt the system's broader knowledge base in unpredictable ways.} Another question is whether this also applies for value alignment in case of attempts to update an AI system's learned values or ethical principles.

These findings motivate our development of dissonance detection capabilities as a crucial safety mechanism for deployed AI systems. More broadly, they suggest we may need to fundamentally rethink AI architectures to develop systems that, like humans, maintain and contextualize potentially conflicting information rather than attempting to overwrite it. This might require moving away from current approaches that try to "edit" neural networks toward architectures that can accumulate and contextualize knowledge while maintaining multiple, temporally-organized versions of truth.
% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such  as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.

% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
%\nocite{langley00}
