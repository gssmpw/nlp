In this paper, we introduced a deterministic algorithm called DS-COD for AMM over sliding windows, providing rigorous error bounds and complexity analysis. For both the sequence-based and time-based models, we demonstrated that DS-COD achieves an optimal space-error tradeoff, matching the lower bounds we established. Additionally, we present an improved version of DS-COD with an adaptive adjustment mechanism, which shows excellent empirical performance. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the efficiency of our algorithms.
Notice that ~\citet{yao2024approximate} also studied sliding window AMM with sparse data. It would be an interesting future work to extend our methods to the sparse case.
%For future work, we aim to optimize the algorithm for sparse data and further improve its time complexity.
