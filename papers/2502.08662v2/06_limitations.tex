\section{Limitations}
Our method can utilize any kind of deterministic sorting algorithm, but we have only experimented with limited global sorting algorithms due to time and resource constraints. We plan to investigate potentially better sorting algorithms in the future.
Also, current ordering-invariant models are limited to inputs given as prefix + parallel + suffix. It would be beneficial to support more complex structures, such as ability to process multiple order-invariant contexts interleaved with serial text.
