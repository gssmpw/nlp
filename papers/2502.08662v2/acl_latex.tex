\section{Conclusion}

Our work addresses order-invariance in listwise inputs by identifying core issues in distribution mismatch and adaptive handling of mixed inputs. Our proposed RoToR provides a stable zero-shot order-invariant solution that reduces the complexity of positional ID modification, while \sr{} adaptively routes between invariant and sensitive LMs to handle real-world scenarios. Together, these methods demonstrate improved performance and reliability on LitM, KGQA, and MMLU benchmarks.
