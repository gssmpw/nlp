    \caption{A motivating example that shows cases of 1. Implicit queue (the table is ordered in recency) and 2. Explicit queue (Option C and D is dependent on the other options). In this case, we need to preserve the initial ordering, since the order contains information. It is only for the case of 3. Order invariant where we want the model to act in an order-invariant way. process the multiple choices independent of the other choices order.}
