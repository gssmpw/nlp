    \caption{Comparing the ordering of 5 segments (S1 - S5) of PINE~(\citealp{pine}; left) and \ours{} (Ours; right). PINE sorts segments using aggregated attention scores. In order to be fully ordering-invariant, segment sorting is changed per token in suffix level, causing confusion. In contrast, we define one global sorting of segments and conduct circular assignment between segments. With this, we simply use the global sorting for position id assignment on suffix tokens, without harming invariance.}
