    \caption{Illustration of ordering 7 rows by 2 different global sort options, (1) lexical sort based on token ids, or (2) reranking sort based on a reranker model (MonoT5-base in this case). (3) frequency based sorting applies lexical sorting, but the definitive token ids are mapped into the inverse frequency.}
