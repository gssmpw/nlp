    \caption{For example input \texttt{``Given Apple Banana Orange which one is most related to the color red? A: It is ...''}, demonstration of how PINE and RoToR (ours) modify the attention mask and positional IDs for each query-key combination, resulting in segment-wise order invariance. %For simplicity, tokenization is performed arbitrarily, not necessarily as in the real process.
    Assume each block represents a single token, and blocks are colored in positional ID assignment. White (no-block) area indicate masked attention.}
