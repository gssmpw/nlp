\begin{abstract}
In this paper we show that every combinatorial problem has an exact explicit equation that returns its solution. We present a method to obtain an equation that solves exactly any combinatorial problem, both inversion, constraint satisfaction and optimization, by obtaining its equivalent tensor network. This formulation only requires a basic knowledge of classical logical operators, at a first year level of any computer science degree. These equations are not necessarily computable in a reasonable time, nor do they allow to surpass the state of the art in computational complexity, but they allow to have a new perspective for the mathematical analysis of these problems. These equations computation can be approximated by different methods such as Matrix Product State compression. We also present the equations for numerous combinatorial problems. This work proves that, if there is a physical system capable of contracting in polynomial time the tensor networks presented, every NP-Hard problem can be solved in polynomial time.

\section{Conclusions}
We have shown that every combinatorial problem that can be defined by a classical logical circuit has an associated tensor network and an exact explicit equation that solves it. Furthermore, we have shown the explicit way of obtain the associated tensor networks of a large number of different combinatorial problems. A consequence is that, if exists a physical system that allows to calculate efficiently the contraction of these tensor networks, any combinatorial problem could be solved efficiently as well. That is, the contraction of the tensor network provides an upper limit to the computational complexity of solving a problem.

Further possible lines of research are to obtain the most efficient tensor network possible with this method, a more efficient method of extracting the maximal component in optimization, or the determination of the minimum $\tau$ value to obtain the correct solution. In addition, different problems not addressed in this paper can be tackled. Another possible line is the combination of this method with other algorithms, such as genetic algorithms or heuristics, to improve their computational complexity. It is also an interesting line to analyze these problems through the tensor network that solves them, in search of new unknown properties. A last possible line is the study of how to contract such tensor networks with a quantum system.
