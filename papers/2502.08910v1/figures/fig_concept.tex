    \caption{\textbf{Overview of \ours.} \textit{(a) Infinitely growing KV cache:} In \ours, the context keys and values are stored in a unified memory space, where some of the keys and values are loaded on GPU memory. \textit{(b) Configurable modular pruning:} Each pruning stage narrows down the candidate key indices based on the current query block. During pruning, if a cache miss is encountered, the missing tokens are dynamically loaded and the GPU cache is updated. \textit{(c) Paged block sparse attention:} The selected key indices are used to perform efficient paged block sparse attention.}
