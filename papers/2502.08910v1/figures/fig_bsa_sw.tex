\caption{\textbf{Visualization of Approximating Sliding Window with Block Sparse Attention.} (Left) Cropped generated block sparse mask from 13th layer from \cref{fig:layer_mask_example}. White pixels mean non-zero entries in the attention matrix, and black pixels mean masked-out pixels. (Right) Illustration of how sliding windows fail to be approximated by block sparse attention.}
