\section{Conclusion}

We systematically analyze the limitations of existing explainable recommendation methods and introduce \model, a novel model to address these challenges. The key design of our model involves leveraging a hybrid graph retrieval to extract explicit CF signals, employing knowledge pruning to filter out less relevant samples, and utilizing retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to integrate retrieved knowledge into explanation generation. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model. \model reveals great potential for graph retrieval-augmented generation in recommendation scenarios. Future work includes exploring fully training-free retrievers and investigating the transferability to other tasks.
