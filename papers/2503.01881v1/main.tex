% WARNING: Authors must not appear in the submitted version. They should be hidden

% Non-anonymous submissions will be rejected without review.

% Enter the author names below. 
% NOTE: Denote affiliations using superscripts as in the provided example.
% NOTE: Use \textscript{1,2,3} instead of $^{1,2,3}$.
%       - Failure to do so will cause affiliation superscripts to appear on the cover page for camera-ready and preprint versions.

% NOTE: For camera-ready and preprint versions, the cover page includes author names but not affiliations.
% It automatically removes the superscripts for affiliations.
% If the automatic process breaks (e.g., if an author name should include a superscript), you can manually define the author string to appear on the cover page by uncommenting the following line.

% Author affiliations, in the order the occur
% The inclusion of state/province, etc. is optional.
% The inclusion of multiple affiliations is optional.
%   - List multiple affiliations with comma-separated numbers as in the example.

\contribution{
    % Contribution
    Provide a succinct but precise list of the contribution(s) of the paper. Use contextual notes to avoid implications of contributions more significant than intended and to clarify and situate the contribution relative to prior work (see the examples below). If there is no additional context, enter ``None''. Try to keep each contribution to a single sentence, although multiple sentences are allowed when necessary. If using complete sentences, include punctuation. If using a single sentence fragment, you may omit the concluding period. A single contribution can be sufficient, and there is no limit on the number of contributions. Submissions will be judged mostly on the contributions claimed on their cover pages and the evidence provided to support them. Major contributions should not be claimed in the main text if they do not appear on the cover page. Overclaiming can lead to a submission being rejected, so it is important to have well-scoped contribution statements on the cover page.

\subsubsection*{Broader Impact Statement}

In this optional section, RLJ/RLC encourages authors to discuss possible repercussions of their work, notably any potential negative impact that a user of this research should be aware of.

%% Appendices

\appendix

\section{The first appendix}
\label{sec:appendix1}
This is an example of an appendix. 

\noindent \textbf{Note:} Appendices appear before the references and are viewed as part of the ``main text'' and are subject to the 8--12 page limit, are peer reviewed, and can contain content central to the claims of the paper. 

\section{The second appendix}
\label{sec:appendix2}
This is an example of a second appendix. If there is only a single section in the appendix, you may simply call it ``Appendix'' as follows:

\section*{Appendix}
% No label, since this can't be referenced meaningfully with \ref{}.
This format should only be used if there is a single appendix (unlike in this document).

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}
\label{sec:ack}
Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments, including those to funding agencies, go at the end of the paper. Only add this information once your submission is accepted and deanonymized. The acknowledgments do not count towards the 8--12 page limit.

\beginSupplementaryMaterials

Content that appears after the references are not part of the ``main text,'' have no page limits, are not necessarily reviewed, and should not contain any claims or material central to the paper. 
%
If your paper includes supplementary materials, use the \begin{center}
    {\tt {\textbackslash}beginSupplementaryMaterials} 
\end{center}
command as in this example, which produces the title and disclaimer above.

If your paper does not include supplementary materials, this command can be removed or commented out.
