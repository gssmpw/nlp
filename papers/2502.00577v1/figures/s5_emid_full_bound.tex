    \caption{\textbf{Scatter plot with regression line between empirical estimates of EMID and its upper bound.} Over the 34 synthetic and 27 natural distribution shift scenarios, we evaluate four MLLMs and get 136 cases and 108 cases of synthetic shifts and natural shifts, respectively, for visualizing EMID and upper bound estimates. The two panels on the left show results for all four models, whereas the right ones distinguish them per model with fitter linear regression coefficients (Slope).}
