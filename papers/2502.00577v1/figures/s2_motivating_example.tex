    \caption{\textbf{Performance variation against varying distribution shifts.} We evaluated LLaVA v1.5 (top) and LLaVA NeXT (bottom) models on 27 out-of-distribution (OOD) variants of the LLaVA-Bench COCO (ID). Here, the $x$-axis is sorted by the severity of shifts between ID and OOD. There is a consistent trend, increased degrees of distribution shifts result in performance degradations of MLLM.}
