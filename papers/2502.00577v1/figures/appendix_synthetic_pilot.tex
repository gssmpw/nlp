    \caption{\textbf{Performance variation against varying degrees of distribution shifts.} We evaluated LLaVA v1.5 and LLaVA NeXT models on 34 out-of-distribution (OOD) variants induced by image and text perturbations of the LLaVA-Bench COCO dataset (ID). Here, the $x$-axis is sorted by the severity of shifts between ID and OOD. There is a consistent trend -- increased degrees of distribution shifts result in performance degradations of MLLM.}
