    \caption{\textbf{Information diagram and motivation of effective mutual information.} The difference between vanilla MI terms does not consider the domain-dependent intrinsic scale and mutual information, thereby failing to fairly measure the relevance between input query $x$ and model prediction $\hat{y}$. Meanwhile, EMI ablates the domain-dependent characteristic to focus on measuring effective relevance between $x$ and $\hat{y}$.}
