\section{Empirical Validation on Real Benchmark} \label{sec:benchmark}


\paragraph{Setup.} As done in the pilot experiments (Figure \ref{fig:pilot_study} and \ref{fig:pilot_study_synthetic}), we used LLaVA v1.5 \cite{liu2024improved} and LLaVA NeXT \cite{liu2024llavanext} in 7B and 13B sizes and evaluated them on the LLaVA-Bench COCO and LLaVA-Bench Wild \cite{liu2023visual} datasets for assessing open-ended generation. To comprehensively examine diverse types of shifts, we further simulate synthetic distribution shifts as well as natural distribution shifts. For synthetic shifts, we consider 7 visual scenarios (1 ID case $+$ 2 synthetic perturbation types at 3 severity levels), and 5 text scenarios (1 ID case $+$ 2 synthetic perturbation types at 2 severity levels), resulting in $7 \times5 = 35$ synthetic scenarios, where 1 scenario is ID and the other 34 are OOD cases.
For natural shifts, we use 4 visual scenarios (1 ID + 3 OOD difficulty levels) and 7 text scenarios (1 ID-English $+$ 6 languages), yielding $4 \times 7 = 28$ natural scenarios. \textbf{This comprehensive design covers a total of 34 synthetic and 27 natural shifts}.
A summary of the OOD construction strategies is in Table \ref{tab:shift_scenarios}.

\paragraph{Estimation of MI and JSD.} 
For the empirical realization of our theoretical statements, we adopt a popular neural estimator for MI, CLUB \cite{cheng2020club} to compute empirical EMID, and a JS divergence estimator, RJSD \cite{hoyos2023representation}, to compute empirical EMID and its upper-bound (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:implementation_details} for details). Experiments with 23 alternative implementations derived consistent conclusions (Please refer to Table \ref{tab:ablation_emiwr} and \ref{tab:ablation_emidup}).

\paragraph{Correlation between win rate and EMI.}
We first conduct the Spearman correlation analysis and Kendall's tau analysis between the win rate and our empirical estimates of EMI. In Table \ref{tab:wr_emi_corr}, we can see that EMI estimates exhibit a strong correlation with win rate, both in terms of absolute coefficient and $p$-value, across all models. This empirical evidence validates the theoretical connection between EMI and win rate discussed in Theorem \ref{Main-thm1-thm}. Therefore, our EMI can be used as a reliable and cost-efficient alternative to win rate for MLLM evaluation with theoretical guarantees.

\paragraph{Verification of bound.} We now validate our main Theorem. Figure \ref{fig:emid_ub_scatter} (left two) shows the scatter plots comparing EMID with its upper bound across four models, each evaluated over 34 and 27 synthetic and natural distribution shifts. We see a clear trend between EMID and its upper bound in the synthetic shift where we could directly control the severity of shifts. While the natural shift setup is noisier, a similar overall trend is observed. Meanwhile, our bounds depend on the distributional discrepancy between the model's response $\hat{y}$ and the ground truth response $y$. Thus, they naturally induce different bounds for each MLLM. The right panel of Figure \ref{fig:emid_ub_scatter} presents model-wise plots with linear regression coefficients, where we observe that each model has a different degree of performance sensitivity against shifts. Pearson correlation analysis results in Table \ref{tab:emid_ub_pearson} further confirm statistically significant correlations between EMID and its upper bound, supporting the validity of the theorem.

\paragraph{Partial bound analysis.} It is common that we can not access the ground truth response $Y$ from our evaluation dataset in advance. Then, one may want to use the EMID upper bound as an estimator of the maximum risk of MLLM given two datasets, i.e., $\max \text{EMID}(P_{\mathbf{X}Y},Q_{\mathbf{X}Y};\theta)$, by neglecting the output-related term $\Delta$. In Figure \ref{fig:emid_partialub_scatter}, we investigate whether the summation of two JS divergence terms can still be predictive for EMID. Although the trends become loose compared to the full bound due to the non-optimality of MLLM parameters, the partial upper bound still has moderate correlations (denoted by Pearson $r$) with EMID.
