\section*{Impact Statement}
This work lays the first theoretical foundation for quantifying the reliability of MLLMs. The theoretical statements we made shine the light on analyzing the MLLM performance gap under distribution shifts which commonly emerged in real-world applications. Our framework can help aware of the potential risk, i.e., performance variation, of MLLMs, and guide the practitioners to devise a method towards robust adaptation for chat assistants, thereby ensuring the trustworthiness of artificial intelligence solutions in crucial social applications such as finance and healthcare.
