\section{Threats to Validity}\label{sec:threats_validity}
Threats to \textbf{construct validity} include concerns over the test ratio in automated analysis compared to test coverage, due to the complexity of components and environments. Traceability issues on some platforms obscure links between test and functional code. To address this, we combined quantitative analysis with manual inspection by two authors, providing insights into developers' testing intentions, supported by survey responses.


Threats to \textbf{internal validity} refer to the representativeness of the randomly selected tests at the labeling process and reported components.  
We sorted the \addons and components to identify the largest number of focal methods and focal test methods. We calculate the z-score on our test file sampling and manual inspection to achieve the 95\% confidence.




Another potential internal validity of our study lies in the subjectivity inherent in the manual analysis of test codes. To address this, we adopt a paired analysis approach, where analyses are conducted collaboratively.  This helps us minimize individual biases. To avoid misdirection while individual coding, we conduct our analysis in multiple phases. We observed a substantial decrease in disagreement rates as we progressed through the latter phases of analysis.
