\subsection{Traditional and ML-Based CD}  

Traditional CD methods have been extensively studied in remote sensing, with early approaches relying on simple algebraic operations such as image differencing **Jensen, "Spatial Autocorrelation Measures"** and image ratioing ____.
These techniques compute pixel-level differences or ratios between two images and apply a threshold to identify change regions. 
Subsequent advancements introduced improved thresholding strategies, such as the Otsu method **Otsu, "A Threshold Selection Method from Gray-Level Histograms"** and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) algorithm ____ to enhance detection accuracy.
Transform-based methods, such as PCA ____ and MAD ____ were later adopted, leveraging statistical properties of images.
However, these methods are heavily dependent on image statistics, which limits their scalability and precision in large-scale, high-resolution CD applications.  
The advent of machine learning has significantly enhanced the ability to extract useful change features.
For instance, Bovolo et al. **Bovolo, "Change Detection in Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Images by Hidden Markov Chain Models"** proposed an unsupervised change detection framework that leverages a semi-supervised SVM initialized with pseudo-training data, effectively addressing the complexity of multi-temporal spectral feature analysis.
Wessels et al. **Wessels, "Automated Change Detection in Very High Resolution Optical Satellite Images Using Regression Trees"** developed an automated system for land cover update mapping, integrating iteratively reweighted MAD (IRMAD) for change mask generation and RF classifiers for robust land cover classification, achieving notable accuracy in operational settings.
Despite these advancements, traditional and early ML-based approaches often rely on manually designed features, which perform well in straightforward scenarios but exhibit limited generalization capability for complex and diverse change types.
