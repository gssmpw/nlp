% \section{Discussion}  

% This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the architecture for the \digit platform, integrating predictive modeling, simulations, and automated workflows to address real-time traffic management challenges. The architecture employs the DCM to represent key components, such as vehicles, sensors, and communication networks, ensuring seamless data flow between physical and digital systems. Predictive models, trained on real-world traffic data, captured temporal patterns and provided short-term forecasts validated against observed data. Simulations, implemented through the \textit{DT Manager}, leveraged these outputs to replicate traffic conditions and test strategies, such as rerouting and adaptive signal timing, achieving an average prediction time of 7 ms. The architecture extends beyond predictive modeling by supporting modular and scalable integration of advanced modeling and simulation techniques. Its flexibility allows incorporation of reinforcement learning, hybrid simulations, and edge-cloud computing frameworks, enabling robust and distributed processing capabilities. Additionally, the system supports generalization to diverse traffic scenarios, making it applicable to urban, highway, and mixed-mode transportation networks. The results validate the platformâ€™s ability to provide actionable insights through predictive modeling and simulations, demonstrating its adaptability and computational efficiency for traffic optimization tasks.
