\subsection{Personal Data and Data Representation}
Representing data in a new, alternative form is the most well-known strategy for supporting the sensemaking of personal data **Epstein et al., "Location-Based Services: A Survey"**. In the context of personal informatics **Roussel et al., "Understanding Personal Informatics"**, previous works have offered insights into how the visualization of users’ tracking data can facilitate understanding and making sense of their data **Wang et al., "Visualizing Physical Activity Data for Health Promotion"**. Epstein et al. **Epstein et al., "Visualization Formats for Location and Activity Data"** investigated various visualization formats for location and activity data aiming to support data sensemaking, such as tables, graphs, captions, and other forms.

Beyond such traditional visualization methods, researchers have also suggested alternative approaches using visual metaphors or abstract forms for data representation **Kim et al., "Casual Information Visualization: A Survey"**. A notable example is \textit{casual information visualization} **Kucher, "Information Visualization Beyond Conventional Methods"}, which is known to generate reflective insights through representing data in artistic forms. In the field of personal informatics, there have been attempts to encode personal data in qualitative and subjective ways through metaphors and abstract imagery. For example, Ayobi et al. **Ayobi et al., "Data Representation through Paper Bullet Journaling"** explored how people represent data through personally meaningful ways and promote self-reflection through paper bullet journaling. Kim et al. **Kim et al., "DataSelfie: A System for Customized Data Visualization"** developed a system \textit{DataSelfie} that allows users to represent personal data in customized visual forms, motivated by the \textit{Dear Data Project} **Lupi and Posavec, "The Dear Data Project"** in which  Lupi and Posavec created and shared personalized visualizations of data through hand-drawn postcards. Also, Murnane et al. **Murnane et al., "Narrating Physical Activities and Goals: A Design Approach"** translated physical activities and goals into multi-chapter narratives, thereby encouraging users to engage with their fitness goals by fostering empathy and enhancing their self-reflection. Another body of works also explored the transformation of personal data into tangible forms, known as \textit{data physicalization}, that enables individuals to engage in a meaning-making process of their data **Chen et al., "Data Physicalization: A Survey"**.

Collectively, these works have shown how an \textbf{unusual and ambiguous representation of data} can foster new, context-rich reflection experiences and data meaning-making **Mols et al., "Ambiguous Data Representation for Reflection"}, diverging from the quality of reflection that conventional statistical representations enable. Building on this, we aim to explore how images generated by AI can facilitate new types of data experience. Abstract images are a typical form of visual representation that invites people to engage in reflection **Dourish et al., "Reflective Engagement with Artworks"**, and prior research has also explored the design space of reflective engagement with artworks **Mols et al., "Designing Reflective Experiences through Artworks"}. In previous HCI studies, ambiguous representation of data have been shown to provide individuals new perspectives, serving as a resource that facilitates reflective thinking **Trujillo-Pisanty et al., "Ambiguous Data Representation for Reflection"**. For example, Mols et al. **Mols et al., "DataZen: A System for Ambiguous Data Representation"** demonstrated that ambiguous data representation can serve as a strategy for enabling reflection, as illustrated by concepts such as \textit{DataZen}, which creates sand patterns from activity, stress, and wellbeing data, and \textit{Life Tree}, an interactive art piece representing patterns of activity, social, and health data, situating this approach within the design space for everyday life reflection. Trujillo-Pisanty et al. **Trujillo-Pisanty et al., "Facial Recognition and Reflection"** created a new representation of online presence by extracting and amalgamating faces from Facebook photos using algorithms, thereby enabling reflection on personal and family representations. With the recent advances in image-generative AI technologies, these possibilities have expanded, making it possible to represent personal data in ambiguous forms **Brand et al., "Introspective AI"** with the design of tailored prompts, as their potential to serve as a design material has been highlighted **Kang and Odom, "Quologue: A System for Synthesizing E-book Highlights and User Reflections"}. Despite this potential, research on how AI-generated images using personal data can facilitate personal data meaning-making remains scarce, which has motivated our current work.

\subsection{AI as a Material for Reflection and Meaning-Making}
With the recent advance in generative AI technology, a growing body of research has begun investigating how AI-generated media can be leveraged to facilitate people’s reflections on data. For instance, along with their conceptualization of \textit{Introspective AI} **Brand et al., "Introspective AI"**, Brand et al. **Brand et al., "Dream Streams: A System for Representing Dreams through Images"** have speculated a concept called \textit{Dream Streams} that represents people’s dreams in images based on sleep monitoring data and audio journaling. Also, Fan et al. **Fan et al., "ContextCam: A System for Generating Context-Aware Images"** have suggested \textit{ContextCam}, which generates images with the themes extracted from contextual data. \textit{Quologue}, proposed by Kang and Odom **Kang and Odom, "Quilogue: A System for Synthesizing E-book Highlights and User Reflections"**, creates outputs that synthesize e-book highlights with users’ reflections using generative AI. Cho et al. **Cho et al., "ARECA: An IoT-Based Air Purifier that Transforms Data into Diary Entries"** have designed \textit{ARECA}, an IoT-based air purifier that turns the data collected from the surrounding environment into diary entries using generative AI. Rajcic and McCormack **Rajcic and McCormack, "Machine-Generated Poetry for Reflection"** investigated how machine-generated poetry based on a user’s emotions extracted from facial expressions can provoke reflection.

Collectively, these prior studies illustrate the potential of generative AI to \textbf{transform data into new forms, creating reflective materials} **Kang and Odom, "Quologue: A System for Synthesizing E-book Highlights and User Reflections"** that can provoke new meaning-making around the data. Our work extends this corpus of studies, and in particular, we build on Brand et al.’s work **Brand et al., "Introspective AI"** that have demonstrated that AI can be utilized as a resource for supporting introspective experiences. Our paper focuses specifically on the ‘image-generative’ aspect of AI, delving deeper into what kinds of attributes of image-generative AI should be handled in order to facilitate a new quality of meaning-making from data. Also, building on Wan et al.’s work **Wan et al., "Co-Creative Narration Systems"** on developing co-creative narration systems that transform dreams into visual metaphors, our work also investigates how various types of personal data, including qualitative and abstract forms, can be represented as images and what kinds of experiences can arise from such visual representations.
