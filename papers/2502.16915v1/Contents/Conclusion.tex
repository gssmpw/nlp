\section{Conclusion}
AIGC is currently a hot research topic, and text-to-3D asset generation is an important part in this field. This paper contributes to the first study of text-to-3D asset quality assessment, which is a significant achievement to the area. Specifically, this paper addresses this problem by introducing the largest T23DAQA database to date, named AIGC-T23DAQA. Subsequently, a novel projection-based evaluator for better text-to-3D asset quality assessment, which leverages a 3D encoder, two 2D encoders, and multi-modality foundation models to extract 3D shape features, texture features, and text 3D asset correspondence features from projection videos and fuses to generate preference scores from the perspectives of quality, authenticity, and text-asset correspondence. Experimental results underscore the superiority of our proposed T23DAQA method, surpassing state-of-the-art NR-IQA, NR-VQA, NR-MQA, and NR-PCQA, LMMQA, T2IQA, T2VQA models. Ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed submodule.
