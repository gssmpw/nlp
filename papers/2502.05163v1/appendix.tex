\section{Theoretical Analysis}\label{app:proof}
In this section, we provide a detailed theoretical analysis about our two-player minimax game framework.
\subsection{Minimizer of Loss}
First of all, we derive the solution of the optimization objectives defined in Equations \eqref{eq:update_classifier} and \eqref{eq:population_dpo}.
\subsubsection{Generator}
Recall that the corresponding PPO training objective of DPO objective \eqref{eq:population_dpo} is:
\begin{align}
    & L_{\text{PPO}}^t(\bphi,\bphi_{\text{ref}}) = \EE_{(\xb,y)\sim\rho(\xb,y)}  \big[ \EE_{\tilde{\xb}\sim p_{\bphi}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y)}[r_t(\xb, \tilde{\xb})] - \beta D_{\text{KL}}(p_{\bphi} | p_{\text{ref}}) \big],\label{eq:ppo}
\end{align}
where $\rho(\xb,y)$ is the data distribution and $r_t((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}) = - \log p_{\btheta_t}(y|\tilde{\xb})$ is the reward function defined in \eqref{eq:reward}. We will show that the DPO objective \eqref{eq:population_dpo} and the PPO objective~\ref{eq:ppo} shares the same minimizer. \citet{azar2024general} provided the following connection between the PPO and DPO objectives.
\begin{proposition}[Proposition 4 in \citet{azar2024general}]\label{prop:same_minimizer}
Let the DPO training objective be 
\begin{align*}
    L_{\text{DPO}}(\bphi, \bphi_{\text{ref}}) = \EE_{\xb\sim\rho}\EE_{\yb_w, \yb_l \sim \mu(\cdot|\xb)} \bigg[ \PP(\yb_w \succ \yb_l | \xb) 
 \ell\bigg(\beta \log \frac{p_{\bphi}(\yb_w | \xb)}{p_{\bphi_{\text{ref}}}(\yb_w | \xb)} - \beta \log \frac{p_{\bphi}(\yb_l | \xb)}{p_{\bphi_{\text{ref}}}(\yb_l | \xb)}\bigg)\bigg],
\end{align*}
and the RLHF training objective be
\begin{align*}
    & L_{\text{PPO}}(\bphi,\bphi_{\text{ref}}) = \EE_{\xb\sim\rho(\xb)}{\EE_{\yb \sim p_{\bphi}(\cdot|\xb)}[r(\yb, \xb)]} - {\beta D_{\text{KL}}(p_{\bphi} | p_{\text{ref}})}.
\end{align*}
    Consider a preference model \( p^* \) such that there exists a minimizer to the Bradley-Terry loss
\[
\arg\min_r - \mathbb{E}_{\xb \sim \rho} \mathbb{E}_{\yb_w, \yb_l \sim \mu(\cdot | \xb)} \left[ p^*(\yb_w \succ \yb_l | \xb) \log \sigma(r(\xb, \yb_w) - r(\xb, \yb_l)) \right].
\]
Then, the optimal policy for the DPO objective and for the RLHF objective with the reward model given as the minimizer to the Bradley-Terry loss above are identical, regardless of whether or not \( p^* \) corresponds to a Bradley-Terry preference model.
\end{proposition}

Therefore, we only need to show that the reward function is the minimizer of the Bradley-Terry loss.
\begin{lemma}\label{lm:minimize_r}
Let $\sigma$ be the sigmoid function and $p^* (\tilde{\xb}_{w} \succ \tilde{\xb}_{l} |\xb,y ) = \sigma\bigl(r^*((\xb,y),\tilde{\xb}_w)-r^*((\xb,y),\tilde{\xb}_l)\bigr) $. Then, we have
\begin{align*}
    \argmin_{r} \mathbb{E}_{\substack{(\xb,y) \sim \rho(\xb,y) \\ \tilde{\xb}_w, \tilde{\xb}_l \sim p_{\phi_n}(\cdot | \xb, y)}} \bigg[ -p^* (\tilde{\xb}_{w} \succ \tilde{\xb}_{l} |\xb,y ) \log\sigma\big(r((\xb,y) \tilde{\xb}_w) - r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_l)\big) \bigg] = r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}) + c(\xb,y).
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lm:minimize_r}]
The objective can be viewed as a cross-entropy between the distribution \(p^*(\tilde{\xb}_w \succ \tilde{\xb}_l \mid \xb, y)\) and \(\sigma\bigl(r((\xb,y),\tilde{\xb}_w)-r((\xb,y),\tilde{\xb}_l)\bigr)\). In particular, the objective depends only on the difference \(r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_w) - r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_l)\). Hence the value of the objective doesn't change if we replace \(r\) by $\tilde{r}((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb})\;=\;r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}) + c(\xb,y)$. The function \(p^* (\tilde{\xb}_{w} \succ \tilde{\xb}_{l} |\xb,y )\) is given by the sigmoid 
\[
p^* (\tilde{\xb}_{w} \succ \tilde{\xb}_{l} |\xb,y ) \;=\;\sigma\bigl(r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_w) - r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_l))\bigr).
\]
Minimizing the cross-entropy is achieved exactly when
\[
\sigma\bigl(r((\xb,y) \tilde{\xb}_w) - r((\xb,y) \tilde{\xb}_l)\bigr)
\;=\;
\sigma\bigl(r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_w) - r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_l)\bigr)
\]
for all \(\xb, \tilde{\xb}_w, \tilde{\xb}_l, y\). Since the sigmoid is strictly increasing, we have
\[
r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_w) - r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_l) \;=\; r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_w) - r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}_l).
\]
The solution is 
\[
r((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}) \;=\; r^*((\xb,y), \tilde{\xb}) + c(\xb,y).
\]
\end{proof}

Then, by Proposition~\ref{prop:same_minimizer} and Lemma~\ref{lm:minimize_r}, the DPO objective \eqref{eq:population_dpo} shares the same minimizer with its corresponding PPO training objective~\eqref{eq:ppo}. In addition, according to \citet{rafailov2023direct}, the minimizer is
\begin{align*}
    p_{\phi_{n+1}}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) = \frac{1}{Z(\xb,y)}{p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) \exp(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta_{n}}(y|\tilde{\xb})] )} \propto  p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) \exp(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta_{n}}(y|\tilde{\xb})] ), 
\end{align*}
where $Z(\xb,y) = \mathbb{E}_{\tilde{\xb}\sim p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb} |\xb,y)} \exp(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta_{n}}(y|\tilde{\xb})] )$ is the normalization term.
\subsubsection{Classifier}
Next, we will derive the solution to the objective~\eqref{eq:update_classifier}. We first prove a tool lemma.
\begin{lemma}\label{lm:mle}
    Let $p(y,\tilde{\xb})$ be a joint distribution over $(y,\tilde{\xb})$. Then
    \begin{align*}
        \max_q \EE_{(y,\tilde{\xb}) \sim p(y,\tilde{\xb})} \big[ \log q(y | \tilde{\xb}) \big] = - H[p(y | \tilde{\xb})],
    \end{align*}
    and the maximizer is $q^*(y | \tilde{\xb}) = p(y | \tilde{\xb}) $. Here, H is the entropy.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lm:mle}]
\begin{align*}
    \begin{aligned}
        L(q) & = \EE_{(y,\tilde{\xb}) \sim p(y,\tilde{\xb})} \big[ \log q(y | \tilde{\xb}) \big] \\
        & = \EE_{p(\tilde{\xb})}  \big[ \EE_{(y|\tilde{\xb}) \sim p(y,\tilde{\xb})} \big[ \log q(y | \tilde{\xb}) \big]\big] \\
        & = \EE_{p(\tilde{\xb})}  \big[ \EE_{(y|\tilde{\xb}) \sim p(y,\tilde{\xb})} \big[ \log p(y | \tilde{\xb}) \big] - D_{\text{KL}} (p(y | \tilde{\xb}) || q(y | \tilde{\xb}))\big] \\
        & \le \EE_{p(\tilde{\xb})}  \big[ \EE_{(y|\tilde{\xb}) \sim p(y,\tilde{\xb})} \big[ \log p(y | \tilde{\xb}) \big] \big],
    \end{aligned}
\end{align*}
    and the last equity holds if and only if $p(y | \tilde{\xb}) =  q(y | \tilde{\xb})$.
\end{proof}
Then, we can calculate the minimizer of \eqref{eq:update_classifier}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lm:nll_minimizer}
    ${\int \rho(\xb, y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb} \Big{/}{\int \rho(\xb,y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb dy}$ is the minimizer to the following optimization problem:
    \begin{align*}
        \argmin_q  \mathbb{E}_{\substack{(\xb,y) \sim \rho(\xb,y) \\ \tilde{\xb} \sim p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb, y)}} \big[- \log q (y|\tilde{\xb}) \big].
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{lm:nll_minimizer}]
    The joint distribution of $(y,\tilde{\xb})$ is 
    \begin{align*}
        p(y,\tilde{\xb}) = \int \rho(\xb, y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb,
    \end{align*}
    and the marginal distribution of $\tilde \xb$ is
    \begin{align*}
        p(\tilde{\xb}) = \int \rho(\xb,y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb dy.
    \end{align*}
    We can restate the optimization problem as 
    \begin{align*}
        \argmax_{q} \EE_{(y,\tilde{\xb}) \sim p(y,\tilde{\xb})}  \big[\log q (y|\tilde{\xb}) \big].
    \end{align*} 
    By Lemma~\ref{lm:mle}, the solution is 
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{aligned}
            q (y|\tilde{\xb}) 
            = p(y | \tilde{\xb})
            = \frac{p(y , \tilde{\xb})}{p(\tilde{\xb})}
            = \frac{\int \rho(\xb, y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb}{\int \rho(\xb,y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb dy}.
        \end{aligned}
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
Therefore, for the classifier, by Lemma~\ref{lm:nll_minimizer}, we have
\begin{align*}
    p_{\theta_{n+1}}(y | \tilde{\xb}) = \argmin_{q}   \mathbb{E}_{\substack{(\xb,y) \sim \rho(\xb,y) \\ \tilde{\xb} \sim p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb,y)}} [-\log q (y|\tilde{\xb})] = \frac{\int \rho(\xb, y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb}{\int \rho(\xb,y)  p_{\phi_n}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y) d\xb dy}.
\end{align*}
In a two player game perspective, $p_{\theta_{n+1}}$ can be viewed as the best response to $p_{\phi_{n}}$, and $p_{\phi_{n+1}}$ can be viewed as the best response to $p_{\theta_{n}}$.  For simplicity, we denote that $p_{\theta_{n+1}}= T_{\theta}(p_{\phi_n})$ and $p_{\phi_{n+1}}= T_{\phi}(p_{\theta_n})$.

\subsection{Nash Equilibrium}
\subsubsection{Setup}
In our two-player game framework, we indeed optimize the following minimax two player game:
\begin{align*}
    \min_\theta \max_\phi F(p_{\phi}, p_{\theta}) :=  \EE_{(\xb,y)\sim\rho(\xb,y)} \big[ \EE_{\tilde{\xb}\sim p_{\bphi}(\tilde{\xb} | \xb, y)}[- \log p_{\btheta_t}(y|\tilde{\xb})] - \beta D_{\text{KL}}(p_{\bphi}(\cdot|\xb,y) || p_{\text{ref}}(\cdot|\xb,y)) \big],
\end{align*}
% and the min-max game is
% \begin{align*}
%     \min_\theta \max_\phi F(p_{\phi}, p_{\theta}).
% \end{align*}
We observe that $F(p_{\phi}, p_{\theta})$ is concave on $p_{\phi}$ since the first term is linear in $p_{\phi}$ and $D_{\text{KL}}(p_{\phi} || p_{\text{ref}})$ is convex in $p_{\phi}$. In addition, $F(p_{\phi}, p_{\theta})$ is convex in $p_\theta$ since $\log$ is a concave function.
\begin{theorem}[Von Neumann's Minimax Theorem]
Let \( X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \) and \( Y \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m \) be {compact convex} sets. If \( f: X \times Y \to \mathbb{R} \) is a continuous function that is concave-convex, i.e.
\[
f(\cdot, y): X \to \mathbb{R} \text{ is } {\text{concave}} \text{ for every fixed } y \in Y, \text{ and}
\]
\[
f(x, \cdot): Y \to \mathbb{R} \text{ is } {\text{convex}} \text{ for every fixed } x \in X.
\]
Then, we have that
\[
\max_{x \in X} \min_{y \in Y} f(x, y) = \min_{y \in Y} \max_{x \in X} f(x, y).
\]

\end{theorem}
By Von Neumann's Minimax Theorem, we have 
\begin{align*}
    \min_{p_{\btheta}} \max_{p_{\bphi}} F(p_{\phi}, p_{\theta}) = \max_{p_{\bphi}} \min_{p_{\btheta}}  F(p_{\phi}, p_{\theta}).
\end{align*}
We further enforce the following regularity conditions:
\begin{itemize} \item Both $\mathcal{X}$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{X}}$ are finite discrete sets of tokens, with $|\mathcal{X}| = X < \infty$ and $|\tilde{\mathcal{X}}| = \tilde{X} < \infty$. \item We constrain $p_\theta$ within a half-space of the Euclidean space, ensuring $p_\theta(y|\xb) \ge \gamma > 0$. \item The normalization term of the generator distribution is strictly positive:
    \[\sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde\xb|\xb,y) \exp\big(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta}(y|\tilde{\xb})] \big) \ge \delta > 0.\]
\item The distribution $p_\phi$ is non-degenerate, i.e., $ \sum_{y=\pm 1}\sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb, y) p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) \ge \alpha >0$.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Existence of Nash Equilibrium}
% A Nash equilibrium $(p^*_{\theta}, p^*_{\phi})$ is a fixed point of the update, meaning that $p^*_{\theta}$ is the best response to $p^*_{\phi}$ and that $p^*_{\theta}$ is the best response to $p^*_{\phi}$.
We will first show that a Nash equilibrium exists in the two-player game. A Nash equilibrium in this game is a state where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy, assuming that the other player keeps their strategy fixed. Since our update rules correspond to the best response to the opponent’s policy, the existence of a Nash equilibrium is equivalent to our updating rule having a fixed point.

Let $\Delta(\mathcal{S})$ mean the set of probability distribution over the set $\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, the $p_\theta$ amounts to choosing a element from space
$\Theta = \prod_{\tilde \xb \in \tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \Delta(\{\pm 1\})$,
which is a compact and convex set in $\RR^{2 \tilde{X}}$. Similarly, $p_\phi$ is a element in 
$ \Phi = \prod_{(\xb,y) \in \mathcal{X} \times \{\pm1\}} \Delta(\tilde{\mathcal{X}})$,
which is a compact and convex set in $\RR^{2 X \tilde X}$. Hence, the joint parameter space is $\Psi = \Theta \times \Phi$, which is a compact, convex subset of the $\RR^{2 \tilde{X} +  2 X \tilde X}$. For simplicity, we also write $\psi = (\phi, \theta)$. We define a mapping $T$ to represent our update rule:
\begin{align*}
    T&: \Psi  \rightarrow \Psi \\
    T(p_\theta, p_\phi) & = (T_\theta(p_{\phi}), T_\phi(p_{\theta})).
\end{align*}
Thus, $T$ is a continuous map from the compact convex set $\Psi$ into itself.
\begin{theorem}[Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem]
    Every continuous function from a nonempty convex compact subset K of a Euclidean space to K itself has a fixed point.
\end{theorem}
By the Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, there is $(p^*_{\theta}, p^*_{\phi}) \in \Psi$ such that
\begin{align*}
    T(p^*_{\theta}, p^*_{\phi}) = (p^*_{\theta}, p^*_{\phi}).
\end{align*}
By definition of T, this means that
\begin{align*}
    p^*_{\theta} = T_{\theta}(p^*_{\phi}), \qquad p^*_{\phi} = T_{\phi}(p^*_{\theta}),
\end{align*}
since that $T_\theta$ and $T_\phi$ are both best response to the opponent's policy, $(p^*_{\theta}, p^*_{\phi})$ is indeed the Nash equilibrium.

\subsubsection{Convergence to Nash Equilibrium}
In this section, we first show that both $T_\theta$ and $T_\phi$ are Lipschitz, and then we prove that our algorithm converges to the fixed point. 

\textbf{Lipschitz Mapping $T_\phi$.} Recall that
\begin{align*}
    T_\phi(p_\theta)(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) = \frac{p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) \exp(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta_{n}}(y|\tilde{\xb})] )}{\sum_{\tilde{\xb}} p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb} |\xb,y) \exp(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta_{n}}(y|\tilde{\xb})] )}.
\end{align*}
Let $g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) = \exp\big(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta}(y|\tilde{\xb})] \big)$, by the regularity conditions, we have
\begin{align*}
    \bigg|\frac{\partial g_\theta (\tilde\xb,y)}{\partial p_\theta(y | \tilde{\xb})}\bigg|  = \Big|\beta^{-1} \big( p_\theta(y|\xb)\big)^{-1}\exp\big(\beta^{-1} [-\log p_{\theta}( y|\tilde{\xb})] \big)\Big| 
    \le \beta^{-1} \gamma^{-1-\beta^{-1}}.
\end{align*}
This leads to that
\begin{align*}
    |g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) - g_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,y)| \le \beta^{-1} \gamma^{-1-\beta^{-1}} |p_\theta(y|\tilde\xb) - p_{\theta'}(y|\tilde\xb)|.
\end{align*}
We rewrite 
\begin{align*}
    T_\phi(p_\theta)(\tilde\xb|\xb,y) = \frac{N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_\theta(\xb,y)},\text{ where }N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)=p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y),\quad D_\theta(\xb, y) = \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y).
\end{align*}

Then, we have
\begin{align*}
    & \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}}|T_\phi(p_\theta) - T_\phi(p_{\theta'})|(\tilde\xb|\xb,y) \\
    & = \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \bigg| \frac{N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} - \frac{N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_{\theta'}(\xb,y)} \bigg| \\
    & = \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \bigg| \frac{N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} - \frac{N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} + \frac{N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_\theta(\xb,y)}- \frac{N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)}{D_{\theta'}(\xb,y)} \bigg| \\
    & \le \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \frac{|N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) - N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) |}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} + \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} |N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) | \bigg|\frac{1}{D_{\theta}(\xb,y)} - \frac{1}{D_{\theta'}(\xb,y)}\bigg| \\
    & = \frac{1}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} {|N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) - N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) |} + \frac{D_{\theta'}(\xb,y)}{D_{\theta}(\xb,y) D_{\theta'}(\xb,y)}\bigg|  D_{\theta'}(\xb,y) - D_{\theta}(\xb,y)\bigg| \\
    & = \frac{1}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} \Big( \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} {|N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) - N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) |} +  \Big|  D_{\theta'}(\xb,y) - D_{\theta}(\xb,y)\Big| \Big).
\end{align*}
And we have
\begin{align*}
|N_\theta(\tilde\xb,\xb,y) - N_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,\xb,y)| \le     p_{\text{ref}}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)|g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) - g_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,y)| \le |g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) - g_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,y)|,\\
|D_{\theta'}(\xb,y) -  D_\theta(\xb,y) | \le \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} p_{\text{ref}} (\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)|g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) - g_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,y)|  \le \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} |g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) - g_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,y)|.
\end{align*}
In addition, by the regularity conditions, we have that
\begin{align*}
    & \sum_{\xb\in\mathcal{X}} \sum_{y=\pm 1} \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}}|T_\phi(p_\theta) - T_\phi(p_{\theta'})|(\tilde\xb|\xb, y) \\ 
    &\le \sum_{\xb\in\mathcal{X}}  \sum_{y=\pm 1} \frac{2}{D_\theta(\xb,y)} \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} |g_\theta(\tilde\xb,y) - g_{\theta'}(\tilde\xb,y)|\\
    &\le \sum_{\xb\in\mathcal{X}}  \sum_{y=\pm 1} \frac{2}{\delta} \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \beta^{-1} \gamma^{-1-\beta^{-1}} |p_\theta(y|\tilde\xb) - p_{\theta'}(y|\tilde\xb)| \\
    & = 2 \delta^{-1} \beta^{-1} \gamma^{-1-\beta^{-1}} |\mathcal{X}|\sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \sum_{y \in 
    \mathcal{Y}}|p_\theta(y|\tilde\xb) - p_{\theta'}(y|\tilde\xb)|.
\end{align*}
This means that 
\begin{align*}
    \|T_\phi(p_\theta) - T_\phi(p_{\theta'}) \|_1 \le 2 \delta^{-1} \beta^{-1} \gamma^{-1-\beta^{-1}} |\mathcal{X}| \| p_\theta - p_{\theta'} \|_1.
\end{align*}

\textbf{Lipschitz Mapping $T_{\btheta}$.} Recall that 
\begin{align*}
    T_\theta(p_\phi)(y|\tilde{\xb}) = \frac{\sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb, y)  p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)}{ \sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \sum_{y=\pm1}\rho(\xb, y)  p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)}.
\end{align*}
Denote that
\begin{align*}
    T_\theta(p_\phi)(y|\tilde{\xb}) = \frac{N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb})}{D_\phi (\tilde{\xb})},\text{ where } N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb}) = \sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb, y) p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y),\quad D_\phi (\tilde{\xb}) = \sum_{y = \pm 1} N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb}).
\end{align*}
Then,
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}| T_\theta(p_\phi) - T_\theta(p_{\phi'}) |(y|\tilde{\xb}) & = \sum_{y =\pm 1} \bigg| \frac{N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb})}{D_\phi (\tilde{\xb})} -  \frac{N_{\phi'}(y,\tilde{\xb})}{D_{\phi'} (\tilde{\xb})}  \bigg| \\
    & \le \frac{1}{D_\phi (\tilde{\xb})}\bigg( \sum_{y=\pm1}\Big|N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb}) -  N_{\phi'}(y,\tilde{\xb})\Big| + \Big|D_\phi (\tilde{\xb}) -  D_{\phi'} (\tilde{\xb}) \Big| \bigg).
\end{align*}
In addition,
\begin{align*}
    \Big|N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb}) -  N_{\phi'}(y,\tilde{\xb})\Big| &\le \sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb, y) | p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb, y) - p_{\phi'}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb, y)|  \\
    \Big|D_\phi (\tilde{\xb}) -  D_{\phi'} (\tilde{\xb}) \Big| &\le \sum_{y=\pm1}\sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb, y) | p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) - p_{\phi'}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)|.
\end{align*}
Therefore,
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}}\sum_{y = \pm 1}| T_\theta(p_\phi) - T_\theta(p_{\phi'}) |(y|\tilde{\xb}) \le \sum_{\tilde\xb\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} \frac{2}{D_\phi (\tilde{\xb})} \sum_{y=\pm1}\sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb, y) | p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y) - p_{\phi'}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb,y)|.  
\end{align*}
% Since that both $N_\phi$ and $D_\phi$ are distributions, we have $0 < |N_\phi| <1 $ and  $0<D_\phi<1$. Then,
% \begin{align*}
%     & |N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb})D_{\phi'} (\tilde{\xb}) - N_{\phi'}(y,\tilde{\xb})D_{\phi} (\tilde{\xb})| \\
%     & \le |N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb})| |D_{\phi'} (\tilde{\xb}) -  D_{\phi} (\tilde{\xb})| + | D_{\phi} (\tilde{\xb})| |N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb}) - N_{\phi'}(y,\tilde{\xb})| \\
%     & \le |D_{\phi'} (\tilde{\xb}) -  D_{\phi} (\tilde{\xb})| + |N_\phi(y,\tilde{\xb}) - N_{\phi'}(y,\tilde{\xb})| \\
%     & = \Big|\sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb)  (p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb) - p_{\phi'}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb)) \Big| + \Big| \sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}} \rho(\xb) p_0 (y|\xb) (p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb) - p_{\phi'}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb)) \Big| \\
%     & \le 2 \sum_{\xb \in \mathcal{X}}  |p_{\phi}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb) - p_{\phi'}(\tilde{\xb}|\xb)| .
% \end{align*}
Let the marginal of $\rho(x)$ be a uniform distribution on the space $\mathcal{X}$. Then we have $\rho(\xb,y) \le 1 / |\mathcal{X}|$. By the regularity conditions, we have
\begin{align*}
    \| T_\theta(p_\phi) - T_\theta(p_{\phi'}) \|_1 \le 2 \alpha^{-1} |\mathcal{X}|^{-1} \| p_{\phi} - p_{\phi'} \|_1 .
\end{align*}


\textbf{Proof of Convergence.} With proper choice of $\beta$, we have $T_\phi$ is $\alpha_1$-Lipchitz and $T_\theta$ $\alpha_2$-Lipchitz, with $\alpha_1 \alpha_2 = 4 \delta^{-1} \beta^{-1} \gamma^{-\beta^{-1}-1}  \alpha^{-1} < 1$ (this can be ensured if $\beta$ is large enough). That is,
\begin{align*}
    \| T_{\phi}(p_{\theta}) - T_{\phi}(p_{\theta'}) \| \le \alpha_1 \| p_\theta - p_{\theta'} \|, \\
    \| T_{\theta}(p_{\phi}) - T_{\theta}(p_{\phi'}) \| \le \alpha_2 \| p_\phi - p_{\phi'} \|.
\end{align*}
Then, we have
\begin{align*}
    \| T^2(p_{\psi}) - T^2(p_{\psi'}) \| & = \| T_\phi( T_\theta(p_{\phi})) - T_\phi( T_\theta(p_{\phi'})) \| + \| T_\theta( T_\psi(p_{\theta})) - T_\theta( T_\psi(p_{\theta'})) \|  \\ &\le \alpha_1\alpha_2 \| p_\phi - p_{\phi'} \| + \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \| p_\theta - p_{\theta'} \| = \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \| p_\psi - p_{\psi'} \|.
\end{align*}
Hence, $T^2$ is a contraction map on the compact space $\Psi$.
\begin{theorem}[Banach Fixed Point Theorem]
    Let $(X, d)$ be a complete metric space and let $T: X \to X$ be a contraction mapping, meaning that there exists a constant $0 \leq c < 1$ such that for all $x, y \in X$,
\[
d(T(x), T(y)) \leq c \, d(x, y).
\]
Then $T$ has a unique fixed point $x^* \in X$, meaning that $T(x^*) = x^*$. Moreover, for any $x_0 \in X$, the sequence defined by $x_{n+1} = T(x_n) $ converges to $x^*$.
\end{theorem}
By Banach Fixed Point Theorem, $T^2$ converges to its unique fixed point. Therefore, the two subsequences $\{ T^{2k}(p_{\psi_0})\}_{k=0}^\infty$ and $\{ T^{2k+1}(p_{\psi_0})\}_{k=0}^\infty$ both converge on the compact space $\Psi$. Since $T^2$ has a unique fixed point, these two subsequences converge to the same fixed point. Therefore,  $\{ T^{k}(\psi_0)\}_{k=0}^\infty$ converges. In addition, for the subsequence $\{ T^{2k}(p_{\psi_0})\}_{k=0}^\infty$, we have
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\| T^{2n+2}(p_{\bpsi_0})- p_{\bpsi^*} \|}{\| T^{2n}(p_{\bpsi_0})- p_{\bpsi^*} \|} \le \alpha_1\alpha_2 < 1.
\end{align*}
Similarly, similar inequality holds for $\{ T^{2k+1}(p_{\psi_0})\}_{k=0}^\infty$. Therefore, both subsequences converge linearly to the fixed point $p_{\bpsi^*}$. Therefore, for any $\epsilon$, we can get an $\epsilon$-equilibrium policy $p_\psi$, i.e., $\| p_\psi - p_{\bpsi^*} \| \le \epsilon $, within $O(\log( 1 / \epsilon))$ iterations.

\section{Additional Related Work}\label{app:related}
Adversarial training in classification~\citep{bai2021recent,machado2021adversarial} has been approached through robust optimization, game theory, and algorithmic defenses aimed at training models resilient to adversarial attacks. One theoretical study derived necessary conditions for an optimal robust classifier under bounded input perturbations and described how decision boundaries evolve via a mean-curvature flow as the adversary’s budget increases~\citep{trillos2022adversarial}. A complementary game-theoretic approach models classification as a two-player game: the attacker generates malicious inputs while the defender optimizes a randomized classifier strategy, yielding a Nash equilibrium rather than a worst-case fixed solution~\citep{dritsoula2017game}. 
Others have focused on specific attack vectors; for example, substituting features like synonyms in text to evade detection, with proposed defenses including simple feature-level heuristics and mixed-integer programming to jointly optimize feature selection under adversarial evasion constraints~\citep{li2014feature}. Classical adversarial training methods (e.g., FGSM~\citep{goodfellow2014explaining} or PGD-based training~\citep{madry2017towards}) generally augment data by applying small perturbations to existing inputs~\citep{trillos2022adversarial}, thereby improving robustness on in-distribution variations but not introducing fundamentally new examples or languages. As a result, these perturbation-focused techniques remain limited in multilingual settings, since they cannot generate adversarial data in languages beyond the original training distribution. In contrast, a two-player self-improving framework for LLMs can leverage a generative adversary to produce novel challenging examples (across different languages) and a defender model that learns from them, expanding the training distribution beyond mere perturbed replicas and enhancing cross-lingual robustness.

    \label{fig:data_prop}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:data_prop}, we show the overall proportion of data by language in our collected and processed seed data. Below, we list the sources of our seed training data gathered from HuggingFace. We also note the additional processing measure we took to ensure data quality for each source. At the last step of seed data curation, we conduct deduplication and decontamination from the test benchmarks.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BeaverTail}~\citep{ji2024beavertails} training set, containing both safe and unsafe data. Upon manual inspection, we make the following notes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In BeaverTail, safety is labeled based on the instruction-response pair. Same instruction with different responses may have different labels. Moreover, same QA pair has 3 labels from different label workers, resulting in 3 data examples in the dataset.
        \item We consider prompts as safe if all labels are ``safe'', and unsafe if any one label is ``unsafe''. 
        \item We only considere responses as unsafe if all labels are ``unsafe'', and disregard the rest data.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ToxicChat}~\citep{lin2023toxicchat} training set, containing both safe and unsafe data.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Safe data: data labeled as ``non-toxic'' further filtered by Llama-3.1 (8B), retaining 82,254 safe samples that agrees with the judge of Llama-3.1.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reddit Suicide Detection}\footnote{https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lucidest/reddit-suicidal-classify-kaggle}, containing only unsafe data. Upon manual inspection, we make the following notes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data are originally either labeled as ``suicidal'' or ``non-suicidal''. However, we cannot consider the ``non-suicidal'' examples as safe. Therefore, we disregard all data labeled as ``non-suicidal''.
        \item We consider the data labeled as ``suicidal'' as unsafe training data. We split the data by keyword detection, and downsample the set of data that contains the keywords ``kill'' and ``suicide'' to avoid over-reliance on just the keywords during model training.

\end{itemize}

For the collected unsafe data, we further assign fine-grained labels of the following 12 subcategories:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}
Each data may receive one or multiple labels. The mapping is done based on the data's original label with manual inspection. If the original label is not enough, we further apply Llama-3.1 to do the labeling with self-consistency over three queries.

\section{Additional Results}
\textbf{Model confidence in incorrect predictions.} A critical question in improving model performance is understanding the nature of its errors. Do these errors primarily stem from unseen data, where the model exhibits uncertainty, or from spurious correlations, where the model demonstrates high confidence and relies on shortcuts learned from imbalanced real-world data? \cref{fig:confidence_iter0} illustrates the output probability distribution of false positives and false negatives across the classifier trained on seed data. The distribution reveals a notable skew: false negatives tend to cluster around a probability of 0, while false positives concentrate near a probability of 1. This indicates that the classifier often exhibits overconfidence in its incorrect predictions, raising concerns about its reliability when faced with challenging examples or distribution shifts.
