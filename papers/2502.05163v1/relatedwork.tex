    \caption{\textbf{Overview of the two-player training pipeline.} The generator produces synthetic data from seed data. The classifier makes predictions and we measure these examples as being predicted correctly or incorrectly based on their seed data label. We train the generator with DPO to create increasingly challenging examples, which in turn improve the classifier through iterative training.}
