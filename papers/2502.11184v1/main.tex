Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe—a capability we term \emph{safety awareness}. In this paper, we introduce \methodname, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1,500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. \methodname includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models' abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using \methodname reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1\% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9\% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness—prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning—but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area.
All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.

\section{Introduction}

%MLLMs are widely deployed
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4V~\cite{2023GPT4VisionSC} and Bard~\cite{bard}, have recently been released and widely deployed. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that operate solely on textual inputs, MLLMs enable users to interact with models using image inputs as well. This advancement expands the impact of language-only systems by introducing novel interfaces and capabilities, allowing MLLMs to tackle new tasks such as mathematical reasoning~\cite{Lu2023MathVistaEM}, medical diagnosis~\cite{Yan2023MultimodalCF,wang2024asclepius,liu2024medchain}, and code generation~\cite{wan2024mrweb,wan2024automatically}.

% safety are important. Safety awareness is an essential first step.
The safety of LLMs is a broad concept encompassing measures and practices that prevent these models from causing harm or acting in unethical, incorrect, or biased ways~\cite{OpenAI2023GPT4TR}. Ensuring safety is at the core of developing and deploying LLMs and has drawn significant attention from both academia and industry. An essential aspect of LLM safety is \emph{safety awareness}, meaning that an LLM should be able to correctly identify whether a piece of information—such as a user query or model response—is safe or not. Previous studies have shown that LLMs are more likely to generate unsafe content when presented with unsafe queries~\cite{Sun2023SafetyAO}. Identifying unsafe queries is thus a helpful and necessary first step in preventing models from generating unsafe responses. Furthermore, LLMs are increasingly used as judges to assess the safety of their own responses, making safety awareness a critical capability.




% The challenge and significance of multimodal safety

Identifying whether multimodal content is safe is a non-trivial task. A multimodal input (e.g., a meme) typically uses different modalities to convey information. To understand the complete meaning of such content and determine its safety, MLLMs need to process information in each modality and effectively fuse the information from different modalities. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example}, a benign image coupled with benign text can convey unsafe information when considered together (left), while an unsafe text prompt may be harmless in the context of certain images (right).



%Previous works have created various safety benchmarks for measuring the safety of LLMs~\cite{Levy2022SafeTextAB,Sun2021OnTS, Sun2023SafetyAO, Wang2023AllLM, Wan2023BiasAskerMT}. 
%Third, each LLM needs to find a good trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness~\cite{Bai2022TrainingAH}, an over-sensitive LLM may refuse to comply with not only unsafe prompts but also safe prompts, leading to a decrease in helpfulness.


%in this paper
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{\methodname}, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to assess whether MLLMs can accurately identify the safety of multimodal content. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: an \emph{unsafe subset} and an \emph{over-safety subset}, featuring specifically designed image-prompt pairs. The unsafe subset includes benign images and prompts that, when combined, express unsafe information, measuring an MLLM's ability to identify unsafe content (harmlessness). The over-safety subset contains images or prompts that may seem unsafe when considered alone but are safe when combined, evaluating whether an MLLM is over-sensitive, which can impact its helpfulness~\cite{Bai2022TrainingAH}. All data have been manually checked by human annotators to ensure quality. To the best of our knowledge, \methodname is the most comprehensive multimodal safety benchmark to date, comprising 1,500 image-prompt pairs across 29 safety scenarios, as shown in Table~\ref{table:related_works}.

We use \methodname to evaluate the safety of nine widely used MLLMs, including GPT-4V, Gemini, Claude-3, and LLava. Our findings reveal that all the MLLMs are not safe enough. For example, GPT-4V erroneously classifies 36.1\% of unsafe inputs in our unsafe subset as safe. A more severe issue is that all the models are over-sensitive; GPT-4V tends to misclassify 59.9\% of benign pairs in our over-safety subset as unsafe, potentially leading to decreased helpfulness. Furthermore, safety-concerned system prompts tend to aggravate over-sensitivity issues.


To address these challenges, we adopt three methods to improve the safety awareness of MLLMs: a prompting-based method for closed-source LLMs, a visual contrastive decoding algorithm, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning for open-source LLMs, aiming to encourage MLLMs to better consider information from both modalities. Experimental results show that none of these methods achieve satisfactory performance, indicating the profound challenges posed by \methodname.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce \methodname, a comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark that evaluates MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios, including both unsafe and over-safety subsets.
    \item We extensively evaluate nine widely used MLLMs, revealing significant safety shortcomings and over-sensitivity issues, thereby highlighting the challenges in developing safe and helpful MLLMs.
    \item We explore three methods to improve safety awareness—prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning—and demonstrate their limitations in addressing the challenges posed by \methodname.

\subsection{Multi-modal Content Understanding}

Multi-modal content (e.g., a meme or video) has different modalities to convey information. 
Therefore, to understand the whole picture of multimedia content and determine its toxicity, one needs not only to process the information in every single modality but also to fuse the information from different modalities~\cite{Gao2020ASO,Kiela2020TheHM}.
The fusion of different modalities is generally performed at two levels: feature level and decision level. 
In the feature-level fusion approaches, the features extracted from different modalities are first combined and then sent as input to a single analysis unit that performs the analysis task. 
In the decision-level fusion approaches, the analysis units first provide the local decisions that are obtained based on individual features from different modalities. 
The local decisions are then combined using a decision fusion unit to make a fused decision. 
The main advantage of decision-level fusion is that it can use the most suitable methods to analyze every single modality. 
However, it fails to utilize the feature-level correlation among modalities~\cite{Ahmed2023ASS}.



\subsection{Datasets for Safety Evaluation.}

We systematically reviewed the papers on benchmarking and evaluating the safety of large language models across related research areas: computer vision, natural language processing, multimedia, and security. As is shown in Table~\ref{table:related_works}, previous works suffer from the following several drawbacks. First, most of the benchmarks are text-only or image-only, not in a multi-modal manner. Second, all the previous benchmarks are not comprehensive enough. Most of the previous work only considered typical safety scenarios without instruction attack. And most of the papers do not measure the over-sensitive issue, which is recently found in language model~\cite{Rttger2023XSTestAT}. Besides, most papers only consider some of the safety scenarios, leading to a limited evaluation of LLMs.



\section{Constructing \methodname Benchmark}

In this section, we will introduce how we construct the \methodname Benchmark. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: the unsafe subset to measure whether an MLLM can identify unsafe contents and the over-safety subset to measure if an MLLM is over-sensitive. We will illustrate how we construct the two subsets in Section~\ref{sec:unsafe} and Section~\ref{sec:safe}

\caption{Illustration of some safety scenarios in {\em \methodname benchmark}. (Full list in Appendix.)} 
\label{tab:overview}
\end{table*}


To enhance the thoroughness of our benchmark across diverse safety scenarios, we conducted a systematic review of prior research on LLM safety, identifying three main scenarios that encompass 17 specific types of unsafe scenarios.
For each type of unsafe scenario, we manually design image-text pairs\footnote{All the images follow the creative Commons license and are downloaded from Google Images} as test cases under the following rule:
\begin{myquote}{10pt}
\tt
Each test case is an image-text pair that both image and text are benign when considered alone, while it is unsafe when considered together.
\end{myquote}
\noindent 

\paragraph{Typical Unsafe Scenarios}
\methodname encompasses 14 types of typical unsafe concerns, which can be categorized into the following four aspects:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
    \item {\em Physical Safe} that can causes direct physical damage or injury to an individual, such as self-harm, biomedical harm, and violence. \\
    \item {\em Mental Safe} that can negatively impacts an individual's psychological, emotional, or cognitive well-being, such as pornography, mental stress, and abusive language.
    \item {\em Property Safe} related to property, such as economic harm, copyright and privacy. \\
    \item {\em Society Safe} related to society, such as hate speech, bias and stereotypes, ethics and morality, misinformation and crime. \\
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Instruction Attack Scenarios}
Besides typical unsafe scenarios, \methodname also involves instruction attack scenarios,  
which refers to the intentional design that induces the model to generate unsafe responses~\cite{Sun2023SafetyAO,Wang2023AllLM}. Specifically, we include 3 types of instruction attacks, including
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
    \item {\em Role Play} that specify a role attribute to cause the model to finish instructions in the speaking style of the role.
    \item {\em Inquiry with Unsafe Opinion} that add imperceptibly unsafe content into the input to influence the model to generate harmful content.
    \item {\em Goal Hijacking} that induces the system into ignoring the original user prompt.
\end{itemize}

To sum up, \methodname unsafe subset covers 17 safety types with 1000 image-text pairs.

\subsection{Over-Safety Subset}
\label{sec:safe}

Inspired by a recent study on the over-sensitive of language models~\cite{Rttger2023XSTestAT}, our \methodname benchmark also incorporates an over-safety subset designed to assess whether a multimodal LLM is over-sensitive.

For each type of over-safety scenario, we manually design image-text pairs as test cases under the following rule:
\begin{myquote}{10pt}
\tt
Each test case is an image-text pair that either image or text is unsafe when considered alone, while it is safe when considered together.
\end{myquote}
\noindent 

\methodname encompasses eight of the ten over-safety scenarios introduced by~\citep{Rttger2023XSTestAT} that are applicable to multimodal LLMs. These scenarios include definitions, homonyms, safe targets, safe contexts, real discrimination against nonsensical groups, nonsensical discrimination against real groups, privacy concerns in public contexts, and privacy concerns in fictional scenarios.
~\citep{Rttger2023XSTestAT} focused on textual prompts, designing prompts that are clearly safe but superficially resemble unsafe prompts in terms of the vocabulary they use. We have tailored this approach for multimodal LLMs, focusing on text-image pairs. 
\methodname also includes four new over-safety scenarios, including tautological (needless repetition of a word), copyright for public domain, fake goal hijacking, and fake role playing. 
% The four new safe prompts along with the corresponding unsafe prompts can better evaluate the reliability of the evaluated multimodal LLMs.

To sum up, \methodname over-safety subset covers 12 safety types with 500 image-text pairs.
An ideal LLM needs to find a good trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness~\cite{Bai2022TrainingAH}. An over-sensitive LLM may refuse to comply with not only unsafe inputs but also safe ones, leading to a decrease in helpfulness.
Hence, by pairing the unsafe with over-safety subset,  \methodname can more effectively assess the safety awareness of the evaluated multimodal LLMs.



\subsection{Quality Control}

We guarantee the quality of our benchmark by vetting each image-text pair through human annotation. Specifically, we recruited three annotators with Bachelor's degrees and proficiency in English, to label whether \methodname Benchmark only contains image-text pairs that meet our criteria. 

For each image-text pair in the benchmark, we ask the annotators to answer three questions: 1) considering the image alone, do you think the image is unsafe? 2) considering the text prompt alone, do you think the text prompt is unsafe? and 3) considering the image and text prompt, do you think the text prompt is unsafe under the context of the image? 
Each annotator works separately and we conduct a majority voting to make the final decision.

For the image-text pairs in the unsafe subset (both the image and text look harmless when considered alone but the semantic is unsafe when considered together), if the annotation is "Yes" for question 1 or 2, or "No" for question 3, we discard this image-text pair. For the image-text pairs in the over-safety subset (either the image or text looks unsafe when considered alone but the semantic is safe when consider together), if the annotation is "No" for both question 1 and 2, or "Yes" for question 3, we discard this image-text pair. Finally, 4.7\% of the image-text pairs are discard after this process.

where ``\{Image\}'' and ``\{Text\}'' denote the input image and text, respectively.

For test cases in the unsafe subset, the expected response is ``No''. Higher accuracy indicates that the evaluated MLLM is safe.
Conversely, for test cases in the over-safety subset, the expected response is ``Yes''. Higher accuracy indicates that the evaluated MLLM is not being overly sensitive.






\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

We use \methodname to evaluate 6 widely used close-Sourced MLLMs, as well as 3 open-sourced MLLMs, the details of which are listed in Table~\ref{tab:main}. We follow the default setting on their official website to call the models.


\subsection{Main Results}




\paragraph{MLLMs are not safe enough.} As is shown in Tabel~\ref{tab:main}, MLLMs exhibit significant gaps in accurately identifying unsafe content. For example, GPT4-V and Bard show low performance in the unsafe subset, with an accuracy of 63.9\% and 73.8\% respectively, indicating the potential reliability issues as a safety judge.
We also show the specific performance of MLLMs in different scenarios in Figure~\ref{fig:safety-scenarios} (a), indicating that different MLLMs perform variously in different scenarios.


\paragraph{MLLMs all suffer from severe over-sensitive issues.} As is shown in Tabel~\ref{tab:main}, MLLMs have much lower accuracy on the over-safety subset, indicating that all the MLLMs are over-sensitive. For example, Claude-3 erroneously classified 98.9\% of test cases in the over-safety subset as unsafe. This can significantly affect the helpfulness. We also show the specific performance of MLLMs in different scenarios in Figure~\ref{fig:safety-scenarios} (b), indicating that different MLLMs perform variously in different scenarios.


\paragraph{MLLMs show a trade-off between safety and over-safety.} Claude-3 exhibits a near-perfect performance in identifying unsafe content, but its performance dramatically dips in the over-safety subset, where it fails to recognize almost all the test cases as non-threatening. On the other hand, GPT-4V can only achieve 63.9\% accuracy on identifying unsafe content, but can suffer less from the over-sensitive issue, with an accuracy of 41.1\%. This indicates that training a safe but not over-sensitive MLLM is still a challenging task.

\paragraph{Safey-Aware system prompt can make MLLMs safer but more over-sensitive.} Previous work~\cite{Wang2023AllLM} adopts system prompts to improve the harmlessness of LLMs. In this section, we investigate the effect of safey-aware system prompts on our benchmark. Specifically, we adopt the following system prompt:

\begin{myquote}{10pt}
    \tt You are a helpful and harmless assistant. Please answer safely.
\end{myquote}

As is shown in Tabel~\ref{tab:system_prompt_result}, the safety-aware system prompt increases the accuracy in the unsafe subset, while decreasing the accuracy on the over-safety subset, indicating that safety-aware system prompt can make MLLMs safer but more over-sensitive.

\paragraph{Case Study} We present a case study in Table~\ref{tab:case}, aiming to provide insights into why the MLLMs fail. We summarize 5 reasons, ranked in frequency, such as making the decision only based on partial modality, lack of some factual knowledge, or misunderstanding the generated image.

\subsection{Improving Multimodal Safety Awareness}

\paragraph{Understanding the failures of Multimodal Safety Awareness.}
Previous case studies demonstrate that MLLMs tend to focus on partial information from a specific modality when identifying whether a multimodal content is safe or not. To further illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze the overall input-output relevancy scores for MLLMs~\citep{stan2024lvlm-interpret}, identifying the most relevant parts of the input to the model prediction. 

Figure~\ref{fig:relevance} illustrates a case in which the model \texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} fails to accurately answer a test case from the over-safety subset, representing a common failure pattern. Specifically, the model assigns greater attention to the textual input than to the visual context. The attended tokens \{``kill'', ``I'', ``you''\} guide the model to generate ``No'', while the image tokens are underutilized for the answer generation.


\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{figures/attribution.pdf}
    \caption{Input-output relevance in a failure case where visual information (<image> tokens) is underutilized}
    \label{fig:relevance}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Improving the Multimodal Safety Awareness.}

Based on the above observation, we explore different methods to encourage the model to consider the information from both image and text to improve the safety awareness of multimodal LLMs. Specifically, we adopt three level of methods, prompting method for close-sourced MLLMs, Visual Contrastive Decoding and Vision-Centric Reasoning Fine-tuning for open-sourced MLLMs.


\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=10pt]
    \item 
     {\em Prompting}: a direct method that explicitly instructs MLLMs to consider both image and text by adding prompt ``Please consider the meaning of the sentence under the context of the image.''.
    \item 
     {\em Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD)}~\citep{leng2024vcd} contrasts the output distributions derived from original and noisy visual input to encourage MLLMs to pay attention to the visual inputs.
    \item %{\em Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}
    {\em Vision-Centric Reasoning Fine-tuning (VRTuning)} employs structured intermediate reasoning steps to thoroughly analyze visual and text inputs, achieved by fine-tuning on the long thought multimodal reasoning dataset~\citep{xu2024llavacot}.
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Accuracy of representative MLLMs. Higher scores denote better performance.}
\label{tab:improve_result}
\end{table}

As is shown in Table~\ref{tab:improve_result}, the simple prompting method effectively enhances the safety awareness of both closed-source MLLMs. This indicates that explicit instructions encourage MLLMs to better integrate multimodal information, thus improving their safety awareness.
For open-source MLLMs, VCD and VRTuning help mitigate the over-sensitive issues, as evidenced by the increased accuracy on the over-safety subset. However, these methods do not consistently enhance accuracy on the unsafe subset.
Despite the improvements, none of the approaches entirely address the safety awareness problem, especially for open-source models. The overall accuracies remain moderate, highlighting the profound challenge posed by the \methodname Benchmark. 
% For example, even after applying VRTuning, Instruct-BLIP's overall accuracy is 56.9\%, leaving substantial room for improvement. These results underscore the need for more robust methods to enhance the safety awareness of MLLMs effectively.








\section{Related Work}


A branch of previous works has focused on specific safety areas in LLMs, such as toxicity~\citep{Hartvigsen2022ToxiGenAL}, bias~\citep{Dhamala2021BOLDDA, Wan2023BiasAskerMT}, copyright~\citep{Chang2023SpeakMA} and psychological safety~\citep{Huang2023EmotionallyNO}. There is also some work on the development of holistic safety datasets. \cite{Ganguli2022RedTL} collected 38,961 red team attack samples across different categories. \newcite{Ji2023BeaverTailsTI} collected 30,207 question-answer (QA) pairs to measure the helpfulness and harmlessness of LLMs. \newcite{Sun2023SafetyAO} released a comprehensive manually written safety prompt set on 14 kinds of risks. 
However, most of the safety datasets above are text- or image-only, hindering the study on multi-modal safety.


More recently, with the popularity of MLLMs, a few concurrent works have also worked on the safety of multimodal LLMs~\cite{wang2024chain, wang2024new}. For example, MM-Safety~\cite{Liu2023MMSafetyBenchAB} is a dataset designed for conducting safety-critical evaluations of MLLMs. However, it only comprises 13 scenarios and does not evaluate the over-safety issue. MossBench~\cite{li2024mossbench} is a multimodal oversensitivity benchmark with 3 types of over-safety scenarios. However, our benchmark is a more comprehensive safety awareness benchmark for MLLMs, involving both an unsafe subset and an over-safety subset and comprising 29 different safety scenarios. 



\section{Conclusion}

\iffalse
In this paper, we introduced \methodname, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety awareness of multi-modal LLMs through 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. Our extensive experiments with 9 popular multi-modal LLMs revealed two critical findings: first, current models struggle to effectively detect unsafe content when it emerges from the combination of seemingly safe individual components; second, these models tend to be overly cautious, often misclassifying safe content as unsafe, which significantly impacts their practical utility.
To address these challenges, we explored three improvement strategies. While these methods showed promise in enhancing the models' ability to consider both modalities, there remains significant room for improvement.
Our work highlights the critical need for continued research in multi-modal safety awareness, particularly in developing more balanced and nuanced approaches to safety detection in multi-modal contexts.
\fi

In this work, we introduced \methodname, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety awareness of MLLMs. Through the careful construction of 1,500 image-prompt pairs across 29 safety scenarios, we provided a rigorous tool for assessing both unsafe and over-safety situations in MLLMs. Our extensive evaluations of nine popular MLLMs revealed significant shortcomings in safety awareness, with models frequently misclassifying unsafe content as safe and exhibiting over-sensitivity that affects their helpfulness. 
We explored three methods to enhance safety awareness but found that none fully address the challenges posed by \methodname. These findings highlight the urgent need for more effective strategies in developing MLLMs that are both safe and helpful. 
%Future work includes investigating advanced methods for multimodal information integration and developing training approaches that balance safety and sensitivity without compromising model utility.


\section*{Limitations}

The main limitation that offers avenues for future research is that none of the improving methods can fully address the challenges posed by \methodname. More effective methods are needed to further enhance the safety awareness of MLLMs.

\section*{Ethical Concerns}

This paper designs a benchmark including toxic images.
However, we highlight that the goal of our paper is not to generate toxic images, but to reveal a severe safety issue in MLLM safety awareness. This work not only raises awareness about the potential dangers associated with MLLM safety but also paves the way for future research and development of more secure and ethical AI systems.
