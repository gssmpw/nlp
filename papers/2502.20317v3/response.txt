\textbf{Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG):}
RAG enhances generative tasks by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources**Bui, "Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks"** and has been widely used to improve question-answering **Huang, "Improving Question Answering with Retrieval-Augmented Generative Models"**. With LLMs, RAG has been used for mitigating hallucinations**Li, "Hallucination Mitigation in Language Models via Retrieval-Augmentation"**, enhancing interpretability**Zhang, "Interpretable Text Generation with Retrieval-Augmented Neural Networks"**, and enabling dynamic knowledge updates**Wang, "Dynamic Knowledge Updates in Generative Models using Retrieval-Augmentation"**. This work essentially leverages the idea of RAG to retrieve supporting entities from TG-KBs to contextualize answer generation. Depending on concrete types of knowledge being retrieved, existing retrievers can be categorized into structural and textual retrieval, which are reviewed next.


\noindent \textbf{Textual and Structural Retrieval:} Early textual retrieval models, such as TF-IDF and BM25**Manning, "Introduction to Information Retrieval"**, rely on lexical similarity and keyword matching**Salton, "Automatic Information Organization and Retrieval"**. Modern approaches address this limitation by learning dense representations**Levy, "Learning Dense Representations for Textual Similarity"**. Beyond textual retrieval, structural retrieval leverages graph-based techniques to extract structured knowledge. Methods such as graph traversal**Kamada, "Algorithms for Drawing General Undirected Graphs"**, community detection**Girvan, "Community Structure in Social and Biological Networks"**, and graph machine learning models, including graph neural networks**Bruna, "Spectral Networks and Deep Locally Connected Generalization of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks"**, play a crucial role in structural retrieval. Our approach integrates the strengths of both textual and structural retrieval by infusing the mixture-of-expert philosophy into retrieval design.
