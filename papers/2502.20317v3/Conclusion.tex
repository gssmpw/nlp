In this work, we propose a mixture of structural and textual retrieval (MoR) to adaptively retrieve structural and textual knowledge based on query desire, which first utilizes a textual graph generator to generate the planning graph, then performs a mixed traversal and conducts organizing via a structure-aware reranker to obtain final candidates. Experiments demonstrate the advantages of our MoR in harmonizing the retrieval of both textual and structural knowledge with insightful discoveries, including balancing retrieval performance across queries with different patterns and query-adaptive knowledge desire for structural/textual knowledge.
