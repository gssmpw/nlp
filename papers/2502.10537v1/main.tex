\begin{abstract}
Analyzing data subgroups is a common data science task to build intuition about a dataset and identify areas to improve model performance. 
However, subgroup analysis is prohibitively difficult in datasets with many features, and existing tools limit unexpected discoveries by relying on user-defined or static subgroups.
We propose exploratory subgroup analysis as a set of tasks in which practitioners discover, evaluate, and curate interesting subgroups to build understanding about datasets and models. 
To support these tasks we introduce Divisi, an interactive notebook-based tool underpinned by a fast approximate subgroup discovery algorithm. 
Divisi's interface allows data scientists to interactively re-rank and refine subgroups and to visualize their overlap and coverage in the novel Subgroup Map.
Through a think-aloud study with 13 practitioners, we find that Divisi can help uncover surprising patterns in data features and their interactions, and that it encourages more thorough exploration of subtypes in complex data.
% Analyzing subgroups in a dataset that have different outcomes than average is an important way to build intuition about data. However, subgroup analysis is difficult when the dataset is large, contains many features, or requires intersecting multiple features together to find meaningful subgroups. Automatic subgroup discovery is a promising strategy to mine interesting groups of instances from large datasets, but existing approaches take too long to run interactively, do not extend to multiple outcomes of interest, and produce a static list of results. We propose Divisi, an interactive search-based tool for data scientists to find and curate subgroups of interest within large datasets with discrete features. Divisi incorporates a novel approximate subgroup discovery algorithm that allows balancing between multiple ranking functions, and it performs faster than existing approaches while maintaining high accuracy compared to exhaustive search. The computational notebook-based visual interface provides interactive re-ranking, editing, and curation features including a novel Subgroup Map visualization. Through a think-aloud study with 13 data scientists, we find that Divisi enables analyses that would have previously been prohibitively time-consuming, and that it facilitates an understanding of the overlap and coverage of subgroups of interest.

Implemented as a computational notebook widget, Divisi includes a novel approximate subgroup discovery algorithm (A) which allows interactive re-ranking by customizable functions, such as error rate and coverage (B). Users can compare metrics across subgroups (C) and test alternative rule definitions (D) to evaluate subgroups. Finally, the Subgroup Map (E) depicts overlap and coverage between groups, so users can curate the most representative subgroups for review (F).}
