\section{Related Work}
Our work is informed by foundational paradigms in visual analytics including exploratory data analysis and exploratory search (Sec. \ref{sec:related-eda}). 
We also build on many prior methods for subgroup analysis from data mining and machine learning, the design space of which we describe in Sec. \ref{sec:related-subgroup-analysis}.

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis and Search}
\label{sec:related-eda}

____ describes \textit{exploratory data analysis} (EDA) as ``looking at data to see what it seems to say''____.
EDA is therefore distinct from hypothesis testing, or confirmatory data analysis, in its emphasis on generating insight from the \textit{data} rather than prior knowledge and expectations.
Many systems for EDA are informed by interaction techniques for \textit{exploratory search}, in which people navigate through and query information resources to build understanding about some latent concept of interest____.
In these interactive search settings, features such as sorting, filtering, and faceted searches____ play a key role in helping users uncover useful information.
Applied to EDA, these techniques can enable steerable recommendations of how to visualize data features____ or efficient overviews of text data____.
We draw inspiration from these search techniques in the design of Divisi.

A wide variety of EDA techniques have been developed for different types of data, including small-scale tabular settings____, high-dimensional data____, text data____, and general unstructured data____.
It is often easiest to find useful insights in EDA on tabular data because the features are generally intrinsically interpretable. 
In contrast, for text or image data the ``features'' (words or pixels) may not have any meaning on their own, making it difficult to interpret what instances have in common.
As datasets grow larger, there may also be many different subtypes within the dataset, limiting the insight provided by top-level metrics and distributions.
For this reason, many prior works aim to mitigate the complexity of large, high-dimensional datasets by automatically deriving semantically meaningful features or ``concepts'' to bootstrap the analysis process____.
Alternatively, some systems allow the user to define their own features of interest____.
However, these methods require the user to already know roughly what concept they are looking for, limiting their opportunities to explore and find unexpected patterns.
Our work relies on the presence of interpretable tabular features for every instance; however, we design for use cases in which the data scientist wants to find the relevant features out of a large set of potentially-meaningful set of descriptors.
This can afford the simplicity of working with tabular data while not restricting the analysis to the user's prior hypotheses.

\subsection{Tools for Subgroup Analysis}
\label{sec:related-subgroup-analysis}

Sometimes called slice discovery, cluster analysis, or rule mining, subgroup analysis is an important part of data science that can help people understand phenomena in a dataset____, help model builders diagnose and fix issues____, explain model predictions____, or even be used in place of a model____.
However, it is usually all but impossible to define clear-cut, interpretable subgroups that exactly capture the outcome of interest (e.g., model errors), creating a design space of trade-offs for how to produce useful insights.
A wide array of subgroup analysis techniques have been developed, varying across several dimensions:

\textit{Conceptualization of a subgroup.} Differences in data types, user needs, and algorithm formulations give rise to different definitions of what a subgroup is. 
At the most subjective level, subgroups can be any semantic human-readable description of instances, regardless of whether it is encoded in the data, such as ``images of people with glasses''____. 
They can also be defined by numerical proximity to some conceptual entity, such as a direction or neighborhood around an instance in an embedding space____. 
Finally, subgroups can be defined more precisely by constructing rules for membership, such as textual patterns____ or predicates on tabular features____. 
While the latter results in the clearest subgroup definitions, it also requires crafting or mining high-quality rules.

\textit{Source of initiative.} Many subgroup discovery methods require the data scientist to define subgroups themselves, using the affordances of the various subgroup concepts described above____. 
These methods are flexible and often provide useful insights on known areas of interest, but it can be difficult to find \textit{new} subgroups without spending time perusing individual instances. 
Algorithm-initiated approaches can provide a strong initial set of subgroups to explore____; however, these techniques heavily focus on producing the most relevant set of subgroups in the initial query.
There is currently a lack of \textit{mixed-initiative} subgroup analysis approaches that allow the user to interactively steer the algorithm's output to produce more relevant slices.
When subgroup analysis tools do offer mixed-initiative interactions, it is typically to \textit{refine} the subgroup definitions____ or to characterize and assess their validity____, both of which are supported in Divisi within our broader mixed-initiative workflow.

\textit{Visualization.} Designs to visualize and compare subgroup-level data characteristics are largely dependent on the way the subgroups are conceptualized.
For example, most clustering-based tools use dimensionality reduction scatter plots, which provide a valuable overview of the dataset but are difficult to map to data features____.
For handcrafted subgroups on tabular data, brushable histograms can serve as controls to define predicates that are then visualized in strip plots____ or domain-specific visualizations____.
To visualize rule-based subgroups generated by an algorithm, table representations with sparkline charts or glyphs are often preferred as they can efficiently present summary statistics over many subgroups____.
Similarly, UpSet plots____ provide a dense visual representation of metrics within multiple set intersections.
Divisi combines several of these elements, including the scatter plot and the subgroup table with sparklines, with novel adaptations for tasks such as assessing overlap and coverage.

\textit{Algorithmic approach.} We can divide prior algorithms for subgroup discovery into four broad classes: lattice search, frequent itemsets, classification, and clustering.
Lattice search methods, such as Slice Finder____, \textsc{Premise}____, and the Nugget Browser____, perform combinatorial search of a space of discrete rules to find those that most satisfy the algorithm's desirability criteria.
These methods can result in easily-interpretable subgroups, but they tend to scale poorly to datasets with hundreds or thousands of features due to combinatorial explosion.
Frequent itemset-based methods, such as DivExplorer____ and the method developed by ________, draw on efficient algorithms from data mining such as FPgrowth, then score and rank the returned subgroups.
Similarly, these methods work best with a relatively small number of possible feature combinations.
Classification-based methods can overcome some of the performance considerations of lattice search and frequent itemset approaches ____, but their results often require significant work to interpret.
Finally, clustering-based methods aim to group together instances by similarity in a high-dimensional space such as a learned embedding____.
Though these methods can provide insight into unstructured data, they often require a trained model, sometimes one that is jointly trained with natural-language representations, limiting their applicability.
Moreover, like classification methods, the resulting clusters and concepts are not always straightforward to interpret because of their reliance on learned embeddings.
Divisi builds on this extensive space of previous algorithms, adopting a modified lattice search approach that addresses scalability issues using approximation.
While it is most directly applicable to tabular datasets as a result, we propose ways to use it in unstructured data contexts in Sec. \ref{sec:use-case}.

Because there are so many alternative techniques for subgroup analysis, each with their own specific associated data types and challenges, there is not a clear consensus of what approach should be applied to a given problem.
As a result, data scientists may not typically include subgroup analysis in the exploratory phase of their workflows.
Our work aims to make it easier to perform subgroup analyses interactively within a typical programming environment, and we assess in our study whether they might find such capabilities useful in their daily work.
