\section{Accuracy and Performance Evaluation Details}
\label{app:perf-evaluation-details}
Table \ref{tab:performance-eval-datasets} provides an overview of the datasets used in the performance and accuracy evaluation in Section \ref{sec:performance-eval}.
The default values were used for the beam size ($k = 50$) and rule length ($L = 3$) in all runs of the Divisi algorithm, while $n$ and $p_\text{min}$ were varied as part of the experiment.
For the source mask, we targeted row sampling to rows that have a positive value for the target outcomes specified in the table.

\textbf{Dataset} & \textbf{Census Income} & \textbf{Airline} & \textbf{Reviews} \\ \midrule
