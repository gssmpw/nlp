\section{Conclusion}

Subgroup analysis is an important, yet under-utilized tool in data science.
Our results suggest that combining algorithm-generated, rule-based insights with human intuition and experimentation in an interactive workflow can help practitioners develop a thorough understanding of complex datasets.
By implementing these interactions in a lightweight notebook-based tool, we hope to lower the barrier for data scientists to try subgroup discovery and to curate unexpected, interesting subpopulations in their data.
Divisi is available as an open-source package so that data scientists and HCI researchers can build on this work, helping to make exploratory subgroup analysis more feasible for a wider range of contexts.
