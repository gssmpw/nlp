We presented \name, the first novel method that can jointly reconstruct realistic clothed humans and objects from a human-object scene image. \name combines the power of attention-based neural implicit learning with a generative diffusion model and human-object pose conditioning to produce realistic clothed human and object 3D shapes. Extensive ablations on various network architecture components of \name demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our experiments show that our method generalizes well to a real world dataset on which it was not trained and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing realistic human-object scenes.
