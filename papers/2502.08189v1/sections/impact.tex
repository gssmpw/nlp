\section{Impact Statement}

% Directly replacing a character in a given target video is a crucial task in practice.
% Existed open-sourced works suffer from poor spatial and temporal information modeling.
% Our model significantly improve the generation performance with better identity preservation, motion smoothness, and human-object interaction.
% We believe our work will benefit various applications, such as art creation and film production.
% Although our method achieves remarkable success, it may fall short in modeling the back of a character and the reflection of a character in a mirror.
% Please be careful when using our model, especially facing these challenging scenarios.

Directly replacing a character in a given target video is a crucial task in practice. Existing open-source solutions often struggle with poor spatial and temporal information modeling. Our model significantly improves generation performance by better preserving identity, ensuring smoother motion, and enhancing human-object interaction. We believe our work will benefit various applications, such as art creation and film production.
While our method achieves remarkable success, it may fall short in modeling the back of a character from a front-facing reference image. Please exercise caution when using our model, especially in such a challenging scenario.
