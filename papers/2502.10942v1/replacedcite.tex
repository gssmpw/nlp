\section{Related Studies}
% Summarizes existing literature on latent representation shifts, attention-based memory mechanisms, and contextual adaptation in LLMs.

Research into Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on mechanisms that enable more effective handling of extended dependencies, complex semantic structures, and evolving discourse patterns. The reliance on fixed learned representations has presented challenges in dynamically adjusting to contextual shifts, prompting investigations into various strategies aimed at enhancing adaptability without requiring external memory augmentation or human intervention. Recent advancements have explored mechanisms such as latent representation modulation, memory-based attention refinements, self-regulating embedding calculations, and dynamic token realignment techniques. A fundamental challenge in this domain has been ensuring that models can maintain coherence across longer sequences while minimizing loss of previously established semantic associations. While large progress has been made through architectural modifications and training paradigm shifts, the development of self-modulating contextual embedding shifts remains an area of ongoing investigation.
