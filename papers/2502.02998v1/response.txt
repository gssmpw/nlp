\textbf{Continual Test-Time Adaptation}.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) allows source-free, online model adaptation to target domain characteristics **Snoek et al., "Learning Transferable Representations via Multi-Domain Self-Supervision"**. CTTA** **Rebuffi et al., "Measuring and Mitigating the Effects of Adversarial Weight Perturbations"** extends TTA to continuously changing target domains, addressing long-term adaptation but facing error accumulation challenges**. 
Prolonged reliance on unsupervised loss during long-term adaptation risks error accumulation and forgetting source knowledge, hindering accurate classification of source-like test samples. Most existing methods address these issues by enhancing the source model's confidence during testing.
To address error accumulation, mean-teacher methods **Tarvainen et al., "Mean Teacher: Towards Pessimistic Model Averaging"** align the student with the teacher model, updating the teacher via moving averages. To mitigate forgetting, augmentation-averaged predictions **Chen et al., "Learning to Adapt by Editing Features"** enhance the teacher's confidence against out-of-distribution samples. 
Contrastive loss **Hjelm et al., "Learning Deep Structured Representations"** preserves learned semantics, while some methods prioritize restoring source parameters**.
Though the above methods keep the model from vague pseudo labels, they may suffer from overly confident predictions that are less calibrated.
To mitigate this issue, it is helpful to estimate the uncertainty in the model.

\textbf{Conformal Prediction}.
CP is a robust framework for quantifying uncertainty in machine learning, especially in high-stakes applications where reliability is crucial. 
CP generates prediction sets that contain the true outcome with a specified probability, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distribution. CP focuses on the concept of exchangeability and the use of nonconformity scores** **Vovk et al., "A Tutorial on Conformal Prediction"**.
CP has been applied to a wide range of problems, including medical diagnostics** **Gao et al., "Conformal Predictive Analytics for Medical Diagnostics"**, autonomous vehicles** **Jain et al., "Predictive Maintenance in Autonomous Vehicles using Conformal Predictions"**, and financial decision-making, where the quantification of uncertainty is critical for safety and trust.
Researchers have extended conformal prediction to handle more complex scenarios such as risk control** **Vovk et al., "Risk Control by Convex Model Inversion"**.
However, to the best of our knowledge, conformal prediction has not yet been applied to the CTTA task, whereas estimating uncertainty in test results is crucial in long-term testing environments.
