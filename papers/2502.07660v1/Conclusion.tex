Theorem \ref{TheoremModelAxiomsVASSnz} and Theorem \ref{TheoremUseHybridizationToDecideEverything} in particular imply:

\begin{corollary}
The reachability, boundedness, semilinearity and \(\mathcal{F}\)-separability (for \(\mathcal{F}\)=Semilinear, Modulo, Unary) problems are decidable in Ackermann time for VASS and \ConsideredModel.
\end{corollary}

To achieve this we have introduced monotone \(\RelationClass\)-eVASS, indirectly also answering the question of ``What types of transitions can we allow a VASS to have while remaining decidable?'' Namely, by Theorem \ref{TheoremIdealDecompositionEVASS}, under minor assumptions on \(\RelationClass\), monotone \(\RelationClass\)-eVASS sections are approximable if and only if \(\RelationClass\) is approximable.

This leaves the following questions: 1) Can the parameterized complexity be improved? On the level of \(\RelationClass\)-eVASS, can we avoid \(+d\) for coverability? Does the index have to depend on \(k\)? Do VASSnz have lower complexity than nested \(\RelationClass\)-eVASS? In particular, one can ask about the parameterized complexity for both VASSnz and \(\RelationClass\)-eVASS.

2) Are there other applications of \(\RelationClass\)-eVASS, or other classes \(\RelationClass\) for which they are interesting to consider?

3) Are there other classes of systems which have a model of ``nice'', for example Pushdown VASS?
