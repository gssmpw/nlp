\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we propose semantic orientation, a language-grounded representation that defines object orientations via intuitive descriptors (\eg, ``plug-in direction''), bridging geometric reasoning and functional semantics. To enable this, we introduce OrienText300K, a large-scale dataset of 3D models annotated with semantic orientation. Through PointSO and the integrated \sofar system, we significantly enhance robotic manipulation capabilities, as demonstrated by strong performance in both simulated and real-world experiments.
