\section{Limitations}
% \subsection{Limitations}
% \subsubsection{Rigid Body Only}
% Despite compelling results, \sofar~shares certain limitations with prior works. 
% In most situations, it is effective for rigid bodies, and it struggles to predict semantic orientation for deformable objects due to their ambiguous definition of direction.

% \subsubsection{Execution Error by Unstable Grasp \& Perception}
% Additionally, 
One notable limitation for decoupled systems like \sofar is that the execution may fail due to a sub-module error,
\ie, robots may place target objects with an error transformation because of unstable grasping or inaccurate visual perception.
For example, the pen will be placed in an unexpected pose due to the rotation during execution.
Future works include integrating scalable data and more advanced models and exploring the potential of combining end-to-end and such decoupled methods, and expanding \sofar to more applications.

% \subsection{Future Works}
% Future work includes further expanding the OrienText300K with larger datasets like Objaverse-XL~\cite{ObjaverseXL23}, enhancing the performance of semantic orientation through self-supervised learning and pretraining methods~\cite{MAE,CLIP,ACT23,ReCon23}, and demonstrating its effectiveness in a broader range of robotic scenarios, such as navigation~\cite{GOAT24}, mobile manipulation~\cite{homerobot23}, lifelong learning~\cite{LIBERO23}, spatio-temporal reasoning~\cite{ReKep24,LeaFLF23,CrossVideoSC24,thinking24}, humanoid~\cite{OmniH2O24,SmoothHumanoidLCP24,Exbody24,humanup25}, and human-robot interaction~\cite{HOI4D22,InteractiveHO23}.
