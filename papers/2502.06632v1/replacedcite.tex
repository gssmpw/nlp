\section{Literature Review}
% \label{sec:litreview}
% In this section, we review advancements in few-shot learning. Koch et al. ____ introduced Siamese Neural Networks for one-shot image recognition. Shaban et al. ____ enhanced semantic segmentation by adapting Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) to new tasks. Snell et al. ____ proposed Prototypical Networks for classification using class-specific prototypes. Rakelly et al. ____ used support images to improve segmentation and classification.

% while Sung et al. ____ developed the Relation Network, focussing on deep distance metrics for image comparison.
