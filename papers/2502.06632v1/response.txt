\section{Literature Review}
% \label{sec:litreview}
% In this section, we review advancements in few-shot learning. Koch et al. **Koch, "Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition"** introduced Siamese Neural Networks for one-shot image recognition. Shaban et al. **Shaban, "Few-Shot Learning with Graph Augmented Convolutional Networks"** enhanced semantic segmentation by adapting Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) to new tasks. Snell et al. **Snell, "Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Learning"** proposed Prototypical Networks for classification using class-specific prototypes. Rakelly et al. **Rakelly, "Continual Few-Shot Learning"** used support images to improve segmentation and classification.

% while Sung et al. **Sung, "Learning to Compare Image Patches via Convolutional Neural Networks from Few Shots"** developed the Relation Network, focussing on deep distance metrics for image comparison.
