\section{Literature Review}
% \label{sec:litreview}
% In this section, we review advancements in few-shot learning. Koch et al. \cite{koch2015siamese} introduced Siamese Neural Networks for one-shot image recognition. Shaban et al. \cite{shaban2017one} enhanced semantic segmentation by adapting Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) to new tasks. Snell et al. \cite{snell2017prototypical} proposed Prototypical Networks for classification using class-specific prototypes. Rakelly et al. \cite{rakelly2018conditional} used support images to improve segmentation and classification.

% while Sung et al. \cite{sung2018learning} developed the Relation Network, focussing on deep distance metrics for image comparison.
