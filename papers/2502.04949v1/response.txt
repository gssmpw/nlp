\paragraph{Robust Neural SBI}
Robustness in neural SBI has become a rapidly growing area of research, with most approaches enhancing robustness for a single data set at the cost of amortization, e.g., due to additional MCMC runs or post-hoc corrections.
The majority of these approaches focuses on \textbf{Target 2} by incorporating an misspecification model **Frasca, "Robust Neural SBI with Misspecification Models"**__, shifting observed summary statistics with low support **Muller, "Shift-Aware Neural SBI"**__, reducing the influence of unmodeled data shifts via generalized SBI **Blomker et al., "Generalized Neural SBI for Robustness"**__ or using the single-data-set NPE-MMD variant previously discussed ____.
Focusing on \textbf{Target 1}, **Li et al., "Latent Space Correction for Neural SBI"** highlighted the role of the approximator's latent space in domain shifts and proposed a latent space correction based on the observed data $\x_\tobs$.
Differently, **Gorham et al., "Robust ABC with Latent Space Filtering"** focus on \textbf{Target 3} by using an upfront ABC run to filter the part of the parameter space causing the highest discrepancy between $\x$ and $\x_\tobs$.

\paragraph{Robust ABI} 
In contrast, research on robustifying inference while retaining amortization has been sparse. 
Extending the scope of the training data via additive noise
**Tucker et al., "Noisy NPE for Robust Inference"**, such as the spike-and-slab noise approach of Noisy NPE ____, can be seen as a light modification to the simulator-implied likelihood as in \textbf{Target 2}, but requires strong assumptions about the misspecification-generating process.
**Cranmer et al., "Robust ABI with Optimal Transport"** also approach \textbf{Target 2} by framing domain shift as an optimal transport problem in summary space, but this requires \emph{observed} ``ground-truth'' parameters $\thetab_\tobs^*$ that are hard to obtain in most ABI settings.
**Featherstone et al., "NPE-MMD for Robust ABI"** provided evidence for the potential of NPE-MMD for robust ABI but focused their evaluation on a gravitational lensing application with synthetically added noise.
Finally, **Frasca et al., "Efficient Regularization for Robust ABI"** proposed an efficient regularization technique that can increase robustness against adversarial attacks and thus attain more reliable performance under \textbf{Target 1}.
