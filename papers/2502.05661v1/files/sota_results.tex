Unlike German datasets such as RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T~\cite{camgoz_neural_2018} and the public DGS corpus~\cite{hanke2020extending}, which are widely used and frequently reported in the literature~\cite{chen2022two,yin2023gloss,li2020tspnet,saunders_progressive_2020}, there is comparatively less work utilizing ASL datasets. We summarize the existing translation results for ASL in Table~\ref{tab:text-to-gloss_sota}.
