\subsection{Section 1 (Visual and Motion Quality)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How easy is it to understand this video? (0  = Very Hard, 1 = Hard, 2 = Neutral, 3 = Easy, 4 = Very Easy)
    \item If it is not easy to understand, what could be improved? (Open-ended question)

    \item If the visual quality is not good or excellent, what could be improved? (Open-ended question)
    \item Rate how natural the motion is. For example, do the movements and transitions look realistic, and are the signs produced in a typical way? (0 = Very Poor, 1 = Poor, 2 = Neutral, 3 = Good, 4 = Excellent)
    \item If motion quality is not good or excellent, what could be improved? (Open-ended question)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Section 2 (Translation Quality)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Translate the ASL in this video into English. (Open-ended question)

    \item If you choose other, what else made it hard to understand? (Open-ended question)

\subsection{Follow-up Questions and Demographics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The following questions ask about your interest in AI Signing technology. First, imaging a version of this technology that is ``nearly perfect,'' meaning the videos are understandable, natural, and accurate. Answer the following with this perfect technology in mind.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Can you image using this technology to supplement existing live interpreters, for example they were not available or for use cases where interpreters might not be possible. (Never, Rarely, Maybe, Sometimes, Often)
        \item Where might you be interested in seeing AI Signing technology? What specific applications or use cases? (Open-ended question)
        \item Why are you interested in these use cases? (Open-ended question)
    \end{itemize}
    \item All of the videos in this study are meant to look like a live ASL signer. THere are alternatives, for example if the human was stylized or had a cartoon-like look. What is your interest in these styles? Assume that both versions would be capable of all signing motions needed for ASL. (All open-ended questions)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For what applications or purposes, if any, would you prefer video with the ``live ASL signer'' look? 
        \item Why do you think this? 
        \item For what applications or purposes, if any, would you prefer video that looked like a cartoon or 3D avatar?
