    \caption{Our system translates English text into a photorealistic ASL video with non-manual information. It starts with an English text input (first row), generates ASL tokens capturing both manual and non-manual details (second row), produces a skeletal pose sequence (third row), and finally creates the photorealistic ASL video (fourth row). \han{@all, please check the stylization.}}
    % \han{should we have a longer sentence? Ideally has 6-7 video frames. Still working on stylization...} \rotem{thinking about it again, instead of putting it here, I would have 1-2 examples here- only text->gloss->ours with expressions (or through pose), then have a no expression vs expression fig later on in the paper..}}
