\begin{table*}[htb!]
\caption{Evaluation results of translating English text into glosses (Task on the left side in Module 1) using RAG. \bm{$^*$}All BLEU-4 and SacreBLEU scores are identical. \bm{$\uparrow$} indicates that higher values represent better performance, while \bm{$\downarrow$} indicates that lower values represent better performance. Best results in \textbf{bold}. The presented results are $mean\pm std$ across 10 repetitions of test set evaluation. Note: If ``Anonymized Embeddings'' is set to ``No'', RAG was performed using embeddings of the original data, else, it was performed using embeddings of the anonymized data.
\Description[This table presents evaluation results of translating English text to English-based glosses. The first row contains ten headers, including number of examples, anonymized embeddings, bleu-1, bleu-2, bleu-3, bleu-4, rouge-l, meteor, chrf, and ter. Regarding the columns, the first column shows number of used examples, where the first row is for using 1474 (all examples -not using RAG) and the other rows are for using 200, 100, and 50 examples. The second column, anonymized embeddings, indicates whether anonymized embeddings are used (yes or no). The remaining columns display various evaluation metrics with the symbol uparrow indicating higher values are better, and downarrow indicating lower values are better. Key findings are: presenting the model with less examples that are more relevant yields better results than using all examples. Moreover, in most cases using less examples (n=50) gives better results than using more examples (e.g. 100, 200). However, for some metrics (ROUGE, TER) using more examples gives better results. The best scores are bolded across all metrics, indicating the optimal settings for this translation model.]}\label{tab:text-to-gloss_RAG_eval_results_appx}
