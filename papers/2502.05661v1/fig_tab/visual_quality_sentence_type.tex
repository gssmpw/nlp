    \caption{Violin plot illustrating the estimated marginal means for visual quality ratings by sentence type. Wh- and yes-no questions exhibit the highest visual quality ratings, whereas conditional sentences display the lowest ratings (all p values < .001). Error bars show 95\% confidence intervals. 
    \Description[This figure presents a violin plot showing the relationship between sentence type and visual quality ratings. The x-axis categorizes different sentence types, including conditional sentences ('condition_if'), yes-no questions ('ynq'), wh-questions ('whq'), other sentence types ('other'), and fingerspelling ('fs'). The y-axis represents estimated marginal means of visual quality ratings, with higher values indicating better quality. The plot reveals that wh-questions and yes-no questions achieve the highest visual quality ratings, as indicated by their higher central markers and broader density at the top. In contrast, conditional sentences tend to have the lowest visual quality ratings, as seen in their lower central markers and density concentrated near the bottom. ]}
