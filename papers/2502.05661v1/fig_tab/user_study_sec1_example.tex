    \Description[This figure contains an example screen from section 1 of our survey. It includes two main sub-figures. The left sub-figure is the video presented to participants, it contains a video frame with a blurred face of a generated human-realistic AI signer. The video was generated using data from the How2Sign dataset. The right sub-figure is the follow-up questions related to the video shown to participants. The questions ask participants to evaluate the video based on: how easy it is to understand (rated from very hard to very easy); the visual quality of the signing (rated from very poor to excellent); and the naturalness of motion (rated from very hard to very easy). Each question includes a scale and an optional text box for participants to suggest improvements if they rated the video negatively in any aspect.]}
