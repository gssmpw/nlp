    \caption{Violin plot illustrating the estimated marginal means for translation quality ratings by model type. \textit{AI (Full)} and \textit{AI (w/o Expressions)} were rated significantly more accurate than \textit{AI (Annotations)}, with no significant difference between them. Error bars represent 95\% confidence intervals. While \textit{Raw Video} was rated significantly better than other models, only significance among the other three models is marked for visual simplicity.
    \Description[This figure is a violin plot displaying the estimated marginal means of Average Translation Rating for different translation methods: AI (Annotations), AI (w/o Expr), AI (Full), and Raw Video. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 4, representing the average rating. The mean rating for each method is indicated by a dot and its numerical value is displayed (e.g., AI (Annotations): 3.15, AI (w/o Expr): 3.55, AI (Full): 3.42, Raw Video: 3.89). Vertical lines show the confidence intervals around the mean. A statistically significant difference is marked between the AI (Annotations) and AI (w/o Expr) conditions, as indicated by asterisks.]}
