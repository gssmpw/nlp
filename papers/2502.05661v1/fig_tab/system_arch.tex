    \caption{Our prototype includes three self-contained modules. It takes an English sentence as input and generates an ASL video (from top to bottom). Module 1 utilizes a large language model (LLM) to translate the English input into an ASL gloss string and predict non-manual markers. Module 2 employs a Motion Matching approach to generate a skeletal pose sequence from the output of Module 1. Finally, Module 3 uses a UNet-like model, which given an individual signer's appearance and style (Signer ID), transforms the skeletal pose sequence into signing frames. These are then combined to produce the final signing video. 
    \Description[The figure depicts the architecture of our system for generating American Sign Language (ASL) videos from English text, divided into three modules. The first module translates English sentences into ASL glosses and predicts non-manual markers like facial expressions and head movements using a large language model and specific questions. The second module converts the gloss strings into skeletal poses through motion matching and blending techniques to integrate both manual and non-manual components. The third module uses a U-Net-like model to transform these skeletal poses into video frames, refining the visual details based on the signerâ€™s appearance and style. The final output is a video of a photorealsitic AI signer performing ASL, reflecting the original English input.]
