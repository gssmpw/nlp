abstract = {The Hippocratic Oath has guided the conduct of physicians for centuries. Inspired by its tenet of preserving privacy, we argue that future database systems must include responsibility for the privacy of data they manage as a founding tenet. We enunciate the key privacy principles for such Hippocratic database systems. We propose a strawman design for Hippocratic databases, identify the technical challenges and problems in designing such databases, and suggest some approaches that may lead to solutions. Our hope is that this paper will serve to catalyze a fruitful and exciting direction for future database research.},

abstract="The development of privacy-preserving data management techniques has been the focus of intense research in the last few years. Such research has resulted in important notions and techniques, such as the notions of Hippocratic database systems and k-anonymity, and various privacy-preserving data mining techniques. However, much work still needs to be carried out to develop high assurance privacy-preserving database management systems. An important requirement in the development of such systems is the need of providing comprehensive and accurate privacy-related metadata, such as data usage purposes. Such metadata represent the core of access control mechanisms specifically tailored towards privacy. In this talk we address such issue. We present a comprehensive approach for privacy preserving access control based on the notion of purpose. Purpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of the data element. Purpose information represents an important form of metadata, because data usage purpose is very often part of privacy policies, such as the case of policies expressed according to P3P. A key feature of our model is that it allows multiple purposes to be associated with each data element and it also supports explicit prohibitions, thus allowing privacy officers to specify that some data should not be used for certain purposes. Another important issue to be addressed is the granularity of data labeling, that is, the units of data with which purposes can be associated. We address this issue in the context of relational databases and propose four different labeling schemes, each providing a different granularity. In the paper we also propose an approach to representing purpose information, which results in very low storage overhead, and we exploit query modification techniques to support data access control based on purpose information. We conclude the talk by outlining future work that includes the application of our purpose management techniques to complex data and its integration into RBAC.",

abstract = {As privacy becomes a major concern for both consumers and enterprises, many research efforts have been devoted to the development of privacy protecting technology. We recently proposed a privacy preserving access control model for relational databases,where purpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of the data element. In this paper, we extend our previous work to handle other advanced data managementsystems, such as the ones based on XML and the ones based on the object-relational data model. Another contribution of our paper isthat we address the problem of how to determine the purpose forwhich certain data are accessed by a given user. Our proposedsolution relies on the well-known RBAC model as well as the notionof conditional role which is based on the notions of role attributeand system attribute.},

abstract = {Current day database applications, with large numbers of users, require fine-grained access control mechanisms, at the level of individual tuples, not just entire relations/views, to control which parts of the data can be accessed by each user. Fine-grained access control is often enforced in the application code, which has numerous drawbacks; these can be avoided by specifying/enforcing access control at the database level. We present a novel fine-grained access control model based on authorization views that allows "authorization-transparent" querying; that is, user queries can be phrased in terms of the database relations, and are valid if they can be answered using only the information contained in these authorization views. We extend earlier work on authorization-transparent querying by introducing a new notion of validity, conditional validity. We give a powerful set of inference rules to check for query validity. We demonstrate the practicality of our techniques by describing how an existing query optimizer can be extended to perform access control checks by incorporating these inference rules.},

The scheme can be applied to any relational data base management system and has several advantages over other suggested schemes.These include:a) implementation easeb) small execution time overheadc) powerful and flexible controlsd) conceptual simplicityThe basic idea utilized is that a user interaction with the data base is modified to an alternate form which is guaranteed to have no access violations. This modification takes place in a high level interaction language. Hence, the processing of a resulting interaction can be accomplished with no further regard for protection. In particular, any procedure calls in the access paths for control purposes, such as in [1,2], are avoided.},
