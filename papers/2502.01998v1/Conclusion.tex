\section{Conclusions And Future Work}
We have presented Data Guard - a fine-grained access control system for large data warehouses. Data Guard's policy language supports specification of access-control rules based on semantic labels used to describe data present in the warehouse tables. Data Guard's policy compiler translates these policies into SQL views which encode the data-masking logic. Further, Data Guard transparently routes table accesses to the appropriate data-masking views based on the accessor's purpose, thus supporting purpose-based access control. Data Guard has been deployed at-scale in LinkedIn and is the primary policy enforcement mechanism for accesses to warehouse tables. There are a number of avenues for further optimizing the performance of Data Guard's data-masking operator as highlighted in the paper. We also plan to enhance Data Guard to support additional capabilities to enable privacy-enhancing technologies such as anonymization and differential privacy, and encryption for data storage.
