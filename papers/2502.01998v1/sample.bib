abstract = {Current day database applications, with large numbers of users, require fine-grained access control mechanisms, at the level of individual tuples, not just entire relations/views, to control which parts of the data can be accessed by each user. Fine-grained access control is often enforced in the application code, which has numerous drawbacks; these can be avoided by specifying/enforcing access control at the database level. We present a novel fine-grained access control model based on authorization views that allows "authorization-transparent" querying; that is, user queries can be phrased in terms of the database relations, and are valid if they can be answered using only the information contained in these authorization views. We extend earlier work on authorization-transparent querying by introducing a new notion of validity, conditional validity. We give a powerful set of inference rules to check for query validity. We demonstrate the practicality of our techniques by describing how an existing query optimizer can be extended to perform access control checks by incorporating these inference rules.},

The scheme can be applied to any relational data base management system and has several advantages over other suggested schemes.These include:a) implementation easeb) small execution time overheadc) powerful and flexible controlsd) conceptual simplicityThe basic idea utilized is that a user interaction with the data base is modified to an alternate form which is guaranteed to have no access violations. This modification takes place in a high level interaction language. Hence, the processing of a resulting interaction can be accomplished with no further regard for protection. In particular, any procedure calls in the access paths for control purposes, such as in [1,2], are avoided.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a comprehensive approach for privacy preserving access control based on the notion of purpose. In our model, purpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of the data element. A key feature of our model is that it allows multiple purposes to be associated with each data element and also supports explicit prohibitions, thus allowing privacy officers to specify that some data should not be used for certain purposes. An important issue addressed in this article is the granularity of data labeling, i.e., the units of data with which purposes can be associated. We address this issue in the context of relational databases and propose four different labeling schemes, each providing a different granularity. We also propose an approach to represent purpose information, which results in low storage overhead, and we exploit query modification techniques to support access control based on purpose information. Another contribution of our work is that we address the problem of how to determine the purpose for which certain data are accessed by a given user.

abstract="The development of privacy-preserving data management techniques has been the focus of intense research in the last few years. Such research has resulted in important notions and techniques, such as the notions of Hippocratic database systems and k-anonymity, and various privacy-preserving data mining techniques. However, much work still needs to be carried out to develop high assurance privacy-preserving database management systems. An important requirement in the development of such systems is the need of providing comprehensive and accurate privacy-related metadata, such as data usage purposes. Such metadata represent the core of access control mechanisms specifically tailored towards privacy. In this talk we address such issue. We present a comprehensive approach for privacy preserving access control based on the notion of purpose. Purpose information associated with a given data element specifies the intended use of the data element. Purpose information represents an important form of metadata, because data usage purpose is very often part of privacy policies, such as the case of policies expressed according to P3P. A key feature of our model is that it allows multiple purposes to be associated with each data element and it also supports explicit prohibitions, thus allowing privacy officers to specify that some data should not be used for certain purposes. Another important issue to be addressed is the granularity of data labeling, that is, the units of data with which purposes can be associated. We address this issue in the context of relational databases and propose four different labeling schemes, each providing a different granularity. In the paper we also propose an approach to representing purpose information, which results in very low storage overhead, and we exploit query modification techniques to support data access control based on purpose information. We conclude the talk by outlining future work that includes the application of our purpose management techniques to complex data and its integration into RBAC.",

Pre-obligations, post-obligations, conditional obligations, and repeating obligations are supported by the obligation model. Interaction between permissions and obligations is discussed, and efficient algorithms are provided to detect undesired effects.},

abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

abstract = {The nested relational model provides a better representational model for complex objects than the (flat) relational model by allowing relations to have relation-valued attributes. A recursive algebra for nested relations that allows relations to be accessed and modified at all levels without always having to flatten them is presented in this paper. The operators of the classical nested relational algebra are extended with recursive definitions so that they can be applied not only to relations but also to subrelations of a relation. Queries are much more efficient and succinct when expressed in this algebra than in languages that require restructuring in order to access subrelations of relations. A sketch of a proof showing the equivalence of the expressive powers of the recursive algebra and the nested relational algebra is given.}
