Scenario Description Languages (SDLs) serve as high-level embeddings, offering an interpretable representation of traffic situations encountered by autonomous vehicles (AVs). 
Their utility extends to critical safety analyses, such as identifying analogous traffic scenarios within vast AV datasets, and aiding in real-to-simulation transfers. 
This paper addresses the challenging task of autonomously deriving SDL embeddings from AV trajectory data. 
We introduce the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline, using rules-based automata to automatically extract SDL embeddings from any trajectory.
This method is highly adaptable, using parameters that are derived directly from the dataset it operates on.
Our methodology draws upon the Waymo Open Motion Dataset to find similar scenarios.
The results reveal that the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline returns trajectories showing similar behavior better than traditional trajectory similarity metrics.
We also demonstrate that our method can be used to automatically identify scenarios of interest from a large corpus of data, enabling easier detection of unexpected behavior.
