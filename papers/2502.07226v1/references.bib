  abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated framework for operational flexibility assessment in power system planning with a significant share of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). The framework proposed includes: (i) the formulation of an integrated generation expansion planning (GEP) and unit commitment (UC) model accounting for key short-term technical constraints, (ii) the elaboration of accurate and systematic horizon reduction methods to alleviate the computational burden of the resulting large-sized optimization problems and (iii) the definition of suitable metrics for the operational flexibility assessment of the obtained plans. The framework is applied to a ten year planning horizon of a realistically sized case study representing the national power system of France, under several scenarios of RES penetration levels and carbon limits, spanning levels of up to 50\%. The importance of incorporating the detailed short-term constraints within long-term planning models is shown. The results of the assessment show that, under high renewable energy penetration, neglecting the short-term constraints may lead to plans significantly short on flexibility, reaching shortage levels of up to 50\% in frequency and several GWs in magnitude. Also, the load not served reaches levels of up to 3\% and carbon emission is underestimated by up to 60\%. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of relying on suitable quantitative metrics for operational flexibility assessment in power systems planning rather than solely relying on generic performance measures, such as system costs and mixes of power plants, which are shown not to sufficiently reflect the flexibility levels of the obtained plans.},

  abstract = {The electric grid had become a vast complex cyber-physical system, and its digitalization is a reality in the close future that would result in a tremendous amount of information, controls, and uncertainties. Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed generation (DG), demand response (DR), distributed energy storage systems (DESS), and electric vehicle (EV) are increasing the level of uncertainty but also the capabilities of new controls on the distribution networks. The future electric grid will need more flexibility and coordination between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) to be able to operate in a reliable, secure and economical fashion. To overcome uncertainties and reliability issues, DSO is moving toward the so-called active distribution network (ADN) which is the crucial piece of for enabling new flexibility at the TSO level. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the estimation of the ADNs flexibility based on the feasibility region at the TSO-DSO interface. A Monte Carlo sampling method is applied to generate random ADN states. The proposed methodology is analyzed in both the 5-bus ring distribution test system and the 33-bus IEEE radial distribution system.},

The meteorological context is of high relevance in such a problem, but it is frequently analysed separately from electrical considerations. However, a few studies have combined both sides of the problem, thus providing valuable references for examining their interdependencies. Therefore, this review focuses on this set of studies to explore the use of meteorological information in the analysis of cloud-induced photovoltaic transients in terms of scales, elements, and objectives under consideration. This examination shows the dependence of the results on the chosen context, allowing for the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. On this basis, some recommendations for future work are drawn, such as the use of spatiotemporal descriptions of cloud passage, description of the meteorological scenario for an adequate interpretation of results, and necessity of holistic approaches to integrate advances from the meteorological and electrical perspectives of the problem.},

Inability or inadequacy of these resources in providing inertial and primary frequency responses is one of the important challenges. In this paper, this issue is addressed within the framework of security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) by adding new constraints representing the system frequency response. A modified system frequency response model is first derived and used to find analytical representation of system minimum frequency in thermal-dominant multi-machine systems. Then, an effective piecewise linearization (PWL) technique is employed to linearize the nonlinear function representing the minimum system frequency, facilitating its integration in the SCUC problem. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem which is solved efficiently by available commercial solvers. The results indicate that the proposed method can be utilized to integrate renewable resources into power systems without violating system frequency limits.},

Despite its short timespan, the synergetic application of deep learning to inverse molecular design has outpaced decades of theoretical efforts, bearing promise to transform current molecular design paradigms. Herein, we provide an overview of the element of computational inverse molecular design and offer our views on current limitations and outstanding challenges. In our perspective, three main directions are identified for each element and analyzed in terms of their merits and relevant novel deep learning developments. For the molecular represen\- tations element, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), grids, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are discussed for enhancing the expressivity, complexity, descriptivity of relevant molecular information, respectively. Second, chemical text mining, accelerated quantum chemical calculations, and transfer learning are explored to augment the size and the accuracy of current property data and predictive models. Last, emerging trends in design methods including generative modeling, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning (AL) are examined for optimizing not only computational costs, but also experimental and simulation efforts. The presented discussions are aimed at catalyzing progress and interdisciplinary collaborations toward general-purpose inverse design frameworks.},

In this paper, the value of an integrated approach for operating gas and electricity systems is assessed. An outer approximation with equality relaxation (OA/ER) method is used to deal with the optimization class of the mixed-integer non-linear problem of the integrated operation of gas and electricity systems. This method significantly improved the efficiency of the solution algorithm and achieved a nearly 40\% reduction in computation time compared to successive linear programming. The value of flexibility technologies, including flexible gas compressors, demand-side response, battery storage, and power-to-gas, is quantified in the operation of integrated gas and electricity systems in GB 2030 energy scenarios for different renewable generation penetration levels. The modeling demonstrates that the flexibility options will enable significant cost savings in the annual operational costs of gas and electricity systems (up to 21\%). On the other hand, the analysis carried out indicates that deployment of flexibility technologies appropriately supports the interaction between gas and electricity systems.},

For this purpose, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) topology is trained with an Adversarial loss in order to produce realistic future frames of the input image sequences. The prediction of future frames is incurred by two different approaches. In the first approach, a network is receiving 4 frames and predicting the next frame and in the second approach, given a sequence of 8 input images a network is predicting the next 8 frames. In order to evaluate the quality of the generated images, a criterion based on cloud coverage is proposed. This cloud coverage metric provides an objective criterion for assessing the quality of the generated sky images, especially in the presence of clouds.},

  abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESS) have the potential to make a significant contribution to planning and operation practises in power systems. While ESS can be used to provide multiple benefits in the power sector, widespread use has been restricted by high technology costs, lack of deployment experience, and the barriers and uncertainties caused by the present electricity market and regulatory structures that were designed for conventional electricity systems. This paper reviews countries with high renewable targets and with significant current or planned ESS deployments to ascertain the common problems affecting the use of ESS on the grid, and to establish where changes have been made or proposed to the electricity market and regulatory frameworks. Three major problems were identified as the undetermined asset class for ESS and unbundled electricity system limiting stakeholders from determining and realising multiple ESS benefits; low electricity market liquidity and changing market conditions; and a lack of common standards and procedures for evaluating, connecting, operating and maintaining ESS. Based on the established barriers, recommendations to update or create policies, regulation and market arrangements to increase the viability and wider use of grid level ESS are discussed. The three key regulatory and policy recommendations were identified as an alignment of renewable policies to that of ESS; creating a separate asset class for ESS and associated rules for regulated and competitive operations; and standardising assessment frameworks, connection and operational procedures for the use of ESS. Finally, three main electricity market recommendations include updating rules to support simultaneous ESS operation across wholesale, ancillary services and capacity markets; updating market rules to allow compensation for flexible and highly accurate responsive demand and generation technologies, such as ESS; and updating market ancillary services energy requirements.},

This obscure issue reaches even more unknown depths in the multi-period (MP) setting, where intertemporality hinders the design of a clear pricing framework. This letter builds on the author's previous work, which proposed a novel methodology for the one-to-one flexibility-to-cost mapping in grid-friendly smart sustainable buildings (GF-SSBs), and discusses alternatives for mapping MP flexibility envelope to costs in practice. Their comparison provides key insights into how different cost structures may affect end-user behavior and the grid's ability to procure flexibility. This letter hopes to kick-start the discussion around ``fair'' or intrinsic flexibility value, an issue that has largely been sidelined.},

The natural gas transmission network constraints and the use of natural gas for other types of loads can affect the delivery of natural gas to generation units. These interdependencies will affect the power system security and economics in day-ahead and real-time operations. Hence, it is imperative to analyze the impact of natural gas network constraints on the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem. In particular, it is important to include natural gas and electricity network transients in the integrated system security because the impacts of any disturbances propagate at two distinctly different speeds in natural gas and electricity networks. Thus, analyzing the transient behavior of the natural gas network on the security of natural gas power plants would be essential as these plants are considered to be very flexible in electricity networks. This paper presents a method for solving the SCUC problem considering the transient behavior of the natural gas transmission network. The applicability of the presented method and the accuracy of the proposed solution are demonstrated for the IEEE 118-bus power system, which is linked with the natural gas transmission system and the results are discussed in this paper.},

This is done while considering any finite number of FR services with distinguished characteristics, such as different delivery times and activation delays. The problem defined by these frequency-security constraints can be formulated as a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Program (MISOCP), which can be efficiently handled by off-the-shelf conic optimization solvers. This paper also takes into account the uncertainty in inertia contribution from the demand side by formulating the frequency-security conditions as chance constraints, for which an exact convex reformulation is provided.

The number of operations for a given order (N) of fit has been reduced from N*to N:. resulting in a substantial reduction in computer execution time. A comparison was made between the algorithm described here and the well-known algorithm of J. C. Davis. From a 50 x 50 grid (2500 data points), computing the coetlicients for degrees 1-10 took 2.84rain with our program and 1.4h with the Davis program on an IBM AT microcomputer.

We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of ``thick'' facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

The study focuses on the specific application of a large scale grid-connected PV farm. Solar resource is largely underexploited worldwide whereas it exceeds by far humans' energy needs. In the current context of global warming, PV energy could potentially play a major role to substitute fossil fuels within the main grid in the future. Indeed, the number of utility-scale PV farms is currently fast increasing globally, with planned capacities in excess of several hundred megawatts. This makes the cost of PV-generated electricity quickly plummet and reach parity with non-renewable resources. However, like many other renewable energy sources, PV power depends highly on weather conditions. This particularity makes PV energy difficult to dispatch unless a properly sized and controlled energy storage system (ESU) is used. An accurate power forecasting method is then required to ensure power continuity but also to manage the ramp rates of the overall power system. In order to perform these actions, the forecasting timeframe also called horizon must be first defined according to the grid operation that is considered. This leads to define both spatial and temporal resolutions. As a second step, an adequate source of input data must be selected. As a third step, the input data must be processed with statistical methods. Finally, the processed data are fed to a precise PV model. It is found that forecasting the irradiance and the cell temperature are the best approaches to forecast precisely swift PV power fluctuations due to the cloud cover. A combination of several sources of input data like satellite and land-based sky imaging also lead to the best results for very-short term forecasting.},

The virtual power plant comprises a conventional power plant, an energy storage facility, a wind power unit, and a flexible demand. This multi-component system participates in energy and reserve electricity markets as a single entity in order to optimize the use of energy resources. As a salient feature, the proposed model considers the uncertainty associated with the virtual power plant being called upon by the system operator to deploy reserves. In addition, uncertainty in available wind power generation and requests for reserve deployment is modeled using confidence bounds and intervals, respectively, while uncertainty in market prices is modeled using scenarios. The resulting model is thus cast as a stochastic adaptive robust optimization problem, which is solved using a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Results from a case study illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  year = {2017},
  journal = {ProQuest Dissertations and Theses},
  abstract = {Aggregations of flexible loads can provide several power system services through demand response programs, for example load shifting and curtailment. The capabilities of demand response should therefore be represented in system operators' planning and operational routines. However, incorporating models of every load in an aggregation into these routines could compromise their tractability by adding exorbitant numbers of new variables and constraints. We propose a novel approximation for concisely representing the capabilities of a heterogeneous aggregation of flexible loads. We assume that each load is mathematically described by a convex polytope, i.e., a set of linear constraints. We discuss the polytopic formulation of many classes of loads including deferrable loads, thermostatically controlled loads, and generic energy storage. The set-wise sum of the loads is the Minkowski sum, which is in general computationally intractable. In this thesis, we develop a new outer approximation of the Minkowski sum. The new approximation is applicable for linear constraints, is easily computable, and only uses one variable per time period corresponding to the aggregation's net power usage. We prove that the approximation is exact when applied to deferrable loads without power constraints and loads modelled for two time periods only. Additionally, numerical results indicate that the approximation is accurate for broad classes of loads. We also develop a tightening procedure to further improve upon the accuracy of the approximation. Following, we extend the above approximation to semidefinite constraints and second-order cone constraints. The approximation is extended to loads that do not have matching constraints via the use of the Gershgorin circle theorem. This extension allows for the modelling of loads with apparent power constraints or for stochastic loads modelled with chance constraints. Numerical results are shown for the case where load charging efficiency and total energy demand are taken as stochastic quantities. Finally, we consider the problem of finding inner approximation to load models. We use an ellipsoidal projection technique to find the maximum inscribed ellipsoid for the Minkowski sum of several loads. We perform numerical simulations to illustrate the technique.},

Building occupants affect building energy use directly and indirectly by interacting with building energy systems, for example, by adjusting thermostats, switching lights on/off, using electrical devices and opening/closing windows. The occupants' daily activity profiles and occupancy patterns clearly shape the timing and magnitude of energy demand in households. Modelling energy-related human activities throughout the day, therefore, is a crucial task for prediction of energy use and, consequently, to reduce the gap between real and predicted building energy use. This study modelled data gathered in the diary-based Danish Time Use Survey (TUS) 2008/09 of 9640 individuals from 4679 households. Individuals' daily activities were logged in 10-min time increments for 24~h, starting and ending at 04:00, during both weekdays and weekends. The aims of this study were to (i) profile energy-related daily activities of occupants during different seasons and weekdays/weekends (ii) investigate time-related characteristics of activities such as starting and ending times and durations, and (iii) profile occupancy patterns for weekdays/weekends for different household types. The outcomes provide valuable input for building energy simulation for bridging the gap between simulated and real energy consumption in the Danish residential sector; typical occupancy profiles for different household types for different days of the week are freely available online [1].},

However, the volatile nature of these renewable sources can lead to stability issues. Therefore, countermeasures must be integrated into modern electricity grids to maintain stability.

Furthermore, these optimization problems often require forecasts that are tailored to deliver value for the considered optimization problem. Nevertheless, existing applications of decision-focused learning to provide this value scale poorly for energy system optimization problems. Therefore, we propose a novel method called Decision-Focused Retraining that combines prediction-focused learning and decision-focused learning. In this method, an existing forecasting model is retrained to generate forecasts delivering increased value for the optimization problem. First, a prediction-focused learning approach with a suitable base loss is used to pre-train the forecasting model. Afterward, the model is fine-tuned by combining a global instance-independent surrogate NN with the prediction-focused base loss to optimize the forecasting model. We evaluate our approach on an exemplary optimization problem, the dispatchable feeder optimization problem, considering over 199 buildings, which leads to an improvement of at least 7.29\%.},

  abstract = {In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) systems have shown impressive performance and remarkable achievements. Many achievements can be attributed to combining RL with deep learning. However, those systems lack explainability, which refers to our understanding of the system's decision-making process. In response to this challenge, the new explainable RL (XRL) field has emerged and grown rapidly to help us understand RL systems. This systematic literature review aims to give a unified view of the field by reviewing ten existing XRL literature reviews and 189 XRL studies from the past five years. Furthermore, we seek to organize these studies into a new taxonomy, discuss each area in detail, and draw connections between methods and stakeholder questions (e.g., ``how can I get the agent to do \_?''). Finally, we look at the research trends in XRL, recommend XRL methods, and present some exciting research directions for future research. We hope stakeholders, such as RL researchers and practitioners, will utilize this literature review as a comprehensive resource to overview existing state-of-the-art XRL methods. Additionally, we strive to help find research gaps and quickly identify methods that answer stakeholder questions.},

  abstract = {Everyone makes decisions, but not everyone is a decision analyst. A decision analyst uses quantitative models and computational methods to formulate decision algorithms, assess decision performance, identify and evaluate options, determine trade-offs and risks, evaluate strategies for investigation, and so on. This book is written for decision analysts. The term "decision analyst" covers an extremely broad range of practitioners. Virtually all engineers involved in design (of buildings, machines, processes, etc.) or analysis (of safety, reliability, feasibility, etc.) are decision analysts, usually without calling themselves by this name. In addition to engineers, decision analysts work in planning offices for public agencies, in project management consultancies, they are engaged in manufacturing process planning and control, in financial planning and economic analysis, in decision support for medical or technological diagnosis, and so on and on. Decision analysts provide quantitative support for the decision-making process in all areas where systematic decisions are made. This second edition entails changes of several sorts. First, info-gap theory has found application in several new areas - especially biological conservation, economic policy formulation, preparedness against terrorism, and medical decision-making. Pertinent new examples have been included. Second, the combination of info-gap analysis with probabilistic decision algorithms has found wide application. Consequently "hybrid" models of uncertainty, which were treated exclusively in a separate chapter in the previous edition, now appear throughout the book as well as in a separate chapter. Finally, info-gap explanations of robust-satisficing behavior, and especially the Ellsberg and Allais "paradoxes", are discussed in a new chapter together with a theorem indicating when robust-satisficing will have greater probability of success than direct optimizing with uncertain models. * New theory developed syst ematically. * Many examples from diverse disciplines. * Realistic representation of severe uncertainty. * Multi-faceted approach to risk. * Quantitative model-based decision theory.

In the past, inorganic-binding peptides have been found predominantly through peptide library screening. While this method has successfully identified peptides that bind to a variety of materials, an alternative design approach that can intelligently search for peptides and provide physical insight for peptide affinity would be desirable. In this work, we develop a computational, physics-based approach to design inorganic-binding peptides, focusing on peptides that bind to the common plastics polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(ethylene terephthalate). The PepBD algorithm, a Monte Carlo method that samples peptide sequence and conformational space, was modified to include simulated annealing, relax hydration constraints, and an ensemble of conformations to initiate design. These modifications led to the discovery of peptides with significantly better scores compared to those obtained using the original PepBD. PepBD scores were found to improve with increasing van der Waals interactions, although strengthening the intermolecular van der Waals interactions comes at the cost of introducing unfavorable electrostatic interactions. The best designs are enriched in amino acids with bulky side chains and possess hydrophobic and hydrophilic patches whose location depends on the adsorbed conformation. Future work will evaluate the top peptide designs in molecular dynamics simulations and experiment, enabling their application in microplastic pollution remediation and plastic-based biosensors.},

They also proposed finite element methods combined with Newton-like algorithms for numerical solution. The main goal of the present paper is to include into the above formulation the usual devices existing in a gas transmission network other than pipelines, namely, compressors, pressure control valves (PCV), flow control valves (FCV) and resistors. One of the main novelties of this paper is that, unlike many related ones, all of the above devices are modelled as nodes instead of edges of the graph which makes numerical solution simpler and computationally cheaper. This is the case, for instance, in the frequent situation where there are many valves in the network but only a few of them are working in each specific simulation scenario. Instead of introducing one edge per valve in the graph, we only consider that, at specific time intervals, some valves are acting which leads to simple modifications in the discrete system which are made dynamically and locally. An interesting feature of the full discrete model is that mass conservation is exactly preserved which is a very important issue, particularly for long time simulations.},

We introduce novel architectural elements that make the model highly efficient and flexible to long sequences. The architecture of ProteinBERT consists of both local and global representations, allowing end-to-end processing of these types of inputs and outputs. ProteinBERT obtains near state-of-the-art performance, and sometimes exceeds it, on multiple benchmarks covering diverse protein properties (including protein structure, post-translational modifications and biophysical attributes), despite using a far smaller and faster model than competing deep-learning methods. Overall, ProteinBERT provides an efficient framework for rapidly training protein predictors, even with limited labeled data.Code and pretrained model weights are available at https://github.com/nadavbra/protein\_bert.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here, we adapt Input Convex Neural Networks that are generally only convex for one-step predictions, for use in building MPC. We introduce additional constraints to their structure and weights to achieve a convex input-output relationship for multistep ahead predictions. We assess the consequences of the additional constraints for the model accuracy and test the models in a real-life MPC experiment in an apartment in Switzerland. In two five-day cooling experiments, MPC with Input Convex Neural Networks is able to keep room temperatures within comfort constraints while minimizing cooling energy consumption.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a robust topology changeaware distribution system state estimation (DSSE) method based on a physics-informed graph neural network and Bayesian Probability Weighted Averaging (BPWA). A general state estimator is first built utilizing a graph attention network to learn the nonlinear mapping functions under different distribution network topologies. During this stage, the topology information is embedded in the neural network and the attention mechanism is employed to capture collaborative signals and discriminate the importance of neighboring buses. Then, the BPWA method allows assigning proper weights for the state estimation results under different topologies, which finally yields a single consensus solution via the sparse training samples under the new topology. The physics-informed mechanism enables the proposed method to embed the topology knowledge in the neural network while fully exploiting the value of historical data. Robustness to anomalous measurements is achieved through the embedding of physics knowledge. The application of the BPWA method further allows the proposed method to achieve faster adaptation to topology change and quantification of the estimation uncertainties by measurement errors. MATLAB and Python are used to carry out the comparative tests to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.},

While the IES significantly improves energy efficiency, the interaction between different energy systems may also bring multiple operational risks to the reliability of the energy supply, which necessitates an effective IES reliability assessment technique. Considering the dynamic characteristics of gas and heat systems can reduce energy losses during contingencies, which provides an instrument to improve the IES reliability. This paper for the first time contributes to a novel emergency dispatch formulation based on the IES dynamic optimal energy flow (OEF). A reliability assessment framework for IES is proposed by combining the IES dynamic OEF and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). By taking into account the emergency dispatch formulation, the unreliability degree of IES can be mitigated. The IES dynamic OEF model is transformed into a linear programming problem under reasonable assumptions and simplifications due to its high degree of nonlinearity. Several novel reliability indices for heat system are proposed by incorporating the impacts of the IES dynamic characteristics on the reliability. The proposed model and method are validated by using an integrated gas, power and heat testing system.},

With the GBNNM, both the nonlinearity and dynamics of a class of nonlinear dynamic systems can be approximated. Unlike previous NN-based model identification methods, the GBNNM directly inherits system dynamics and separately models system nonlinearities. This model corresponds well with the object system and is easy to build. The GBNNM is embedded online as a normal model reference to obtain the quantitative residual between the object system output and the GBNNM output. This residual can accurately indicate the fault offset value, so it is suitable for differing fault severities. To further estimate the fault parameters (FPs), an improved extended state observer (ESO) using the same NNs (IESONN) from the GBNNM is proposed to avoid requiring the knowledge of ESO nonlinearity. Then, the proposed MIFE scheme is applied for reaction wheels (RW) in a satellite attitude control system (SACS). The scheme using the GBNNM is compared with other NNs in the same fault scenario, and several partial loss of effect (LOE) faults with different severities are considered to validate the effectiveness of the FP estimation and its superiority.},

Cooperating agents learn to control the flexibility offered by electric vehicles, space heating and flexible loads in a partially observable stochastic environment. In the standard independent Q-learning approach, the coordination performance of agents under partial observability drops at scale in stochastic environments. Here, the novel combination of learning from off-line convex optimisations on historical data and isolating marginal contributions to total rewards in reward signals increases stability and performance at scale. Using fixed-size Q-tables, prosumers are able to assess their marginal impact on total system objectives without sharing personal data either with each other or with a central coordinator. Case studies are used to assess the fitness of different combinations of exploration sources, reward definitions, and multi-agent learning frameworks. It is demonstrated that the proposed strategies create value at individual and system levels thanks to reductions in the costs of energy imports, losses, distribution network congestion, battery depreciation and greenhouse gas emissions.},

Participating AS can assist stabilizing the power grid by following the frequency regulation signal, or dynamic regulation signal (RegD) in this study while receiving economic benefits. Industrial loads are an indispensable component as a demand-side regulating resource of ancillary service due to their intensive electricity consumption. In this paper, we use grid-connected solar photovoltaics panels combined with the energy storage system (ESS) to produce continuous electricity consumption signals in order to follow the RegD signal. The participation of solar energy in real-time regulation provision process is emphasized, which is modeled based on a variety of operation modes in accordance to Australian Standard. Through a particular case study, with the integration of solar energy, the proposed method poses cost-effectiveness in industrial plant scheduling and a favorable load following capability, helping ensure the frequency stability of the electric grid. The proposed methodology is more economically advantageous compared to identical industrial loads only equipped with on-site ESS, and requires less switchings on machines compared to industrial plants with passive use of solar energy.},

  abstract = {The variability of renewables and power demands poses significant challenges for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks, as they often introduce uncertainties that may lead to power flow constraint violations. Robust optimization (RO) is a powerful tool for managing the operational risks caused by these uncertainties. However, solving robust DER dispatch problems is nontrivial since the non-convex AC power flow constraints prevent the use of strong duality to find deterministic counterparts. To this end, this paper proposes adversarial constraint learning that can provide linear surrogates for robust dispatch problems. This method begins by designing a gradient-based adversarial attack process to identify the worst-case constraint violations. A ``teacher'' model is trained in advance to enable rapid gradient calculations during this attack process. Under the teacher's supervision, two ``student'' models are then trained to predict the worst-case violation from candidate dispatch decisions and nominal operating conditions (i.e., renewable generation and power demands). These student models are further reformulated into equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) forms and serve as computationally efficient surrogates for the original robust dispatch problems. Simulations across various operating conditions and test systems demonstrate that our method can achieve desirable feasibility, low suboptimality, and high online computational efficiency.},

Incorporating the network constraints and multi-phase unbalanced modeling, the proposed method obtains an effective approximate feasible region of the net power injection. For any aggregate power trajectory within this region, it is proved that there exists a feasible disaggregation solution. In addition, a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework is developed for practical implementation of the transmission-distribution interaction.

The repertoires of peptides for various MHC Class I proteins are distinct, which can be reflected by their diverse binding motifs. To characterize binding motifs for MHC Class I proteins, in vitro experiments have been conducted to screen peptides with high binding affinities to hundreds of given MHC Class I proteins. However, considering tens of thousands of known MHC Class I proteins, conducting in vitro experiments for extensive MHC proteins is infeasible, and thus a more efficient and scalable way to characterize binding motifs is needed.                                         Results               We presented a de novo generation framework, coined PepPPO, to characterize binding motif for any given MHC Class I proteins via generating repertoires of peptides presented by them. PepPPO leverages a reinforcement learning agent with a mutation policy to mutate random input peptides into positive presented ones. Using PepPPO, we characterized binding motifs for around 10~000 known human MHC Class I proteins with and without experimental data. These computed motifs demonstrated high similarities with those derived from experimental data. In addition, we found that the motifs could be used for the rapid screening of neoantigens at a much lower time cost than previous deep-learning methods.

  abstract = {The anticipated increase in the frequency of extreme weather events and the growing photovoltaic (PV) penetration in the energy system raise concerns about future variability in PV power generation. However, future changes in global PV variability based on the CMIP6 still remain uncertain. To fill this gap, data from 16 state-of-art CMIP6 models were employed to analyze trends in both PV power generation and variability for 2025--2100 under low, medium, and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. A multivariate bias correction algorithm (MBCn) was used to calibrate CMIP6 data, with reanalysis data - ERA5 serving as the benchmark. Additionally, the impact of meteorological factors were examined. The results indicate that under the low emission scenario, global PV power generation shows a slight increase, while the other two scenarios exhibit decreasing trends. In terms of PV variability, changes are correlated with latitude, with high-latitude regions more likely to face higher fluctuations, leading to an additional approximately 16\% of low-power days by 2100 under the high emission scenario. Furthermore, over two-thirds of the land area experiences a decrease in PV power generation along with increased variability under the high emission scenario, approximately 8 times higher than the low emission scenario. Considering the impact of meteorological factors, removing days with extreme high and low solar irradiance increases stability by about 23\%. However, eliminating days with extreme high and low temperature worsens stability, revealing that global warming reduces variability to some extent due to the opposing effects of temperature and irradiance on PV power generation. This study highlights the consequences of climate change on PV power generation variability, providing valuable insights for PV installation planning, especially for countries at higher latitudes.},

First, a neural network is trained to depict the relationship between nodal power injections and voltage magnitude measurements, and then it is used to generate synthetic measurements under independent nodal power injections, thus eliminating the influence of correlated nodal power injections on topology identification. Second, a maximal information coefficient-based maximum spanning tree algorithm is developed to obtain the network topology by evaluating the dependence among the synthetic measurements. The proposed method is tested on different distribution networks and the simulation results are compared with those of other methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A promising approach is to control the reactive power injections of inverters to maintain the voltages. However, existing voltage regulation algorithms require the exact knowledge of line parameters, which are not known for most distribution systems and are difficult to infer. In this work, by utilizing the convexity results of voltage regulation problem, we design an input convex neural network to learn the underlying mapping between the power injections and the voltage deviations. By using smart meter data, our proposed data-driven approach not only accurately fits the system behavior, but also provides a tractable and optimal way to find the reactive power injections.

We prove that the load control algorithm globally converges to an optimal operating point that minimizes the total disutility of users, restores the nominal frequency and the scheduled tie-line power flows, and respects the load capacity limits and the thermal constraints of transmission lines. Furthermore, the global exponential convergence of the reduced ALC algorithm without considering the capacity limits is proved and leveraged to study the dynamical tracking performance and robustness of the algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness, optimality, and robustness of the proposed ALC algorithm are demonstrated via numerical simulations.},

However, the uncertainty of renewable energy sources' output power may lead to negative impacts on the scheduling of park-level integrated energy system. Therefore, a distributionally robust day-ahead scheduling model of PIES considering generalized energy storages is pro\- posed in this paper, aiming to reduce the operating cost, renewable energy curtailment, and carbon emission of park-level integrated energy system. In the proposed model, the actual multi-energy storage devices, integrated demand response and pipeline energy storages are synergistically modeled as generalized energy storages to improve the operating flexibility of park-level integrated energy system; the Wasserstein metric-based dis\- tributionally robust optimization method is utilized to handle the uncertainty problems in the scheduling of parklevel integrated energy system, which can obtain the expected operating costs of park-level integrated energy system under the worst-case probability distribution restricted in an ambiguity set; the strong duality theory and reformulation--linearization technique are utilized to linearize the proposed non-convex model and make it easier to be solved by the commercial solver. Case studies are performed on a park-level integrated energy system that consists of an IEEE 33-bus distribution network, a 44-node district heating network and a 20-node natural gas network for verifying the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model.},

To this end, it is necessary to establish an appropriate state estimation (SE) model for IEGS to filter the raw measured data. Considering that power systems and natural gas systems have different time scales and sampling periods, this paper proposes a dynamic state estimation (DSE) method based on a Kalman filter that can consider the dynamic characteristics of natural gas pipelines. First, the standardized state transition equations for the gas system are developed by applying the finite difference method to the partial differential equations (PDEs) of the gas system; then the DSE model for IEGS is formulated based on a Kalman filter; also, the measurements from the electricity system and the gas system with different sampling periods are fused to ensure the observability of DSE by using the interpolation method. The IEEE 39-bus electricity system and the 18-nodes Belgium gas system are integrated as the test systems. Simulation results verify the proposed method's accuracy and calculation efficiency.},

  abstract = {With more energy networks being interconnected to form integrated energy systems (IESs), the optimal energy flow (OEF) problem has drawn increasing attention. Extant studies on OEF models mostly utilize the finite difference method (FDM) to address partial-differential-equation (PDE) constraints related to the dynamics in natural gas networks (NGNs) and district heating networks (DHNs). However, this time-domain approach suffers from a heavy computational burden with regard to achieving high finite-difference accuracy. In this paper, a novel OEF model that formulates NGN and DHN constraints in the frequency domain and corresponding model compaction techniques for efficient solving are contributed. First, an energy circuit method (ECM) that algebraizes the PDEs of NGNs and DHNs in the frequency domain is introduced. Then, an ECM-based OEF model is formulated, which contains fewer variables and constraints than an FDM-based OEF model and thereby yields better solving efficiency. Finally, variable space projection is employed to remove implicit variables, by which another constraint generation algorithm is enabled to remove redundant constraints. These two techniques further compact the OEF model and bring about a second improvement in solving efficiency. Numerical tests on actual systems indicate the final OEF model reduces variables and constraints by more than 95\% and improves the solving efficiency by more than 10 times. In conclusion, the proposed OEF model and solving techniques well meet the optimization needs of large-scale IESs.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6\% compared to the hindsight optimum.},

Energy prices are decided by locational marginal pricing principles in the transmission-level MES. At the same time, the carbon emissions of different energy systems are uniformly priced using a carbon emission flow (CEF) model based on the consumers' actual emission contributions by tracing the embedded flow of CO2. Various distribution-level MESs modeled by energy hubs (EHs) are independently operated in response to the variation in the integrated prices. The whole bi-level model formulates an equilibrium problem and is solved iteratively. Case studies based on two MESs at different scales illustrate the effectiveness and benefit of the proposed carbon pricing method in reducing carbon emissions more efficiently than current methods.},

  abstract = {The pipeline efficiency factor (E-value) and the overall heat transfer coefficient (K-value) are, respectively, the characteristic parameters that describe the flow and heat transfer behavior of gas pipe sections. These parameters have a significant impact on the accuracy of the thermo-hydraulic calculations of the gas flow processing. Hence, they should be investigated thoroughly. Due to various complex factors affecting the E-value and the K-value in operating the in-service gas pipe sections, it is often difficult to calculate the two characteristic parameters accurately using physics-based formulae. Based on quasi-steady-state historical operational data sets of the in-service gas pipe section, the characteristic parameters are identified with the maximum likelihood method and the least square method, respectively. Besides, the characteristic parameters of the gas pipe section are derived from solving the inverse problem of the steady-state thermo-hydraulic calculations. Both methods are applied to an in-service pipeline, and the two parameters are obtained from 144 historical operational data sets. By introducing the two parameters into the thermo-hydraulic calculations for certain quasi-steady-state historical conditions in the same gas pipe section, the maximum relative errors occurred between the calculated results and the measured data are 2.91\% and 2.66\%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the two methods is small, with a gap of 0.0037 W/(m2 K) in K-value and 0.0206 in E-value. The proposed identification methods are extendable to provide adequate technical support for large-scale gas pipeline networks.},

We derive a lower bound to the mutual information objective that can be optimized efficiently, and show that our training procedure can be interpreted as a variation of the Wake-Sleep algorithm. Specifically, InfoGAN successfully disentangles writing styles from digit shapes on the MNIST dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images, and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also discovers visual concepts that include hair styles, presence/absence of eyeglasses, and emotions on the CelebA face dataset.

  abstract = {Adaptive robust optimization (ARO) is a well-known technique to deal with the parameter uncertainty in optimization problems. While the ARO framework can actually be borrowed to solve some special problems without uncertain parameters, such as the power flexibility aggregation problem studied in this paper. To effectively harness the significant flexibility from massive distributed energy resources (DERs), power flexibility aggregation is performed for a distribution system to compute the feasible region of the exchanged power at the substation over time. Based on two-stage ARO, this paper proposes a novel method to aggregate system-level multi-period power flexibility, considering heterogeneous DER facilities, network operational constraints, and an unbalanced power flow model. This method is applicable to aggregate only the active (or reactive) power, and the joint active-reactive power domain. Accordingly, two power aggregation models with two-stage optimization are developed: one focuses on aggregating active power and computes its optimal feasible intervals over multiple periods, and the other solves the optimal elliptical feasible regions for the aggregate active-reactive power. By leveraging the ARO technique, the disaggregation feasibility of the obtained feasible regions is guaranteed with optimality. Numerical simulations on a real-world distribution feeder with 126 multi-phase nodes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Bilateral relationship between retailer and consumers can be described as an information game and is characterized by package contracts based on publicly observable information only. First, a mathematical model for the optimal contract design problem involving two coupled energy markets is established. Then, an equivalent reduced model is obtained by several certified lemmas and theorems. Consumer behaviors behind each reduction step are revealed. Thereafter, the market equilibrium is characterized with a proof of existence, revealing the impact of asymmetric information on the retailer's strategy. An illustrative example with locational marginal price based heat-power market is presented. Case studies confirm the theoretical analysis and show that our model can promote retailer's profit. The impact of several factors, such as the probability and reservation utility level, has been tested, providing fundamental insights into strategic behavior in multi-energy market under asymmetric information.},

Firstly, the dynamic state estimation model is built. Since the gas pipeline transient flow equations are less than the states, the boundary conditions are used as supplementary constraints to predict the transient states. To increase the measurement redundancy, the zero mass flow rate constraints at the sink nodes are taken as virtual measurements. Secondly, to ensure the stability under bad data condition, the robust Kalman filter algorithm is proposed by introducing a time-varying scalar matrix to regulate the measurement error variances correctly according to the innovation vector at every time step.

  abstract = {Effective power flow modeling critically affects the ability to efficiently solve large-scale grid optimization problems, especially those with topology-related decision variables. In this work, we put forth a generative modeling approach to obtain a piecewise linear (PWL) approximation of AC power flow by training a simple neural network model from actual data samples. By using the ReLU activation, the NN models can produce a PWL mapping from the input voltage magnitudes and angles to the output power flow and injection. Our proposed generative PWL model uniquely accounts for the nonlinear and topology-related couplings of power flow models, and thus it can greatly improve the accuracy and consistency of output power variables.

Numerical tests using the IEEE 14- and 118-bus test systems have demonstrated the modeling accuracy of the proposed PWL approximation using a generative approach, as well as its ability in enabling competitive OTS solutions at very low computation order.},

  abstract = {In power systems with more and more variable renewable sources, gas generation is playing an increasingly prominent role in providing short-term flexibility to meet net-load requirements. The flexibility provided by the gas turbines in turn relies on the flexibility of the gas network. While there are several discussions on the ability of the gas network in providing this operational flexibility, this has not been clearly modeled or quantified. In addition, the gas network may also be responsible for supplying heating technologies, and low-carbon scenarios see a tighter interaction between the electricity, heating and gas sectors, which calls for a holistic multi-energy system assessment. On these premises, this paper presents an original methodology to quantify the flexibility the gas network can provide to the power system, as well as the constraints it may impose on it, with also consideration of different heating scenarios. This is achieved by a novel multi-stage integrated gas and electrical transmission network model, which uses electrical DC OPF and both steady-state and transient gas analyses. A novel metric that makes use of the concept of zonal linepack is also introduced to assess the integrated gas and electrical flexibility, which is then used to impose gas-related inter-network inter-temporal constraints on the electrical OPF. Case studies are performed for the Great Britain transmission system for different renewables and heating scenarios to demonstrate the proposed integrated flexibility assessment methodology, provide insights into the effects of changes to the heating sector on the multi-energy system's combined flexibility requirements and capability, and assess how the electrical network can experience local generation and reserve constraints related to the gas network's lack of flexibility.},

This study is the first to model and assess the potential of P2G when combined with gas seasonal storage operation accounting for the two networks' characteristics and constraints (including the amount of hydrogen that can be blended with NG under different gas network conditions). Power system operation with P2G is analysed via a two-stage optimisation based on DC power flow to assess the gas production from otherwise curtailed renewables, also considering impact of P2G on short-term and long-term gas prices. Additionally, impact of P2G on gas network operation and its potentially required re-dispatch are evaluated with a steady-state gas flow model. Case studies conducted on the Great Britain gas and electrical transmission networks quantify benefits and limitations of the integrated usage of P2G with seasonal gas storage under different scenarios. The proposed model thus sets the fundamentals for further development of this emerging technology as a seasonal storage option in low-carbon power systems.},

In this paper, the major issues and challenges in multi-agent system and smart microgrids are discussed. We present a review of state-of-the-art applications and trends. By discussing the possibilities considering what has been done, future applications, with attention to renewable energy resources integration in emerging scenarios, are placed on the agenda. It is suggested that further studies keep growing in this direction, which will be able to decentralize the high complex energy system, allowing users to participate in the system more actively. This step may decentralize the infrastructure, giving more weight to society wishes, as well as facilitating maintenance, reducing costs and opening a the door for innovative ideas for low-cost based equipment.

In order to achieve an advanced coordination level between grid operators it is essential to consider the increasing penetration of DER, especially at the lower voltage levels. Massive amounts of information are required to reach a complete observability of the grid, therefore, different methodologies to aggregate flexibility within distribution grids have been proposed. In this case, the modelling of Flexibility Providing Units is adapted to consider time-series, while the aggregation process is repeated for several time-steps, which is essential for short-term operation planning of power systems. The proposed method is applied to the European CIGRE MV Grid for two scenarios, a typical summer and winter day. Results show that the load profile over a specific time, the reactive power requirements and the amount of flexibility provided within a grid play major roles in the probability distribution of the operating points of the grid. This has a direct influence on the definition of predefined schedules at the TSODSO interconnection point.},

With increasing penetration of distributed generation in the grid, especially at lower voltage levels, this task is becoming more complex for system operators, leading to the need of an improvement in their coordination efforts. To tackle this issue, different methodologies to present the flexibility provision within a distribution grid in an aggregated manner have been developed. This paper focuses on validating the results provided by such aggregation algorithms. A random sampling approach is used to validate the obtained flexibility range of a distribution grid obtained through a previously developed linear optimal power flow algorithm. By means of a `beta' instead of a `uniform' distribution for the selection of the random variables, the flexibility ranges become comparable and a validation of the results is applicable. A case study is performed using the CIGRE test-bench grid. Results show that optimization-based aggregation algorithms can provide accurate results, while respecting grid constraints and showing a convex behavior.},

The potential for flexibility utilization in building loads, particularly thermal-controlled ones, has drawn attention when aggregated into VPPs. This work proposes a data-driven approach to overcome the challenges in modeling and aggregation of thermal dynamics within clustered buildings. Specifically, we utilize piecewise linear equations to represent the impact of various input features on thermal dynamics (i.e., zone temperature variation), which is more precise in extracting the nonlinear relationship through adaptive model order adjustment and breakpoint determination. Additionally, we transform the identified thermal dynamic process into virtual storage models and aggregate them into the optimization-based system dispatch process. The proposed two-stage aggregation approach facilitates the determination of accurate dispatch decisions by iteratively updating the power bounds of flexibility regions. It ensures disaggregation feasibility simultaneously to generate individual power signals for each building. Case simulations verify the accuracy of the proposed method on modeling and aggregation of thermal dynamics within clustered buildings.},

The problem is formulated as one of finding the robust maximum volume ellipsoid inside the flexibility region under uncertainty.

The nonlinear least-squares method with the trust-region algorithm is adopted to optimize the tunable parameters of mixture components. The optimal number of mixture components is adaptively solved by minimizing the Euclidean distance between the GGMM and the actual histogram distribution. The probability distribution of ramping features is generally truncated due to the ramp definition with a specific threshold. Thus, a sign function is utilized to truncate the GGMM distribution. Then, the cumulative distribution function of the GGMM is analytically derived and utilized to design a random number generator for ramping features. Numerical simulations on publicly available wind power data show that the parametric GGMM can accurately characterize the irregular and multimodal distributions of ramping features.},

Almost all the existing studies have modelled the CHP's output characteristics as a feasible operation region of electric power and heat power. However, only the extraction steam of a CHP unit that used for district heating can be controlled directly, without considering the extraction steam's heat transfer process, the actual heat power output cannot be precisely decided. Thus this paper proposes a detailed CHP dispatch model based on the principles of heat transfer. A three-stage heat transfer model of the extraction steam is used to describe the heating process. Then, a joint dispatch model concerning CHP units, conventional thermal power units, and RESs is given. Finally, the impacts of different factors on the extraction steam's heat transfer process and its influence for RES accommodation are analyzed. Results show that considering heat transfer process is essential in modelling the CHP plant that used for district heating, especially when the CHP plant is working at a status that deviates from the rated one significantly.},

To capture the capability of renewable energy integration more accurately on a short timescale, this paper proposes a security region evaluation method obtaining every feasible point rather than the only maximum output point of renewable generators. This evaluation method is based on multi-parametric programming considering network operational constraints, including N-1 security constraints and variable limits. In the obtained security region, each feasible point can map the values of the objective function and optimal variables of the OPF model, which is beneficial for the real-time dispatch. Furthermore, the flexible spaces including the deep peak regulation of generators and the emergency transmission rates of lines are considered to extend the security region of renewable energy integration. The security regions of renewable generator outputs and the transmission power of tie lines, which reflect the range of renewable energy self-accommodation and outside-accommodation, are quantified considering these flexible spaces. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.},

It brings challenges for the co-operation of electricity-gas systems. This paper proposes a static equivalent model that replaces the natural gas network, which lays the foundation for electricity-gas co-operation between separate electricity and gas companies. The influence of the natural gas network on the electricity network is represented in this equivalent model, which consists of a constraint equivalent model and a loss equivalent model. In the constraint equivalent model, a set of optimization models is formulated to approximate the feasible region of natural gas-fired units (NGUs) imposed by the operational constraints of the natural gas network. In the loss equivalent model, the natural gas consumption of compressors contributed by NGUs is considered based on the ``shortest path principle'' using the gas loss as the weight. The proposed static equivalent model is applied in the optimal power flow of electricity-gas systems. Case studies demonstrate the desired accuracy of the proposed method.},

Here we provide examples of new fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the assistance of machine learning---demonstrating a method by which machine learning can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4.

The gas network model is equipped with hydrogen tracking to quantify the changes in the molar composition resulting from hydrogen injection at multiple nodes. The methodology is applied to a real distribution system and results demonstrate that overlooking gas network constraints leads to P2G units' flexi\- bility contribution overestimation. Furthermore, simultaneous operation of P2G units might be feasible from electricity network perspective but infeasible when considering the maximum hydrogen concentration to meet gas quality standards. This could be achieved if P2G units' location is properly chosen and/or gas quality standards are amended.},

  abstract = {Due to the increasing integration of renewable forms of generation, ageing network infrastructure, and rapid increase in peak load demand, flexibility is becoming economically more viable and hence significant role player in the future power system. There is vast amount of literature on flexibility covering research, demonstration and validation activities. Nevertheless, there is still no unifying definition of the term "flexibility" and consistent characterizing terms for "flexibility resources". The lack of clarity in definitions and concepts may undermine information exchange amongst stakeholders imposing hurdles on the transition from mature technology to investment decisions and deployment. System operators, for example, require better clarity for the techno-economic evaluation of flexibility resources in their planning processes. This paper, by reviewing prominent flexibility-related publications, proposes a comprehensive flexibility definition and unified characterizing terms for flexibility resources. Furthermore, the paper proposes a taxonomy method which is applied to classify flexibility resources. The presented taxonomy method clears the confusion on "what-is-what" under the concept of flexibility. This paper also presents the benefits of unified characterizing terms in mapping flexibility resources to ancillary services. The benefits are illustrated by considering a realistic use case in a Norwegian distribution network.},

This representation facilitates the learning of a fluid simulator tailored to the input video that can deliver robust, long-term future predictions. The value of our method is twofold: first, our learned simulator enables the inference of hidden physics quantities (e.g., velocity field) purely from visual observation; secondly, it also supports future prediction, constructing the input video's sequel along with its future dynamics evolution. We compare our method with a range of existing methods on both synthetic and real-world videos, demonstrating improved reconstruction quality, visual plausibility, and physical integrity.},

  abstract = {To increase the flexibility of power generation, the coal-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants should make full use of their own energy storage (ES). Available ES exists mainly in boiler steam-water systems, in units' condensed water systems (CW), and in district heating networks (DHN). The goal of the paper is to analysis the ES quantitatively. And ES is characterized by ES coefficient, the maximum ES capacity and ES respond speed for power load. ES coefficient, the key parameter of ES capacity, represents the change in ES when unit process variable changes. For pressure, flow, and temperature variables, three kinds of mechanism methods (volume increment method, equivalent enthalpy drop method, and specific enthalpy increment method) are proposed to calculate ES coefficients. Then, the maximum ES capacity can be obtained by the product of ES coefficient and the limit value of the variable. Finally, ES respond speed for power load can be drawn from simulation. Calculation results and simulations show that ES in CW has small capacity 1.2 GJ but fast speed; ES in boiler has larger capacity 2.6 GJ and slower respond speed; ES in DHN is 374 GJ, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the previous two, and the response is relatively fast. Therefore, recommendations to increase power load flexibility are using ES in boiler and DHN to reduce fuel fluctuation when power load change frequently, using ES in CW to reduce load responding time, and using ES in DHN to expand load regulation range.},

With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, the mechanical rotational inertia keeps declining, its leading role is weakened, and the existing cognition of the inertia of the power system is no longer applicable. The paper first reviews the physical nature of inertia as a measure of the ability to hinder the change of state of an object, and models the power system as an energy supply chain containing various energy forms and components at different scales. The inertia is generalized to mechanical rotational inertia, electrical inertia, thermal inertia and fluid inertia. In energy supply chain, the ``inertia pair'' composed of storage inertia and channel inertia on the same scale determines the dynamics of the scale. On the whole scale, multiple ``inertia pairs'' at different scales determine the sequential dynamic characteristics in the time domain and the cascading filtering characteristics in the frequency domain. Then, it is further revealed that the source of inertia demand is energy demand, storage units need to have enough instantaneous energy release to cope with the energy supplement lag caused by the transmission channel, and the entire energy supply chain needs to store enough local energy to support decentralized control. The inertia cognition of the power system from the energy perspective is helpful to evaluate the inertia demand of new power systems and provide theoretical guidance for the method design of active power control of new power systems.}

  abstract = {Traditional virtual power plants (VPPs) with fixed resource composition and coordination strategies struggle to cost-effectively exploit the flexibility of large-scale resources for adapting variable regulation requirements and resources characteristics. To this end, this paper proposes a dynamic aggregation mechanism to flexibly select and coordinate individual resources for forming aggregators according to grids regulation requirements and resource characteristics. The proposed mechanism is operated through a two-stage dynamic aggregation model comprising resource selection and coordination. Considering the two-stage dynamic aggregation model is a combinational optimization problem with high computational complexity, the submodular optimization method is utilized to swiftly address this problem. First, the complementarity and submodularity of the dynamic aggregation process are formulated to elaborate how the aggregation regulation characteristics (ARCs) evolve with flexible resource composition and coordination. Next, a submodularity-based algorithm is developed to promptly solve dynamic aggregation model under three scenarios, where aggregation operators focus on the resources quantity, quality, and cost-effectiveness, respectively. The polynomial computational complexity of the proposed algorithm has also been evaluated. Simulations using the IEEE 39-bus (New England) system consists of 10,000 flexible resources were executed to assess the submodularity approach. The proposed algorithm demonstrates superior computing speed and better performance guaranteed results (90\%, 97\%, 90\% in three scenarios) compared to other methods---making it more suitable for implementation in practice.},

  abstract = {The penetration of renewable sources (particularly wind power) in to the power system network has been increasing in the recent years. As a result of this, there have been serious concerns over reliable and satisfactory operation of the power systems. One of the solutions being proposed to improve the reliability and performance of these systems is to integrate energy storage devices into the power system network. Further, in the present deregulated markets these storage devices could also be used to increase the profit margins of wind farm owners and even provide arbitrage. This paper discusses the present status of battery energy storage technology and methods of assessing their economic viability and impact on power system operation. Further, a discussion on the role of battery storage systems of electric hybrid vehicles in power system storage technologies had been made. Finally, the paper suggests a likely future outlook for the battery technologies and the electric hybrid vehicles in the context of power system applications.},

This work addresses two-stage robust optimization (2RO) problems (also called adjustable robust optimization), wherein first-stage and second-stage decisions are made before and after uncertainty is realized, respectively. This results in a nested min-max-min optimization problem which is extremely challenging computationally, especially when the decisions are discrete. We propose Neur2RO, an efficient machine learning-driven instantiation of column-and-constraint generation (CCG), a classical iterative algorithm for 2RO. Specifically, we learn to estimate the value function of the second-stage problem via a novel neural network architecture that is easy to optimize over by design. Embedding our neural network into CCG yields high-quality solutions quickly as evidenced by experiments on two 2RO benchmarks, knapsack and capital budgeting. For knapsack, Neur2RO finds solutions that are within roughly \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the best-known values in a few seconds compared to the three hours of the state-of-the-art exact branch-and-price algorithm; for larger and more complex instances, Neur2RO finds even better solutions. For capital budgeting, Neur2RO outperforms three variants of the \$k\$-adaptability algorithm, particularly on the largest instances, with a 5 to 10-fold reduction in solution time.

  abstract = {Stochastic Programming is a powerful modeling framework for decision-making under uncertainty. In this work, we tackle two-stage stochastic programs (2SPs), the most widely used class of stochastic programming models. Solving 2SPs exactly requires optimizing over an expected value function that is computationally intractable. Having a mixed-integer linear program (MIP) or a nonlinear program (NLP) in the second stage further aggravates the intractability, even when specialized algorithms that exploit problem structure are employed. Finding high-quality (first-stage) solutions -- without leveraging problem structure -- can be crucial in such settings. We develop Neur2SP, a new method that approximates the expected value function via a neural network to obtain a surrogate model that can be solved more efficiently than the traditional extensive formulation approach. Neur2SP makes no assumptions about the problem structure, in particular about the secondstage problem, and can be implemented using an off-the-shelf MIP solver. Our extensive computational experiments on four benchmark 2SP problem classes with different structures (containing MIP and NLP second-stage problems) demonstrate the efficiency (time) and efficacy (solution quality) of Neur2SP. In under 1.66 seconds, Neur2SP finds high-quality solutions across all problems even as the number of scenarios increases, an ideal property that is difficult to have for traditional 2SP solution techniques. Namely, the most generic baseline method typically requires minutes to hours to find solutions of comparable quality.},

  abstract = {Identification of potent peptides through model prediction can reduce benchwork in wet experiments. However, the conventional process of model buildings can be complex and time consuming due to challenges such as peptide representation, feature selection, model selection and hyperparameter tuning. Recently, advanced pretrained deep learning-based language models (LMs) have been released for protein sequence embedding and applied to structure and function prediction. Based on these developments, we have developed UniDL4BioPep, a universal deep-learning model architecture for transfer learning in bioactive peptide binary classification modeling. It can directly assist users in training a high-performance deep-learning model with a fixed architecture and achieve cuttingedge performance to meet the demands in efficiently novel bioactive peptide discovery. To the best of our best knowledge, this is the first time that a pretrained biological language model is utilized for peptide embeddings and successfully predicts peptide bioactivities through large-scale evaluations of those peptide embeddings. The model was also validated through uniform manifold approximation and projection analysis. By combining the LM with a convolutional neural network, UniDL4BioPep achieved greater performances than the respective state-of-the-art models for 15 out of 20 different bioactivity dataset prediction tasks. The accuracy, Mathews correlation coefficient and area under the curve were 0.7--7, 1.23--26.7 and 0.3--25.6\% higher, respectively. A user-friendly web server of UniDL4BioPep for the tested bioactivities is established and freely accessible at https://nepc2pvmzy.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com. The source codes, datasets and templates of UniDL4BioPep for other bioactivity fitting and prediction tasks are available at https://github.com/dzjxzyd/ UniDL4BioPep.},

The output of the proposed algorithm is concise and can be easily incorporated in the existing system operation and market clearing. Case studies based on the IEEE 33 and 123 test feeders show the computational efficiency of the proposed method outperforms existing methods by 4{$\sim$}7 times. Additionally, many fewer inequalities are needed to depict the VPP-CC while achieving the comparative approximation accuracy compared to sampling-based methods, which will relieve the communication and computation burden.},

  abstract = {Balancing reactive power within a grid is one of the fundamental tasks of transmission system operators. With increasing portion of wind power, wind turbines have to contribute to reactive power generation during steady state as well as during transient conditions. First, this paper provides an overview about the available options to supply reactive power by wind farms typically connected to the grid by AC cables. Then the fault-ride through (FRT) sequence of the doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) is discussed in order to explain the reactive power generation capability of this type of wind turbines during low voltage periods. Under steady state conditions the utilization of var sources represents an optimization task. It is shown in the paper that generation of reactive power by WT may be a favorable option under economic aspects. FRT with DFIG is possible even if the grid voltage drops to zero. To protect the converter against overcurrent and overvoltage DFIG are equipped with crowbar and sometimes with chopper. When the crowbar is switched on the machine is a var consumer. However the line side converter (LSC) can be controlled to supply up to 50\% of the required reactive current. When the crowbar is not activated the DFIG can supply reactive power from the rotor side through the machine as well as through the LSC. For illustration, simulation results for an exemplary fault are shown and elucidated.},

The three-level HETUS Activity Coding List (ACL) 2018 will be exactly the same as ACL 2008 for the two aggregated levels; only on detailed third level of ACL a few additional codes are proposed. Moreover, people's everyday satisfaction will be captured in future via four additional questions at the end of the diary. In order to reduce the burden of respondents, there are fewer questions in the household and in the individual model questionnaire. Finally, the form "Weekly Schedule of Working Time" will be left out. Actually, countries planning to participate in HETUS wave 3 are preparing, together with Eurostat, to complete HETUS with new tools and sources for collecting data in the years to come. Results of these initiatives will become available by the end of 2019 and these will then be "translated" into precise and generally applicable methodological guidelines. Eurostat works -- with the help of a dedicated Task Force TUS on Innovative Tools and Sources -- to develop additional guidelines of this kind from 2020 onwards.

  abstract = {Accurate models of generation systems are critical for maintaining reliable and secure grid operations. In this paper, a novel and systematic approach is proposed to identify and calibrate the generation system problematic parameters using continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and advanced deep-learning technology. The phasor measurement unit (PMU) data are used through ``event playback'' to check whether the parameter calibration is required, and if yes, a group of suspicious parameters will be identified as the primary problematic parameter candidates (PPCs). These primary PPCs are randomly perturbed to generate the event playback simulation data, which are used by the CWT and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to further narrow down the primary PPCs into a smaller set of candidates. Then, the identified candidates are perturbed again to generate massive event playback simulation data for training a parameter calibration neural network. We designed a multi-output neural network structure to find the mappings between the perturbed parameters and the simulation data using both CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Finally, the well-trained and tested CNN-LSTM model is used to estimate the accurate value of the suspicious parameters with actual PMU measurements. The proposed CNN-LSTM network can accurately and reliably estimate the generation-system problematic parameters, and has better performance when compared to other machine-learning methods, such as the multilayer perceptron network and the conditional variational autoencoder method. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach have been validated through simulation and real-world data.},

  author = {Feng, Cheng and Gao, H Oliver and Wang, Siyuan and You, Fengqi},
  abstract = {Frequency control services are essential for maintaining stability of renewable-dominated power systems. System operators worldwide have introduced new frequency control services to encourage distributed energy resource (DER) participation. However, the absence of a coordinated and unified framework for frequency control services and associated DER participation mechanisms has limited the cost efficiency and overall effectiveness of these efforts. This paper proposes the Generalized Frequency Shaping Service (GFSS) framework, a unified and systematic approach to integrating diverse ancillary frequency services, along with its associated optimal DER participation design methodology. The GFSS framework standardizes and consolidates global frequency control practices, enabling DERs with heterogeneous capabilities to collaboratively support system frequency regulation while minimizing costs, even in the face of the complex, time-varying dynamics inherent to renewabledominated systems. An optimization model is developed to determine optimal participation factors for DERs. This model rigorously evaluates the power and energy reserve requirements of heterogeneous DERs while minimizing stability-related costs, thereby ensuring both cost efficiency and grid reliability. In addition, the paper further presents a computationally efficient solution algorithm to solve the non-convex participation design optimization problem. Case studies validate the efficacy of the proposed GFSS framework and the optimal DER participation design approach.},

Distributed energy resources (DERs) can provide contingency frequency support via the virtual power plant (VPP). Given that the VPP may cover thousands of DERs with diverse characteristics and response latency, this paper proposes to use equivalent aggregation models for the VPP to participate in contingency reserve services. First, the equivalent aggregation model for the VPP's aggregated frequency response is developed, accurately and concisely restoring the DER aggregation's capability to stop the system frequency from falling. On this basis, the VPP's performance-to-cost map is constructed, which specifies the minimal cost to achieve the same performance as different equivalent aggregation models. In order to encourage DERs to report their response latency accurately, additional latency is penalized based on the resulting cost increase. A sensitivity-based method in the matrix form is developed to estimate the marginal increasing cost due to the increasing latency. Numerical studies are conducted to validate the equivalent aggregation model's effectiveness and illustrate how latency affects response performance and aggregation cost.},

However, climate change may affect renewable power outputs by enhancing the weather variability and making extreme conditions more frequent. High temperature or clouds, for example, can lead to poorer photovoltaic (PV) power outputs. Here, we assess global changes in the frequency of warm and cloudy conditions that lead to very low PV power outputs. Using simulations from global climate models (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), we show that summer days with very low PV power outputs are expected to double in the Arabian Peninsula by mid-century but could be reduced by half in southern Europe over the same period, even under a moderate-emission scenario. Changes for winter, either enhancing or mitigating the PV power intermittency, are projected to be less striking, at least in low- and mid-latitude regions. Our results present valuable information for energy planners to compensate for the effects of future weather variability.},

  abstract = {As the emergence of bacterial resistance is outpacing the development of new antibiotics, we must find cost-effective and innovative approaches to discover new antibacterial therapeutics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent one promising solution to fill this void, since they generally undergo faster development, display rapid onsets of killing, and most importantly, show lower risks of induced resistance. Despite prior success in AMP design with physics- and/or knowledge-based approaches, an efficient approach to precisely design peptides with high activity and selectivity is still lacking. Toward this goal, we have invented a novel approach which utilizes a generative model to predict AMP-like sequences, followed by molecular modeling to rank the candidates. Thus, we can identify peptides with desirable sequences, structures, and potential specific interactions with bacterial membranes. For the proof of concept, we curated a dataset that comprises 500,000 non-AMP peptide sequences and nearly 8,000 labeled AMP sequences to train the generative model. For 12 generated peptides that are cationic and likely helical, we assessed the membrane binding propensity via extensive all-atom molecular simulations. The top six peptides were promoted for synthesis, chemical characterizations, and antibacterial assays, showing various inhibition to bacterial growth. Three peptides were validated with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In aggregate, the combination of AMP generator and sophisticated molecular modeling affords enhanced speed and accuracy in AMP design. Our approach and results demonstrate the viability of a generative approach to develop novel AMPs and to help contain the rise of antibiotic resistant microbes.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are very popular these days, and are the subject of a very intense investigation. A DNN is made up of layers of internal units (or neurons), each of which computes an affine combination of the output of the units in the previous layer, applies a nonlinear operator, and outputs the corresponding value (also known as activation). A commonly-used nonlinear operator is the so-called rectified linear unit (ReLU), whose output is just the maximum between its input value and zero. In this (and other similar cases like max pooling, where the max operation involves more than one input value), for fixed parameters one can model the DNN as a 0-1 Mixed Integer Linear Program (0-1 MILP) where the continuous variables correspond to the output values of each unit, and a binary variable is associated with each ReLU to model its yes/no nature. In this paper we discuss the peculiarity of this kind of 0-1 MILP models, and describe an effective bound-tightening technique intended to ease its solution. We also present possible applications of the 0-1 MILP model arising in feature visualization and in the construction of adversarial examples. Computational results are reported, aimed at investigating (on small DNNs) the computational performance of a state-of-the-art MILP solver when applied to a known test case, namely, hand-written digit recognition.},

We simultaneously minimized power purchase costs and polluting gas emissions. We introduced the normal boundary intersection (NBI) method to convert the multiobjective optimization (MOO) model into a series of single-objective optimization (SOO) problems, which we solved using the interior-point method (IPM). In the process used to solve each SOO problem, we rearranged the coefficient matrix of the correction equation in the block bordered diagonal form (BBDF) according to the sequence of the forecast scenario and sampling scenarios. Thus, we were able to decompose this correction equation further into a number of low-dimensional equations corresponding to the forecast scenario and sampling scenarios, respectively, and solve them using the asynchronous block iteration method. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed algorithm on an IEEE 39-bus system and a real-provincial power system, and built a parallel computational framework on high-performance clusters to demonstrate the enhancements in computational speed and the reduced memory requirements obtained by parallelization. Through this framework, one can obtain scheduling of the outputs of generators on a day-ahead basis.},

In this paper, we are interested in a robust version of the location transportation problem with an uncertain demand using a 2-stage formulation. The obtained robust formulation is a convex (not linear) program, and we apply a cutting plane algorithm to exactly solve the problem. At each iteration, we have to solve an NPhard recourse problem in an exact way, which is time-consuming. Here, we go further in the analysis of the recourse problem of the location transportation problem. In particular, we propose a mixed integer program formulation to solve the quadratic recourse problem and we define a tight bound for this reformulation. We present an extensive computation analysis of the 2-stage robust location transportation problem. The proposed tight bound allows us to solve large size instances.},

Time-dependent consumer data from the district heating systems were applied to compare the results obtained from modelling approaches.

  abstract = {Optimally operating an integrated electricity-gas system (IEGS) is significant for the energy sector. However, the IEGS operation model's nonconvexity makes it challenging to solve the optimal dispatch problem in the IEGS. This letter proposes a new Benders decomposition-based (IBD) algorithm catering to a commonly used steady-state dispatch model of the IEGS. This IBD algorithm leverages a refined decomposition structure where the subproblems are linear and ready to be solved in parallel. We analytically compare our IBD algorithm with an existing Benders decomposition algorithm and a typical piecewise linearization method. Case studies have substantiated the higher computational efficiency of our IBD algorithm.},

  abstract = {As synchronous generators (SGs) are extensively replaced by converter-based generators (CBGs), modern power systems are facing complicated frequency stability problems. Conventionally, the frequency nadir and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) are the two main factors concerned by power system operators. However, these two factors heavily rely on simulations or experiments, especially in a power system with high-penetration CBGs, which offer limited theoretical insight into how the frequency response characteristics are affected by the devices. This paper aims at filling this gap. Firstly, we derive a formulation of the global frequency for a CBG-integrated power system, referred to as common-mode frequency (CMF). The derived CMF is demonstrated to be more accurate than existing frequency definitions, e.g., the average system frequency (ASF). Then, a unified transfer function structure (UTFS) is proposed to approximate the frequency responses of different types of devices by focusing on three key parameters, which dramatically reduces the complexity of frequency analysis. On this basis, we introduce two evaluation indices, i.e., frequency drop depth coefficient (FDDC) and frequency drop slope coefficient (FDSC), to theoretically quantify the frequency nadir and the average RoCoF, respectively. Instead of relying on simulations or experiments, our method rigorously links the system's frequency characteristics to the characteristics of heterogeneous devices, which enables an in-depth understanding regarding how devices affect the system frequency. Finally, the proposed indices are verified through simulations on a modified IEEE 39-bus test system.},

Recognition of flow structure is an important issue in the study of two-phase flow, and it is of great significance for the optimization of industrial processes. Therefore, how to recognize complex flow structures effectively represents a challenge. To cope with this problem, we develop a novel deep learning network to recognize flow structures under different flow conditions. In particular, we conduct vertical upward gas-liquid two-phase flow experiments to obtain the flow structure data set on the basis of images collected by a high-speed camera. Then, we design a branch-aggregation network (BAN), where the branch structure is utilized to increase the width of the network, and multilevel aggregation structure is used to fuse features of different levels. In recognition of flow structure, the proposed network achieves an accuracy of 99.60\% with a fast convergence speed and shows the advantages in antinoise ability, which is significant for online recognition in industrial processes. The results indicate that BAN can be a feasible method to recognize complex flow structures.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic analysis tool is important to quantify the impacts of the uncertainties on power system operations. However, the repetitive calculations of power flow are time-consuming. To address this issue, data-driven approaches are proposed but they are not robust to the uncertain injections and varying topology. This article proposes a model-driven graph convolution neural network (MD-GCN) for power flow calculation with high-computational efficiency and good robustness to topology changes. Compared with the basic graph convolution neural network (GCN), the construction of MD-GCN considers the physical connection relationships among different nodes. This is achieved by embedding the linearized power flow model into the layer-wise propagation. Such a structure enhances the interpretability of the network forward propagation. To ensure that enough features are extracted in MD-GCN, a new input feature construction method with multiple neighborhood aggregations and a global pooling layer are developed. This allows us to integrate both global features and neighborhood features, yielding the complete features representation of the system-wide impacts on every single node. Numerical results on the IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 1354-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better performance as compared to other approaches in the presence of uncertain power injections and system topology.},

It renders the solar irradiance (determining the solar power) forecasting a critical task. This paper tackles the problem of solar irradiance prediction from a history of sky image sequence. Most existing machine learning methods directly regress the solar irradiance values from a historical image sequence and/or solar irradiance observations. By contrast, we propose a novel deep neural network for short-term solar irradiance forecasting by leveraging a clear sky model. In particular, we build our network structure on the vision transformer to encode the spatial as well as the temporal information in the sky video sequence. We then aim to predict the solar irradiance residual from the learned representation by explicitly using a clear sky model. We evaluated our approach extensively on the existing benchmark datasets, such as TSI880 and ASI16. Results on the nowcasting task, namely estimation of the solar irradiance from the observations, and the forecasting task, which is up to 4-hour ahead-of-time prediction, demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with existing machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Microplastics have emerged as an ubiquitous pollutant with severe environmental and human health hazards. Over the decades encountering these pollutants, microorganisms have evolved with the tool(s) to degrade different classes of plastic polymers. Several enzymes including depolymerases and lipases have been studied for the reduction of plastic toxicity. Since the degradation of plastic is a long process, thus, meta ``omics'' approaches have been employed to identify the active microbiota and microbial dynamics involved in the mitigation of microplastic-contaminated sites. Further, protein engineering approaches have opened new avenues to tackle this alarming situation. Increasing plastic contamination is serving as a breeding ground and carrier for spread of other persistent chlorinated pollutant. This review for the first time summarized a comprehensive report on microplastic sources, toxicity, and bio-based mitigation approaches. It covers deeper understanding about multi-omic approaches in microplastic research and engineering technologies in microplastic degradation. The guidelines and regulation to tackle the increasing pollution have been discussed. Knowledge gaps and opportunities have been comprehensively compiled that would aid the state-of-the-art information in the available literature for the researchers to further address this issue.},

  abstract = {Robust optimization has been established as a leading methodology to approach decision problems under uncertainty. To derive a robust optimization model, a central ingredient is to identify a suitable model for uncertainty, which is called the uncertainty set. An ongoing challenge in the recent literature is to derive uncertainty sets from given historical data that result in solutions that are robust regarding future scenarios. In this paper we use an unsupervised deep learning method to learn and extract hidden structures and anomalies from data, leading to non-convex uncertainty sets and better robust solutions. We prove that most of the classical uncertainty classes are special cases of our derived sets and that optimizing over them is strongly NP-hard. Nevertheless, we show that the trained neural networks can be integrated into a robust optimization model by formulating the adversarial problem as a convex quadratic mixed-integer program. This allows us to derive robust solutions through an iterative scenario generation process. In our computational experiments, we compare this approach to a similar approach using kernel-based support vector clustering and to other benchmark methods. We find that uncertainty sets derived by the unsupervised deep learning method find a better description of data and lead to robust solutions that often outperform the comparison methods both with respect to objective value and feasibility.},

  abstract = {We consider the embedding of piecewise-linear deep neural networks (ReLU networks) as surrogate models in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. A MILP formulation of ReLU networks has recently been applied by many authors to probe for various model properties subject to input bounds. The formulation is obtained by programming each ReLU operator with a binary variable and applying the big-M method. The efficiency of the formulation hinges on the tightness of the bounds defined by the big-M values. When ReLU networks are embedded in a larger optimization problem, the presence of output bounds can be exploited in bound tightening. To this end, we devise and study several bound tightening procedures that consider both input and output bounds. Our numerical results show that bound tightening may reduce solution times considerably, and that small-sized ReLU networks are suitable as surrogate models in mixed-integer linear programs.},

This study presents the experimental application of such a deep machine learning model to design membranolytic anticancer peptides (ACPs) de novo. A recurrent neural network with long short-term memory cells was trained on {$\alpha$}-helical cationic amphipathic peptide sequences and then fine-tuned with 26 known ACPs by transfer learning. This optimized model was used to generate unique and novel amino acid sequences. Twelve of the peptides were synthesized and tested for their activity on MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and selectivity against human erythrocytes. Ten of these peptides were active against cancer cells. Six of the active peptides killed MCF7 cancer cells without affecting human erythrocytes with at least threefold selectivity. These results advocate constructive machine learning for the automated design of peptides with desired biological activities.},

A second contribution is to propose a new recurrent physical cell (PhyCell), inspired from data assimilation techniques, for performing PDE-constrained prediction in latent space. Extensive experiments conducted on four various datasets show the ability of PhyDNet to outperform state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies also highlight the important gain brought out by both disentanglement and PDE-constrained prediction.

Our approach is grounded in a second-order lumped-parameter model that captures the dynamics of synchronous generators and frequency-responsive DERs endowed with inertial and droop control. A key feature of this reduced-order model is that its parameters can be related to those of the originating higherorder dynamical model. This allows one to systematically design the DER inertial and droop-control coefficients leveraging classical frequency-domain response characteristics of second-order systems. Time-domain simulations validate the accuracy of the model-reduction method and demonstrate how DER controllers can be designed to meet steady-state-regulation and transient-performance specifications.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language models over discrete data. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10 and LSUN bedrooms.},

With the widespread deployment of high-precision measurement units, data-driven methods have greater advantages in practice. In addition, with massive integra-tion of distributed renewable generation and fast electric vehicle chargers, the fluctuations of net load increase significantly. The data-driven power flow calculation method based on the linear model becomes difficult to obtain accurate results for the low nonlinear adaptability. To improve the data-driven power flow calculation accuracy under high penetration of renewable distri-bution generation, this paper proposed an approach with high adaptability to the nonlinearity of power flow. Based on the thought of Koopman operator theory, the nonlinear relationship in power flow calculation is converted into a linear mapping in a higher dimension state space, which can significantly improve the calculation accuracy. Case studies on different IEEE cases have demonstrated that the proposed method can realize higher accu-racy in power flow calculation with large-scale power fluctuations, compared to the existing data-driven method, in both mesh and radial networks. Finally, measurement data of a practical 10kV distribution network has been further used to verify the effec-tiveness of the proposed method in practical applications.},

  abstract = {The use of wind power is often restricted by the strong interdependence between the electricity generation and thermal energy generation of combined heat and power units (CHP), especially during winter, when CHP operates according to the heat-led mode. Considering the strong temporal and spatial correlations between wind power and thermal demand, the heating system can provide margins for wind power accommodation from the perspective of overall energy consumption. This paper proposes an optimal operation model for an integrated energy system (IES) combining the thermal inertia of a district heating network (DHN) and buildings to enhance the absorption of wind power. The temperature dynamics and transmission delay in DHN and the thermal storage capacity of buildings are studied to exploit the heating system as an option for managing the dispatch of wind power. The proposed model is a mixed integer non-linear programming model and can be solved by general commercial optimization software. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a real heating system (having 24 nodes and 50 pipelines) in Jilin Province is used in the case study. The simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model in terms of operational economics and wind power utilization.},

  abstract = {Inverter-based resources (IBRs) possess dynamics that are significantly different from those of synchronous-generator-based sources and as IBR penetrations grow the dynamics of power systems are changing. This article discusses the characteristics of the new dynamics and examines how they can be accommodated into the long-standing categorizations of power system stability in terms of angle, frequency, and voltage stability. It is argued that inverters are causing the frequency range over which angle, frequency, and voltage dynamics act to extend such that the previously partitioned categories are now coupled and further coupled to new electromagnetic modes. While grid-forming (GFM) inverters share many characteristics with generators, grid-following (GFL) inverters are different. This is explored in terms of similarities and differences in synchronization, inertia, and voltage control. The concept of duality is used to unify the synchronization principles of GFM and GFL inverters and, thus, established the generalized angle dynamics. This enables the analytical study of GFM-GFL interaction, which is particularly important to guide the placement of GFM apparatuses and is even more important if GFM inverters are allowed to fall back to the GFL mode during faults to avoid oversizing to support short-term overload. Both GFL and GFM inverters contribute to voltage strength but with marked differences, which implies new features of voltage stability. Several directions for further research are identified, including: 1) extensions of nonlinear stability analysis to accommodate new inverter behaviors with cross-coupled time frames; 2) establishment of spatial--temporal indices of system strength and stability margin to guide the provision of new stability services; and 3) data-driven approaches to combat increased system complexity and confidentiality of inverter models.},

  abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) represent an attractive and novel approach to generate realistic data, such as genes, proteins or drugs, in synthetic biology. Here, we apply GANs to generate synthetic DNA sequences encoding for proteins of variable length. We propose a novel feedback-loop architecture, feedback GAN (FBGAN), to optimize the synthetic gene sequences for desired properties using an external function analyser. The proposed architecture also has the advantage that the analyser does not need to be differentiable. We apply the feedback-loop mechanism to two examples: generating synthetic genes coding for antimicrobial peptides, and optimizing synthetic genes for the secondary structure of their resulting peptides. A suite of metrics, calculated in silico, demonstrates that the GAN-generated proteins have desirable biophysical properties. The FBGAN architecture can also be used to optimize GAN-generated data points for useful properties in domains beyond genomics.},

  abstract = {In this paper an objective function is formulated to minimize the cost of reactive power while maintaining the minimum specified voltage security margin along with other constraint. Usually reactive power cost functions are non differentiable. Therefore quadratic opportunity cost function for reactive power has been derived in terms of real power cost parameters and day-ahead data of energy market, and hence the overall objective function is summation of quadratic cost functions of real and reactive power generation. The reactive power output of each generator is divided into three regions and cost of reactive power in each region is defined separately. Therefore optimization problem became highly non-linear and mix-integer in nature. A Sequential quadratic programming algorithm is developed to minimize the cost of reactive power generation along with real power generation to alleviate the bus voltage violations. Reactive power output regions of generators needed integer variable for their selection; therefore, heuristic method (if-then rules) is applied along with Sequential quadratic programming algorithm to alleviate the need of integer variable. The proposed approach is applied on IEEE-14 bus system.},

  abstract = {If clean energy pathways are to harness massive increases in wind power, innovations with broad geographic viability will be needed to support buildout in diverse locations. However, geodiversity in impact potential is seldom captured in technology assessment. Here we propose a scalable approach to plant-level optimization using artificial intelligence to evaluate land sparing and economic benefits of wake steering at more than 6,800 plausible onshore wind locations in the USA. This emerging controls strategy optimizes plant energy production by directing turbine wakes. On the basis of estimates from our artificial intelligence model trained on engineering wind flow simulations, co-optimizing plant layouts with wake steering can reduce land requirements by an average of 18\% per plant (site-specific benefits range from 2\% to 34\%), subject to errors and uncertainties in the flow model, wind resource estimates, buildout scenario and geographic factors. According to model estimates, wake steering is predicted to increase power production during high-value (relatively low wind) periods, boosting the annual revenue of individual plants by up to US\$3.7 million (equivalent to US\$13,000\,MW-1\,yr-1) but producing negligible gains in some settings. Consideration of wake steering's geographic potential reveals divergent nationwide prospects for improved economics and siting flexibility.},

Different geographical locations may have many IENGSs which are connected by electric or gas transmission lines, thus formulating multi-area IENGSs. These multi-area IENGSs are not simple addition of individual IENGSs, since renewable energy may distribute unequally between different IENGSs, and excess renewable energy needs to be transmitted from one area to another, but is limited by potential tie-line congestions. To solve these problems, this paper proposes an economic dispatch model for multi-area IENGSs considering tie-line congestion, maximum allowable emission bounds and hourly spinning reserve constraints. The considered multi-area IENGS consists of multiple single-area IENGSs, among which wind energy distribution varies considerably. The maximum allowable emission bounds of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxygen are separately set based on their different influences on the environment. The hourly spinning reserves are allocated for both the power system and the natural gas system, which are provided by fossil fuel-fired units, power-to-gas facilities, gas pipelines, and natural gas storage facilities. After that, the presented model is converted into a mixed-integer linear programming problem for higher computing efficiency. Case studies for integrated systems are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

We provide an estimation of how flexibility requirements are likely to evolve in years to come; the use of global sensitivity analysis allows the identification of the variables responsible for these evolutions.

However, antibody design still heavily relies on isolating antigen-specific antibodies from serum, which is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. To address this issue, we propose a Pre-trained Antibody generative large Language Model (PALM-H3) for the de novo generation of artificial antibodies heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) with desired antigen-binding specificity, reducing the reliance on natural antibodies. We also build a high-precision model antigen-antibody binder (A2binder) that pairs antigen epitope sequences with antibody sequences to predict binding specificity and affinity. PALM-H3-generated antibodies exhibit binding ability to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including the emerging XBB variant, as confirmed through in-silico analysis and in-vitro assays. The in-vitro assays validate that PALM-H3-generated antibodies achieve high binding affinity and potent neutralization capability against spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 wild-type, Alpha, Delta, and the emerging XBB variant. Meanwhile, A2binder demonstrates exceptional predictive performance on binding specificity for various epitopes and variants. Furthermore, by incorporating the attention mechanism inherent in the Roformer architecture into the PALM-H3 model, we improve its interpretability, providing crucial insights into the fundamental principles of antibody design.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Combining a basic set of building blocks into more complex forms is a universal design principle. Most protein designs have proceeded from a manual bottom-up approach using parts created by nature, but top-down design of proteins is fundamentally hard due to biological complexity. We demonstrate how the modularity and programmability long sought for protein design can be realized through generative artificial intelligence. Advanced protein language models demonstrate emergent learning of atomic resolution structure and protein design principles. We leverage these developments to enable the programmable design of de novo protein sequences and structures of high complexity. First, we describe a high-level programming language based on modular building blocks that allows a designer to easily compose a set of desired properties. We then develop an energy-based generative model, built on atomic resolution structure prediction with a language model, that realizes all-atom structure designs that have the programmed properties. Designing a diverse set of specifications, including constraints on atomic coordinates, secondary structure, symmetry, and multimerization, demonstrates the generality and controllability of the approach. Enumerating constraints at increasing levels of hierarchical complexity shows that the approach can access a combinatorially large design space.},

A methodology based on computational geometry is then suggested and applied to assess the available feasible operation region (or space) of the compound system. A brief case study of different thermo-electric MES focuses on general technical limitations in power output on the one hand, and limitations in the special case of contingencies on the other.

They learn occupant preferences and schedules, and utilize an accurate thermal model to reduce the energy use of heating and cooling equipment while maintaining the temperature for maximum comfort. Despite the importance of having an accurate thermal model for the operation of smart thermostats, fast and reliable identification of this model is still an open problem. In this paper, we explore various techniques for establishing a suitable thermal model using time series data generated by smart thermostats. We show that Bayesian neural networks can be used to estimate parameters of a grey-box thermal model if sufficient training data is available, and this model outperforms several black-box models in terms of the temperature prediction accuracy. Leveraging real data from 8,884 homes equipped with smart thermostats, we discuss how the prior knowledge about the model parameters can be utilized to quickly build an accurate thermal model for another home with similar floor area and age in the same climate zone. Moreover, we investigate how to adapt the model originally built for the same home in another season using a small amount of data collected in this season. Our results confirm that maintaining only a small number of pre-trained thermal models will suffice to quickly build accurate thermal models for many other homes, and that 1{\textasciitilde}day smart thermostat data could significantly improve the accuracy of transferred models in another season.},

Nevertheless, the extension of the application of DL in the domain of PSs has encountered challenges, e.g., high requirement for the quality and quantity of training data, production of physically infeasible/inconsistent solutions, and low generalizability and interpretability. There is a growing consensus that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can address these concerns by integrating physics-informed (PI) rules or laws into state-of-the-art DL methodology. This survey presents a systematic overview of the PINN in the domain of PSs. Specifically, several paradigms of PINN (e.g., PI loss function, PI initialization, PI design of architecture, and hybrid physics-DL models) are summarized. The applications of PINN in PSs in recent years, including state/parameter estimation, dynamic analysis, power flow calculation, optimal power flow, anomaly detection and location, and model and data synthesis, etc., are investigated in detail, followed by the summary and assessment of relevant works so far. Revolving around the characteristics of PSs and the state-of-the-art DL techniques, this paper outlines the potential research directions and attempts to shed light on the deeper and broader application of PINN on PSs.},

This paper presents a comprehensive characteristics analysis and potential assessment of the power flexibility from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning loads in commercial buildings in the U.S. using a simulation-based method. Commercial buildings are first grouped by building type and climate region. The U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Prototype Building Models are used to represent an average building in each group and are simulated to characterize power flexibility. Based on building survey data, the number of commercial buildings in each group is estimated and used to calculate aggregate power flexibility. It is found that cooling loads in commercial buildings offer more flexibility for increasing power consumption than for decreasing it. The power consumption of commercial buildings in the U.S. can be increased by 46~GW and decreased by 40~GW on peak summer days. Among all commercial building types, standalone retail buildings provide the most absolute flexibility while medium office buildings have the most flexibility as a percentage of the rated power consumption.},

The existing methods for state estimation of natural gas network with noise are all modeled after processing the data with noise, leading to the real data being distorted to a certain extent. With that in mind, a data-driven method is presented in this paper. While solving the problem of state estimation for natural gas network with measurement noise in the input data, filtering and denoising are unnecessary during state estimation, retaining the complete information of real data. It avoids destruction of real data induced by separating noise from measured data owing to different methods and intensities of noise processing. According to the gas flow characteristic equation of natural gas system, the original problem is converted into a weighted low-rank approximation problem, the search space is shrunk to an orthogonal complement space. The selection of initial values is not merely unrestricted but there will be no accumulation and transmission of iteration error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulating 10-node natural gas network. Compared with the Newton's method, the data-driven method has superior performance, the RMSE achieves 0.2268 and the MAPE achieves 1.63\%.},

For a large-scale wind farm, processing the global equality constraint in a centralized or distributed framework is time-consuming and computationally complex. Here we considered the fast and localized execution issue of the power optimal dispatch problems. A completely decentralized dynamic system was designed to optimize power flow while satisfying the electricity supply constraints. A voltage optimization problem with the global power constraints was decoupled into local wind turbine controllers based on the node-dependence nature, which is an inherent characteristic of wind farms and was fitted to the power sensitivity matrix in this paper. The local optimization problem was solved iteratively using the gradient projection method, and the system converged linearly to the equilibrium point. The simulations for the case studies performed in Simulink demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a near-global optimal performance using only local measurements.},

To better hedge the uncertainties of distributed generation and loads, distributionally robust model predictive control (MPC) is applied to the MADOPF problem. To preserve operational independence and information privacy for each microgrid, decomposition of the nonconvex model is devised with guaranteed convergence. Numerical tests on a two-area system and a real large-scale 16-area system derived from Shandong Power Grid validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Some conventional thermal units based on synchronous machines are gradually decommissioned and replaced by power electronics interfaced renewables. Thus, the lack of natural inertia and governor damping, which are the features of synchronous machines, raises significant concern about system frequency stability, including the faster rate of change and lower nadir point of frequency. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of communication and Internet of Things technologies, distributed energy resources can be aggregated as a virtual power plant to help balance real-time electricity demand and supply. However, the capability of utilizing the whole virtual power plant to provide adjustable inertia support has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose a framework of the synchronous virtual power plant based on grid-forming inverter interfaced distributed energy resources. By coordinating the parameter settings of grid-forming inverters, the virtual power plant provides inertia support. Also, we design an online learning-based parameter settings method that makes the inertia of the virtual power plant adjustable. A case study in IEEE 34 nodes system illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In the HE-IES, the potential flexibility of buildings' thermal loads can be exploited to relax the heat power balance constraints and consequently allows a more flexible operation of the combined heat and power units. In this paper, model-driven and data-driven techniques are combined to quantify the demand flexibility of buildings' thermal loads in a non-instructive way. First, the explicit analytical equivalent thermal parameter (ETP) model of the aggregated buildings is developed. The heat transfer coefficient{\textasciicircum}) and thermal inertia coefficient(C) of the ETP model are designated to measure the potential demand flexibility. Second, the Particle Swarm Optimization optimized Radial Basis Function neural network (PSO-RBF) is used to identify the relationship between the values of {\cyrchar\cyrk} and C and the meteorological factors. To obtain the training data, an innovative two-stage regression method based on the adaptive temporal resolution is proposed to extract {\cyrchar\cyrk} and C values from the historical thermal load data. Last, the flexible thermal load model is built based on the predictions of the meteorological factors, which can be incorporated conveniently into the online dispatch of the HE-IES. A comprehensive simulation environment is designed to verify the accuracy and availability of the proposed technique.},

Field and laboratory work regularly provide new evidence on the fate of microplastic debris. This debris has been observed within every marine habitat. In this study, at least 101 peer-reviewed papers investigating microplastic pollution were critically analysed (Supplementary material). Microplastics are commonly studied in relation to (1) plankton samples, (2) sandy and muddy sediments, (3) vertebrate and invertebrate ingestion, and (4) chemical pollutant interactions. All of the marine organism groups are at an eminent risk of interacting with microplastics according to the available literature. Dozens of works on other relevant issues (i.e., polymer decay at sea, new sampling and laboratory methods, emerging sources, externalities) were also analysed and discussed. This paper provides the first in-depth exploration of the effects of microplastics on the marine environment and biota. The number of scientific publications will increase in response to present and projected plastic uses and discard patterns. Therefore, new themes and important approaches for future work are proposed.},

The corrective actions adopted during outages in power distribution networks include reconfiguration through switching control and emergency load shedding. The conventional decision-making models for outage mitigation are, however, not suitable for smart grids due to their slow response and computational inefficiency. Here, we present a graph reinforcement learning model for outage management in the distribution network to enhance its resilience. The distinctive characteristic of our approach is that it explicitly accounts for the underlying network topology and its variations with switching control, while also capturing the complex interdependencies between state variables (along nodes and edges) by modeling the task as a graph learning problem. Our model learns the optimal control policy for power restoration using a Capsule-based graph neural network. We validate our model on three test networks, namely the 13, 34, and 123-bus modified IEEE networks where it is shown to achieve near-optimal, real-time performance. The resilience improvement of our model in terms of loss of energy is 607.45 kWs and 596.52 kWs for 13 and 34 buses, respectively. Our model also demonstrates generalizability across a broad range of outage scenarios.},

The paper's holistic approach leverages meteorological variables, historical global horizontal irradiance (GHI) data, ground-based sky imager (GSI) images, satellite-derived cloud masks, and satellite-based clear sky data to improve forecasting accuracy. The proposed framework extends the forecasting horizon to 60 min while covering a continuous 6-h historical context. Innovative feature extraction techniques were implemented to reduce the cloud image dimensions, enabling the development of a lightweight forecasting model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, contributing to a more reliable GHI forecasting for efficient energy grid management.},

By incorporating district heating networks (DHNs) into CHPD, the thermal storage capability of network pipelines can be exploited to increase the operational flexibility for high penetration of renewable energy. This article proposes a flexibility evaluation method based on a generalized thermal storage model to systematically characterize and quantify the flexibility of DHNs in CHPD. In particular, systematic flexibility metrics are introduced to define the parameters of the proposed thermal storage model, including heat ramping capability, heat input limits, and heat storage capacities. A direct quantification method is proposed to explicitly derive these metrics without extensive simulations required in traditional methods. Besides, four different control modes of district heating systems are identified and modeled according to the controllability of mass flow rates and supply temperature at heat sources. A simplified CHPD model is developed based on sequential linear programming and a lumped heat loss model to enhance the computational efficiency. Comprehensive case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in evaluating the flexibility of DHNs in CHPD. It is demonstrated that the flexibility of DHNs in CHPD can be exploited as far as possible in the control mode with adjustable mass flow and supply temperature.},

The emergence of renewable energy resources, along with multi-career users, requires multi-career systems. In this regard, the energy hub (EH) as an integrated system can be used to increase the reliability of the system. The power-to-gas (P2G) and P2G storage are two practical technologies to achieve high efficiency in energy systems. In this paper, the contribution is optimal scheduling of stochastic problem in EH system amalgamated with CHP unit, P2G storage, thermal storage, boiler, wind power, and electrical storage to supply the heat, gas, and power loads by regarding demand response program (DRP). For the electrical loads, the load shifting strategy is considered to minimize the operational cost of the EH system. In order to manage related uncertainties about electricity price, wind power, and electrical loads, the downside risk constraint (DRC) method is applied to investigate the EH system function. According to the obtained results, by increasing approximately 2.8\% of the operational cost, the risk level can be reduced remarkably. And also, almost 10\% of the energy shifted from peak hours to the off-peak time after DRP is applied.},

Based on this indicator, various linearity evaluations are conducted. Results show that system linearity is not consistently related to either system scale or load level. In addition, voltages always exhibit high linearity regardless of the system scale and the load level. Yet, angles and line flows do not. Additionally, some specific systems demonstrate high and stable linearity even when the load conditions change, whereas others consistently show very low linearity.

  abstract = {A model predictive control law (MPC) is given by the solution to a parametric optimization problem that can be precomputed offline, which provides an explicit map from state to input that can be rapidly evaluated online. However, the primary limitations of these optimal 'explicit solutions' are that they are applicable to only a restricted set of systems and that the complexity can grow quickly with problem size. In this paper we compute approximate explicit control laws that trade-off complexity against approximation error for MPC controllers that give rise to convex parametric optimization problems. The algorithm is based on the classic double-description method and returns a polyhedral approximation to the optimal cost function. The proposed method has three main advantages from a control point of view: it is an incremental approach, meaning that an approximation of any specified complexity can be produced, it operates on implicitly-defined convex sets, meaning that the prohibitively complex optimal explicit solution is not required and finally it can be applied to any convex parametric optimization problem. A sub-optimal controller based on barycentric interpolation is then generated from this approximate polyhedral cost function that is feasible and stabilizing. The resulting control law is continuous, although non-linear and defined over a non-simplical polytopic partition of the state space. The non-simplical nature of the partition generates significantly simpler approximate control laws, which is demonstrated on several examples.},

This approach simultaneously seeks the best partitioning of the uncertainty set of scenarios into K subsets, and optimizes decisions corresponding to each of these subsets. In general case, it is solved using the K-adaptability branch-and-bound algorithm, which requires exploration of exponentially-growing solution trees. To accelerate finding high-quality solutions in such trees, we propose a machine learning-based node selection strategy. In particular, we construct a feature engineering scheme based on general two-stage robust optimization insights that allows us to train our machine learning tool on a database of resolved B\&B trees, and to apply it as-is to problems of different sizes and/or types. We experimentally show that using our learned node selection strategy outperforms a vanilla, random node selection strategy when tested on problems of the same type as the training problems, also in case the K-value or the problem size differs from the training ones.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1--4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence---the structure prediction component of the `protein folding problem'8---has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10--14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

In these situations, conventional multi-class classification approaches are not suitable for fault diagnosis. One solution is the use of anomaly classifiers that are trained using only nominal data. Anomaly classifiers can be used to detect when a fault occurs but give little information about its root cause. Hybrid fault diagnosis methods combining physically-based models and available training data have shown promising results to improve fault classification performance and identify unknown fault classes. Residual generation using grey-box recurrent neural networks can be used for anomaly classification where physical insights about the monitored system are incorporated into the design of the machine learning algorithm. In this work, an automated residual design is developed using a bipartite graph representation of the system model to design grey-box recurrent neural networks and evaluated using a real industrial case study. Data from an internal combustion engine test bench is used to illustrate the potentials of combining machine learning and model-based fault diagnosis techniques.},

  abstract = {The autonomous polygeneration microgrid topology has been developed in order to cover holistically needs in a remote area such as electrical energy, space heating and cooling, potable water through desalination and hydrogen as fuel for transportation. The existence of an advanced energy management system is essential for the operation of an autonomous polygeneration microgrid. So far, energy management systems based on a centralized management and control have been developed for the autonomous polygeneration microgrid topology based on computational intelligence approaches. A decentralized management and control energy management system can have important benefits, when taking into consideration the autonomous character of these microgrids. This paper presents the design and investigation of a decentralized energy management system for the autonomous polygeneration microgrid topology. The decentralized energy management system gives the possibility to control each unit of the microgrid independently. The most important advantage of using a decentralized architecture is that the managed microgrid has much higher chances of partial operation in cases when malfunctions occur at different parts of it, instead of a complete system breakdown. The designed system was based on a multi-agent system and employed Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for its implementation. It was then compared through a case study with an existing centralized energy management system. The technical performance of the decentralized solution performance is on par with the existing centralized one, presenting improvements in financial and operational terms for the implementation and operation of an autonomous polygeneration microgrid.},

  abstract = {Although massive data is quickly accumulating on protein sequence and structure, there is a small and limited number of protein architectural types (or structural folds). This study is addressing the following question: how well could one reveal underlying sequence--structure relationships and design protein sequences for an arbitrary, potentially novel, structural fold? In response to the question, we have developed novel deep generative models, namely, semisupervised gcWGAN (guided, conditional, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks). To overcome training difficulties and improve design qualities, we build our models on conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) that uses Wasserstein distance in the loss function. Our major contributions include (1) constructing a low-dimensional and generalizable representation of the fold space for the conditional input, (2) developing an ultrafast sequence-to-fold predictor (or oracle) and incorporating its feedback into WGAN as a loss to guide model training, and (3) exploiting sequence data with and without paired structures to enable a semisupervised training strategy. Assessed by the oracle over 100 novel folds not in the training set, gcWGAN generates more successful designs and covers 3.5 times more target folds compared to a competing data-driven method (cVAE). Assessed by sequence- and structure-based predictors, gcWGAN designs are physically and biologically sound. Assessed by a structure predictor over representative novel folds, including one not even part of basis folds, gcWGAN designs have comparable or better fold accuracy yet much more sequence diversity and novelty than cVAE. The ultrafast data-driven model is further shown to boost the success of a principle-driven de novo method (RosettaDesign), through generating design seeds and tailoring design space. In conclusion, gcWGAN explores uncharted sequence space to design proteins by learning generalizable principles from current sequence--structure data.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

The dynamics of these scenarios are represented as instances between capacity, ramp-rate and ramp-duration variables. A polytopic model is used to enclose these instances with its surface defining the worst case scenarios. This approach captures the correlated nature of the dynamics and provides a compact representation. In relevance, the capability of the generators and the power import from the grid are modeled as convex envelopes. A vertex based method is proposed that allocates the polytope among the resource envelopes. During this process, the operational cost is minimized while considering the resource location and the network constraints. The proposed method is examined for a microgrid test case based on the CIGRE medium voltage network. The results show new insights in the allocated demand and reserve capabilities. As an additional result, it is observed that the reserve requirements can be decreased by allocating reserves for each time instance separately as compared to the fixed percentage of load approach.},

This paper gives an overview on the state of the art of research on flexibility management in MESs by analyzing three categories of flexibility programs: Conversion, Storage and Demand-Side Management. The literature review reveals different assumptions on the structure and operation of energy systems including end-consumer energy prices being calculated with or without effects of network constraints and associated emission costs. Furthermore, several challenges are identified that need to be addressed by future research, such as the application of the proposed models in real market environments and interaction of several MES in a larger system context.},

  abstract = {The use and development of standard test systems has been critical for testing all kind of algorithms, operation procedures and planning purposes in transmission and distribution networks. With the irruption of advanced metering infrastructure based among others on smart meter technology, distribution systems suffered a drastic modernization in many regions of the world. The smart grid concept translated to the terminal distribution systems implies a drastic change of paradigm in the way these kinds of systems have been planned and operated. Although there are several distribution test systems, most of them are synthetic and there are very few test feeders and networks representing the European style distribution system. In this paper, a real (non-synthetic) comprehensive distribution test network representing a typical European town's network is presented. The model also features a provisioning mechanism to incorporate smart meter data obtained from the consumer's meter in order to study the distribution network status. This test network will provide a tool that allows researchers to work on algorithms and optimization of resources for European style distribution systems. The test network also demonstrates the impact of neutral voltage in European style distribution networks. Both researchers and the distribution company provide with the raw data extracted from the GIS system and all the functions to convert the data into an OpenDSS model as well as the loads extracted from real smart meters representing 20~days.},

  abstract = {Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutics, allowing brand new possibility to leverage target binding sites that are previously undruggable. Most existing methods are either inefficient or only concerned with the target-agnostic design of 1D sequences. In this paper, we propose a generative model for full-atom {\textbackslash}textbf\{Pep\}tide design with {\textbackslash}textbf\{G\}eometric {\textbackslash}textbf\{LA\}tent {\textbackslash}textbf\{D\}iffusion (PepGLAD). We first establish a benchmark consisting of both 1D sequences and 3D structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature for systematic evaluation. We then identify two major challenges of leveraging current diffusion-based models for peptide design: the full-atom geometry and the variable binding geometry. To tackle the first challenge, PepGLAD derives a variational autoencoder that first encodes full-atom residues of variable size into fixed-dimensional latent representations, and then decodes back to the residue space after conducting the diffusion process in the latent space. For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes. Experimental Results show that our method not only improves diversity and binding affinity significantly in the task of sequence-structure co-design, but also excels at recovering reference structures for binding conformation generation.},

The cooperation on congestion management in the distribution network is highlighted as a solution to relieve network constraints via the optimal adjustment of active and reactive power of VPP resources while maximizing renewable energy integration across the pool under management. The VPP reduces uncertainty affiliated with input data by employing the latest forecasts through a rolling horizon approach in the planning stage. Thanks to the flexibility of the VPP to perform rescheduling in accordance with agreements it negotiated with its resources, it becomes possible to refrain from undesirable curtailments. Both the market-integrative and the service-centric roles of the VPP are verified through modeling and simulation with a benchmark European distribution network. The results confirm the added value of the proposed VPP in enhancing the integration of wind and solar power.},

  abstract = {The demand for energy generation from solar energy resource has been exponentially increasing in recent years. It is integral for a grid operator to maintain the balance between the demand and supply of the grid. Solar radiation forecasting paves the way for proper planning, reserve management, and elude penalty since solar energy is sporadic in nature. Several methods can forecast solar radiation; the prior classifications are machine learning models, numerical weather prediction models, satellite imaging, sky imager and hybrid model. This article presents a comprehensive review of all those models with the working principle, challenges and future research direction. Sky imagers provide the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (nRMSE) value of 6\%--9\% for a time horizon of 30~min, and the satellite imagery technique provides the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of 61.28~W/m2 -- 346.05~W/m2 for a time horizon of 4~h ahead. Similarly, NWP mesoscale models provide the RMSE value of 411.6~W/m2 - for three days ahead of forecasting with a spatial resolution of 50~km. Machine learning models are good at delivering accurate results with the time horizon up to 1 day ahead by yielding the results of RMSE in the range of 0.1170~W/m2 -- 93.04~W/m2. Deep learning and hybrid models are being developed to overcome the issues faced by the standalone techniques. In many research works, artificial intelligence techniques are integrated with NWP models, sky imagers and satellite imagers to improve the data handling algorithm, which implicitly results in forecasting accuracy.},

This paper proposes training a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the estimates given the PMU voltage and current measurements as inputs, with the intent of obtaining fast and accurate predictions during the evaluation phase. GNN is trained using synthetic datasets, created by randomly sampling sets of measurements in the power system and labelling them with a solution obtained using a linear SE with PMUs solver. The presented results display the accuracy of GNN predictions in various test scenarios and tackle the sensitivity of the predictions to the missing input data.},

  abstract = {District heating (DH) systems are an inseparable part of the infrastructure in many countries. Today more attention is being paid to energy savings, efficiency improvements, and the replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy. Research in the field of DH is focused on the supply of areas with low heat demand and low-energy buildings and on an increased share of heat being produced from renewable energy sources. New DH systems are expected to remain competitive in the future. In this study a new DH concept is proposed which is based on mass flow control. The DH system using mass flow control is meant for the concept of a ring network technology where mass flow rates in consumer substations are controlled by pumps with inverters to improve heat transfer. It will replace the traditional DH network and control in which water flow is throttled by control valves. The new control system will enable new temperature curves to be adopted for supply and return temperatures and more significant temperature cooling. First, a new topology and control method is presented. This ring network and the method used to control the flow rate of the primary supply water and its temperature are compared with the traditional technology. This method clearly shows the benefits of the DH applications under consideration. Second, these benefits are demonstrated by mathematical modelling. A simulation model is developed to study the area heating of six single-family houses and two apartment buildings. The static operation on the primary side of the networks is investigated for the most common outdoor temperatures. The numerical results are compared to those achieved with the traditional technology. The new flow rate is 46\%, the pressure loss 25\%, and the pumping power 12\% of their former values in the pipes. The heat losses increase slightly with higher outdoor temperatures. The return temperature is lowest with the new technology. In the future the equipment that consumers will have will be more intelligent. The new technology that is presented allows consumers to adjust their energy consumption more easily by means of fast feedback on outdoor and room temperatures.},

To tackle the high variability from loads/renewables, we incorporate a mean-variance risk constraint into the classical linear quadratic regulator (LQR) formulation for this problem. The risk constraint aims to bound the time-averaged cost of state variability and thus can improve the worst-case performance for large disturbances. The resulting risk-constrained LQR problem is solved through the dual reformulation to a minimax problem, by using a reinforcement learning (RL) method termed as stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax). In particular, the zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG) approach is used to simplify the gradient estimation using simulated system trajectories. Numerical tests conducted on the IEEE 68-bus system have validated the convergence of our proposed SGDmax for GFM model and corroborate the effectiveness of the risk constraint in improving the worst-case performance while reducing the variability of the overall control cost.},

However, some issues bring challenges to the state estimation of the coupled electric-gas integrated energy system. The issues include that measurement data of the integrated energy system has low redundancy, there exists a large measurement error of the integrated energy system, and the measurement devices of the electric and gas network are not standardized in terms of sampling time units. Considering that the data-driven model has high portability and the ability to distill and summarize information, the data-driven state estimation model of the electric-gas coupled integrated energy system is established in this paper. Bayesian learning is used to obtain the probabilistic statistical features of the measurement data. Super Latin sampling is applied to generate the complete measurement data. The rationality of the generated data is checked by the energy flow analysis of the integrated energy system to obtain the training sample set for the deep learning network. A hybrid deep learning network coupled with the convolutional neural network and long and short-term memory is proposed, and the root mean square error is utilized to train the hybrid deep learning network, which effectively improves the error accuracy of the state estimation of the electric-gas coupled integrated energy system. Compared with the classical model-driven method of state estimation, the arithmetic simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

Traditional capacity adequacy planning techniques have been supplemented with integration studies, which have been carried out in power systems with high targets for renewable generation. These have highlighted the increased variability that a system may experience in the future. As system generation planning techniques evolve with the challenge of integrating variable generation, the flexibility of a system to manage periods of high variability needs to be assessed. The insufficient ramping resource expectation (IRRE) metric is proposed to measure power system flexibility for use in long-term planning, and is derived from traditional generation adequacy metrics. Compared to existing generation adequacy metrics, flexibility assessment is more data intensive. A flexibility metric can identify the time intervals over which a system is most likely to face a shortage of flexible resources, and can measure the relative impact of changing operational policies and the addition of flexible resources. The flexibility of a test system with increasing penetrations of variable generation is assessed. The results highlight the time horizons of increased and decreased risk associated with the integration of VG.},

System flexibility, or the ability of a system to meet changes in demand and VG production, is one such issue receiving much attention. This paper presents a methodology to assess the flexibility of a power system while explicitly considering the limitations of the transmission network. By determining only the flexibility available from resources which could be realized in real-time operation due to transmission constraints, a more realistic assessment of a system's flexibility can be made. The flexibility of the IEEE Reliability Test System is assessed using two metrics. Transmission is shown to have a significant effect on the availability of flexibility and the risk posed to the system by net load ramps. The impact is seen to be strongly dependent on the variability of the net load and on the distribution of online resources.

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the output power variation of different photovoltaic (PV) array configurations during irradiance transitions caused by moving clouds. The study was based on velocity and other characteristics of roughly 27,000 irradiance transitions identified in measured irradiance data and conducted using a mathematical model of irradiance transitions and an experimentally verified simulation model of a PV module. The studied electrical PV array configurations were series-parallel, total-cross-tied and multi-string. The different PV array orientations and layouts (physical shapes) of the configurations were also studied. The average rate of change of the power of these studied PV array configurations during the irradiance transitions was around 3\%/s and the maximum instantaneous rates of change of the power were around 75\%/s. Half of the time during the studied transitions, the rate of change in the power was over 1.2\%/s, and most of the time during the transitions, it exceeded typical PV power ramp rate limits set by grid operators. The average rate of change of PV array power decreased with an increasing maximum array dimension and it was observed to be the largest when the shorter dimension of the array was parallel to the dominant movement direction of the shadow edges. The results of this study are relevant especially in terms of PV array design, maximum power point tracking algorithm development and energy storage systems sizing.},

This paper proposes an adaptive voltage control method to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster, realizing dynamic voltage support without relying on accurate system model parameters. Based solely on the measured input/output data of the controlled system, the proposed method dynamically linearizes the controlled system through online identification. Subsequently, a data-driven cooperative adaptive controller is designed to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster. The method can effectively regulate the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the controlled PV cluster with adaptability to system changes. The stability of the proposed control method is theoretically clarified. Numerical simulation using MATLAB/Simulink shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Part I proposes a novel Adaptive M-Lasso estimator with theoretically guaranteed robustness. For solving this estimator, common algorithms are not scalable to large-scale systems since they often fail to converge under parallelism. This is addressed in Part II, where a novel Online Parallel Stochastic Coordinate Descent algorithm with theoretically guaranteed scalability is proposed. It can simultaneously update massive DF estimates by stochastic parallelism with fast convergence. It also works recursively under a multi-core setting and does not need step-size tuning, which is applicable for cloud-computing-based online parallel estimation. Convergence bounds of this algorithm are theoretically proven, and its speedup and maximum parallel core number are derived. These guide practical computational resource allocation for high efficiency. The benefits of the framework are showcased in real-time market operations under locational marginal pricing (LMP) and financial transmission right (FTR) mechanisms for congestion management. Thanks to its sparsity-promoting effect, robustness, and scalability, it allows for correctly and fast solving LMPs, congestion patterns, and FTR revenues against uncertainties. Test results on IEEE 300- and European 9241-bus systems via Alibaba Cloud validate the high scalability of this algorithm and benefits of the proposed framework to system applications.},

However, existing methods are vulnerable to time-varying non-Gaussian PMU measurement noise, bad data, and uncertain renewable energy sources (RESs). Moreover, they lack scalability to large-scale systems. This two-part paper proposes a robust and scalable sparse DF estimation framework considering PMU data quality and RES uncertainty. In this Part I, a novel Adaptive M-Lasso estimator with theoretically guaranteed robustness is proposed. It mitigates the impacts of measurement and RES uncertainties to yield accurate dominant DF estimates while promoting sparsity. The key idea is to integrate the robust statistics theory with sparse representation techniques, in particular the Huber loss function, adaptively-weighted l1 regularization, concomitant scale estimate, and pseudo-residuals. Two important robustness properties of this estimator are theoretically proven, i.e., the bounded influence function and the asymptotic consistency of dominant DF estimates given limited samples. The breakdown points of this estimator to measurement and RES uncertainties are derived. Test results validate that the proposed estimator allows accurate estimation without relying on power flow models or massive operating data. It achieves significantly superior robustness over existing methods in multiple scenarios.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have revolutionized many machine learning tasks in power systems, ranging from pattern recognition to signal processing. The data in these tasks are typically represented in Euclidean domains. Nevertheless, there is an increasing number of applications in power systems, where data are collected from non-Euclidean domains and represented as graph-structured data with high-dimensional features and interdependency among nodes. The complexity of graph-structured data has brought significant challenges to the existing deep neural networks defined in Euclidean domains. Recently, many publications generalizing deep neural networks for graph-structured data in power systems have emerged. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in power systems is proposed. Specifically, several classical paradigms of GNN structures, e. g., graph convolutional networks, are summarized. Key applications in power systems such as fault scenario application, time-series prediction, power flow calculation, and data generation are reviewed in detail. Further-more, main issues and some research trends about the applications of GNNs in power systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {Carbon neutrality goals are driving the increased use of renewable energy (RE). Large-scale use of RE requires accurate energy generation forecasts; optimized power dispatch, which minimizes costs while satisfying operational constraints; effective system control to ensure a stable power supply; and electricity markets that support bidding and trading decisions associated with RE. However, the uncertainties in RE generation make renewable power systems challenging to operate. For example, the intermittent nature of wind power can make it difficult to balance the supply and demand of electricity in real time; therefore, traditional power sources could be needed to meet the demand, which can increase electricity prices. This Review outlines the potential of artificial intelligence-based methods for supporting renewable power system operation. We discuss the ability of machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning methods to facilitate power system forecasts, dispatch, control and markets to support the use of RE. We also emphasize the applicability of these techniques to different operational problems. Finally, we discuss potential trends in renewable power system development and approaches to address the associated operational challenges such as the increasingly distributed nature of RE installations, diversification of energy storage systems and growing market complexity.},

The coupling in cold seasons precludes CHPs from providing the necessary flexibility for managing the wind power dispatch. The lack of flexibility problem can be tackled by exploiting the energy storage capability of a district heating network (DHN) which decouples the strong linkage of electric power and heat supplies. In this paper, a combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) is formulated to coordinate the operation of electric power system (EPS) and district heating system (DHS). The proposed CHPD model which is solved by an iterative method considers the temperature dynamics of DHN for exploiting energy storage as an option for managing the variability of wind energy. The simulation results are discussed for several test systems to demonstrate the potential benefits of the proposed method in terms of operation economics, wind power utilization, as well as the potential benefits for real systems.},

An improved understanding of T-cell immunity will greatly aid in the development of new cancer immunotherapies and vaccines for life-threatening pathogens. Central to the design of such targeted therapies are computational methods to predict non-native peptides to elicit a T-cell response, however, we currently lack accurate immunogenicity inference methods. Another challenge is the ability to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides for specific human leukocyte antigen alleles, for both synthetic biological applications, and to augment real training datasets. Here, we propose a beta-binomial distribution approach to derive peptide immunogenic potential from sequence alone. We conducted systematic benchmarking of five traditional machine learning (ElasticNet, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, Random Forest and AdaBoost) and three deep learning models (convolutional neural network (CNN), Residual Net and graph neural network) using three independent prior validated immunogenic peptide collections (dengue virus, cancer neoantigen and SARS-CoV-2). We chose the CNN as the best prediction model, based on its adaptivity for small and large datasets and performance relative to existing methods. In addition to outperforming two highly used immunogenicity prediction algorithms, DeepImmuno-CNN correctly predicts which residues are most important for T-cell antigen recognition and predicts novel impacts of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our independent generative adversarial network (GAN) approach, DeepImmuno-GAN, was further able to accurately simulate immunogenic peptides with physicochemical properties and immunogenicity predictions similar to that of real antigens. We provide DeepImmuno-CNN as source code and an easy-to-use web interface.},

  abstract = {With the increasing penetration of renewable energy and flexible loads in smart grids, a more complicated power system with high uncertainty is gradually formed, which brings about great challenges to smart grid operations. Traditional optimization methods usually require accurate mathematical models and parameters and cannot deal well with the growing complexity and uncertainty. Fortunately, the widespread popularity of advanced meters makes it possible for smart grid to collect massive data, which offers opportunities for data-driven artificial intelligence methods to address the optimal operation and control issues. Therein, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has attracted extensive attention for its excellent performance in operation problems with high uncertainty.

  abstract = {A distribution system can flexibly adjust its substation-level power output by aggregating its local distributed energy resources (DERs). Due to DER and network constraints, characterizing the exact feasible power output region is computationally intensive. Hence, existing results usually rely on unpractical assumptions or suffer from conservativeness issues. Sampling-based data-driven methods can potentially address these limitations. Still, existing works usually exhibit computational inefficiency issues as they use a random sampling approach, which carries little information from network physics and provides few insights into the iterative search process. This letter proposes a novel network-informed data-driven method to close this gap. A computationally efficient data sampling approach is developed to obtain high-quality training data, leveraging network information and legacy learning experience. Then, a classifier is trained to estimate the feasible power output region with high accuracy. Numerical studies based on a real-world Southern California Edison network validate the performance of the proposed work.},

To mitigate these challenges, energy storage devices have gained attention for their ability to rapidly charge and discharge. Collaborating with wind power (WP), energy storage (ES) can participate in the frequency control of regional power grids. This approach has garnered extensive interest from scholars worldwide. This paper proposes a two-region load frequency control model that accounts for thermal power, hydropower, ES, and WP. To address complex, nonlinear optimization problems, the dingo optimization algorithm (DOA) is employed to quickly obtain optimal power dispatching commands under different power disturbances. The DOA algorithm's effectiveness is verified through the simulation of the two-region model. Furthermore, to further validate the proposed method's optimization effect, the DOA algorithm's optimization results are compared with those of the genetic algorithm (GA) and proportion method (PROP). Simulation results show that the optimization effect of DOA is more significant than the other methods.},

However, current smart meters are not smart enough. They can only perform basic data collection and communication functions and cannot carry out on-device intelligent data analytics due to hardware constraints in terms of memory, computation, and communication capacity. Moreover, privacy concerns have hindered the utilization of data from distributed smart meters. Here, we present an end-edge-cloud federated split learning framework to enable collaborative model training on resource-constrained smart meters with the assistance of edge and cloud servers in a resource-efficient and privacy-enhancing manner. The proposed method is validated on a hardware platform to conduct building and household load forecasting on smart meters that only have 192 KB of static random-access memory (SRAM). We show that the proposed method can reduce the memory footprint by 95.5\%, the training time by 94.8\%, and the communication burden by 50\% under the distributed learning framework and can achieve comparable or superior forecasting accuracy to that of conventional methods trained on high-capacity servers.},

  abstract = {Aggregators have emerged as crucial tools for the coordination of distributed, controllable loads. To be used effectively, an aggregator must be able to communicate the available flexibility of the loads they control, as known as the aggregate flexibility to a system operator. However, most of existing aggregate flexibility measures often are slow-timescale estimations and much less attention has been paid to real-time coordination between an aggregator and an operator. In this paper, we consider solving an online optimization in a closed-loop system and present a design of real-time aggregate flexibility feedback, termed the maximum entropy feedback (MEF). In addition to deriving analytic properties of the MEF, combining learning and control, we show that it can be approximated using reinforcement learning and used as a penalty term in a novel control algorithm -- the penalized predictive control (PPC), which modifies vanilla model predictive control (MPC). The benefits of our scheme are (1). Efficient Communication. An operator running PPC does not need to know the exact states and constraints of the loads, but only the MEF. (2). Fast Computation. The PPC often has much less number of variables than an MPC formulation. (3). Lower Costs. We show that under certain regularity assumptions, the PPC is optimal. We illustrate the efficacy of the PPC using a dataset from an adaptive electric vehicle charging network and show that PPC outperforms classical MPC.},

  abstract = {The power generation and consumption of distributed energy resources (DERs) offer significant flexibility potential, which can be utilized to provide services such as peak and frequency regulation. DERs introduce a vast number of variables and constraints, making it complicated to directly integrate them into upper-level dispatch. To address this challenge, virtual power plants (VPPs) emerge, which treat diverse DERs as a collective entity and use aggregated flexibility envelopes to reduce the variable and constraint scale, facilitating upper-level optimization. In VPPs, unified DER modeling and efficient DER aggregation play a crucial role but are challenging. This paper first introduces a novel unified polytope model to represent heterogenous DERs' flexibility region. A coordination transformation is utilized to eliminate redundant variable dimensions and maintain DERs' interface characteristics. A sample-based projection method is then developed, further removing all state variables, resulting in a unified flexibility region. This method is then utilized to calculate the Minkowski sums of individual flexibility polytopes for aggregation. The results of numerical tests demonstrate a considerable reduction in computation time and maintain satisfactory accuracy when the proposed modeling and aggregation approach is adopted.},

  abstract = {A virtual power plant (VPP) facilitates the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) for transmission-level operations. A challenge in operating a VPP is to characterize the cost function over its feasible power transfer region under DERs' uncertainties. To address this challenge, a characterization method is proposed for the intraday operation of a VPP with nonanticipativity and robustness considerations to DERs' uncertainties. The characterization stems from designing operational requirements subject to nonanticipativity and robustness, by which a feasible power transfer region across all the time periods is constructed by boundary points at each time period and time-coupling constraints. Furthermore, a cost function over the feasible power transfer region is formulated as the combination of convex piecewise surfaces and a constant compensation cost. Finally, a perspective to analyze the impacts of DERs' uncertainties on feasible power transfer regions is studied. Numerical experiments in the IEEE 33-bus and 136-bus systems show that 1) our feasible power transfer region fulfills nonanticipativity and robustness to face DERs' uncertainties, 2) our cost function covers the true operational cost of a VPP, and 3) impacts of DERs' uncertainties on feasible power transfer regions can be measured by the product of their fluctuation intervals and system parameters.},

The operational constraints of the external power network are preserved via multi-parametric programming. The operational costs of the external power network are formulated as an explicit function of power transmission on tie lines. This unified equivalent model can consider both AC and DC tie lines. The intuitive difference between the transfer capacity of AC and DC tie lines is revealed from a new perspective. On this basis, a market model for the internal power network with the equivalence of the operational constraints for the external power network is presented. Two typical trading modes are considered: the bulk sale mode and the direct power purchase mode. The exact convex relaxation formulation of the market model is derived under the direct power purchase mode.},

However, a tie-line security region is a high-dimension polytope due to multiple time periods and border buses in power system operations, generally leading to a heavy computational burden. A fast calculation for high-dimension tie-line security regions is studied in this paper. The high-dimension polytope across all the time periods is decomposed as a Cartesian production of lower-dimension polytopes at each time period by leveraging dispatch levels of generations. For each lower-dimension polytope, the computational burden brought by multiple border buses is alleviated by aggregating tie-line power. Minimum renewable curtailments are preserved in the tie-line security region by adding an additional dimension, providing the information for renewable accommodations based on the tie-line security region. For coupling parameters within our tie-line security region, a feasible decision of the regional power system always exists. Finally, a decentralized and non-iterative framework is demonstrated to utilize our tie-line security region for renewable accommodations in an interconnected power system. The effectiveness of our methods is corroborated in the IEEE 9-bus system, a 661-bus utility system, and a five-region system.},

  abstract = {With the increasing power demand and renewables, the efficient utilization of power resources in each regional network relies on the tie-line power exchanges in interconnected power networks. Consequently, an accurate characterization of the feasible region of tie-line power transfer is crucial for scheduling tie-line power to achieve a secure and efficient utilization of power resources. This paper proposes a characterization method to explicitly capture a feasible region of tie-line power transfer considering steady-state constraints with reactive power and voltage limits and transient constraints. The steady-state and transient constraints are explicitly derived: 1) a power transfer distribution factor matrix with reactive power and voltage magnitude is derived to equivalently reflect the steady-state operational region with fewer variables and constraints; 2) the transient constraints of the tie-line power are derived based on the swing and current injection equations and a constraint transcription technology is adopted to convert transient constraints from continuous-time domain to a vector space, which makes it possible to identify the feasible region of tie-line power transfer. The steady-state and transient constraints are explicitly projected to the tie-line power space via a vertex search method. Finally, this paper utilizes the feasible region of tie-line power transfer to perform the tie-line scheduling via the proposed linear programming model. The proposed tie-line scheduling model can promote the optimal utilization of generation dispatches, which guarantees security and improve economics in the interconnected power network. The numerical results based on the IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The AC power flow equalities are taken into account as constraints in the optimization model. Different from the typical optimal power flow problem, the objective function of a DES optimal scheduling (DESOS) problem varies with changing operational requirements. In this paper, three frequently-used objective functions are considered for the DESOS problem. Two of them are monotonic over the feasible set while the third is not. An illustrative example elucidates that the descent direction of a chosen objective function significantly impacts the efficiency of the second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation for the DESOS problem. To obtain tighter semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations for the DESOS cases where the SOCP relaxation is not exact, this paper looks for computationally efficient convex constraints that can approximate the rank-1 constraint in the non-iterative framework. The designed non-iterative enhanced SDP relaxations are compared in terms of tightness of convexification for the DESOS problems considering the three objective functions independently. The comparison is performed on several radial IEEE test systems and a real world distribution feeder.},

  abstract = {The power coupling issue in grid-forming converters (GFMs) is an emerging concern within power systems dominated by inverter-based resources. Specifically, the phase difference between two rotational frames, i.e., system/grid and controller frames, has not been associated with the power coupling effect. It is demonstrated that such phase difference causes interaction between the inner and power control loops. To this end, we first developed a detailed power model of a GFM system to study the sensitivity of control parameters against coupling issues. In particular, we found that the inner voltage control loop could impact the system's stability. In addition, the controller-generated virtual inductance and the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter trigger a destabilizing effect for GFM using P-{$\delta$} control compared to P-{$\omega$} droop control. This is due to the phase difference and control loops interaction. As a result, the typical virtual inductance becomes inadequate in suppressing the coupling for P-{$\delta$} droop control. Subsequently, a q-axis-based virtual impedance combined with phase difference compensation is proposed. It extends the range of stable control parameters and minimizes the power coupling for both types of droop controls. Experiments were conducted to verify the theoretical analysis and the proposed scheme.},

The characterization of a tie-line power transmission region with regional operational constraints is inherently a multi-parametric programming problem, which greatly suffers from a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a fast boundary search approach to efficiently characterize the tie-line power transmission region in AC/DC hybrid grids. The multi-parametric programming method is improved in the following three aspects: (1) the search direction is fixed along the boundary of a region, which avoids the search inside a region; (2) the abundant search of subregions that share a boundary facet is avoided; and (3) a fast guess of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is presented, which reduces the number of optimization calculations. Furthermore, an expansion strategy is presented to enlarge the tie-line power transmission region via quantifying the impact of system parameters on the transmission region. Simulations based on the IEEE 118-bus test system and a 661-bus utility system show that (1) the proposed method can be over 30 times faster than existing methods and (2) the proposed method successfully expands the tie-line power transmission region by identifying the key parameters.},

With the high penetration of renewables, a sharp increase or decrease of renewable power requires a good depiction of the tie-line security region considering time coupling. However, the tie-line power security region with time coupling is a high-dimension polytope, which leads to a considerable computational burden. This paper presents a fast algorithm to approximate the original high-dimension tie-line security region considering time coupling. A few lower-dimension polytopes associated with combinations of different periods are calculated for the approximation. An evaluation method with clear physical explanations is established to measure the accuracy of the approximation. The method converts the evaluation to two linear programming problems based on the mathematical relationship between optimal points and polytope vertices. Under a Monte Carlo framework, the statistical analysis is employed to measure the accuracy using five presented indices. The performance of the proposed method is verified by the case studies on the IEEE 118-bus test system and a 661-bus utility system.},

Macro-scale meteorology might not fully represent the actual ambient conditions of the loads, renewables, and power equipment, thus hindering an accurate description of load and renewables output fluctuation, and the causes of power equipment ageing and failure. Understanding the interactions between microclimate and electric power systems, and making decisions grounded on such knowledge, is a key to realising the sustainability of the future electric power systems. This review explores key interactions between microclimate and electric power systems across loads, renewables, and connecting transmission lines. The microclimate-based applications in electric power systems and related technologies are described. We also provide a framework for future research on the impact of microclimate on electric power systems mainly powered by renewables.},

  abstract = {Signal measurement appearing in the form of time series is one of the most common types of data used in medical machine learning applications. Such datasets are often small in size, expensive to collect and annotate, and might involve privacy issues, which hinders our ability to train large, stateof-the-art deep learning models for biomedical applications. For time-series data, the suite of data augmentation strategies we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. In this paper, we present TTS-CGAN, a transformer-based conditional GAN model that can be trained on existing multi-class datasets and generate class-specific synthetic time-series sequences of arbitrary length. We elaborate on the model architecture and design strategies. Synthetic sequences generated by our model are indistinguishable from real ones, and can be used to complement or replace real signals of the same type, thus achieving the goal of data augmentation. To evaluate the quality of the generated data, we modify the wavelet coherence metric to be able to compare the similarity between two sets of signals, and also conduct a case study where a mix of synthetic and real data are used to train a deep learning model for sequence classification. Together with other visualization techniques and qualitative evaluation approaches, we demonstrate that TTS-CGAN generated synthetic data are similar to real data, and that our model performs better than the other state-of-the-art GAN models built for time-series data generation.},

However, existing tutorials tend to be at a level of abstraction largely impenetrable by non-technicians. This tutorial aims to help beginners understand key concepts by working through important but often omitted derivations carefully and explicitly, with a focus on linking the mathematics with a practical computation solution for a Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM)---one of the most widely used BNP methods. Abstract concepts are made explicit and concrete to non-technical readers by working through the theory that gives rise to them. A publicly accessible computer program written in the statistical language R is explained line-by-line to help readers understand the computation algorithm. The algorithm is also linked to a construction method called the Chinese Restaurant Process in an accessible tutorial in this journal (Gershman \& Blei, 2012). The overall goals are to help readers understand more fully the theory and application so that they may apply BNP methods in their own work and leverage the technical details in this tutorial to develop novel methods.},

An EH can efficiently model the integration of different energy carriers and coordinate an integrated energy sharing system of multiple prosumers in HE-IES. In this article, a closed-loop framework is designed to integrate the contract theory and consensus algorithms for a bilevel heat--electricity energy sharing system. First, the energy sharing scheme between prosumers and an EH in the lower level energy system is formulated. Contract theory is utilized to maximize the profits of an EH under the information asymmetry scenario, and different contract items are designed for the electric and thermal networks. In particular, a set of new bidirectional contract items is proposed in the electrical network. Furthermore, a consensus-based energy sharing framework among various EHs and utility grid in the upper level system is developed and network constraints are considered. Two types of Lagrange multipliers are defined to decouple the electric and thermal network, and an interactive mechanism is designed to solve the problem. Finally, the simulation results verify the convergence of the bilevel closed-loop framework and the feasibility and performance of the scheme.},

Traditional two-timescale VVC optimizes STDDs and FTCDs based on accurate system models, but sometimes is impractical because of its unaffordable modeling effort. In this paper, a novel bi-level off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) method is proposed to solve this in a model-free manner. A Bi-level Markov decision process (BMDP) is defined and separate agents are set up for the slow and fast timescale sub-problems. For the fast timescale sub-problem, we adopt an off-policy RL method with high sample efficiency. For the slow one, we develop an off-policy multi-discrete soft actor-critic (MDSAC) algorithm to address the curse of dimensionality with various STDDs. To mitigate the non-stationary issue in the two agents' training, we propose a multi-timescale off-policy correction (MTOPC) method by adopting the importance sampling technique. Comprehensive numerical studies not only demonstrate the proposed method can achieve stable and satisfactory optimization of both STDDs and FTCDs without any model information, but also support that the proposed method outperforms existing VVC methods involving both STDDs and FTCDs.},

  abstract = {Distribution power systems (DPSs) are generally unbalanced, and their loads may have notable static voltage characteristics (ZIP loads). Hence, although many papers have focused on linear single-phase power flow models, it is still necessary to study linear three-phase distribution power flow models. This paper proposes a data-driven-aided linear three-phase power flow model for DPSs. We first formulate how to amalgamate data-driven techniques into a linear power flow equation to establish our linear model. This amalgamation makes our linear model independent of the assumptions commonly used in the literature (e.g., nodal voltages are nearly 1.0 p.u.); therefore, our model is characterized by relatively high accuracy, even when the assumptions become invalid. We then demonstrate how to apply our model to DPSs with ZIP loads. We also show that with the Huber penalty function employed, the adverse impact of bad data on our model's accuracy is significantly reduced, rendering our model robust to poor data quality. Case studies demonstrate that our model is generally more accurate, with 2- to 100-fold smaller errors, than most existing linear models, and remains fairly accurate even under poor data conditions. Our model also contributes to a rapid solution to DPS analyses and optimization problems.},

  abstract = {The optimization of electricity--gas coupled systems is typically complicated by the nonconvex relationships such as gas flow equations. Piecewise linearization, despite being one of the few solutions that guarantee exactness and optimality, is often discarded for an exceptionally long computational time. In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach based on artificial neural networks, to enable fast economic dispatch in electricity--gas coupled systems, by utilizing simulation data from the piecewise-linearization-based model-driven method. Load profiles at each electric bus and gas node are fed into the artificial neural network as input neurons; optimal economic dispatch results are set as output neurons, where the dispatch results can be either continuous (e.g. power and gas output) or binary (e.g. scenario feasibility). In generating power and gas outputs, the slack generator method is proposed to further eliminate load mismatch. Case studies on an integrated Belgium 20-node gas/IEEE 24-bus power system show that, after the artificial neural network is properly trained, the data-driven economic dispatch method is 104{$\sim$}105 times faster than model-driven piecewise linearization. It even outperforms second-order cone programming, a well-known convex relaxation technique to model natural gas systems, in terms of both the coupled system's state recovery accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the data-driven method is applied to a multi-period dispatch problem to demonstrate its scalability.},

Here we find that replacing polluting coal technologies with new and improved coal-fired combined heat and power plants will lead to substantial carbon lock-in and hinder decommissioning of associated coal-fired electricity generation. Expanding the use of industrial waste heat and air/ground-source heat pumps can avoid the need for new combined heat and power construction and reduce carbon emissions by 26\% from 2020 to 2030.

A VPP aggregation model considering network constraints and temporal coupling constraints of DERs is constructed, while some VPP performance parameters are proposed to characterize and quantify the regulation ability. An uncertainty set considering time-series coupling properties of variables is constructed, and an aggregation method under uncertainty scenarios is proposed based on a two-stage robust optimization model.

Finally, case studies demonstrates that the proposed method provides a more extensive feasible region compared to other methods, and the deviation power remains within a reasonable range. The dynamic aggregation strategy facilitates the synergistic and correlative operation of DERs, exploits the regulation ability of the VPP in frequency regulation and spinning reserve, and improves the feasibility of practical applications.

While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.},

This article proposes a real-time distribution system topology estimation approach building on the graph theory and Bayesian networks with sparse measurements. The graph theory develops the topology graph bank to effectively leverage the prior knowledge of topology models, including the topology structure and the switching relationship between different topologies. This allows the development of the Bayesian networks for topology tracking using real-time voltage and power injection measurements. A novel discrete method considering the similarity of data correlation information is proposed for the optimal placement of {$\mu$}PMUs to ensure the performance of topology estimation. Numerical results on the IEEE 33-node and 123-node systems show that the BN-based topology estimation model has better performance against incomplete information, i.e., missing data, than other alternatives.},

This paper proposes a RoCoF constrained unit commitment model so as to enhance the frequency stability in operation time-scale, where the spatial difference in frequency dynamics is considered and the RoCoF constraint is enforced for each node. The maximum of node RoCoF is approximated by two terms, i.e., the initial post-disturbance node RoCoF and the maximum of the center of inertia (COI) RoCoF. Analytical expressions of the node initial RoCoF under typical disturbances are derived. Then, a tractable relationship between the node initial RoCoF and the working status of generators is obtained by the piecewise linearization approach. Simulation results carried out on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the proposed model can limit the node RoCoF in an economic and accurate manner. The adaptability to renewable power generation and online application are also discussed.},

The intention behind developing AI was and is to benefit humans by reducing labor, increasing everyday conveniences, and promoting social good. However, recent research and AI applications indicate that AI can cause unintentional harm to humans by, for example, making unreliable decisions in safety-critical scenarios or undermining fairness by inadvertently discriminating against a group or groups. Consequently, trustworthy AI has recently garnered increased attention regarding the need to avoid the adverse effects that AI could bring to people, so people can fully trust and live in harmony with AI technologies. A tremendous amount of research on trustworthy AI has been conducted and witnessed in recent years. In this survey, we present a comprehensive appraisal of trustworthy AI from a computational perspective to help readers understand the latest technologies for achieving trustworthy AI. Trustworthy AI is a large and complex subject, involving various dimensions. In this work, we focus on six of the most crucial dimensions in achieving trustworthy AI: (i) Safety \&amp; Robustness, (ii) Nondiscrimination \&amp; Fairness, (iii) Explainability, (iv) Privacy, (v) Accountability \&amp; Auditability, and (vi) Environmental Well-being. For each dimension, we review the recent related technologies according to a taxonomy and summarize their applications in real-world systems. We also discuss the accordant and conflicting interactions among different dimensions and discuss potential aspects for trustworthy AI to investigate in the future.},

  abstract = {In the context of a network of sky cameras installed on atmospheric multi-instrumented sites, we present an algorithm named ELIFAN, which aims to estimate the cloud cover amount from full-sky visible daytime images with a common principle and procedure. ELIFAN was initially developed for a self-made full-sky image system presented in this article and adapted to a set of other systems in the network. It is based on red-to-blue ratio thresholding for the distinction of cloudy and cloud-free pixels of the image and on the use of a cloud-free sky library, without taking account of aerosol loading. Both an absolute (without the use of a cloud-free reference image) and a differential (based on a cloud-free reference image) red-to-blue ratio thresholding are used.  An evaluation of the algorithm based on a 1-year-long series of images shows that the proposed algorithm is very convincing for most of the images, with about 97\&thinsp;\% of relevance in the process, outside the sunrise and sunset transitions. During those latter periods, however, ELIFAN has large difficulties in appropriately processing the image due to a large difference in color composition and potential confusion between cloud-free and cloudy sky at that time. This issue also impacts the library of cloud-free images. Beside this, the library also reveals some limitations during daytime, with the possible presence of very small and/or thin clouds. However, the latter have only a small impact on the cloud cover estimate.  The two thresholding methodologies, the absolute and the differential red-to-blue ratio thresholding processes, agree very well, with departure usually below 8\&thinsp;\% except in sunrise--sunset periods and in some specific conditions. The use of the cloud-free image library gives generally better results than the absolute process. It particularly better detects thin cirrus clouds. But the absolute thresholding process turns out to be better sometimes, for example in some cases in which the sun is hidden by a cloud.},

First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Firstly, CCLSTM is used to estimate the shape and speed of cloud motion. Secondly, the Super-Resolution Network is built based on perceptual losses to reconstruct the result of CCLSTM and, finally, make it clearer.

Building a highly compatible flexibility evaluation method that incorporates a clear relation between flexibility indices and RE curtailment is crucial to addressing this issue. A novel flexibility evaluation methodology is proposed based on the probabilistic distribution of flexibility adequacy. The novel indices can reflect the direction, amount, frequency, and consequence of lack of flexibility and also have a linear relationship with RE curtailment, features that are beneficial for planners aiming to determine the type of flexible resources needed and to quantify their capacity. The conditional probability distribution functions of different types of flexible resources are first built. Then, a unified form of flexibility on different time-scales is proposed to represent and calculate their contributions to flexible indices using conditional probability convolution. The evaluation method is validated in a combined heat-and-electricity supply system. Four types of flexible resources are studied to demonstrate the quantitative capability of the proposed method in planning, including conventional units, electricity storage devices, heat storage devices, and electric boilers.},

Nevertheless, a possible problem is that power experts may find it hard to trust the results of such algorithms, if they do not fully understand the reasons for their outputs. In this light, this article suggests a method that explains the outputs of PQD classifiers, using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The method operates as follows: first, various XAI techniques and classifiers are combined and scored based on their explanations during the validation step. Then, the best combination of classifier and XAI technique for each disturbance is used on the testing set, such that the classifier outputs are more transparent. To accomplish these steps, a definition for the correct explanation in PQD is given. Also, to determine the quality of an explanation for a certain output, we propose an evaluation process to measure the explainability score for each XAI technique and classifier. By means of this approach, the PQD classifier outputs are optimized to be both accurate and easy to understand, allowing experts to make informed and trustworthy decisions.},

  abstract = {In today's data-driven world, there is a growing opportunity for optimization models to more closely resemble real-world scenarios, namely through learning constraints or objective functions that are not explicitly known and must be estimated through data. In ``Mixed-Integer Optimization with Constraint Learning,'' the authors establish a novel methodological framework for data-driven decision making. Their approach enables constraints and objectives to be embedded directly from trained machine learning models that are mixed-integer optimization representable including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, and neural networks. The authors propose two different strategies to manage uncertainty in learned constraints. The first is based on the concept of trust region where the convex hull of data points is used to avoid extrapolation. Additionally, they present an ensemble learning method for enforcing constraints across multiple estimators, improving the robustness of the downstream prediction accuracy. Practitioners can access this framework through the ``OptiCL'' Python package. Case studies on World Food Programme humanitarian aid planning and chemotherapy regimen optimization demonstrate the methodology's ability to produce scalable and data-informed prescriptions.           ,              We establish a broad methodological foundation for mixed-integer optimization with learned constraints. We propose an end-to-end pipeline for data-driven decision making in which constraints and objectives are directly learned from data using machine learning, and the trained models are embedded in an optimization formulation. We exploit the mixed-integer optimization representability of many machine learning methods, including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, and multilayer perceptrons, which allows us to capture various underlying relationships between decisions, contextual variables, and outcomes. We also introduce two approaches for handling the inherent uncertainty of learning from data. First, we characterize a decision trust region using the convex hull of the observations to ensure credible recommendations and avoid extrapolation. We efficiently incorporate this representation using column generation and propose a more flexible formulation to deal with low-density regions and high-dimensional data sets. Then, we propose an ensemble learning approach that enforces constraint satisfaction over multiple bootstrapped estimators or multiple algorithms. In combination with domain-driven components, the embedded models and trust region define a mixed-integer optimization problem for prescription generation. We implement this framework as a Python package (OptiCL) for practitioners. We demonstrate the method in both World Food Programme planning and chemotherapy optimization. The case studies illustrate the framework's ability to generate high-quality prescriptions and the value added by the trust region, the use of ensembles to control model robustness, the consideration of multiple machine learning methods, and the inclusion of multiple learned constraints.

Secondly, outputs from the rigorous model are compared to outputs from simpler models used in the literature. It is found that there is a significant prediction error in these simpler models. The pipeline model is also extended to address a pipeline network, for which the mixing effect at the pipeline junctions is addressed. Lastly, a FCMP problem is solved for a pipeline network, and the obtained mass flow rates are used to assess the performance of different models. It is found that consideration of temperature variation and rigorous calculation of critical physical quantities are crucial for a more accurate model that better represents reality.},

This market presents an important difference with the energy-only market: while the need for energy production is driven by the demand from consumers, frequency-containment AS are procured because of the need to deal with the largest generation/demand loss in the system (or smaller losses that could potentially compromise frequency stability). Thus, a question that arises is: who should pay for frequency-containment AS? In this work, we propose a cost-allocation methodology based on the nucleolus concept, in order to distribute the total payments for frequency-containment AS among all generators or loads that create the need for these services. It is shown that this method complies with necessary properties for the AS market, such as avoidance of cross-subsidies and maintaining players in this cooperative game. Finally, we demonstrate its practical applicability through a case study for the Great Britain power system, while comparing its performance with two alternative mechanisms, namely proportional and Shapley value cost allocation.},

A split expectation-maximization (split-EM) method is proposed considering the measurement errors to deal with the topology identification problem on the historical batch data, in which the number of topology categories does not need to be given in advance. Based on the topology identification results of historical data, the number of topology categories is reduced. Then, feasible classifiers are trained using machine learning methods to predict the real-time topology efficiently. An error-correcting mechanism is proposed for the real-time identification involving the credibility analysis and the reidentification based on the Bayesian recursion model. Finally, via a practical example, the effectiveness of the proposed models is verified by efficiently identifying the PDN's topologies in both the historical batch data with mixed topologies and real-time measurements. In addition, the partition-based extension application solution of the topology identification models for large-scale PDNs is proposed without extra measurements to relieve the calculation burden and reduce the identification time notably while maintaining the accuracy as the non-partitioned scheme.},

The second is meant to assess in advance the flexibility that an ADN will have in future time intervals using forecasts of time-variant influencing factors handling uncertainty by a probabilistic approach.

  abstract = {The traditional energy system has the disadvantages of high energy consumption and high emission. Through multiple energy networks interconnection and flexible energy conversion, the regional integrated energy system (RIES) can satisfy various energy demands and achieve clean and efficient energy utilization. However, the demand and supply relationship of RIES is complex. Without a reasonable energy supply structure, it's difficult for RIES to give full play to the economic and efficient operation. At the same time, the multi-energy trading and service mechanisms are still unclear. The promotion of RIES brings challenges and opportunities to energy sector. In order to address the issues in the promotion of RIES, a day-ahead energy trading strategy of RIES considering energy cascade utilization is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the relationship between energy suppliers (ESs), integrated energy service provider (IESP) and energy users (EUs) is clarified. And their benefits are clarified in the energy trading strategy. Furthermore, the day-ahead energy trading model, which is a bi-level optimization model is built. In the upper model, the IESP purchases electric energy and natural gas from ESs at wholesale prices and set energy retail prices. According to energy cascade utilization theory, the IESP make decisions on the energy retail plan and energy scheduling. In the lower model, optimal energy consuming plan are given for EUs. In this model, energy grades of energy production, conversion and storage devices output are classified and the energy grade demands of different energy loads are divided. And the energy cascade utilization trading model is simulated based on actual data. The simulation results show that the trading strategy is feasible and the application of energy cascade utilization theory can further improve the energy utilization efficiency of RIES.},

  abstract = {Increasing the building energy efficiency in recent years results in noticeably reduction in their heating demand. Combined with the current trend for utilizing low temperature heat sources, it raises the necessity of introducing a new generation of district heating [DH] systems with lowered operational temperature. However, in order to implement low temperature concept for existing DH systems, there is a need to apply a stepwise changes in the existing systems. This study emphasis on improving the existing DH pipes networks. For this purpose the first step is developing a model, which comprises district heating networks [DHN] characteristics.This paper is presenting a new developed model, which reflects the thermo-dynamic behavior of DHN. It is designed for tree network topologies. The purpose of the model is to serve as a basis for applying a variety of scenarios towards lowering the temperature in DH systems. The main focus is on modeling transient heat transfer in pipe networks regarding the time delays between the heat supply unit and the consumers, the heat loss in the pipe networks and the consumers' dynamic heat loads. A pseudo-dynamic approach is adopted and also the implicit finite element method is applied to simulate transient temperature changes in pipe networks. The model is calculating time series data related to supply temperature to the DHN from heat production units, heat loads and return temperature related to each consumer to calculate dynamic temperature changes in the network, heat loss and temperature loss through the pipe networks. To validate the model and to demonstrate its competences, the model is applied for Studstrup district heating networks. Studstrup is a suburban area in Aarhus, Denmark where 320 consumers are connected to the DHN through approximately 14 km pipelines (supply and return pipes). At the first stage, the Studstrup DH system is developed in TERMIS, which is commercial software for district heating system simulation, and then the developed model is validated and compared with the results obtained from TERMIS and measurements. The TERMIS model is already validated towards measurements.This paper explains the developed model, which is going to be used for performing possible scenarios to improve the existing DHN from heat and temperature loss viewpoints. Moreover, it provides a platform to add and extend different aspect of DH systems.},

There is a push to develop LPEs for power system interconnections to be used in markets and reliability studies. The equivalents that exist for these interconnections do not capture thermal limits of equivalent lines, which results in their transmission limits being significantly different from the original interconnection limits. Assigning noninfinite and nonzero limits to equivalent lines is the niche of this paper. This is done by considering an unloaded network, which is operating point independent. A solution method is developed and discussed, which is capable of assigning lower, best, and upper estimates for equivalent line limits and is proposed for use towards developing LPEs.},

This energetic flexibility can be used for various purposes such as minimizing energy procurement costs or providing ancillary services to power grids. To fully leverage the flexibility available from distributed small-scale resources, their flexibility must be quantified and aggregated. This paper introduces a generic and scalable approach for flexible energy systems to quantitatively describe and price their flexibility based on zonotopic sets. The description allows aggregators to efficiently aggregate the flexibility of large numbers of systems and to make control and market decisions on the aggregate level. In addition, an algorithm is presented that distributes aggregate-level control decisions among the individual systems of the population in an economically fair and computationally efficient way. The algorithm is applied to the problem of disaggregating reference schedules resulting from day-ahead energy markets.},

These systems rely on robust forecasting, optimization, and control/scheduling algorithms that can handle the uncertain nature of demand and renewable generation. This paper proposes an advanced ML algorithm, called Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network based Forecast Embedded Scheduling (rTPNN-FES), to provide efficient residential demand control. rTPNN-FES is a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously forecasts renewable energy generation and schedules household appliances. By its embedded structure, rTPNN-FES eliminates the utilization of separate algorithms for forecasting and scheduling and generates a schedule that is robust against forecasting errors. This paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm for an IoT-enabled smart home. The evaluation results reveal that rTPNN-FES provides near-optimal scheduling 37.5 times faster than the optimization while outperforming state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces, for the first time to our knowledge, physics-informed neural networks to accurately estimate the AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) result and delivers rigorous guarantees about their performance. Power system operators, along with several other actors, are increasingly using Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithms for a wide number of applications, including planning and real-time operations. However, in its original form, the AC OPF problem is often challenging to solve as it is non-linear and non-convex. Besides the large number of approximations and relaxations, recent efforts have also been focusing on Machine Learning approaches, especially neural networks. So far, however, these approaches have only partially considered the wide number of physical models available during training. And, more importantly, they have offered no guarantees about potential constraint violations of their output. Our approach (i) introduces a framework to incorporate AC power flow equations inside neural network training and (ii) integrates methods that rigorously determine and reduce the worst-case constraint violations across the entire input domain, while maintaining the optimality of the prediction. We demonstrate how physics-informed neural networks achieve higher accuracy and lower constraint violations than standard neural networks, and show how we can further reduce the worst-case violations for all neural networks.},

The conventional interval arithmetic (IA) and affine arithmetic (AA) cannot fully apply the characteristics of general algebra: associativity, inverse elements, distributive law, so the IA or AA based interval power flows (IPFs) are either very conservative or unreliable. Relative-Distance-Measure (RDM) arithmetic can overcome these defects in the conventional arithmetic for interval analysis and therefore a RDM based IPF is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, a linear programming contractor (LPC) is developed to solve this RDM based IPF, which can iteratively transform the IPF problem into serial linear optimization models and its results are reliable. Simulation results of IEEE 123-bus test systems show that the proposed IPF can obtain much better results than those of baseline methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.},

  abstract = {State estimation (SE) of distribution networks heavily relies on pseudo measurements that introduce significant errors, since real-time measurements are insufficient. Interval SE models are regularly used, where true values of system states are supposed to be within the estimated intervals. However, conventional interval SE algorithms cannot consider the correlations of same interval variables in different terms of constraints, which results in overly conservative estimation results. In this paper, we propose a new interval SE model that is based on the relative distance measure (RDM) arithmetic. In the proposed model, measurement errors are assumed to be bounded in given sets and the state variables are described as RDM variables. Since the SE model is a non-convex, the solution's credibility cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each nonlinear measurement equation in the model is transformed into dual inequality linear equations using the mean value theorem. The SE model is finally reformulated as a linear programming contractor that iteratively narrows the upper and lower bounds of the estimated state variables. Numerical tests on IEEE three-phase distribution networks show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional interval-constrained propagation, modified Krawczyk-operator and optimization based interval SE methods.},

  abstract = {Forecasting the formation and development of clouds is a central element of modern weather forecasting systems. Incorrect clouds forecasts can lead to major uncertainty in the overall accuracy of weather forecasts due to their intrinsic role in the Earth's climate system. Few studies have tackled this challenging problem from a machine learning point-of-view due to a shortage of high-resolution datasets with many historical observations globally. In this paper, we present a novel satellite-based dataset called ``CloudCast''. It consists of 70,080 images with 10 different cloud types for multiple layers of the atmosphere annotated on a pixel level. The spatial resolution of the dataset is 928 x 1530 pixels (3x3 km per pixel) with 15-min intervals between frames for the period 2017-01-01 to 2018-12-31. All frames are centered and projected over Europe. To supplement the dataset, we conduct an evaluation study with current state-of-the-art video prediction methods such as convolutional long short-term memory networks, generative adversarial networks, and optical flow-based extrapolation methods. As the evaluation of video prediction is difficult in practice, we aim for a thorough evaluation in the spatial and temporal domain. Our benchmark models show promising results but with ample room for improvement. This is the first publicly available global-scale dataset with high-resolution cloud types on a high temporal granularity to the authors' best knowledge.},

A database containing information about various aspects of the identified datasets is constructed. A multi-criteria ranking system is further developed to evaluate each dataset based on eight dimensions which could have important impacts on the data usage. Finally, insights on the applications of these datasets are provided. This study streamlines the processes of identifying and selecting sky image datasets, and could potentially accelerate the method development and benchmark in solar forecasting and related fields including energy meteorology and atmospheric science.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaics (PV), the primary use of solar energy, is growing rapidly. However, the variable output of PV under changing weather conditions may hinder the large-scale deployment of PV. In this study, we propose a two-stage classification-prediction framework to predict contemporaneous PV power output from sky images (a so-called ``nowcast''), and compare it with an end-to-end convolution neural network (CNN). The proposed framework first classifies input images into different sky conditions and then the classified images are sent to specific sub-models for PV output prediction. Two types of classifiers are developed and compared: (1) a CNN-based classifier trained on clear sky index (CSI)-labeled sky images and (2) a physics-based non-parametric classifier based on a threshold of fractional cloudiness of sky images. Different numbers of classification categories are also examined. The results suggest that the cloudiness-based classifier is more suitable than the CSI-based classifier for the framework, and the 3-class classification (i.e., sunny, cloudy, overcast) is found to be the optimal choice. We then fine-tune the cloudiness threshold for the non-parametric classifier and tailor the architecture for each sky-condition-specific sub-model. Under the best design, the proposed framework can achieve a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.20\,kW (relative to a 30\,kW rated PV array) on the test set comprising 18 complete days (9 sunny, RMSE\,=\,0.69\,kW; 9 cloudy, RMSE\,=\,3.06\,kW). Compared with the end-to-end CNN baseline model, the overall prediction performance can be improved by 6\% (7\% in sunny and 6\% in cloudy), with 6\% fewer trainable parameters needed in the architecture.},

  abstract = {Large-scale integration of photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is challenged by the intermittent nature of solar power. Sky-image-based solar forecasting using deep learning has been recognized as a promising approach to predicting the short-term fluctuations. However, there are few publicly available standardized benchmark datasets for image-based solar forecasting, which limits the comparison of different forecasting models and the exploration of forecasting methods. To fill these gaps, we introduce SKIPP'D---a SKy Images and Photovoltaic Power Generation Dataset. The dataset contains three years (2017--2019) of quality-controlled down-sampled sky images and PV power generation data that is ready-to-use for short-term solar forecasting using deep learning. In addition, to support the flexibility in research, we provide the high resolution, high frequency sky images and PV power generation data as well as the concurrent sky video footage. We also include a code base containing data processing scripts and baseline model implementations for researchers to reproduce our previous work and accelerate their research in solar forecasting.},

This method typically uses recurrent units to capture long-term dependencies, but these units often come with high computational costs and limited performance in real-world scenes. This paper presents an innovative Wavelet-based SpatioTemporal (WaST) framework, which extracts and adaptively controls both low and high-frequency components at image and feature levels via 3D discrete wavelet transform for faster processing while maintaining high-quality predictions. We propose a Time-Frequency Aware Translator uniquely crafted to efficiently learn short- and long-range spatiotemporal information by individually modeling spatial frequency and temporal variations. Meanwhile, we design a wavelet-domain High-Frequency Focal Loss that effectively supervises high-frequency variations. Extensive experiments across various real-world scenarios, such as driving scene prediction, traffic flow prediction, human motion capture, and weather forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed WaST achieves state-of-the-art performance over various spatiotemporal prediction methods.

A Bayesian nonparametric model---the Dirichlet process mixture model---is adopted and combined with a variational inference algorithm to extract the information embedded within uncertainty data. Further a data-driven approach for defining uncertainty set is proposed. This machine-learning model is seamlessly integrated with adaptive robust optimization approach through a novel four-level optimization framework. This framework explicitly accounts for the correlation, asymmetry and multimode of uncertainty data, so it generates less conservative solutions. Additionally, the proposed framework is robust not only to parameter variations, but also to anomalous measurements. Because the resulting multilevel optimization problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf solvers, an efficient column-and-constraint generation algorithm is proposed to address the computational challenge. Two industrial applications on batch process scheduling and on process network planning are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed modeling framework and effectiveness of the solution algorithm. {\copyright} 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 3790--3817, 2017},

By applying principal component analysis to uncertainty data, correlations between uncertain parameters are effectively captured, and latent uncertainty sources are identified. These data are then projected onto each principal component to facilitate extracting distributional information of latent uncertainties using kernel density estimation techniques. To explicitly account for asymmetric distributions, we introduce forward and backward deviation vectors into the data-driven uncertainty set, which are further incorporated into novel data-driven static and adaptive robust optimization models. The proposed framework not only significantly ameliorates the conservatism of robust optimization, but also enjoys computational efficiency and wide-ranging applicability.

  abstract = {Supramolecular peptide-based materials have great potential for revolutionizing fields like nanotechnology and medicine. However, deciphering the intricate sequence-to-assembly pathway, essential for their real-life applications, remains a challenging endeavour. Their discovery relies primarily on empirical approaches that require substantial financial resources, impeding their disruptive potential. Consequently, despite the multitude of characterized self-assembling peptides and their demonstrated advantages, only a few peptide materials have found their way to the market. Machine learning trained on experimentally verified data presents a promising tool for quickly identifying sequences with a high propensity to self-assemble, thereby focusing resource expenditures on the most promising candidates. Here we introduce a framework that implements an accurate classifier in a metaheuristic-based generative model to navigate the search through the peptide sequence space of challenging size. For this purpose, we trained five recurrent neural networks among which the hybrid model that uses sequential information on aggregation propensity and specific physicochemical properties achieved a superior performance with 81.9\% accuracy and 0.865 F1 score. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental validation have confirmed the generative model to be 80--95\% accurate in the discovery of self-assembling peptides, outperforming the current state-of-the-art models. The proposed modular framework efficiently complements human intuition in the exploration of self-assembling peptides and presents an important step in the development of intelligent laboratories for accelerated material discovery.},

  abstract = {Modern power systems are undergoing a transitional phase, increasingly incorporating renewable energy sources (RES) to harness their economic and environmental benefits. The main challenge with this transitional phase is the management of the increased variability and uncertainty in the power balance. Legacy operation and planning practices are gradually seen as becoming inadequate or ill-adapted in addressing this challenge. One particular gap in the state of the art, which is of great importance, is estimating the operational flexibility potential of individual power system assets and their aggregation at the system level. System operators need to evaluate and plan ahead flexibility adequacy for their power systems in order to ensure feasible and economical operation under high RES penetration. Likewise, asset owners need to integrate the notion of asset flexibility as part of their investment and operations decisions. To this end, we propose the concept of the flexibility envelope to describe the flexibility potential dynamics of a power system and its individual resources in the operational planning time-frame. We demonstrate that the resulting envelope dynamics can be a starting point for flexibility adequacy planning in systems with highly variable generation.},

The traditional planning, performed by utilities and system operators, includes the study of system resource adequacy during peak load periods in the summer and winter to ensure the generation and transmission system is appropriate to meet load. But in a power grid with a high penetration of variable renewable energy (i.e., wind and solar), periods of high risk to system resource adequacy may no longer correspond only to hours of peak load. In particular, high shares of variable renewable energy, even when well-forecasted to inform system operations, can further complicate the stress extreme weather events already place on the grid. They also may lead to changes to the types of weather conditions that are most problematic to system operations and resource adequacy due to widespread and extended deficits of wind and solar generation. Accordingly, the focus of reliability assessments in long-term planning studies may need to evolve in the coming years to more fully incorporate weather events that lead to these deficits. This report seeks to identify these new weather events and understand the characteristics of the events that lead to system risk of future systems with higher penetrations variable renewable energy.},

  abstract = {Traditional power grids are mainly based on centralized power generation and subsequent distribution. The increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources and the growing number of electrical loads is creating difficulties in balancing supply and demand and threatens the secure and efficient operation of power grids. At the same time, households hold an increasing amount of flexibility, which can be exploited by demand-side management to decrease customer cost and support grid operation. Compared to the collection of individual flexibilities, aggregation reduces optimization complexity, protects households' privacy, and lowers the communication effort. In mathematical terms, each flexibility is modeled by a set of power profiles, and the aggregated flexibility is modeled by the Minkowski sum of individual flexibilities. As the exact Minkowski sum calculation is generally computationally prohibitive, various approximations can be found in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is a comparative evaluation of several approximation algorithms in terms of novel quality criteria, computational complexity, and communication effort using realistic data. Furthermore, we investigate the dependence of selected comparison criteria on the time horizon length and on the number of households. Our results indicate that none of the algorithms perform satisfactorily in all categories. Hence, we provide guidelines on the application-dependent algorithm choice. Moreover, we demonstrate a major drawback of some inner approximations, namely that they may lead to situations in which not using the flexibility is impossible, which may be suboptimal in certain situations.},

  abstract = {Integrated heat and electricity dispatch is crucial to exploit synergistic benefits from integrated energy systems. However, this requires information from both electricity systems and district heating systems (DHSs), which are managed by an electricity control center (ECC) and district heating control centers (DHCCs), respectively. For reasons pertaining to privacy, communication, dimension, and compatibility, it is not practical for DHCCs to send detailed models to the ECC. Therefore, a new feasible region method is proposed for formulation of new DHS models, which exploit the flexibility of DHSs with consideration of building thermal inertia. A greedy method is developed to solve the new modified feasible region models by calculating a series of linear programming problems efficiently. Then the new models are sent to the ECC to be used in central dispatch considering DHS operation constraints, i.e. integrated heat and electricity dispatch. The modified models are similar to conventional power plants and storages, and are thus compatible with current dispatch programs. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the method. Although some conservativeness exists, the total cost and wind energy curtailment are both decreased compared to conventional decoupled dispatch.},

The estimation quality of the stochastic model is positively influenced since in the power domain, a lower number of independent parameters is estimated from a given amount of recorded data. The simulation results prove that this method offers excellent fit for both the probability density function and the autocorrelation function of the generated wind power time series.

  abstract = {Accurate forecasts of distributed solar generation are necessary to reduce negative impacts resulting from the increased uptake of distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, the high variability of solar generation over short time intervals (seconds to minutes) caused by cloud movement makes this forecasting task difficult. To address this, using cloud images, which capture the second-to-second changes in cloud cover affecting solar generation, has shown promise. Recently, deep neural networks with "attention" that focus on important regions of an image have been applied with success in many computer vision applications. However, their use for forecasting cloud movement has not yet been extensively explored. In this work, we propose an attention-based convolutional long short-term memory network to forecast cloud movement and apply an existing self-attention-based method previously proposed for video prediction to forecast cloud movement. We investigate and discuss the impact of cloud forecasts from attention-based methods towards forecasting distributed solar generation, compared to cloud forecasts from non-attention-based methods. We further provide insights into the different solar forecast performances that can be achieved for high and low altitude clouds. We find that for clouds at high altitudes, the cloud predictions obtained using attention-based methods result in solar forecast skill score improvements of 5.86\% or more compared to non-attention-based methods.},

Three essential components that characterize a virtual power plant are distinguished, followed by a comprehensive overview of the services they can deliver in today's liberalized markets in Europe. It is found that a combination of technical, economic and regulatory barriers still hamper a widespread implementation of the concept. In addition, specific regulatory barriers are identified that hinder a virtual power plant in providing certain services.

In this work, we use artificial intelligence to reconstruct observations of European climate extremes (warm and cold days and nights) by leveraging Earth system model data from CMIP6 through transfer learning. Our method surpasses conventional statistical techniques and diffusion models, showcasing its ability to reconstruct past extreme events and reveal spatial trends across an extensive time span (1901-2018) that is not covered by most reanalysis datasets. Providing our dataset to the climate community will improve the characterization of climate extremes, resulting in better risk management and policies.},

The coefficient of heat transfer from gas to the external medium and the coefficient of internal viscous friction of hydraulic resistance are considered as such parameters. The theoretical calculation of these coefficients with sufficient accuracy for practice is very difficult due to the significant uncertainty of the actual conditions of heat transfer along the route and the current state of the pipeline. To solve this problem, a mathematical model of a steady gas flow in a pipeline is proposed, which is based on the assumptions about the polytrophic nature of the gas, as well as the non-isentropic and nonadiabatic nature of its flow. Together with the model, a method for identifying undefined coefficients has been developed. The problem of building the corresponding computational procedures with unknown boundary conditions is solved. An analysis of emergency states of a gas pipeline for cases of complete rupture and partial destruction of its wall was carried out by means of numerical modeling. Examples of using the developed model for predicting emergency states of gas pipelines are given.},

This storage device definition has some mathematical advantages: 1) it can be easily integrated within complex optimization problems, 2) it can be modeled using linear programming, suitable for practical large-scale cases. Secondly, a stochastic unit commitment with ideal and generic storage devices and intermittent generation is proposed to solve the joint energy-and-reserves scheduling and real-time power balance problem, reflecting the minute-by-minute intermittent changes and the stochasticity of renewable resources. We also compare our results with those obtained using a deterministic unit commitment with perfect information. The proposed model is illustrated with a 24-bus system.},

The high variability of the primary source challenges the grid operators in ensuring the stability and reliability of the electric grid. Machine learning algorithms, and in particular artificial neural networks, are one of the most reliable methods for photovoltaic (PV) energy production forecast. This article proposes a new ensemble method based on the probabilistic distribution of the trials, the probabilistic ensemble method (PEM). The proposed method has been tested on a three-years real case study, where the available days have been clustered according to the solar irradiation forecast. The days where the worst performance, in terms of nRMSE, was recorded mostly belonged to the totally cloudy days class, that has been therefore selected for the analysis. The PEM has been compared with the ensemble based on the mean value, achieving an improvement in the nRMSE metric up to 4.79\% in 2017 in the totally cloudy days class.},

  abstract = {Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP)1, which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations2,3. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather~Forecasts4. GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25{$^\circ$} latitude--longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8\,min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2\% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production. This work helps open the next chapter in operational weather forecasting, in which crucial weather-dependent decisions are made more accurately and efficiently.},

The growing pressure, primarily driven by environmental concerns, for generating more electricity from renewables and improving energy efficiency have promoted the application of DER into electricity systems. So far, DER have been used to displace energy from conventional generating plants but not to displace their capacity as they are not visible to system operators. If this continues, this will lead to problematic over-capacity issues and under-utilisation of the assets, reduce overall system efficiency and eventually increase the electricity cost that needs to be paid by society. The concept of VPP was developed to enhance the visibility and control of DER to system operators and other market actors by providing an appropriate interface between these system components. The technical and commercial functionality facilitated through the VPP are described and concludes with case studies demonstrating the benefit of aggregation (VPP concept) and the use of the optimal power flow algorithm to characterise VPP},

  abstract = {This paper proposes and evaluates a systematic method of scheduling energy storage and conventional generation capacities in a day-ahead frequency regulation market, based on compliance to control performance standard 1 (CPS1), during each hour of the following day. The salient feature of this method is the development of two simple piecewise linear curves that represent the relationship between first, conventional generation and energy storage power capacities, and second, energy storage power and energy capacities, to satisfy CPS1 compliance in the presence of stochastic load variations. These curves are then modeled inside a mixed integer linear program to solve for resource allocations by minimizing total capacity cost. As such, the formulation avoids complex algorithms that are otherwise required to model frequency dynamics inside the optimization problem. To reduce computation time, a scenario reduction algorithm is used to obtain a small set of scenarios to represent the stochastic load. The proposed method is evaluated using comprehensive dynamic simulations of the two-area IEEE reliability test system implemented in PSS/E. The results prove that the proposed method is effective for scheduling capacities to meet CPS1 compliance with minimum cost.},

  abstract = {With the proliferation of natural gas combined cycle units, the modern energy infrastructure has evolved into a coupled electricity and natural gas system, which often encompasses multiple large-scale and geographically-diverse energy areas. The similarity in electricity and natural gas consumption profiles in coupled systems gives rise to critical mandates for the coordinated optimization of electricity and natural gas operation. This paper presents a decentralized optimization framework, which considers wind energy and power-to-gas (P2G) technologies in the operation of integrated multi-area electricity and natural gas transmission system (IEGTS). First, a comprehensive optimal dispatch model is established for the multi-area IEGTS in a centralized manner where bi-directional flows of electricity and natural gas among multi-areas are optimized considering the stochastic nature of wind energy. In particular, a linearized transient-state gas flow model under mild assumptions is proposed to represent the dynamic characteristics of the natural gas sector. The centralized optimization problem is decomposed into a set of computationally-tractable subproblems that are solved independently in individual areas. The alternating direction multiplier method is employed to achieve a rapidly convergent solution while preserving the privacy of operation data shared among participating areas. Finally, case studies are carried out on two multi-area IEGTS with multiple wind generation scenarios which demonstrate the computational performance of the proposed method with P2G facilities operating in variable conditions.},

To address this challenge, in this article, the asynchronous dispatch method is proposed and instantiated by two different dispatch models featuring a short electric dispatch time scale and a long heat dispatch time scale. Case studies demonstrate the asynchronous dispatch method can overcome the efficiency and reliability problems caused by the existing synchronous dispatch methods.},

However, in deregulated power systems, investor-owned storage participates in electricity markets with a profit-driven motive. The alignment of such profit-driven operations with social welfare critically depends on market design and storage's participation choices. This study employs an agent-based approach and investigates the impact of different market participation options on storage's contribution to reducing electricity costs and carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the existing electricity pool market design in North America may encourage early-stage storage adoptions but hinder progress toward deep decarbonization. We found that day-ahead markets are more effective in utilizing storage to reduce carbon emissions, while real-time markets are more effective in reducing costs. We compare different combinations of storage market participation choices and conclude trade-offs between consumer energy affordability and carbon emissions.},

  abstract = {Solar energy production based on a photovoltaic system is closely related to solar irradiance. Therefore, the planning of production is based on the prediction of solar irradiance. The optimal use of different energy storage systems requires an accurate prediction of solar irradiation with at least an hourly time horizon. In this work, a solar irradiance prediction method is developed based on the prediction of solar shading by clouds. The method is based on determining the current cloud position and estimating the velocity from a sequence of multiple images taken with a 180-degree wide-angle camera with a resolution of 5 s. The cloud positions for the next hour interval are calculated from the estimated current cloud position and velocity. Based on the cloud position, the percentage of solar overshadowing by clouds is determined, i.e., the solar overshadowing curve for the next hour interval is calculated. The solar irradiance is determined by normalizing the percentage of the solar unshadowing curve to the mean value of the irradiance predicted by the hydrometeorological institute for that hourly interval. Image processing for cloud detection and localization is performed using a computer vision library and the Java programming language. The algorithm developed in this work leads to improved accuracy and resolution of irradiance prediction for the next hour interval. The predicted irradiance curve can be used as a predicted reference for solar energy production in energy storage system optimization.},

  abstract = {The integration of different energy systems is receiving increasing attention as a promising solution to accom\- modate the rising share of renewable energy sources (RES). The synergies among different energy carriers can be exploited to introduce flexibility to the system and compensate for the uncertain and fluctuating production from RES. In particular, the power and natural gas networks are becoming increasingly coupled due to the growth in electricity produced from gas-fired power plants, and the emergence of power-to-gas technologies. This paper aims at analyzing the existing literature about the short-term optimal operation of integrated electrical-gas systems (IEGSs) and identifying the benefits of coordinated optimization compared to independent scheduling of the two sectors. A comprehensive overview of the mathematical modeling of the two systems and the linking components is presented. The results show that lower operating costs and higher utilization of renewables are achieved by adopting fully integrated optimization strategies. Moreover, linepack modeling is crucial to fully capture the intrinsic storage capability of the gas network. Finally, modeling the uncertainties from RES pro\- duction is imperative, since these are reflected in the gas network. Whilst significant research about IEGS modeling has been undertaken, there are still several challenges in solving the co-optimization problem. In this review, possible solution approaches are discussed, identifying linearization and convex relaxation techniques as powerful tools to approximate the nonconvex and nonlinear gas flow equation. Furthermore, decomposition techniques and decentralized optimization schemes can be used to more efficiently solve the problem, and, concurrently, tackle regulatory and privacy issues.},

The optimization process is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) also known as security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). Independent system operators (ISOs) run SCUC daily and require state-of-the-art algorithms to speed up the process. Existing patterns in historical information can be leveraged for model reduction of SCUC, which can provide significant time savings. In this paper, machine learning (ML) based classification approaches, namely logistic regression, neural networks, random forest and K-nearest neighbor, were studied for model reduction of SCUC. The ML was then aided with a feasibility layer (FL) and post-process technique to ensure high quality solutions. The proposed approach is validated on several test systems namely, IEEE 24-Bus system, IEEE-73 Bus system, IEEE 118-Bus system, South-Carolina (SC) synthetic grid 500-Bus system, and Polish 2383-Bus system. Moreover, model reduction of a stochastic SCUC (SSCUC) was demonstrated utilizing a modified IEEE 24-Bus system with renewable generation. Simulation results demonstrate a high training accuracy to identify commitment schedule while FL and post-process ensure ML predictions do not lead to infeasible solutions with minimal loss in solution quality.},

Recourse actions in both systems, based on linear decision rules, allow adjustments to the dispatch and operating set-points during real-time operation when the uncertainty in wind power production is revealed. We convexify the non-linear and nonconvex power and gas flow equations using DC power flow approximation and second-order cone relaxation, respectively. Our coordination approach enables a study of the mitigation of short-term uncertainty propagated from the power system to the gas side. We analyze the results of the proposed approach on a case study and evaluate the solution quality via out-of-sample simulations performed ex-ante.},

ProteinGAN learns the evolutionary relationships of protein sequences directly from the complex multidimensional amino-acid sequence space and creates new, highly diverse sequence variants with natural-like physical properties. Using malate dehydrogenase (MDH) as a template enzyme, we show that 24\% (13 out of 55 tested) of the ProteinGAN-generated and experimentally tested sequences are soluble and display MDH catalytic activity in the tested conditions in vitro, including a highly mutated variant of 106 amino-acid substitutions. ProteinGAN therefore demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to rapidly generate highly diverse functional proteins within the allowed biological constraints of the sequence space.},

The integrating large number of resources in the existing market structure, particularly in the light of providing flexibility services, is envisioned through the concept of virtual power plant (VPP). To this end, it is crucial to establish a clear methodology for VPP flexibility modelling. In this context, this paper first puts forward the need to clarify the difference between feasibility and flexibility potential of a VPP, and then propose a methodology for the evaluation of relevant operating regions. Similar concepts can also be used to modelling TSO/DSO interface operation. Several case studies are designed to reflect the distinct information conveyed by feasibility and flexibility operating regions in the presence of ``slow'' and ``fast'' responding resources for a VPP partaking in the provision of energy and grid support services. The results also highlight the impact of flexible load and importantly network topology on the VPP feasibility (FOR) and flexibility (FXOR) operating regions.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive DER flexibility modelling and characterisation framework that is based on the concept of nodal operating envelope (NOE). In particular, capacity, ramp, duration and cost are identified as key flexibility metrics and associated with different but consistent NOEs describing capability, feasibility, ramp, duration, economic, technical and commercial flexibility features. These NOEs, which conceptually arise from a Venn diagram, can be built via optimal power flow (OPF) analysis, visualised in the active-reactive power space, and used by different stakeholders. Results from a canonical test system and a real distribution system illustrate the value and applicability of the proposed framework to model and characterise provision of flexibility and market services from DER for different use cases.},

In the life sciences, the anticipated growth of sequencing promises unprecedented data on natural sequence diversity. Protein language modeling at the scale of evolution is a logical step toward predictive and generative artificial intelligence for biology. To this end, we use unsupervised learning to train a deep contextual language model on 86 billion amino acids across 250 million protein sequences spanning evolutionary diversity. The resulting model contains information about biological properties in its representations. The representations are learned from sequence data alone. The learned representation space has a multiscale organization reflecting structure from the level of biochemical properties of amino acids to remote homology of proteins. Information about secondary and tertiary structure is encoded in the representations and can be identified by linear projections. Representation learning produces features that generalize across a range of applications, enabling state-of-the-art supervised prediction of mutational effect and secondary structure and improving state-of-the-art features for long-range contact prediction.},

The resulting formulation has the same computational complexity as the deterministic problem. Furthermore, a valuation framework to assess the cost of securing the system against fluctuations in wind power in-feed is proposed. The applicability of the method and the valuation framework is demonstrated on the IEEE RTS96 system. We show that the probabilistic formulation leads to lower probability of thermal overloads, and that it is less costly to secure the system against uncertain in-feed than to secure the system against failures in most cases.},

  abstract = {Higher levels of renewable electricity generation increase uncertainty in power system operation. To ensure secure system operation, new tools that account for this uncertainty are required. In this paper, we adopt a chance-constrained AC optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that generation, power flows, and voltages remain within their bounds with a predefined probability. We then discuss different chance-constraint reformulations and solution approaches for the problem. We first describe an analytical reformulation based on partial linearization, which enables us to obtain a tractable representation of the optimization problem. We then provide an efficient algorithm based on an iterative solution scheme which alternates between solving a deterministic AC optimal power flow problem and assessing the impact of uncertainty. The flexibility of the iterative scheme enables not only scalable implementations, but also alternative chance-constraint reformulations. In particular, we suggest two sample-based reformulations that do not require any approximation or relaxation of the AC power flow equations. In a case study based on four different IEEE systems, we assess the performance of the method, and demonstrate scalability of the iterative scheme. We further show that the analytical reformulation accurately and efficiently enforces chance constraints in both in- and out-of-sample tests, and that the analytical reformulations outperforms the two alternative, sample-based chance constraint reformulations.},

We propose a peptide design system for protein targets based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) called GANDALF (Generative Adversarial Network Drug-tArget Ligand Fructifier). GAN based methods have been developed for computational drug design but these can only generate small molecules, not peptides. Peptides are very complex macromolecules which makes them much more difficult than small molecules to generate. Our GANDALF methodology uses two networks to generate a new peptide sequence and structure. It also incorporates data such as active atoms not used in other methods. Active atoms are important because they interact via electron sharing when a target protein and a peptide bind to each other. We can identify the active atoms using our electron structure calculation (eCADD) program and the rules of interaction we have developed. Our method goes farther than comparable methods by generating a full peptide structure as well as predicting binding affinity. The results were validated using a multi-step process comparing the results with FDA approved drugs and our initial prototype method. We have generated multiple peptides for three targets of interest (PD-1, PDL-1, and CTLA-4) and have found that the best generated peptide for each target was comparable to the FDA approved drugs in binding affinity and fitness of 3D binding as well as show the generated peptides were unique from the existing FDA drugs.},

  abstract = {The transient stability of the grid is challenged by short-term photovoltaic output fluctuations, which are mainly caused by local clouds. To address this issue, intra-hour solar forecasting has been widely adopted. Sky images have been proved as promising sources to produce intra-hour solar forecasts. To incorporate with cloud dynamics, sky images are typically embedded into solar forecasting models either indirectly or directly. While the performance of these methods varies across different forecasting environments, a detailed analysis on indirect and direct approaches have not been investigated yet. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive study on the performance of 7 commonly-used sky image-based solar forecasting approaches, including four indirect and three direct models. A total of 72 forecasting settings are established to evaluate the performance of these models. Three critical parameters are specially considered, namely image resolution, image sequence length, and forecast horizon. Results show that among these forecasting models, the stacking ensemble learning and the convolutional neural network + long short-term memory network model typically show the best forecasting performance for indirect and direct workflows, respectively. Compared with the direct approaches, the indirect approaches advance at detecting ramp events with an average the ramp score of 21.65 W/(m2{\texttimes}min). The direct approaches, on the other hand, outperform the indirect approaches on forecasting accuracy with an average forecast skill of 24.62\%. The results of this work can be used as a general guideline for intra-hour solar forecasting benchmark selection.},

By designing synthetic structures computationally, they can utilise more structures than those available in the Protein Data Bank, design structures that are not found in nature, or direct the design of proteins to acquire a specific desired structure. While some researchers attempt to design proteins from first physical and thermodynamic principals, we decided to attempt to test whether it is possible to perform               de novo               helical protein design of just the backbone statistically using machine learning by building a model that uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The LSTM model used only the {$\varphi$} and {$\psi$} angles of each residue from an augmented dataset of only helical protein structures. Though the network's generated backbone structures were not perfect, they were idealised and evaluated post generation where the non-ideal structures were filtered out and the adequate structures kept. The results were successful in developing a logical, rigid, compact, helical protein backbone topology. This paper is a proof of concept that shows it is possible to generate a novel helical backbone topology using an LSTM neural network architecture using only the {$\varphi$} and {$\psi$} angles as features. The next step is to attempt to use these backbone topologies and sequence design them to form complete protein structures.},

This paper proposes to learn-to-encode flexible and safe regions in distribution network operation in a unified data-driven way by the proposed fusing learning and optimization framework for distribution network decisionmaking. It formulates the identification of flexible and safe regions as binary classification tasks. Various learning models are constructed as region classifiers and trained for the above classification tasks from offline sampled flexible and safe region datasets. Specifically, the sparse neural network is leveraged for classifying based on its classification performance for region learning and fewer parameters for network optimization. The trained region classifiers are transformed into a series of mixedinteger linear constraints via the big-M relaxation method to formulate the data-driven region constraints, which are encoded in distribution networks for data-driven economic and safe operation. The case study verifies 1) the classification accuracy of region learning and 2) the economy and safety of distribution network operation with data-driven regions.},

We solve this two-stage approach by decomposition into a nonlinear bidding problem and a mixed-integer linear scheduling problem. We consider aluminum electrolysis participating in the German primary balancing market. We show savings in weekly production costs of 5--20\% compared to stationary operation. The savings due to the optimal bidding strategy are up to twice the savings from pure exploitation of electricity spot market price spreads. We thus demonstrate that energy-intense processes can systematically take advantage of highly profitable demand-side management measures beyond a spot market price adjusted production.},

The growing complexity of learning tasks requires more complex AI models, which increasingly exhibit unreliable behaviour. This is of particular concern in safety-critical systems where AI is commonly used. Therefore, well-known architectural approaches have been adopted such as N-Version Programming or Simplex Architectures (denoted as Architectural Safeguards) to deal with the unreliable nature of AI. At design-time, however, it is difficult to identify an architectural safeguard that satisfies the reliability (or other quality) requirements of the system. In this paper, we present a model-based reliability analysis of AI-enabled systems to assess architectural safeguards at design-time taking into account the predictive uncertainty of AI components. We have validated our approach in a case study from the field of autonomous driving. Our results show that our approach not only enables the analysis of the impact of architectural safeguards on the overall reliability of an AI system but supports software engineers in decision-making.},

Here we show how machine learning enables the de novo design of abiotic nuclear-targeting miniproteins to traffic antisense oligomers to the nucleus of cells. We combined high-throughput experimentation with a directed evolution-inspired deep-learning approach in which the molecular structures of natural and unnatural residues are represented as topological fingerprints. The model is able to predict activities beyond the training dataset, and simultaneously deciphers and visualizes sequence--activity predictions. The predicted miniproteins, termed `Mach', reach an average mass of 10\,kDa, are more effective than any previously known variant in cells and can also deliver proteins into the cytosol. The Mach miniproteins are non-toxic and efficiently deliver antisense cargo in mice. These results demonstrate that deep learning can decipher design principles to generate highly active biomolecules that are unlikely to be discovered by empirical approaches.},

The following paper has been written by experts of the Committee on Energy Meteorology of the German Meteorological Society summarizing their more than 30 years of experience and lessons learnt. It gives an overview of activities in energy meteorology that are already essential for the transformation of energy systems to systems with high shares of renewable energies. Building on this, the experts have created a vision of future topics that describe the future research landscape of energy meteorology. The authors explain that work in energy meteorology in recent years has primarily been concerned with the physically based modeling of wind and solar power generation and the development of short-term forecasting systems. In future years, a significant expansion of work in the areas of energy system modeling, digitalization, and climate change is expected. This includes the detailed consideration of regionally specified spatiotemporal variability for system design, the integration of artificial intelligence skills, the development of weather-related consumption based on smart meters, and the mapping of the effects of climate change on the energy system in planning and operating processes.},

In this direction, we propose a combined power, heat, and natural gas dispatch model to reveal the maximum potential ``network flexibility'', corresponding to the ability of natural gas and district heating pipelines to store energy. To account for both energy transport and linepack in the pipelines in a computational efficient manner, we explore convex quadratic relaxations of the nonconvex flow dynamics of gas and heat. The resulting model is a mixed-integer second-order cone program. An ex-post analysis ensures feasibility of the heat dispatch, while keeping the relaxation of the gas flow model sufficiently tight. The revealed flexibility is quantified in terms of system cost compared to a dispatch model neglecting the ability of natural gas and district heating networks to store energy.},

However, as the standard approach is to train the network to minimize a prediction loss, the resultant model remains ignorant to its prediction confidence. Orthogonally to Bayesian neural nets that indirectly infer prediction uncertainty through weight uncertainties, we propose explicit modeling of the same using the theory of subjective logic. By placing a Dirichlet distribution on the class probabilities, we treat predictions of a neural net as subjective opinions and learn the function that collects the evidence leading to these opinions by a deterministic neural net from data. The resultant predictor for a multi-class classification problem is another Dirichlet distribution whose parameters are set by the continuous output of a neural net. We provide a preliminary analysis on how the peculiarities of our new loss function drive improved uncertainty estimation. We observe that our method achieves unprecedented success on detection of out-of-distribution queries and endurance against adversarial perturbations.},

We also demonstrate that ESM-IF1, which was only trained on single-chain structures, can be extended to engineer protein complexes. Using this approach, we screened about 30 variants of two therapeutic clinical antibodies used to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We achieved up to 25-fold improvement in neutralization and 37-fold improvement in affinity against antibody-escaped viral variants of concern BQ.1.1 and XBB.1.5, respectively.

DCP is a structured way to define convex optimization problems, based on a family of basic convex and concave functions and a few rules for combining them. Problems expressed using DCP can be automatically converted to standard form and solved by a generic solver; widely used implementations include YALMIP, CVX, CVXPY, and Convex. jl. In this paper we propose a framework that combines the two ideas, and includes two improvements over previously published work on convex-concave programming, specifically the handling of domains of the functions, and the issue of subdifferentiability on the boundary of the domains.

  abstract = {The high similarities between protein sequences and natural language, particularly in their sequential data structures, have driven parallel advancements in deep learning models for both domains. In natural language processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as text generation, translation, and conversational agents, owing to their extensive training on diverse datasets that enable them to capture complex language patterns and generate human-like text. Inspired by these advancements, researchers have attempted to adapt LLMs for protein understanding by integrating a protein sequence encoder with a pre-trained LLM, following designs like LLaVa. However, this adaptation raises a fundamental question: ``Can LLMs, originally designed for NLP, effectively comprehend protein sequences as a form of language?'' Current datasets fall short in addressing this question due to the lack of a direct correlation between protein sequences and corresponding text descriptions, limiting the ability to train and evaluate LLMs for protein understanding effectively. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProteinLMDataset, a dataset specifically designed for further self-supervised pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs to enhance their capability for protein sequence comprehension. Specifically, ProteinLMDataset includes 17.46 billion tokens for pretraining and 893K instructions for SFT. Additionally, we present ProteinLMBench, the first benchmark dataset consisting of 944 manually verified multiple-choice questions for assessing the protein understanding capabilities of LLMs. ProteinLMBench incorporates protein-related details and sequences in multiple languages, establishing a new standard for evaluating LLMs' abilities in protein comprehension. The large language model InternLM2-7B, pretrained and fine-tuned on the ProteinLMDataset, outperforms GPT-4 on ProteinLMBench, achieving the highest accuracy score. The dataset and the benchmark are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsynbio/ProteinLMDataset/ and https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsynbio/ProteinLMBench.

Since the long-term RES prediction involves significant errors, we need online configure the frequency control parameters of RESs in a rolling manner to improve the operation economics under the premise of stabilizing system frequency. To address this concern, this paper proposes a frequency constrained stochastic look-ahead power dispatch (FCS-LAPD) model to formulate the frequency control parameters of RESs and energy storage systems (ESSs) as scheduling variables, which can optimally allocate the virtual inertia and droop coefficient of RESs and ESSs. In this FCS-LAPD model, the uncertainties of RESs are characterized using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The required reserves are determined by frequency control parameters, and the reserve cost coefficients are adjusted properly to allocate the reserves according to the predicted power generation. Due to the nonlinearity of the frequency nadir constraint, a convex hull approximation method is employed to linearize it with guaranteed feasibility. The proposed FCS-LAPD is ultimately cast as an instance of quadratic programming and can be efficiently solved. Case studies on modified IEEE 24-bus system and a provincial power system in China are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

In this paper, we study residential DR with consideration of the power distribution network and the associated constraints. We formulate residential DR as an optimal power flow problem and propose a distributed scheme where the load service entity and the households interactively communicate to compute an optimal demand schedule. To complement our theoretical results, we also simulate an IEEE test distribution system. The simulation results demonstrate two interesting effects of DR. One is the location effect, meaning that the households far away from the feeder tend to reduce more demands in DR. The other is the rebound effect, meaning that DR may create a new peak after the DR event ends if the DR parameters are not chosen carefully. The two effects suggest certain rules we should follow when designing a DR program.},

  abstract = {Successful integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) or deep learning (DL) has resulted in breakthroughs in many areas. However, deploying these highly accurate models for data-driven, learned, automatic, and practical machine learning (ML) solutions to end-user applications remains challenging. DL algorithms are often computationally expensive, power-hungry, and require large memory to process complex and iterative operations of millions of parameters. Hence, training and inference of DL models are typically performed on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters in the cloud. Data transmission to the cloud results in high latency, round-trip delay, security and privacy concerns, and the inability of real-time decisions. Thus, processing on edge devices can significantly reduce cloud transmission cost. Edge devices are end devices closest to the user, such as mobile phones, cyber--physical systems (CPSs), wearables, the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded and autonomous systems, and intelligent sensors. These devices have limited memory, computing resources, and power-handling capability. Therefore, optimization techniques at both the hardware and software levels have been developed to handle the DL deployment efficiently on the edge. Understanding the existing research, challenges, and opportunities is fundamental to leveraging the next generation of edge devices with artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Mainly, four research directions have been pursued for efficient DL inference on edge devices: 1) novel DL architecture and algorithm design; 2) optimization of existing DL methods; 3) development of algorithm--hardware codesign; and 4) efficient accelerator design for DL deployment. This article focuses on surveying each of the four research directions, providing a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art tools and techniques for efficient edge inference.},

  abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources characterized by a high degree of variability and uncertainty is a complex challenge for network operators that are obligated to ensure their connection while keeping the quality and security of supply. In order to deal with this variable behavior and forecast uncertainty, the distribution networks are equipped with flexible distributed energy resources capable of adjusting their operating point to avoid technical issues (voltage problems, congestion, etc.). Within this paradigm, the flexibility that, in fact, can be provided by such resources, needs to be estimated/forecasted up to the transmission network node (primary substation) and requires new tools for TSO/DSO coordination. This paper addresses this topic by developing a methodology capable of finding the flexibility area while taking into account the technical grid constraints. The proposed approach is based on the formulation of a single optimization problem which is run several times, according with the expected precision for the flexibility area estimation. To each optimization problem run, a different objective function belonging to a family of straight lines is assigned. This allows exploring the active and reactive power flow limits at the TSO/DSO boundary nodes -- which define the flexibility area. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated on two test networks and the results suggest a step forward in the TSO/DSO coordination field. Nevertheless, further investigations to study the effect of assets with discrete control nature (e.g., on load tap changers -- OLTC, capacitor banks) on the occurrence of disjoint flexibility areas should be carried.},

  abstract = {The penetration of distributed renewable energy sources in the distribution grid is increasing considerably in the last years. This is one of the main causes that contributed to the growth of technical problems in both transmission and distribution systems. An effective solution to improve system security is to exploit the flexibility that can be provided by distributed energy resources (DER), which are mostly located at the distribution grids. Their location combined with the lack of power flow coordination at the system operators interface creates difficulties in taking advantage of these flexible resources. This paper presents a methodology based on the solution of a set of optimization problems that estimate the flexibility ranges at the distribution and transmission system operators (TSO-DSO) boundary nodes. The estimation is performed while considering the grid technical constraints and a maximum cost that the user is willing to pay. The novelty behind this approach comes from the development of flexibility cost maps, which allow the visualization of the impact of DER flexibility on the operating point at the TSO-DSO interface.

  abstract = {The utilization of energy efficient combined cooling heat and power (CCHP) microgrid systems provide an opportunity for us to considering both the increase of economic benefits and environmental costs, simultaneously. The goal of this paper is to propose a P2G-CCHP microgrid system integration framework, connect power to gas (P2G) devices to CCHP microgrid, and provide a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model to solve the problem of economic dispatch. DRO model uses the Wasserstein metric to extract the ambiguity set of the probability distribution information of the wind power and photovoltaic output uncertainty. And environmental cost is also considered in the optimal operation of the system. In addition, based on the strong duality theory, the DRO model is transformed into an easy-to-solve MILP problem. The simulation results show that: 1) The introduction of a P2G device can effectively improve the electrical-gas coupling of the P2G-CCHP microgrid system, and improve the stability and economy of the system operation. 2) Considering environmental cost, the pollutant emission of the P2G-CCHP microgrid system is significantly reduced, which ensures the low-carbon operation of system. 3) The DRO model can resist the interference of uncertain wind power and PV output with relatively low conservatism and computational complexity and has the characteristics of data-driven.},

Firstly, the definition of NGS-SR is proposed, that is, the closed set of all secure operating points in the state space. NGS-SR is then modeled considering variety of operation constraints, such as the hydraulic balance constraint, the node gas pressure constraint, etc. Secondly, an observation-based method is proposed to solve the security boundary of NGS-SR. Thirdly, the approaches of security assessment and preventive control based on NGS-SR are illustrated. Finally, the NGS-SR of two typical systems are observed, analyzed and compared with the existing methods of security analysis. The results show the validity and precision of the proposed model and method, as well as the advantages of NGS-SR: 1) NGS-SR can describe the secure operating range of the system in a geometric and visualized way; 2) NGS-SR is beneficial to realize online security analysis, the analysis speed is increased up to 1944 times in the cases; 3) NGS-SR can provide the security margin information for system operation.},

  abstract = {As the proportion of wind power generation increases in power systems, it is necessary to develop new ways for wind power accommodation and improve the existing power dispatch model. The power-to-gas technology, which offers a new approach to accommodate surplus wind power, is an excellent way to solve the former. Hence, this paper proposes to involve power-to-gas technology in the integrated electricity and natural gas systems (IEGSs). To solve the latter, on one hand, a new indicator, the scale factor of wind power integration, is introduced into the wind power stochastic model to better describe the uncertainty of grid-connected wind power; on the other hand, for quantizing and minimizing the impact of the uncertainties of wind power and system loads on system security, security risk constraints are established for the IEGS by the conditional value-at-risk method. By considering these two aspects, an MILP formulation of a security-risk based stochastic dynamic economic dispatch model for an IEGS is established, and GUROBI obtained from GAMS is used for the solution. Case studies are conducted on an IEGS consisting of a modified IEEE 39-bus system and the Belgium 20-node natural gas system to examine the effectiveness of the proposed dispatch model.},

At the heart of the development is the concept of the grid-forming resource (GFR) which brings together both the technologies of renewable energy resource and grid-forming converter. Extending on an extensive review, a grid-forming converter control and protection scheme is presented to ensure operation under small- and large-signal transients as needed for overall system security. The scheme is shown to be practical in offering inertial response emulation and frequency control based on droop characteristics to maintain power balances rapidly, to control voltages, as well as to support transient stability enhancement under grid faults. The integration with the control of wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) creates a grid-forming wind park as the prototype of the GFR. Feedforward signals exchanged between grid and resource-side controls enhance fast overall controllability. The principal claims are substantiated based on a scenario developed in the European project initiative MIGRATE with a focus on the Irish power transmission system. The model comprises more than 2000 individual WECSs grouped into wind parks, where ten wind parks are GFRs. The transient behavior of this scenario comprising 100\% converter-interfaced generation is shown to be superior compared with a counterpart case comprising synchronous machinery. The results validate the fact that GFRs with their proposed controls are expected to be key elements in creating a renewable and secure electric power system.},

  abstract = {The declining cost of solar Photovoltaics (PV) generation is driving its worldwide deployment. As conventional generation with large rotating masses is being replaced by renewable energy such as PV, the power system's inertia will be affected. As a result, the system's frequency may vary more dramatically in the case of a disturbance, and the frequency nadir may be low enough to trigger protection relays such as under-frequency load shedding. The existing frequency-watt function mandated in power inverters cannot provide grid frequency support in a loss-of-generation event, as PV plants usually do not have power reserves. In this article, a novel adaptive PV frequency control strategy is proposed to reserve the minimum power required for grid frequency support. A machine learning model is trained to predict system frequency response under varying system conditions, and an adaptive allocation of PV headroom reserves is made based on the machine learning model as well as real-time system conditions including inertia. Case studies show the proposed control method meets the frequency nadir requirements using minimal power reserves compared to a fixed headroom control approach.},

PN signals, e.g., pressure and temperature, are modeled as low-pass time-varying graph signals, and an outlier-resistant graph-frequency domain (GFD) filter is proposed. This article extends the innovation saturation (IS) mechanism from the node domain to the GFD. A GFD IS function is developed with a more compact structure, which reduces outlier effects by restricting PN signals' smoothness. Since the PN signal is time-varying, the saturation function is embedded in the Kalman filter as an inequality constraint. The close-form solution to the filter is derived by replacing the nonlinear inequality constraints with high-pass graph Fourier transforms, and the cutoff frequency is found by analyzing the graph-frequency component of prior and posterior. A steel industrial PN is used to evaluate the proposal. Results indicate that the proposed filter exhibits superior performance in PN systems, particularly internal nodes.},

This paper proposes a hybrid physical and data driven modeling approach, which can take full advantage of physical laws and measurement data to characterize the transient behavior of gas flow in pipeline networks. Based on the linear graph theory, the gas flow dynamics and network topology are uniformly repre\- sented in the directed graph, so that the state-space model can be extracted automatically. Considering that the increasing number of model parameters with networks scale, a decentralized parameters identification algorithm is designed to enhance computational efficiency. The overall network is partitioned into a certain number of nonoverlapping subnetworks, and each one formulizes the parameter identification as a nonlinear optimization problem solved by an iterative Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a real-world gas network from a steel industrial park in China is studied, and simulation results are compared with the commercial simulation software Apros™. The results indicate that the proposed method improves the accuracy in gas network transient modeling markedly.},

In particular, objects represent the foreground, scenes represent the background, and motion traces their dynamics.

In the first stage, MOSO-VQVAE decomposes a previous video clip into the motion, scene and object components, and represents them as distinct groups of discrete tokens. Then, in the second stage, MOSOTransformer predicts the object and scene tokens of the subsequent video clip based on the previous tokens and adds dynamic motion at the token level to the generated object and scene tokens. Our framework can be easily extended to unconditional video generation and video frame interpolation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional video generation: BAIR, RoboNet, KTH, KITTI and UCF101. In addition, MOSO can produce realistic videos by combining objects and scenes from different videos.},

  abstract = {The multi-energy coupling characteristic of integrated energy system helps to promote energy efficiency improvement and facilitate renewable energy integration. However, the growing complexities from multi-energy coupling and the increasing uncertainties of renewable generations are both threatening the synergistic opera\- tion. It is imperative to fully exploit the flexibility of integrated energy system for operating reliability and economy. In view of the essential similarities from the slow dynamics of gas and thermal systems, a unified gas and thermal inertia model for integrated energy system is proposed in this paper for flexibility excavation and optimal allocation. First, gas and thermal inertia is uniformly defined considering inertial characteristics. Furthermore, a method for unified modelling of gas and thermal inertia is accurately illustrated based on the dynamic model of gas and thermal system. To prove the validity of the unified model, a multitype reserve procurement scheme considering gas and thermal inertia is proposed. A typical community-scale integrated energy system is employed as a test system. The simulation results demonstrate the potential ability of gas and thermal inertia to improve the operational flexibility, reliability and economy of integrated energy system.},

  abstract = {The continuous increase in pathogenic viruses and the intensive laboratory research emphasizes the need for cost- and time-efficient drug development. This accelerates research for alternate drug candidates like antiviral peptides (AVP) that have therapeutic and prophylactic potential and gaining attention in recent times. However, diversity in their sequences, limited and non-uniform characterization often limit their applications. Isolating newer peptide backbones with required characteristics is a cumbersome process with many design--test--build cycles. Advanced deep learning approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) can be helpful to expedite the initial stage of developing novel peptide drugs. In this study, we developed PandoraGAN that uses a manually curated training dataset of 130 highly active peptides that include peptides from known databases (such as AVPdb) and literature to generate novel antiviral peptides. The underlying architecture in PandoraGAN is able to learn a good representation of the implicit properties of antiviral peptides. The generated sequences from PandoraGAN are validated based on physico-chemical properties. They are also compared with the training dataset statistically using Pearson's correlation and Mann--Whitney U-test. We, therefore, confirm that PandoraGAN is capable of generating a novel antiviral peptide backbone showing similar properties to that of the known highly active antiviral peptides. This approach exhibits a potential to discover novel patterns of AVP which may have not been seen earlier with traditional methods. To our knowledge, this is the first ever use of GAN models for antiviral peptides across the viral spectrum.},

  abstract = {Power grids require more flexibility to adapt to the integration of variable renewable energy sources, which naturally produce inconsistent supply. Distributed energy resources installed at consumer sites can provide flexibility from the demand side. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of providing grid flexibility using combined heat and power (CHP) systems. A model that reproduces the operation of power sources was used to analyze the predicted lack of grid flexibility in the power system for the year 2030, and the model was used for the greater Tokyo area. We then scrutinized flexibility provision by the CHPs of four types of business facilities by tracking their operational changes in response to electricity time-of-use rates that reflect flexibility insufficiency. The nationwide potential of flexibility supply was calculated from the simulation result as well as nationwide CHP penetration data. The results show that the introduction of time-of-use rates as an economic incentive leads to a sizeable reduction in consumers' energy costs, and the provision of flexibility depends substantially on the facilities' heat-to-electricity ratios. We concluded that the aggregation of CHPs and sundry components, along with integrated working of various types of facilities, offers the most effective grid flexibility support.},

  abstract = {The uncertainty and variability of wind power pose significant challenges to secure and reliable operation of power systems. Coordinated operation of the electric power system and district heating system, which can provide sufficient reserve capacity and flexibility, is an effective way to cope with the uncertainty. This paper proposes an adaptive robust energy and reserve co-optimization for the integrated electricity and heat system to minimize the total system cost under the worst-case realization of wind uncertainty considering spatial correlations of wind uncertainties. The available reserve capacity and flexibility provided by the district heating system is fully used by exploiting the regulation capabilities of combined heat and power units and electrical boilers, as well as utilizing the building thermal inertia. To reduce the conservatism of the robust solution, the spatial correlation of wind uncertainties is considered in the uncertainty set. The column-and-constraint generation algorithm is adopted to solve the adaptive robust model iteratively by reformulating the second stage with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the economic efficiency is improved by utilizing the reserve flexibility from the district heating system and considering wind farm spatial correlations. Compared with the conventional single-stage optimized model, the feasibility of the two-stage robust solution is always guaranteed by considering the real-time operation constraints of the electric power system and district heating system.},

This paper proposes a chance-constrained two-stage energy and multi-type reserves scheduling scheme for integrated electricity and heating systems to handle both wind power forecast errors and the outage of the largest generator. The combined heat and power units and heat pumps not only provide following reserves for offsetting wind power forecast errors under normal conditions, but also provide primary frequency response reserves for arresting system frequency decline after the outage of the largest generator. The primary frequency response reserves from combined heat and power units and heat pumps are optimized satisfying system steady-state frequency requirement while considering the reserve costs. To manage the risk level of load shedding caused by wind power forecast errors, chance constraints are adopted to achieve the trade-off between the sufficiency of following reserves and system economic efficiency. The nonlinear and nonconvex scheduling model is reformulated as a mixed-integer linear program via linearization and convex approximation based on conditional value-at-risk. The effectiveness of the proposed scheduling scheme in improving the system frequency regulation, system economic efficiency, and wind power integration is verified through the case studies on a 6-bus and 6-node integrated electricity and heating system and a regional large-scale test system.},

However, intra-regional operation constraints are currently not well considered in practical implementation, which may lead to internal congestions and economic loss. In this paper, a non-iterative tie-line scheduling framework taking account of both intra- and inter-regional network constraints is proposed. Based on projection theory, admissible set of tie-line injections (ASTI) is defined as the allowable range of tie-line power injections that can be met by a regional system. Then, the ASTI is implemented in tie-line scheduling to ensure the feasibility of the tie-line schedule result for each region. Requirements for practical algorithms that calculate the ASTI in power system applications are analyzed, and a novel vertex-oriented projection algorithm is proposed to efficiently calculate the ASTI. Case studies based on several IEEE and Polish test systems verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed projection algorithm. Simulations based on a four-region system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tie-line scheduling framework.},

  abstract = {The technical virtual power plant (TVPP) is a promising paradigm to facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) while incorporating operational constraints of both DERs and networks. Due to the volatility and limited predictability of DER generation and electric loads, the output capability of the TVPP is uncertain. In this regard, this paper proposes the robust capability curve (RCC) of the TVPP, which explicitly characterizes the allowable range of the scheduled power output that is executable for the TVPP under uncertainties. Implementing the RCC can secure the scheduling of the TVPP against unexpected fluctuations of operating conditions when the TVPP participates in the transmission-level dispatch. Mathematically, the RCC is the first-stage feasible set of an adjustable robust optimization problem. An uncertainty set model incorporating the variable correlation and uncertainty budget is employed, which makes the robustness and conservatism of the RCC adjustable. A novel methodology is proposed to estimate the RCC by the convex hull of several points on its perimeter. These perimeter points are obtained by solving a series of multi scenario-optimal power flow problems with worst-case uncertainty realizations identified based on a linearized network configuration. Case studies based on the IEEE-13 test feeder validate the effectiveness of the RCC to ensure the scheduling feasibility while hedging against uncertainties. The computational efficiency of the proposed RCC estimation method is also verified based on larger-scale test systems.},

This paper proposes a novel concept of integrated flexibility, which is defined as the multi-energy responsive ability of a smart energy hub (SEH) to serve its terminal loads with an alterable combination of multiple energy inputs. The feasible region of the multi-energy flexibility provision, namely the integrated flexible region (IFR), is modeled and calculated based on the standardized energy hub matrix modeling and the polytopic projection. The integrated flexibility is then implemented in the utility-side system scheduling following a bottom-up framework, in which SEHs estimate and submit their IFRs, whereafter the utility system operator optimally schedules the system incorporating IFR constraints. This flexibility providing scheme allows the demandside flexible resources to interact with multiple energy sectors simultaneously while retaining the operation independence of local systems. Case studies illustrate the geometry of the IFR and verify the economic and environmental benefits of implementing the integrated flexibility.},

  abstract = {Spatiotemporal predictive learning methods generally fall into two categories: recurrent-based approaches, which face challenges in parallelization and performance, and recurrent-free methods, which employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as encoder-decoder architectures. These methods benefit from strong inductive biases but often at the expense of scalability and generalization. This paper proposes PredFormer, a pure transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. Motivated by the Vision Transformers (ViT) design, PredFormer leverages carefully designed Gated Transformer blocks, following a comprehensive analysis of 3D attention mechanisms, including full-, factorized-, and interleaved- spatial-temporal attention. With its recurrent-free, transformerbased design, PredFormer is both simple and efficient, significantly outperforming previous methods by large margins. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PredFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. On Moving MNIST, PredFormer achieves a 51.3\% reduction in MSE relative to SimVP. For TaxiBJ, the model decreases MSE by 33.1\% and boosts FPS from 533 to 2364. Additionally, on WeatherBench, it reduces MSE by 11.1\% while enhancing FPS from 196 to 404. These performance gains in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrate PredFormer's potential for real-world applications.

  abstract = {A TSO-DSO interactive mechanism is proposed to realize coordinated voltage support of transmission network by reactive power provision, activating flexibility of active distribution networks, such as distributed generations, flexible loads, reactive power compensators, etc. The mechanism consists of four stages: i) TSO sends reactive power request to DSOs; ii) Each DSO forms its reactive power quantity-price curve and sends to TSO; iii) TSO does a global optimization to achieve a voltage support scheme, incorporating its own reactive power provision devices and reactive power quantity-price curves; iv) Each DSO re-optimizes in its local area to reach the voltage support requirement. Based on this mechanism, the specific implementation approaches of the four stages are discussed, and a four-stage distributed algorithm is proposed. The case analysis demonstrates that the proposed mechanism and algorithm can effectively and accurately realize voltage support. Also, the TSO is able to achieve a more cost-effective scheme compared with independent voltage support while the active elements managed by DSOs achieve profits from participating in the coordinated voltage support. Specifically, in the test case presented in this paper, the coordinated scheme can save more than 50\% costs and 25\% reactive power requirements compared with the traditional one.},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous problems of microplastics in waters are receiving global attention as microplastics can harm aquatic organisms, and finally can accumulate in the human body through biological chain amplification. In addition, microplastics act as a carrier capable of carrying heavy metals, organics, which form complex pollutants. These new combinations of pollutants, once ingested by aquatic organisms, are amplified through the food chain and can have unpredictable ramifications for aquatic organisms and human beings. Therefore, human beings are not only the source of plastic pollution, but also the sink of microplastic pollution. Therefore, this study reviews the source and distribution of microplastics, and their combined ability with heavy metals, antibiotics, and persistent organic pollutants in aquatic environments. Furthermore, it describes the interaction between aquatic organisms and microplastics. Finally, some suggestions are put forward to promote the sustainable application of microplastics. This work provides theoretical guidance for combining microplastics with other pollutants in water, and the accumulation of microplastics in food chain.},

  abstract = {The coordinated multi-area economic dispatch enables optimal resource utilization in a larger spatial range. To overcome drawbacks such as heavy communication burden, convergence failure, and weak scalability of iterative coordination methods, this paper proposes a fully non-iterative multi-area coordination framework. The proposed framework is based on a novel system reduction technique termed as the condensed system representation (CSR). The CSR makes external equivalence of the dispatch problem of each area by exploiting power system operating characteristics, i.e., only a small number of generators may become marginal units and only a minority of security constraints may be active. An algorithm based on the optimality condition analysis is developed to identify the CSR by fixing non-marginal units to their output bounds, eliminating redundant security constraints, and making Norton equivalence of the internal network. With CSRs submitted by local areas, the multi-area system can be optimized without iterative information exchange. Case studies based on a 3-area 9-bus system verify the effectiveness of the CSR-based coordination framework. Larger-scale test systems are constructed to validate the computational efficiency, robustness, and scalability of the proposed method.},

The EP eliminates internal variables from technical and economic operation constraints of the subsystem and obtains an equivalent model with reduced scale, which is the key to the non-iterative coordinated optimization. In Part II of this paper, a novel projection algorithm with the explicit error guarantee measured by the Hausdorff distance is proposed, which characterizes the EP model by the convex hull of its vertices. This algorithm is proven to yield a conservative approximation within the prespecified error tolerance and can obtain the exact EP model if the error tolerance is set to zero, which provides flexibility to balance the computation accuracy and effort. Applications of the EP-based coordinated dispatch are demonstrated based on the multi-area coordination and transmission-distribution coordination. Case studies with a wide range of system scales verify the superiority of the proposed projection algorithm in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, and validate the effectiveness of the EP-based coordinated dispatch in comparison with the joint optimization.},

Conventional coordinated optimization methods, such as the Lagrangian relaxation and Benders decomposition, require iterative information exchange among subsystems. Iterative coordination methods have drawbacks including slow convergence, risk of oscillation and divergence, and incapability of multi-level optimization problems. To this end, this paper aims at the non-iterative coordinated optimization method for hierarchical power systems. The theory of the equivalent projection (EP) is proposed, which makes external equivalence of the optimal dispatch model of the subsystem. Based on the EP theory, a coordinated optimization framework is developed, where each subsystem submits the EP model as a substitute for its original model to participate in the cross-system coordination. The proposed coordination framework is proven to guarantee the same optimality as the joint optimization, with additional benefits of avoiding iterative information exchange, protecting privacy, compatibility with practical dispatch scheme, and capability of multi-level problems.},

Violations of this constraint seriously impact system reliability and thus carry with them a very high cost.

System operators are considering modifications to the conventional real-time economic dispatch model to provide improved ramp flexibility. In this paper an operational flexibility metric called lack of ramp probability (LORP) is proposed for the real-time economic dispatch. Further, a two-step robust optimization based framework is introduced to simultaneously guarantee LORP flexibility metric and ensure ramp deliverability in a multi-zonal setting. The proposed framework is illustrated on a 3-zone modified IEEE 73 bus (RTS-96) test system.},

NNSE consists of two parts, the linear state estimation neural network (LSE-net) and the unobservable state estimation neural network (USE-net). The LSE-net functions as an adaptive approximator of linear state estimation (LSE) equations to estimate the nominally observable states. The inputs of LSE-net are the vectors of synchrophasors while the outputs are the estimated states. The USE-net operates as the complementary estimator on the nominally unobservable states. The inputs are the estimated observable states from LSE-net while the outputs are the estimation of nominally unobservable states. USE-net is trained off-line to approximate the veiled relationship between observable states and unobservable states. Two test cases are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed approach. The first case, which is based on the IEEE 118-bus system, shows the comprehensive performance of convergence, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed approach. The second case study adopts realworld synchrophasor measurements, and is based on the Jiangsu power grid, which is one of the largest provincial power systems in China.},

When aggregating similar units in this manner, it is advantageous if the aggregation maintains a certain degree of genericity, since the higher-level algorithms can then be designed with a higher degree of modularity. To achieve this goal, however, it is not only necessary to examine aggregation of models of the underlying units, but also the accompanying constraints. Constraint sets for rate- and storage volume-constrained units can often be represented as polytopes in high-dimensional Euclidean space; unfortunately, adding such polytopic sets in higher dimension than 2 has so far been considered a combinatorial problem. In this paper, we present a novel method for computing such polytopic constraint sets for integrating units, which achieves a much lower computational complexity than previous results. The concept is demonstrated via simulations of a smart grid control scenario.},

The objective is to accommodate load variations on the grid, arising from varying consumption and natural variations in the power production e.g. from wind turbines. This balancing between supply and demand is performed by distributing power to consumers in an optimal manner, subject to the requirement that each consumer receives the specific amount of energy the consumer is entitled to within a specific time horizon. However, in order to do so, the high-level controller requires knowledge of how much energy the consumers can receive within a given time horizon. In this paper, we present a method for computing these bounds as convex constraints that can be used directly in the optimisation. The method is illustrated on a simulation example that uses actual wind data as load variation, and fairly realistic consumer models. The example illustrates that the exact bounds computed by the proposed method leads to a better power distribution than a conventional, conservative approach in case of fast changes in the load.},

We propose a machine learning--based approach that uses convolutional neural networks to create dynamically consistent counterfactual versions of historical extreme events under different levels of global mean temperature (GMT). We apply this technique to one recent extreme heat event (southcentral North America 2023) and several historical events that have been previously analyzed using established attribution methods. We estimate that temperatures during the southcentral North America event were 1.18{$^\circ$} to 1.42{$^\circ$}C warmer because of global warming and that similar events will occur 0.14 to 0.60 times per year at 2.0{$^\circ$}C above preindustrial levels of GMT. Additionally, we find that the learned relationships between daily temperature and GMT are influenced by the seasonality of the forced temperature response and the daily meteorological conditions. Our results broadly agree with other attribution techniques, suggesting that machine learning can be used to perform rapid, low-cost attribution of extreme events.           ,              Machine learning is used to quantify the influence of human activity on the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events.},

Necessary metrics for defining power system operational flexibility, namely the power ramp-rate, power and energy capability of generators, loads and storage devices, are presented.

The user can quickly and easily design a thermohydraulic system by placing symbols on the screen resembling system components. These components can then be connected to form a system representation. Such system models may then be used to obtain detailed simulations of the physical system. Usually this kind of simulation models are too complex and not ideal for control system design. Therefore, a need exists for automated techniques to extract lumped parameter models useful for control system design. The goal of this first paper, in a two part series, is to propose a method that utilises a graphical representation of a thermohydraulic system, and a lumped parameter modelling approach, to extract state space models. In this methodology each physical domain of the thermohydraulic system is represented by a linear graph. These linear graphs capture the interaction between all components within and across energy domains e hydraulic, thermal and mechanical. These linear graphs are analysed using a graph-theoretic approach to derive reduced order state space models. These models capture the dominant dynamics of the thermohydraulic system and are ideal for control system design purposes. The proposed state space model extraction method is demonstrated by considering a U-tube system. A non-linear state space model is extracted representing both the hydraulic and thermal domain dynamics of the system.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of ``posterior collapse'' ---- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder ---- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) show promise in treating resistant infections. However, applications of known AMPs have encountered issues in development, production, and shelf-life. To drive the development of AMP-based treatments, it is necessary to create design approaches with higher precision and selectivity toward resistant targets. Previously, we developed AMPGAN and obtained proof-of-concept evidence for the generative approach to design AMPs with experimental validation. Building on the success of AMPGAN, we present AMPGAN v2, a bidirectional conditional generative adversarial network (BiCGAN)-based approach for rational AMP design. AMPGAN v2 uses generator-discriminator dynamics to learn data-driven priors and controls generation using conditioning variables. The bidirectional component, implemented using a learned encoder to map data samples into the latent space of the generator, aids iterative manipulation of candidate peptides. These elements allow AMPGAN v2 to generate candidates that are novel, diverse, and tailored for specific applications, making it an efficient AMP design tool.},

There are no known peptide binders for many plastics---a gap that can be filled with de novo design. Current computational methods for peptide design exhibit limitations in sampling and scaling that could be addressed with quantum computing. Hybrid quantum-classical methods can leverage complementary strengths of near-term quantum algorithms and classical techniques for complex tasks like peptide design. This work introduces a hybrid quantum-classical generative framework for designing plastic-binding peptides combining variational quantum circuits with a variational autoencoder network. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating peptide candidates, evaluate its efficiency for property-oriented design, and validate the candidates with molecular dynamics simulations.

However it is unknown whether language models, trained on sequences of natural proteins, will be capable of more than memorization of existing protein families. Here we show that language models generalize beyond natural proteins to generate             de novo             proteins. We focus on two protein design tasks: fixed backbone design where the structure is specified, and unconstrained generation where the structure is sampled from the model. Remarkably although the models are trained only on sequences, we find that they are capable of designing structure. A total of 228 generated proteins are evaluated experimentally with high overall success rates (152/228 or 67\%) in producing a soluble and monomeric species by size exclusion chromatography. Out of 152 experimentally successful designs, 35 have no significant sequence match to known natural proteins. Of the remaining 117, sequence identity to the nearest sequence match is at median 27\%, below 20\% for 6 designs, and as low as 18\% for 3 designs. For fixed backbone design, the language model generates successful designs for each of eight experimentally evaluated artificially created fixed backbone targets. For unconstrained generation, sampled proteins cover diverse topologies and secondary structure compositions, and have high experimental success rate (71/129 or 55\%). The designs reflect deep patterns linking sequence and structure, including motifs that occur in related natural structures, and motifs that are not observed in similar structural contexts in known protein families. The results show that language models, though only trained on sequences, learn a deep grammar that enables the design of protein structure, extending beyond natural proteins.},

Compared to pixels, this compressed latent space has dramatically reduced dimensionality, allowing us to apply scalable autoregressive generative models to predict video. In contrast to previous work that has largely emphasized highly constrained datasets, we focus on very diverse, large-scale datasets such as Kinetics-600. We predict video at a higher resolution on unconstrained videos, 256x256, than any other previous method to our knowledge.

For machines to discover novel molecules, they must first be trained to sort through the many characteristics of molecules and determine which properties should be retained, suppressed, or enhanced to optimize functions of interest. Machines need to be able to understand, read, write, and eventually create new molecules. Today, this creative process relies on deep generative models, which have gained popularity since powerful deep neural networks were introduced to generative model frameworks. In recent years, they have demonstrated excellent ability to model complex distribution of real-word data (               e.g.               , images, audio, text, molecules, and biological sequences). Deep generative models can generate data beyond those provided in training samples, thus yielding an efficient and rapid tool for exploring the massive search space of high-dimensional data such as DNA/protein sequences and facilitating the design of biomolecules with desired functions. Here, we review the emerging field of deep generative models applied to peptide science. In particular, we discuss several popular deep generative model frameworks as well as their applications to generate peptides with various kinds of properties (               e.g.               , antimicrobial, anticancer, cell penetration,               etc               ).

Following the historical rates of renewable installation1, a recent high-resolution energy-system model6 and forecasts based on China's 14th Five-year Energy Development (CFED)7, however, only indicate that the capacity will reach 5--9.5\,PWh\,year-1 by 2060. Here we show that, by individually optimizing the deployment of 3,844 new utility-scale PV and wind power plants coordinated with ultra-high-voltage (UHV) transmission and energy storage and accounting for power-load flexibility and learning dynamics, the capacity of PV and wind power can be increased from 9\,PWh\,year-1 (corresponding to the CFED path) to 15\,PWh\,year-1, accompanied by a reduction in the average abatement cost from US\$97 to US\$6 per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2). To achieve this, annualized investment in PV and wind power should ramp up from US\$77\,billion in 2020 (current level) to US\$127\,billion in the 2020s and further to US\$426\,billion\,year-1 in the 2050s. The large-scale deployment of PV and wind power increases income for residents in the poorest regions as co-benefits. Our results highlight the importance of upgrading power systems by building energy storage, expanding transmission capacity and adjusting power load at the demand side to reduce the economic cost of deploying PV and wind power to achieve carbon neutrality in China.},

In this paper, we formulate the flexibility evaluation problem as a chance constrained optimization model incorporated the randomness of renewables. To make it tractable, the evaluated flexibility is represented by the combination of a virtual generator and a virtual battery which is decomposed by a robust optimization algorithm. Then, a novel high-dimensional polytope based bound shrinking method is proposed to estimate the parameters of the virtual generator and virtual battery. The numerical test results show the proposed method obtain much more precise results with lower conservativeness than those of existing methods.

Thus the receiving end of the power system faces the problem of insufficient adjustable resource capacity. It requires the full utilization of a large number of flexible energy resources to participate in power system dispatch and provide auxiliary services. However, the vast number, wide distribution, and diverse characteristics of these flexible energy resources pose significant challenges to centralized dispatch and control. It is necessary to manage and dispatch these flexible energy resources in a clustered way. To accurately assess the role of clusters in the power system dispatch and control, it is essential to aggregate these flexible energy resources and evaluate their performance by using appropriate quantitative metrics based on application requirements. According to the application demands of flexible resource clusters in power system dispatch and electricity market, a quantitative metric system of flexibility for evaluating the adjustable capacity of flexible energy resource clusters is proposed. Based on their physical characteristics, these resources are categorized into three types: generator-like characteristics, storage-like characteristics, and common characteristics. For quantitative evaluation of the cluster flexibility metrics across various application scenarios, an aggregation reference model comprising an equivalent generator and an equivalent energy storage is proposed. This aggregation reference model has a clear physical interpretation, exhibits nested properties, and therefore is suitable for various time scales and energy forms. It can be used to calculate the quantitative metrics for specific application scenarios and widely applied in scenarios such as asynchronous dispatch of distributed energy resource clusters, joint optimization dispatch of integrated energy systems, and participation of virtual power plant in electricity market bidding.},

In this paper, the coordinated operation problem of VPPs and the distribution system operator (DSO) is formulated as minimizing the total operational cost constrained by linearized three-phase power flow equations and operational constraints. To preserve the VPPs' privacy, the DSO needs to coordinate the VPPs in a distributed manner. However, conventional synchronous distributed methods may suffer from communication delays or failures because of the flimsy communication conditions between DSO and VPPs. We propose an asynchronous distributed algorithm that is robust against communication uncertainties. Firstly, a hybrid alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is developed, which can be applied to convex problems with promising convergence performance. In the hybrid ADMM framework, the delayed or missing data that transmitted from VPPs are compensated by a novel predicting algorithm combining the multi-parameter quadratic programming (MPQP) and autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). We prove that the proposed algorithm can converge under imperfect communication condition with some mild assumptions. Numerical tests on IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 123-bus systems indicate that the proposed method has more reliable and faster convergence performance than existing asynchronous methods in all cases.},

To accelerate the developed algorithm's convergence further, methods including adaptive updating of penalty parameter, warm start and over-relaxation are introduced.

  abstract = {Dynamic economic dispatch in microgrids is usually realized in a centralized energy management system (EMS). However, centralized systems are subject to single-point failure problems. In rural areas and islands, a failed EMS cannot be recovered in a timely manner due to lack of technical support. In this paper, we propose a cloud and edge computing-based framework to realize dynamic economic dispatch, which is conducted on a local Digital Signal Processor (DSP) chip and a remote cloud computing platform (CCP). Based on the multi-parametric programming algorithm, the dispatch process is divided into two parts: offline calculation and real-time decision making. These calculation tasks can be conducted on the remote cloud computing platform and the DSP chip of the inverter in an arbitrary renewable generator, respectively. The tests are carried out on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 instance and an autonomous microgrid with DSP TMS320F28335 chip. The results show that the proposed method can obtain the same results as the conventional method, with significantly improved reliability.},

Nevertheless, incorporating a mixed integer set often renders an optimization formulation drastically more challenging to compute. In this paper, we study how to effectively solve two-stage robust mixed integer programs built upon decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). We particularly consider those with a mixed integer DDU set that has a novel modeling power on describing complex dependence between decisions and uncertainty, and those with a mixed integer recourse problem that captures discrete recourse decisions. Note that there has been very limited research on computational algorithms for these challenging problems. To this end, several exact and approximation solution algorithms are presented, which address some critical limitations of existing counterparts (e.g., the relatively complete recourse assumption) and greatly expand our solution capacity. In addition to theoretical analyses on those algorithms' convergence and computational complexities, a set of numerical studies are performed to showcase mixed integer structures' modeling capabilities and to demonstrate those algorithms' computational strength.},

This paper focuses on mixed-integer second-order cone programming-based optimal scheduling for the electric grids with gas flow dynamics in consideration of AC power flow, unit commitment, and line switching. For the gas grids, differential continuity equations and differential momentum equations, representing gas flow dynamics, are discretized to a group of algebraic equations with the implicit trapezoidal rules. In the algebraic equations, nonconvex bilinear terms with integer variables, representing gas flow directions, are transformed into linear inequality constraints with McCormick envelopes, and quadratic terms are relaxed by the second-order cone (SOC) approach. For the electric grids, SOC relaxation-based AC power flow models are employed, and the line switching problem is modeled by the improved SOC relaxation approach with McCormick envelopes. The entire problem is established as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, and the impacts of gas flow dynamics on the feasible region compared to the steady-state region are discussed.},

To identify the topology or estimate the parameters, a lot of existing literature relies on the knowledge of feasible topologies or full-scale deployment of advanced measuring devices, such as phase measurement units (PMUs), which is unrealistic in practice. Therefore, we propose a data-driven topology and parameter joint estimation method for non-PMU distribution networks, only using historical measurement data from smart meters. First, the topology label matrix, as a unique label of the network topology and corresponding parameters, is created and calculated based on historical data. The numeric characteristics of the topology label matrix is further analyzed to extract the topology and parameter information. Subsequently, a clustering based topology identification and parameter estimation methodology is proposed as a data-driven linear regression model. To reduce the coupling during regression, a power supply path matrix is utilized to improve the accuracy. Moreover, to improve the credibility of the method, an error-correction mechanism is proposed to indicate whether the inaccurate identification exists and how to correct it. Finally, the proposed method is tested in IEEE 33-node, 123-node networks and a large-scale system. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide an accurate estimation of the topology and line parameters based on samples of measurement with noise and is also effective in a large-scale system.},

The need for new antibiotics is high, while the arsenal of available agents is decreasing, especially for the treatment of infections by Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are offering a promising route for novel antibiotic development and deep learning techniques can be utilised for successful AMP design. In this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) generative model and a bidirectional LSTM classification model were constructed to design short novel AMP sequences with potential antibacterial activity against E. coli. Two versions of the generative model and six versions of the classification model were trained and optimised using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation. These models were used to generate sets of short novel sequences that were classified as antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial. The validation accuracies of the classification models were 81.6--88.9\% and the novel AMPs were classified as antimicrobial with accuracies of 70.6--91.7\%. Predicted three-dimensional conformations of selected short AMPs exhibited the alpha-helical structure with amphipathic surfaces. This demonstrates that LSTMs are effective tools for generating novel AMPs against targeted bacteria and could be utilised in the search for new antibiotics leads.},

  abstract = {The increasing deployment of energy storages in power grid necessitates the consideration of their operational costs and constraints. However, energy storages introduce complementary constraints or binary variables, make the optimization problems non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this issue, we propose a generalized relaxation condition (GRC), which possesses a priori property. As long as the GRC is met, it is guaranteed that there is no simultaneous charging and discharging (SCD) in the relaxed optimization problems excluding the complementarity constraints. Moreover, we prove that the exact relaxation region on the locational marginal prices (LMPs) formed by the proposed GRC contains those of the other existing relaxation conditions. The proposed GRC can be satisfied for the majority of electricity price scenarios, including positive prices and mild negative prices. Beyond that, through introducing penalties for charging and discharging losses of storage into the objective function, the proposed GRC can be further ensured in all price scenarios. We also develop a criterion to set the penalty parameter properly, making the GRC satisfied. Afterward, a practical relaxation method is presented based on the proposed GRC. Finally, we propose a practical two-stage penalty parameter adjustment scheme to weaken the dependence of the proposed relaxation method on the prediction accuracy of the LMPs. The proposed exact relaxation condition is applicable to various scenarios, such as storage-participating economic dispatch, joint energy-reserve optimization and Volt/VAR optimization. Finally, comprehensive test cases verify the exactness and advantages of the proposed relaxation method.},

  abstract = {As the proportion of renewable energy generation, characterized by high randomness and volatility, gradually increases, the power system requires more flexible resources to maintain supply-demand balance, and ensure secure and stable operation. The flexibility of the power system comes from three main aspects: distributed energy resources in the distribution network, multi-energy flexibility of gas and heat network, and support from neighboring regional power grids. Diverse energy systems comprise numerous controllable objects, leading to the curse of dimensionality in optimal dispatch and control. This thesis proposes flexible aggregation reference models and calculation methods for diverse energy systems, constructing equivalent models for flexibility aggregation in distributed generation and flexible loads, gas networks, heat networks, and regional power grid systems. Additionally, this thesis introduces an algorithm to calculate the parameters of these equivalent models, enabling coordinated system dispatch. This thesis starts by explaining the aggregation of energy system flexibility from both physical and mathematical perspectives, presenting an efficient solution for the flexibility aggregation reference model: the high-dimensional polyhedron projection inner-approximation method. This method integrates the physical significance of flexibility resource aggregation problems and employs three inner-shape template inner-approximation strategies, depending on the presence of explicit physical expressions. This results in more accurate models of energy system flexibility aggregation and effectively guarantees the feasibility of disaggregated dispatch commands. To solve the curse of dimensionality in coordinating and dispatching numerous distributed energy resources within the distribution network, this thesis proposes a method for aggregating their flexibility. Considering operational constraints, random factors, and network constraints, the thesis classifies and aggregates distributed energy resources into a flexibility aggregation model consisting of an equivalent generator and an equivalent energy storage device. This aggregated model can be applied in calculating steady-state flexibility quantification metrics for the entire distribution system and asynchronous coordination between transmission and distribution networks. To address the joint dispatch problem arising from the differing physical equations of integrated energy systems, this thesis proposes an equivalent energy storage flexibility evaluation method for gas and heat networks. Network parameters are identified from operational data, and the gas and heat networks are modeled as multi-port energy storage devices, considering dynamic processes of gas and heat flow described by partial differential equations and network constraints. The equivalent storage parameters are calculated using the high-dimensional polyhedron projection method, enabling quantitative assessment of the equivalent energy storage capacity. This approach decouples computational complexity from the size of the gas and heat networks, simplifying the multi-energy system coordination problem and enabling more efficient optimization. To address the inefficiency caused by the division of dispatch authority in multi-regional interconnected power grids, a flexible aggregation equivalent model of regional power grids composed of several equivalent generators is constructed. A method combining projection space dimension decomposition, inscribed projection approximation, and reorganization is proposed to calculate the parameters of the regional power grid flexibility aggregation model. With the equivalent aggregation model of regional power grids, efficient resolution of tie-line dispatch optimization problems among multi-area interconnected power grids is enabled, facilitating their coordination.},

Lockout controls are designed to avoid wear and tear resulting from short-cycling of hardware. The lock on/off time could significantly affect aggregate flexibility from TCLs to provide ancillary services and may even fail control algorithms designed without considering the lock time constraints. This paper focuses on flexibility estimation and control design for TCLs with lock time constraints to provide frequency regulation service. We first investigate the potential impacts of lock time on TCLs' aggregate flexibility and control performance. Both control-dependent and control-independent power bounds are then derived, based on previous TCL switching operations and regulation signals, respectively. While the control-dependent method provides aggregate flexibility for a given control method, the control-independent method calculates the theoretical maximum of power bounds. Finally, two control algorithms are proposed to better distribute flexibility over time and thereby improve signal tracking performance. The proposed methods are illustrated and validated through simulations.},

  abstract = {As an aggregator of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as distributed generator, energy storage, and load, the virtual power plant (VPP) enables these small DERs participating in system operation. One of the critical issues is how to aggregate DERs to form VPPs appropriately. To improve the controllability and reduce the operation cost of VPP, the complementary DERs with close electrical distances should be aggregated in the same VPP. In this paper, it is formulated as an optimal network partition model for minimizing the voltage deviation inside VPPs and the fluctuation of injection power at the point of common coupling (PCC). A new convex formulation of network reconfiguration strategy is incorporated in this approach which can guarantee the components of the same VPP connected and further improve the performance of VPPs. The proposed approach is cast as an instance of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and can be effectively solved. Moreover, a scenario reduction method is developed to reduce the computation burden based on the k-shape algorithm. Numerical tests on the 13-bus and 70-bus distribution networks justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Due to the volatile nature of wind and photovoltaic power, wind farms and solar stations are generally thought of as the consumers of ramping services. However, a microgrid (MG) is able to strategically integrate various distributed energy resources (DERs) to provide both energy and ancillary services (ASs) for the bulk power system. To evaluate the ramping capabilities of an MG in the joint energy and AS markets, an optimal bidding strategy is developed in this paper considering flexible ramping products (FRPs). By aggregating and coordinating various DERs, including wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaic systems (PVs), micro-turbines (MTs) and energy storage systems (ESSs), the MG is able to optimally allocate the capacities for energy, spinning reserve and ramping. Taking advantage of the synergy among DERs, the MG can maximize its revenues from different markets. Moreover, the flexibility of the MG for the bulk power system can be fully explored. To address the uncertainties introduced by renewable generation and market prices, a hybrid stochastic/robust optimization (RO) approach is adopted. Case studies based on a real-world MG with various DERs demonstrate the market behavior of the MG using the proposed bidding model.},

Traditionally, physics-based models are used including Weighted Least Square (WLS) or Weighted Least Absolute Value (WLAV). These models typically consider a single snapshot of the system without capturing temporal correlations of system states. In this paper, a Physics-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL) method is proposed. Specifically, inspired by autoencoders, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to learn the temporal correlations. The estimated system states from DNNs are then checked against physics law by running through a set of power flow equations. Hence, the proposed PGDL is both data-driven and physicsbased. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed PGDL method are compared with traditional methods in standard IEEE cases. Simulations show promising results and the applicability is further discussed.},

But traditional algorithms cannot combine high accuracy with fast calculation speed. In this paper, we revisit the probabilistic power flow problem, aiming to boost the computational accuracy leveraging the breakthroughs of deep learning. We propose a quasi Monte-Carlo method based on graph convolutional network (GCN) to calculate distribution characteristics of system power flow, where the key novelty is viewing the power system from a graph perspective. More specifically, the graph structure and features of power system are adopted as input of graph convolutional network. Through construction of the weight adjacency matrix with an impedance matrix, the relationship among nodes is redefined. We apply the convolutional layers on the mixed graph to compute probabilistic power flow. Using IEEE Case 69 data for experiments, our model outperforms existing model-based and data-driven methods.},

A system economic dispatch (ED) model is established for the operators to make full use of the DER clusters. We calculate the feasible regions with temporal coupling by extending the Progressive Vertex Enumeration (PVE) algorithm to high dimension by the Quickhull algorithm.

The VPP can optimally dispatch these resources in a cluster manner and provide flexibility for the power system operation as a whole. Most existing studies formulate the equivalent power flexibility of the aggregating DERs as deterministic optimization models without considering their uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce the stochastic power flexibility range (PFR) and time-coupling flexibility (TCF) to describe the power flexibility of VPP. In this model, both operational constraints and the randomness of the DERs' output are incorporated, and a combined model and data-driven solution is proposed to obtain the stochastic PFR, TCF, and cost function of VPP. The aggregating model can be easily incorporated into the optimization model for the power system operator or market bidding, considering uncertainties. Finally, a numerical test is performed. The results show that the proposed model not only has higher computational efficiency than the scenario-based methods but also achieves more economic benefits.},

DiffPepBuilder also introduces disulfide bonds to stabilize the generated peptide structures. We tested DiffPepBuilder on 30 experimentally verified strong peptide binders with available protein-peptide complex structures. DiffPepBuilder was able to effectively recall the native structures and sequences of the peptide ligands and to generate novel peptide binders with improved binding free energy. We subsequently conducted de novo generation case studies on three targets. In both the regeneration test and case studies, DiffPepBuilder outperformed AfDesign and RFdiffusion coupled with ProteinMPNN, in terms of sequence and structure recall, interface quality, and structural diversity. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that the introduction of disulfide bonds enhanced the structural rigidity and binding performance of the generated peptides. As a general peptide binder de novo design tool, DiffPepBuilder can be used to design peptide binders for given protein targets with three dimensional and binding site information.},

Considering the complex interaction of wind turbines (WTs) and time-variant frequency dynamics of power systems, it is necessary to assess the primary frequency regulation (PFR) capability and construct feasible regions for wind farms. In order to cope with the challenges of incomplete parameters in physical-based methods and inadequate interpretability in existing data-driven methods, this paper develops a data-driven state space transformation model for wind farms to construct feasible regions of droop and inertia coefficients. Meanwhile, the optimal coefficients are determined by using an alternative direction search (ADS) scheme, which are utilized to construct approximate feasible region with high solution efficiency. Furthermore, a coordinated iteration framework between system operator and multiple wind farms is proposed to fully exploit the frequency support capability. The simulation results validate that the proposed method has the advantages of fast analytical solving, independence from physical parameters, and lower requirements of training data.},

RTDA is the largest region in the uncertainty space, such that all the elements in it will not cause infeasibility while deploying a corrective action.

  abstract = {Concise and reliable modeling for the aggregated power flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) is essential for coordinating transmission and distribution networks. Inner approximated aggregation models are desirable for power system operators because they ensure a safe dispatchable range for the distribution network. However, previous inner approximation methods often rely on experience and intuition due to the absence of an explicit expression of the exact aggregation model (EAM), leading to accuracy and computational efficiency challenges. This paper proposes a novel inner approximation method to overcome these challenges, leveraging the properties of our recently derived closed-form EAM. Specifically, we divide the process of inner approximation methods into two steps: defining a geometric prototype and calculating its parameters. The first step is accomplished by selecting a subset of all the coefficient vectors forming the EAM so as to improve accuracy. When calculating parameters, on the other hand, we exploit the regularity of these coefficient vectors to improve the computational efficiency. The inner approximated flexibility model of ADNs is further incorporated into the security-constrained unit commitment problem as an application, which helps improve the system's economic benefits. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The widely-used tractable uncertainty modeling method---chance constraints with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) approximation, can be over-conservative and even turn an originally feasible problem into an infeasible one. This paper proposes a new approximation method for multiple joint chance constraints (JCCs) to model the uncertainty in dispatch problems, which solves the conservativeness and potential infeasibility concerns of CVaR. The proposed method is also convenient for controlling the risk levels of different JCCs, which is necessary for power system applications since different resources may be affected by varying degrees of uncertainty or have different importance to the system. We then formulate a data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained programming model for the power system multiperiod dispatch problem and leverage the proposed approximation method to solve it. In the numerical simulations, two illustrative examples clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, and the results of the multiperiod dispatch on IEEE test cases verify its practicality.},

Basically, both outer and inner approximated power-energy boundary models are utilized to describe the aggregated flexibility of controllable DERs. These power and energy boundary parameters are uncertain because the availability of controllable devices, such as electric vehicles and thermostatically controlled loads, cannot be precisely predicted. The optimal operation problem of the aggregator is thus formulated as chance-constrained programming (CCP). Then, a flexibility envelope searching algorithm based on the ALSO-X+ method is proposed to solve the CCP, the result of which is a conservative approximation of the original CCP but not as conservative as the Conditional Value-at-Risk approximation. After optimizing the aggregated power of the group of DERs, the decision at the aggregator level is disaggregated into the flexibility regions of individual DERs. Finally, the numerical test demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.},

Advances in the so-called `de novo' design problem have recently been brought forward by developments in artificial intelligence. Generative architectures, such as language models and diffusion processes, seem adept at generating novel, yet realistic proteins that display desirable properties and perform specified functions. State-of-the-art design protocols now achieve experimental success rates nearing 20\%, thus widening the access to de novo designed proteins. Despite extensive progress, there are clear field-wide challenges, for example, in determining the best in silico metrics to prioritise designs for experimental testing, and in designing proteins that can undergo large conformational changes or be regulated by post-translational modifications. With an increase in the number of models being developed, this review provides a framework to understand how these tools fit into the overall process of de novo protein design. Throughout, we highlight the power of incorporating biochemical knowledge to improve performance and interpretability.},

At the cluster-layer, the probability distribution of aggregate regulation capacity is estimated by state evolution model with no underlying information needed. At the aggregator-layer, optimal droop coefficient allocation for multiple clusters is achieved by minimizing the comprehensive cost objective with capacity chance constraints. At the device-layer, a self-governing mechanism is designed for each individual load to timely formulate and correctly conduct its own response plan according to upper-layer broadcast instructions. Consequently, the reliability of PFC with ON/OFF loads is significantly enhanced by taking capacity uncertainty and inherent lock-time constraint into account. Meanwhile, the communication requirements and user privacy damage are minimized while ensuring the final control accuracy. Steady-state and transient simulations further validate the effectiveness of the proposed upper-layer and device-layer PFC method respectively.},

This transformation poses significant challenges to the energy management and operation control: 1) The integration of massive DERs requires additional scheduling capacity, which necessitates the active control of DERs to enhance system support capabilities. The variability of these sources also significantly increases the operation risk of ADNs. 2) The complexity and frequent changes in DERs make timely maintenance impractical, and the accuracy of the distribution network model is poor. The engineering application of the precise modeling based operation control and optimal scheduling technology is difficult. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the theory and methods based on machine learning, proposes an energy management and operation control technology system for ADNs that integrates ``measurement-identification-control'', and realizes operation control and optimal scheduling with minimal/no model maintenance. Meanwhile, the following key techniques are analyzed: 1) the real-time scheduling technology for distribution networks with weak models or without models, achieving autonomous optimization; 2) the adaptive dynamic control technology for DER clusters, enabling proactive support for the power grid; 3) the probability optimization scheduling method for risk quantification, achieving a balance between risk and economy. Finally, the architecture of the energy management and operation control system suitable for ADNs with a extremely high proportion of DERs is briefly introduced.}

GTC, defined as the maximum allowable flow rate of a natural gas system, is used to describe the transmission capability limit of the system. However, we find that the complete capability limit should be described by a curve (GTC curve) instead of GTC, because GTC is just one point of the curve and many other critically secure states still exist except for GTC. Based on this finding, firstly, we define and model the GTC curve as the set consisted of all the critically secure states. Secondly, the sampling-based method is proposed to draw the GTC curve. Finally, we propose the related assessment indices of GTC curve. Two typical test systems are used to verify the existence of GTC curve and the proposed methods. In the two systems, there exist about 71\% and 77\% of critical states on the GTC curve whose total gas volumes are GTC respectively, while 29\% and 23\% of the critical states are not, their total gas volumes are smaller than GTC with different degrees and the most degree can reach 5.6\% and 13.1\% respectively. The GTC curve can describe the capability limit of the system completely, which will help the operators better understand the operational limit of the system as well as improve the security and reliability of planning schemes.},

We found that the optimal fertilizer application rate and irrigation for the historical period (1995--2014) are lower than local farmers' practices as well as trial-derived recommendations. With the optimized practices, the projected annual requirement of fertilizer, irrigation water and residue inputs across the North China Plain in the period 2051--2070 is reduced by 16\% (14--21\%) (mean with 95\% confidence interval), 19\% (7--32\%) and 20\% (16--26\%), respectively, compared with the current supposed optimal management in the historical reference period, with substantial greenhouse gas emission reductions.

  abstract = {Grid-forming (GFM) control has been considered a promising solution for accommodating large-scale power electronics converters into modern power grids thanks to its grid-friendly dynamics, in particular, voltage source behavior on the AC side. The voltage source behavior of GFM converters can provide voltage support for the power grid, and therefore enhance the power grid (voltage) strength. However, grid-following (GFL) converters can also perform constant AC voltage magnitude control by properly regulating their reactive current, which may also behave like a voltage source. Currently, it still remains unclear what are the essential differences between the voltage source behaviors of GFL and GFM converters, and which type of voltage source behavior can enhance the power grid strength. In this paper, we will demonstrate that only GFM converters can provide effective voltage source behavior and enhance the power grid strength in terms of small signal dynamics. Based on our analysis, we further study the problem of how to configure GFM converters in the grid and how many GFM converters we will need. We investigate how the capacity ratio between GFM and GFL converters affects the equivalent power grid strength and thus the small signal stability of the system. We give guidelines on how to choose this ratio to achieve a desired stability margin. We validate our analysis using high-fidelity simulations.},

The promising solution is distributed optimization where each area optimizes its own subproblems via limited information exchange with neighbors. However, most distributed methods require synchronization which may be impractical due to various local computation ability and communication delay or loss. This paper presents an asynchronous distributed economic dispatch strategy in active distribution networks (ADNs). Firstly, unlike traditional model, active power \& reactive power (P-Q) coupling characteristics in ADNs are considered shaping the dispatch more reasonable. Then, an asynchronous fully distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is developed. The proposed method enables each aggregator in ADN optimize their own subproblem through limited information exchange with neighbors in a more flexible and efficient way. Finally, the investigated scheme is validated by numerical tests.},

Conventionally, economic dispatch of DGs is solved by centralized control with optimization algorithms or distributed control with consensus algorithms. To improve the reliability, scalability, and economy of MGs, a fully decentralized economic power sharing strategy is proposed in this paper. As frequency is a global state in ac MG and dc bus voltage serves as a natural indicator in dc MG, a frequency-IC droop scheme is proposed for ac MG, a voltage-IC droop scheme is proposed for dc MG, and a normalization scheme is proposed for hybrid ac/dc MG. By using the proposed technique, ICs of DGs reach equality with the convergence of the system global indicator (frequency or dc bus voltage). Then power sharing of each DG is automatically achieved based on its relevant IC function and the total operating cost can be optimized without any communication or central controllers. The proposed approach is implemented in an ac MG, a dc MG, and a hybrid ac/dc MG in MATLAB/Simulink to verify its effectiveness.},

To address that, this paper proposes two robust methods of correcting time-varying PAD deviation with unknown parameters of TL (ParTL). First, the phenomena of time-varying PAD deviation observed from field PMU data are presented. Two general formulations for PAD estimation are then established. To simplify the formulations, estimation of PADs is converted into the optimal problem with a single ParTL as the variable, yielding a linear estimation of PADs. The latter is used by second-order Taylor series expansion to estimate PADs accurately. To reduce the impact of possible abnormal amplitude data in field data, the IGG (Institute of Geodesy \& Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences) weighting function is adopted. Results using both simulated and field data verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methods.},

The large-scale integration of environment-dependent renewables during energy decarbonization could induce increased uncertainty in the supply--demand balance and climate vulnerability of power grids. This Perspective discusses the superimposed risks of climate change, extreme weather events and renewable energy integration, which collectively affect power system resilience. Insights drawn from large-scale spatiotemporal data on historical US power outages induced by tropical cyclones illustrate the vital role of grid inertia and system flexibility in maintaining the balance between supply and demand, thereby preventing catastrophic cascading failures. Alarmingly, the future projections under diverse emission pathways signal that climate hazards --- especially tropical cyclones and heatwaves --- are intensifying and can cause even greater impacts on the power grids. High-penetration renewable power systems under climate change may face escalating challenges, including more severe infrastructure damage, lower grid inertia and flexibility, and longer post-event recovery. Towards a net-zero future, this Perspective then explores approaches for harnessing the inherent potential of distributed renewables for climate resilience through forming microgrids, aligned with holistic technical solutions such as grid-forming inverters, distributed energy storage, cross-sector interoperability, distributed optimization and climate--energy integrated modelling.},

This paper firstly adapts loadability set to security check, enabling it to depict the capability of power systems to accommodate load variations. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and progressive vertex enumeration (PVE) are introduced to lighten the computational burden caused by multiple periods. The computational time can be traded off with the precision of approximation to the loadability set. Case studies verify that the loadability set can be approximated with proper precision.},

The proposed approach introduces a unified power flow controller (UPFC) in a three-stage security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF). The pre- and post-contingency system operation states are divided into three stages including the base case, post-contingency short-term, and post-contingency long-term periods. The UPFC applications re-route active power flow and provide reactive power to mitigate overloads and voltage violations when line outages occur in power systems. UPFC is adopted as a fast-response corrective control device during the post-contingency short-term period, which is coordinated with the conventional slow-response corrective control system during the post-contingency long-term period. A convex approach is applied to reformulate the original nonlinear nonconvex SCOPF problem into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. A two-level algorithm using Benders decomposition and sequential cone programming (SCP) is applied to solve the large-scale SOCP problem. An improved covering cut bundle (CCB) strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the Benders decomposition algorithm. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution technique for enhancing the power system flexibility.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a two-level network-constrained peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy for multi-microgrids (MGs), which guarantees the distribution power network security and allows MGs to trade energy with each other flexibly. At the lower level, a P2P transactive energy is employed for multi-MGs to trade energy with each other. A multi-leader multi-follower (MLMF) Stackelberg game approach is utilized to model the energy trading process among MGs. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) and provide the closed-form expression for SE. For privacy concerns, we provide several distributed algorithms to obtain SE. At the upper level, the distribution system operator (DSO) reconfigures the distribution network based on the P2P transactive energy trading results by applying the AC optimal power flow considering the distribution network reconfiguration. If there are any network violations, DSO requests trading adjustments at the lower level for network security. We reformulate the DSO operation problem in a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and ensure its solution accuracy. Numerical results for a 4-Microgrid system, a modified IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus distribution power system show the effectiveness of the proposed transactive model and its solution technique.},

In this paper, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed to characterize the correlation between wind farms and probability distribution of their forecast errors. In our model, chance constraints including reserve sufficiency and branch power flow bounds are ensured to be satisfied with predetermined probability. To solve this CCUC problem, we propose a Newton method based procedure to acquire the quantiles and transform chance constraints into deterministic constraints.

In addition, the cumulative frequency deviation during the entire regulation period is exploited as a frequency dynamic criterion.

  abstract = {A new challenge has arisen in power generation scheduling recently, as the rapid increase in the number of gas-fired units has made power systems more vulnerable to failures in natural gas networks. The large-scale integration of wind power further exacerbates the problem because gas-fired units are usually scheduled to catch up wind power uncertainty and thus lead to great variations in the state of gas network. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to commit and dispatch the gas-fired units considering both wind uncertainty and natural gas network security. However, the dynamic characteristics of gas flow are remarkably slower than those of power flow, which should be appropriately modeled to explore its benefits for power system operation. Because directly applying partial differential equations overly complicates the already complicated generation scheduling problem, we address this problem by proposing an approximated transient matrix-form gas flow model. A two-stage robust generation scheduling model is then proposed considering the dynamic security constraints of gas networks and the wind power uncertainty. Moreover, we successfully avoid the nonlinearity of gas flow constraints by developing a new solution methodology. Finally, an illustrative case is presented to demonstrate the effect of gas network dynamics in generation scheduling.},

There are many other linear power flow models that improve the DC power flow model with the inclusion of {\textbackslash}boldsymbolQ and {\textbackslash}boldsymbolv. However, existing linear models are derived based on empirical mathematical approximation without a general methodology guidance. In this paper, we found that the fundamental difference among different linear power flow models lies in the formulation of ``independent variables.'' Based on this finding, a general formulation of linear power flow models is proposed. The linearization error is theoretically analyzed. In particular, the case when {\textbackslash}boldsymbol {\th}eta and {\textbackslash}boldsymbolv{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}scriptscriptstyle k are regarded as independent variables is thoroughly investigated. Method for finding the linear power flow with the minimum error is presented.

It is shown that the linearization error when {\textbackslash}boldsymbolv{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}scriptscriptstyle 2 is regarded as an independent variable is normally smaller than that for {\textbackslash}boldsymbolv because of the special properties of the distribution of {\textbackslash}boldsymbolv in power grids.},

However, under the current operational procedures, the gas system operator is unable to provide detailed network data to the power system operator due to information privacy, and thus, the power system operator has very limited knowledge of the situation variation in the gas system. To better represent the interaction between electric and gas systems and increase situation awareness, a multi-port equivalent model of gas networks and electricity-to-gas sensitivity factors is proposed in this paper by transplanting the theory of electric analogy and reduced equivalence from electric circuit analysis to gas system analysis. The multi-port equivalent model enables the gas system operator to provide the reduced equivalent boundary information of the gas system without revealing detailed network data. Based on this information, electricity-to-gas sensitivity factors are calculated by power system operators. These factors indicate ``where, when and how much'' the status of the gas system will change as a function of changes in power generation. Both the equivalent model and sensitivity factors have explicit matrix formulations and can contribute to improving power system operators' awareness of varying conditions in the gas system.

Flexible EVs can enhance power systems' ability to handle renewable generation uncertainties. How EV flexibility can be utilized in power grid operation has captured great attention. However, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small capacity and large number. Hence, it is the aggregator that interacts with the grid on behalf of the EVs by characterizing their aggregate flexibility. In this article, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility characterization problem. First, an offline model is built to obtain the lower and upper bounds of the aggregate EV power flexibility region. It ensures that any trajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters such as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not known in advance, an online algorithm is developed based on Lyapunov optimization techniques. We provide a theoretical bound for the maximum charging delay under the proposed online algorithm. Furthermore, real-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online algorithm to better unlock EV power flexibility. Comprehensive performance comparisons are carried out to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

We build an MES model and propose an optimal MES schedule which helps MES reduce wind power curtailment in power systems. At first, electricity and natural gas networks are coordinated at the transmission (regional) level for accommodating the large penetration of wind power in regional MES. The distribution (district) level MES coordinates energy conversion and storage to jointly supply the electricity, natural gas, and heat loads. The transmission level MES is modeled using detailed network equations while the distribution level MES is modeled as a device with multiple input/output ports using the linear branch-flow-based energy hub model. A two-stage robust model is established to consider the variability of wind power at the two MES levels. The proposed problem is solved by a nested column-and-constraint (C\&CG) generation method. The first-stage problem which schedules the hourly unit commitment is solved in the outer loop, while the inner loop solves the second-stage problem to realize the worst scenario. Several acceleration strategies are utilized to enhance the computational performance of the nested C\&CG. Numerical results offered for a 6-bus 3-node system and a modified IEEE 118-bus 10-node system show the effectiveness of the proposed MES model and solution technique for enhancing the power system flexibility.},

  abstract = {We present VideoGPT: a conceptually simple architecture for scaling likelihood based generative modeling to natural videos. VideoGPT uses VQ-VAE that learns downsampled discrete latent representations of a raw video by employing 3D convolutions and axial self-attention. A simple GPT-like architecture is then used to autoregressively model the discrete latents using spatio-temporal position encodings. Despite the simplicity in formulation and ease of training, our architecture is able to generate samples competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models for video generation on the BAIR Robot dataset, and generate high fidelity natural videos from UCF-101 and Tumbler GIF Dataset (TGIF). We hope our proposed architecture serves as a reproducible reference for a minimalistic implementation of transformer based video generation models.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a physics-informed sparse Gaussian process (SGP) for probabilistic stability assessment of large-scale power systems in the presence of uncertain dynamic PVs and loads. The differential and algebraic equations considering uncertainties from dynamic PVs and loads are reformulated to a nonlinear mapping relationship that allows the application of SGP. Thanks to the nonparametric characteristic of Gaussian process, the proposed framework does not require distributions of uncertain inputs and this distinguishes it from existing approaches. As the original Gaussian process is not scalable to large-scale systems with high dimensional uncertain inputs, this paper develops the SGP with a stochastic variational inference technique. It leads to approximately two orders of complex reduction. A data pre-processing step is also introduced to tackle the coexistence of stable and unstable cases by sample clustering and constructing separate SGPs. The probabilistic transient stability index is analyzed to assess system stability under different uncertain dynamics loads and PVs. Comparisons are performed with the sampling-based, the polynomial chaos expansion-based, and traditional Gaussian process-based methods on the modified IEEE 118-bus and Texas 2000-bus systems under various scenarios, including different levels of uncertainties and the existence of nonlinear correlations among dynamic PVs. The impacts of data quality and quantity issues are also investigated. It is shown that the proposed SGP achieves significantly improved computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy with a limited number of data.},

This article proposes an aggregate operation model to efficiently manage a large number of DERs with heterogeneous parameters. The aggregate operation model includes the approximate feasible region and the equivalent operational cost function. First, considering the coupling of power, energy, and regulation service, the operational flexibility of multiple categories of DERs is modeled by a general polytope. Second, by scaling and translating a basic homothetic polytope, a maximum inner aggregation approach is formulated to exploit the potential flexibility of DERs and guarantee solution feasibility. The uncertainty of DERs is modeled by the distributionally robust chance-constrained program (DRCCP), and the equivalent cost function of the DER aggregator is rigidly derived. Last, this study theoretically explains that the aggregate feasible region can be enlarged by introducing the DER clustering process, and a spectral clustering algorithm based on the multi-scale similarity metric method is developed to classify DERs into different aggregators. Numerical simulation results indicate the great potential of the proposed method to enhance system operational flexibility with high computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {The natural gas pipeline network is an important part of the integrated energy system. The optimal control of the integrated energy system requires accurate transient online simulation of the natural gas pipeline network. However, the existing relevant research does not make enough use of the measured data, resulting in low simulation accuracy. Therefore, a high-accuracy online transient simulation framework is proposed from four perspectives: transient simulation model selection, model parameters settings, measured data processing, and model error compensation. In this framework, measured data is fully used to improve simulation accuracy by integrating multiple physics-based and data-driven methods. First, the simulation model based on the finite volume method is selected as the basic physics-based model. Then measured data are processed based on the 3 times standard deviation method and moving average filtering to drive the simulation model. To set suitable model parameters, a data-driven method combining with the Kriging model and genetic algorithm is proposed to simultaneously identify the two key parameters of roughness and heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the final simulation errors of the physics-based model are compensated by combining the data-driven model in three modes, namely supplement, embedment, and integration. Two cases of an actual single pipeline and a complex pipeline network illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework and verify the advantage of the integrated data-driven and physics-based methods. Compared with measured data, the final simulation errors of mass flow and temperature are 0.3279\% and 0.1036\%, respectively. Under the trend of delicacy and intelligent operation of natural gas pipeline network, the proposed framework provides a theoretical basis for the online simulation application.},

  abstract = {Multi-energy systems (MES) provide various types of energy services by coupling different energy sectors. Such coupling increases the efficiency and flexibility of the entire energy system, and at the same time, however, increases the dependencies of the load carrying capability among different types of load demand. In the MES planning stage, we always want to assess and compare the load carrying capability among different planning schemes, considering the N-1 or N-M contingencies and the mutual effect of different energy sectors. While in the MES operation stage, we always want to know if the load of MES can be securely supplied considering potential contingencies and how far the current operation status is from the security boundary. This paper proposes a new concept named the energy hub (EH) security region and applying the concept to depict the load carrying capability of the district MES. The concept defines a region in a hyperspace where the MES can be safely operated under steady-state operational and security constraints. We first model the district MES using the EH approach and propose the mathematical form of the EH steady-state security region systematically. Then, a vertex-based algorithm is proposed to precisely calculate the security region using a space projection technique. We further propose indices to evaluate the load carrying capability of a district MES and identify critical components. Numerical case studies are conducted on two test systems to verify the validity of the proposed method. The results show the proposed EH security region concept and calculation method provide quantitive indicators on how to compare MES planning schemes and improve the load carrying capability.},

However, malfunctions of gas networks have caused several large-scale power blackouts. The transition from coal and oil to gas fuels significantly increases the interdependence between gas networks and electric power systems, raising the risks of more frequent and widespread power blackouts due to the malfunction of gas networks. In a coupled gas--electricity system, the identification and transmission of gas network malfunction information, followed by the redispatch of electric power generation, occur notably faster than the propagation and escalation of the malfunction itself, e.g., significantly diminished pressure. On this basis, we propose a gas-electric early warning system that can reduce the negative impacts of gas network malfunctions on the power system. A proactive control strategy of the power system is also formulated based on the early warning indicators. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated via case studies of a real coupled gas--electricity system in China.},

It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems.

Although the design of antimicrobial peptides using machine learning methods has achieved good results in recent years, it remains a challenge to learn and design novel antimicrobial peptides with multiple properties of interest from peptide data with certain property labels. To this end, we propose Multi-CGAN, a deep generative model-based architecture that can learn from single-attribute peptide data and generate antimicrobial peptide sequences with multiple attributes that we need, which may have a potentially wide range of uses in drug discovery. In particular, we verified that our Multi-CGAN generated peptides with the desired properties have good performance in terms of generation rate. Moreover, a comprehensive statistical analysis demonstrated that our generated peptides are diverse and have a low probability of being homologous to the training data. Interestingly, we found that the performance of many popular deep learning methods on the antimicrobial peptide prediction task can be improved by using Multi-CGAN to expand the data on the training set of the original task, indicating the high quality of our generated peptides and the robust ability of our method. In addition, we also investigated whether it is possible to directionally generate peptide sequences with specified properties by controlling the input noise sampling for our model.},

  abstract = {The increasing integration of distributed energy resources calls for new planning and operational tools. However, such tools depend on system topology and line parameters, which may be missing or inaccurate in distribution grids. With abundant data, one idea is to use linear regression to find line parameters, based on which topology can be identified. Unfortunately, the linear regression method is accurate only if there is no noise in both the input measurements (e.g., voltage magnitude and phase angle) and output measurements (e.g., active and reactive power). For topology estimation, even with a small error in measurements, the regression-based method is incapable of finding the topology using nonzero line parameters with a proper metric. To model input and output measurement errors simultaneously, we propose the error-in-variables model in a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for joint line parameter and topology estimation. While directly solving the problem is NP-hard, we successfully adapt the problem into a generalized low-rank approximation problem via variable transformation and noise decorrelation. For accurate topology estimation, we let it interact with parameter estimation in a fashion that is similar to expectation-maximization algorithm in machine learning. The proposed PaToPa approach does not require a radial network setting and works for mesh networks. We demonstrate the superior performance in accuracy for our method on IEEE test cases with actual feeder data from Southern California Edison.},

  abstract = {The distribution system state estimation problem seeks to determine the network state from available measurements. Widely used Gauss-Newton approaches are very sensitive to the initialization and often not suitable for real-time estimation. Learning approaches are very promising for real-time estimation, as they shift the computational burden to an offline training stage. Prior machine learning approaches to power system state estimation have been electrical model-agnostic, in that they did not exploit the topology and physical laws governing the power grid to design the architecture of the learning model. In this paper, we propose a novel learning model that utilizes the structure of the power grid. The proposed neural network architecture reduces the number of coefficients needed to parameterize the mapping from the measurements to the network state by exploiting the separability of the estimation problem. This prevents overfitting and reduces the complexity of the training stage. We also propose a greedy algorithm for phasor measuring units placement that aims at minimizing the complexity of the neural network required for realizing the state estimation mapping. Simulation results show superior performance of the proposed method over the Gauss-Newton approach.},

  abstract = {Ensuring that the outputs of neural networks satisfy specific constraints is crucial for applying neural networks to real-life decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider making a batch of neural network outputs satisfy bounded and general linear constraints. We first reformulate the neural network output projection problem as an entropy-regularized linear programming problem. We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free. Despite the fact that we can explicitly perform backpropagation based on automatic differentiation mechanism, we also provide an alternative approach in GLinSAT to calculate the derivatives based on implicit differentiation of the optimality condition. Experimental results on constrained traveling salesman problems, partial graph matching with outliers, predictive portfolio allocation and power system unit commitment demonstrate the advantages of GLinSAT over existing satisfiability layers.},

In this paper, we present a systematic study to handle this challenge in two-stage robust optimization{\textasciitilde}(RO). Our main contributions include three sophisticated variants of column-and-constraint generation method to exactly compute DDU-based two-stage RO. By a novel application of core concepts of linear programming, we provide rigorous analyses on their computational behaviors. Interestingly, in terms of the iteration complexity of those algorithms, DDU-based two-stage RO is not more demanding than its decision independent uncertainty (DIU) based counterpart. It is worth highlighting a counterintuitive discovery that converting a DIU set into a DDU set by making use of "deep knowledge" and then computing the resulting DDU-based formulation may lead to a significant improvement. Indeed, as shown in this paper, in addition to capturing the actual dependence existing in the real world, DDU is a powerful and flexible tool to represent and leverage analytical properties or simply domain expertise to achieve a strong solution capacity. So, we believe it will open a new direction to solve large-scale DIU- or DDU-based RO. Other important results include basic structural properties for two-stage RO, an approximation scheme to deal with mixed integer recourse, and a couple of enhancement techniques for the developed algorithms, as well as an organized numerical study to help us appreciate all algorithms and enhancement techniques' computational performances.},

The ED is solved every 5 min identifying the most economic generation dispatch and reserve schedule. AGC is a feedback control system that regulates area control error by sending signals to regulation reserve every 2-6 s. In system with high renewable penetration and associated high net-load variability, the conventional ED-AGC hierarchical model may result in degraded MW-frequency performance and increasing operational cost. In this paper, an AGC dynamic constrained ED model is proposed to provide a more reliable and economical regulation reserve schedule in handling high net load variability. The continuous AGC dynamics is transformed into discrete state-space model, and the fast AGC dynamics are eliminated to reduce the system order. The discretized reduced-order AGC dynamics are incorporated into the ED to optimize the regulation schedule. The proposed model can be applied in a look-ahead mode with very short-term load forecast or in a look-back mode to provide a ``perfect dispatch'' benchmark based on historical net load data. The 5-bus and 118-bus systems are tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

  abstract = {A major limitation to integrating wind power in electric power system (EPS) is the massive generation capacity of the high-penetration inflexible combined heat and power (CHP) units in district heating system (DHS). A heat and power optimal dispatch is established in this study to exploit building-level thermal inertia as a form of short-term thermal energy storage (TES) to unlock the flexibility of CHP units. This proposed short-term building TES can provide storage potential by utilizing small variations in indoor temperature under the proposed dispatch control model to control the storage capacity in the dispatch process. A linear optimization operational model is run to integrate energy systems by balancing heat and power demands over multiple time periods with CHP units, wind power, short-term building TES, and district-level heating network (DHN) storage capacity. A two-stage decomposition--coordination iteration algorithm is proposed to solve this optimization program. The simulation results are analyzed to determine the potential benefits of this short-term TES in terms of economics, wind power integration, and the flexibility of CHP units. {\copyright} 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

In consideration of the randomness and volatility characteristics of wind energy, a worst-case based scenario selection method (SSM) based on the peak and valley shaving of the system, the ramping-up/down rates of net load, and the dispersion of uncertainty factors is presented to reduce the number of scenarios and improve the robustness of unit commitment (UC) schemes. Regarding the balance of efficiency and flexibility of tie-line scheduling, tie-line operation modes are established on the basis of the tie-line load rate (TLLR). Besides, the number of reversals of tie-line power flow directions during the entire scheduling period is also modeled. By linearizing the tie-line operation modes' equations, the MAUC can be converted into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. Case studies show that more wind energy can be consumed by connecting power systems through tie lines and coordinating scheduling of generators and tie lines. Expected energy not supplied (EENS) of scenario reduction techniques based on the clustering method, i.e. k-means, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Fuzzy C-means (FCM), are 147\%, 38\%, and 130\% higher than that of the SSM.},

At the same time, machine learning techniques provide more opportunities to study the complex power system security and stability problems.

First, by introducing P2G, an IES structure based on energy hub is established to implement bidirectional flow between power and natural gas systems. Second, the dynamic characteristic of gas pipelines is modeled with energy storage capability, which can improve the flexibility of the natural gas system by regulating the pressure level of pipeline networks. Furthermore, a cooperative dispatching strategy for P2G and pipeline storage capability is presented to catch the flexibility of IES, in which the unbalanced wind power is converted into natural gas and stored in pipeline networks. Finally, case study is verified on the modified IEEE39-NGS20-HS20 and IEEE118-NGS40-HS20 IES systems with different typical wind power scenarios. The proposed cooperative dispatching strategy can effectively increase wind power consumption and reduce operating cost of the whole system without high computation burden.},

The commonly used steady-state analysis method is not applicable in computing the pipeline dynamics of natural gas networks, and it is computationally expensive for most transient analysis methods to obtain high-resolution solutions. In addition, conventional methods generate energy flow profiles at pre-set time intervals, which are not compatible with continuous-time applications. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes a dynamic energy flow analysis method applied in integrated gas and electricity systems using the holomorphic embedding method. The system's state equations are formulated using ordinary differential equations based on a simplified natural gas network model and are reconstructed by time-embedded holomorphic functions. By solving these functions, the continuous-time profiles of the energy flow of the whole system can be readily generated with a moderate computational burden, and the pipeline dynamics can be addressed. The simulation results of the case studies validate the improved computational performance of the proposed method over that of a conventional ordinary difference equation solver. In both small-scale and large-scale cases, the proposed method can capture the transient process in every state variable in response to disturbances accurately and efficiently.},

Frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) is proposed to address this challenge. Despite existing efforts in modeling frequency characteristics in unit commitment (UC), current strategies can only handle oversimplified low-order frequency response models and do not consider wide-range operating conditions. This paper presents a generic data-driven framework for FCUC under high renewable penetration. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained to predict the frequency response using real data or high-fidelity simulation data. Next, the DNN is reformulated as a set of mixed-integer linear constraints to be incorporated into the ordinary UC formulation. In the data generation phase, all possible power injections are considered, and a region-of-interest active sampling is proposed to include power injection samples with frequency nadirs closer to the UFLC threshold, which enhances the accuracy of frequency constraints in FCUC. The proposed FCUC is investigated on the IEEE 39-bus system. Then, a full-order dynamic model simulation using PSS/E verifies the effectiveness of FCUC in frequency-secure generator commitments.},

  abstract = {The magnetic flux leakage (MFL) defect detection of oil and gas pipelines faces two tasks, defect type identification and defect size and shape estimation. However, there are few pieces of research on defect shape estimation, especially fewer research works on defect cross-sectional profile estimation. The complex nonlinear relationship between the defect profile and the MFL signal makes the defect profile difficult to be estimated. In this article, we propose a novel visual deep transfer learning (VDTL) neural network, which not only predicts the defect size but also estimates the defect cross-sectional profile. VDTL network consists of a visual data transformation layer, a transfer learning convolutional neural network (CNN) layer, and a fully connected layer. In addition, we propose an augmentation data to figure (ADF) transformation method for one-dimensional MFL signals, and a fusion algorithm for two-dimensional radial and axial MFL images, which enriches the defect information in the images. Based on the Alexnet network, the multikernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) transfer learning algorithm is introduced to improve the accuracy. Experiments are carried out on the data collected in the laboratory and on the data simulated by the finite element method. The results show that the prediction errors for defect length, depth, and defect cross-sectional profile are 0.67 mm, 0.97\%, and 2.67\%, which are the smallest among the other methods. The research provides a theoretical basis for accurate defect prediction and the safe maintenance of oil and gas pipelines.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become an important trend to support the analysis and control of complex and time-varying power systems. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been utilized in the power system field, most of these DRL models are regarded as black boxes, which are difficult to explain and cannot be used on occasions when human operators need to participate. Using the explainable AI (XAI) technology to explain why power system models make certain decisions is as important as the accuracy of the decisions themselves because it ensures trust and transparency in the model decision-making process. The interpretability issue in DRL models in power system emergency control is discussed in this article. The proposed interpretable method is a backpropagation deep explainer based on Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs), which is named the Deep-SHAP method. The Deep-SHAP method is adopted to provide a reasonable interpretable model for a DRL-based emergency control application. For the DRL model, the importance of input features has been quantified to obtain contributions for the outcome of the model. Further, feature classification of the inputs and probabilistic analysis of the outputs in the XAI model is added to interpretability results for better clarity.},

  abstract = {To ensure the validity of distribution system state estimation (DSSE) in case of frequent topology changes, it is important to develop DSSE methods with topology identification capability. This paper proposes a forecasting-aided joint topology/state estimation method for distribution systems considering topology changes. The joint estimation problem is formulated under the Dirichlet-process hidden-Markov-model (DP-HMM), which requires establishing state-space models for a partial set of topologies (i.e., predefined topologies) and constructing probability distribution of the other possible topologies (i.e., unseen topologies). A particle filter (PF)-based method is proposed to resolve this joint estimation problem, which augments the particles to include both topology-related variables and nodal voltages. Its robustness against measurement outliers is enhanced by adopting the anti-zero bias modification. The base distribution for unseen topologies are constructed via probabilistic neural networks (PNNs). To improve the accuracy of PNNs, the synthetic minority oversampling technique is employed to rebalance the training data. Aiming at efficiency enhancement, a rule-based candidate set reduction method is proposed for the unseen topologies to improve topology sampling validity. Test results on the IEEE 33-bus, IEEE 123-bus, and a modified 2516-bus distribution systems show that the proposed method has good state and topology estimation accuracy while achieving good scalability.},

The proposed coordinated stochastic model (referred to as EGTran) considers random outages of generating units and transmission lines, and random errors in forecasting the day-ahead hourly loads. The Monte Carlo simulation is applied to create multiple scenarios for representing the coordinated system uncertainties. The nonlinear natural gas network constraints are linearized and incorporated into the stochastic model. Numerical results demonstrate the benefits of applying the hourly economic demand response for enhancing the scheduling coordination of natural gas and electricity networks. It is demonstrated that electricity demand response would offer a less volatile hourly load profile and locational marginal prices, and less dependence on natural gas constraints for the optimal operation of electric power systems. The proposed model for EGTran could be applied by grid operators for the hourly commitment and dispatch of power system units.},

  abstract = {Extracting information on fluid motion directly from images is challenging. Fluid flow represents a complex dynamic system governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. General optical flow methods are typically designed for rigid body motion, and thus struggle if applied to fluid motion estimation directly. Further, optical flow methods only focus on two consecutive frames without utilising historical temporal information, while the fluid motion (velocity field) can be considered a continuous trajectory constrained by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). This discrepancy has the potential to induce physically inconsistent estimations. Here we propose an unsupervised learning based prediction-correction scheme for fluid flow estimation. An estimate is first given by a PDE-constrained optical flow predictor, which is then refined by a physical based corrector. The proposed approach outperforms optical flow methods and shows competitive results compared to existing supervised learning based methods on a benchmark dataset. Furthermore, the proposed approach can generalize to complex real-world fluid scenarios where ground truth information is effectively unknowable. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the physical corrector can refine flow estimates by mimicking the operator splitting method commonly utilised in fluid dynamical simulation.},

This may jeopardize the frequency dynamics and challenges the secure operation of power systems. In this paper, the concept of frequency security margin is proposed to quantify the system frequency regulation ability under contingency. It is defined as the maximum power imbalance that the system can tolerate while keeping frequency within the tolerable frequency range. A frequency constrained unit commitment (FCUC) model considering frequency security margin is proposed. Firstly, the analytical formulation of system frequency nadir is derived while considering both the frequency regulation characteristics of the thermal generators and the frequency support from VRE plants. Then, the frequency security margin is analytically formulated and piecewise linearized. A novel FCUC model is proposed by incorporating linear frequency security constraints into the traditional unit commitment model. Case studies on a modified IEEE RTS-79 system and HRP-38 system are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FCUC model. The impacts of VRE penetration on system frequency security are analyzed using frequency security margin.},

  abstract = {This article presents a model predictive control (MPC) based multitime scale co-optimized dispatch for integrated electricity and natural gas system (IEGS) considering the bidirectional interactions and renewable uncertainties. In the proposed model, optimal dispatch is extended into three substages optimization problems of day-ahead, intraday, and real-time to coordinate the economy and accuracy of operations. The different optimization strategy is designed in each dispatching stage according to the operating characteristics of multienergy coupled units and high-penetration intermittent wind power. In the day-ahead stage, the unit commitment is tackled to arrange the start-stop plan of slow-response units, maintained in intraday and real-time stages to ensure full-term optimal economic operation. In the intraday stage, MPC-based rolling optimization is implemented to obtain the unit output scheme with the lowest operating cost target. Furthermore, the output scheme is rolling adjusted in the real-time stage based on the ultrashort-term forecast value, and a closed-loop feedback mechanism is introduced to achieve accurate power balance. In each stage, stochastic decision-making is executed based on the stochastic scenario method, efficiently capturing the uncertainty in IEGS. Besides, the proposed nonlinear model is transformed into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem using McCormick relaxation, which can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers. Simulation results on IEEE39-Gas20 and IEEE118-GAS40 test systems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in operational economy and wind power utilization, and also verify the effectiveness of the method to accurately track random fluctuations without obvious computational burden.},

The added costs depend on several factors including market design, performance of renewable generation forecasting and the specific dispatch procedure. Quantifying these costs has been limited to small sample Monte Carlo approaches applied specific dispatch algorithms. The computational complexity and accuracy of these approaches has limited the understanding of tradeoffs between different factors. In this work we consider a two-stage stochastic economic dispatch problem. Our goal is to provide an analytical quantification and an intuitive understanding of the effects of uncertainties and network congestion on the dispatch procedure and the optimal cost. We first consider an uncongested network and calculate the risk limiting dispatch. In addition, we derive the price of uncertainty, a number that characterizes the intrinsic impact of uncertainty on the integration cost of renewables. Then we extend the results to a network where one link can become congested. Under mild conditions, we calculate price of uncertainty even in this case. We show that risk limiting dispatch is given by a set of deterministic equilibrium equations. The dispatch solution yields an important insight: congested links do not create isolated nodes, even in a two-node network. In fact, the network can support backflows in congested links, that are useful to reduce the uncertainty by averaging supply across the network. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in standard IEEE benchmark networks.},

It is critical to estimate cloud cover to accurately predict PV generation within a very short horizon (second/minute). To achieve the precise forecasting of cloud cover, an image preprocessing method based on total-sky images is proposed to remove the interference and address the image edge distortion issue. An optimal threshold estimation method is further designed to achieve higher cloud identification precision. Considering the cloud's meteorological properties, a random hypersurface model (RHM) based on the Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter is applied to track the cloud. The GM-PHD can track the rotation and diffusion of cloud, which helps to estimate sun-cloud collision. Furthermore, a hybrid autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and back propagation (BP) neural network based model is applied for the intra-hour PV power forecasting. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed cloud tracking based PV power forecasting model can capture the ramp behavior of PV power, improving forecasting precision.},

However, due to the dispersed integration of energy storage systems and uncertain REGs, the available regulation capability exhibits spatio-temporal coupling. It poses a challenge to quantify flexibility considering multiple locations and time periods. This paper proposes a novel analytical region-based method to characterize the flexibility considering spatio-temporal coupling, where the total dispatch budget and carbon emission constraints are considered to guarantee economic and environmental benefits. Leveraging the basic feasible solution theory, we derive an analytical formulation of the flexibility region, expressed as a set of linear inequalities. Note that no inner or outer approximation techniques are employed in the deduction procedure. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method are validated on test systems. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method enables precise quantification and visualization of operational flexibility for DSs. The derived flexibility region is a closed polyhedron in a high-dimensional space, signifying the maximum ranges of uncertainties that can be accommodated.},

  abstract = {We study the energy consumption minimization problems of natural gas transmission in gunbarrel structured networks. In particular, we consider the transient-state dynamics of natural gas and the compressor's nonlinear working domain and min-up-and-down constraints. We formulate the problem as a two-level dynamic program (DP), where the upper-level DP problem models each compressor station as a decision stage and each station's optimization problem is further formulated as a lower-level DP by setting each time period as a stage. The upper-level DP faces the curse of high dimensionality. We propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach for the upper-level DP using appropriate basis functions, and an exact approach for the lower-level DP by exploiting the structure of the problem. We validate the superior performance of the proposed ADP approach on both synthetic and real networks, as compared to the benchmark simulated annealing (SA) heuristic and the commonly used myopic policy and steady-state policy. On the synthetic networks, the ADP reduces the energy consumption by 5.8\%-6.7\% from the SA and 12\% from the myopic policy. On the test gunbarrel network with 21 compressor stations and 28 pipes calibrated from China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), the ADP saves 4.8\%-5.1\% (with an average of 5.0\%) energy consumption than the SA and the currently deployed steady-state policy, which translates to cost savings of millions of dollars a year. Moreover, the proposed ADP algorithm requires 18.4\%-61.0\% less computation time than the SA. The advantages in both solution quality and computation time strongly support the proposed ADP algorithm in practice.},

System expansion in CLCA can quantify the environmental consequences of an increment of feedstock suppliers' and downstream product consumers' processes as well as a decrement of feedstock consumers' and downstream product suppliers' processes. These market dynamics are ignored when performing attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA). The CLCO problem is formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear fractional programming problem and solved by an optimization algorithm that integrates the inexact parametric algorithm and branch-and-refine algorithm. The environmental and economic objectives are minimizing the unit consequential life cycle environmental impacts and maximizing the unit net present value, respectively. Market dynamics results show that consuming natural gas in the waste HDPE chemical recycling process increases the natural gas' market price and supply by 0.1\%, while onsite manufacturing propylene decreases propylene market price by 5.46\%, decreases propylene supply by 8.8\%, and increases the propylene demand by 10.2\%. Disparities and comprehensiveness are two effects of system expansion. Disparities are illustrated by a 14.22\% decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a 60.37\% reduction of photochemical oxidant formation compared to ALCA results. Comprehensiveness of system expansion is reflected by the diverse results of the environmental consequences of each consumer or marginal supplier's process of feedstocks and products. Specifically, the substitution of 1-butene supplier's process by onsite production from chemical recycling reduces 19.68\% of total photochemical oxidant formation. Onsite use of natural gas from chemical recycling increases 37.14\% of total ionizing radiation.},

First, an exact characterization of their aggregate flexibility is derived analytically, which in general contains exponentially many inequality constraints with respect to the number of loads. In order to have a tractable solution, we develop a numerical algorithm that gives a sufficient approximation of the exact aggregate flexibility. Geometrically, the flexibility of each individual load is a polytope and their aggregation is the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. Our method is motivated by an alternative interpretation of the Minkowski sum as a projection operation. The aggregate flexibility can be viewed as the projection of a high-dimensional polytope onto the subspace representing the aggregate power. We formulate a robust optimization problem to optimally approximate the polytopic projection with respect to the homothets of a given polytope. To enable efficient and parallel computation of the aggregate flexibility for a large number of loads, a muti-stage aggregation strategy is proposed. Finally, an energy arbitrage problem is solved to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

One of the key challenges of integrating TCLs into system-level operation and control is developing a simple and portable model to accurately capture their aggregate flexibility. In this paper, we propose a geometric approach to model the aggregate flexibility of TCLs. We show that the set of admissible power profiles of an individual TCL is a polytope, and their aggregate flexibility is the Minkowski sum of the individual polytopes. In order to represent their aggregate flexibility in an intuitive way and achieve a tractable approximation, we develop optimization-based algorithms to approximate the polytopes by the homothets of a given convex set. As a special application, this set is chosen as a virtual battery model, and the corresponding optimal approximations are solved efficiently by equivalent linear programming problems. Numerical results show that our algorithms yield significant improvement in characterizing the aggregate flexibility over existing modeling methods. We also conduct case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches by coordinating TCLs to track a frequency regulation signal from the Pennsylvania--New Jersey--Maryland Interconnection.},

The causal effects of WD-RESs on blackouts generally decrease in high-penetration WD-RES power systems, and WD-RESs are not mainly responsible for the occurrence of blackouts in extreme weather conditions.

The energy consumption due to the time delay caused by the transport of the medium in the DH network is enormous, especially in large networks. The study of time delay is necessary for the operation and optimization of DH networks. Compared with previous studies of constant flow rates and ideal pipeline (without regard to branches, elbows, variable pipe diameters, etc), this paper simulates a DH network in Tianjin University, China, by establishing the actual engineering model in a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method to analyze the time delay. The CFD model has great advantages in terms of computational cost and application range compared to theoretical calculations. The peak-valley method was used to verify the correctness of the time delay simulation model. Results show that the time delay calculated by the CFD model is consistent with the actual time delay obtained from the measured data. Based on this model, the parameters that affect the time delay are furtherly analyzed. Four key parameters, including flow rate, pipe length, pipe diameter, and water supply temperature are summarized. The results show that the flow rate, pipe length and pipe diameter have a great influence on the time delay of the DH network, while the temperature has little effect on the time delay. The time delay of the DH network system has a significant impact and can provide services for optimal control of the system.},

Centrifugal compressors commonly used in high pressure gas transmission networks could be driven by gas turbines or electric motors. Including compressor units powered via different fuels in a compressor station allows switching between fuels required by compressors to achieve a set outlet pressure and flow throughput. In this paper, an optimisation model of gas network was developed considering reasonably detailed representation of a compressor station to investigate flexibility provision from the compressor station to the power system. The model was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem by linearising the nonlinear equations governing gas flow along pipes and compressor power consumption. The model was tested on the gas transmission system in South Wales, UK. The operation of compressors was optimised in response to gas and electricity price subject to meeting operational limits of the gas network. The results showed that the compressors can provide flexibility to the power system through shifting their electricity energy consumption in time or switching between gas- and electric-driven compressor units. It was found that the allowable range for variation of linepack plays a key role in the magnitude and duration of flexibility provision from compressor units.},

Our approach does not require an explicit description of the projection, and can easily be generalized to find a maximally sized convex body of a polytopic projection. Our obtained MVE is an inner approximation of the projected polytope, and its center is a centralized relative interior point of the projection. Since FME may produce many redundant constraints, we apply an LP-based procedure to keep the description of the projected polytopes at its minimal size. Furthermore, we propose an upper bounding scheme to evaluate the quality of the inner approximations. We test our approach on a simple polytope and a color tube design problem, and observe that as more auxiliary variables are eliminated, our inner approximations and upper bounds converge to optimal solutions.},

To this end, a solution scheme based on a blending of three popular robust optimization techniques is proposed. For disjoint bilinear optimization problems with a polyhedral feasible region and a general convex feasible region, we show that, under mild regularity conditions, the convex relaxations of the original bilinear formulation and its two-stage robust reformulation obtained from a reformulation-linearizationbased technique and linear decision rules, respectively, are equivalent. For generic bilinear optimization problems, the convex relaxations from the reformulation-linearization-based technique are generally tighter than the one from linear decision rules. Numerical experiments on bimatrix games, synthetic disjoint bilinear problem instances, and convex maximization problems demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution scheme.},

  abstract = {The pressure changes dramatically during the shutdown process of the multi-product pipeline. When the pipeline pressure comes to decrease, it is often mistaken as pipeline leakage or other abnormal condition which increases the burden of the operator on-site. At present, the method of pipeline shutdown pressure analysis is mainly based on numerical simulation which can not monitor shutdown pressure in real-time. In this work, the time-series approximate ability of long short-term memory (LSTM) is taken advantage of to construct a shutdown pressure prediction model. To overcome the drawback of this deep learning algorithm that is trained only by ample data, the scientific principle and theory are integrated into LSTM. Subsequently, the theory-guided long short-term memory (TG-LSTM) is proposed for pipeline shutdown pressure prediction. The proposed model is trained with available data and simultaneously guided by the theory (physical principle and engineering theory) of the underlying problem. In the training process, the data mismatch, as well as monotonicity constraints, and boundary constraints are coupled into loss function. After acquiring the parameters of the neural network, a TG-LSTM model is established which not only fits the data, but also follows the physical principle and the engineering theory. The proposed model is verified by three real-world multi-product pipelines. The results indicate that TG-LSTM achieves better accuracy than other prediction models, with MAPE being 0.246\%, 0.186\%, and 0.143\%, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of different hyper-parameter is conducted to illustrate the robustness of TG-LSTM in pipeline shutdown pressure prediction.},

However, to truly utilize the thermal inertia of the DHN, the supply and return temperatures at the heat source are both necessary to regulate the district heating system (DHS) for wind power integration, whereas the heat output of CHP is not able to do that. Therefore, a new IHPD model that considers the thermal inertia of the DHN was formulated to improve the flexibility of CHP units for wind power integration, in which the first proposed integration model was used to completely simulate the dynamic temperature distribution of the DHS. The optimised supply and return temperatures at the heat source were then obtained to guide the operation regulation of DHS for wind power integration in actual engineering applications. Moreover, the stored thermal energy and the thermal storage rate of the DHN were quantitatively calculated to determine the thermal state of DHN. To analyse the effects of the proposed IHPD model, the approach was compared with a conventional heat and power dispatch model through a case study based on a real DHS. The results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in terms of wind power integration, energy saving and operation regulation of DHS.},

To facilitate feasible region projection, a network reduction method considering heat uncerntainties is then devised.

  abstract = {Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have been massively integrated into the modern electric power system in the past few decades due to the environmental and sustainability concerns throughout the world. As a result, the power electronic converters are anticipated to acquire a steadily increasing role as they are the key element for the interface between RES and the grid. However, owing to the intermittency of the RES and the distinguished features of the Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). The main focus of this thesis is to develop optimal system operation strategies to maintain the security and stability of the grid while considering the fast and accurate control of the IBR units. To achieve this, we investigate challenges in different areas. Regarding system frequency and low inertia issues, the main challenges are the incorporation of differential equation-based frequency dynamics into algebraic equation-based optimization problem as well as the optimal utilization of the frequency support from different sources. We first target on the optimal system scheduling on a transmission system level to achieve system operation cost minimization while maintaining the frequency security.  In addition, the frequency stability problem in microgrids after unintentional islanding events is also studied. We consider the frequency support from WTs, PV and storage systems as well as noncritical load shedding to ensure the microgrid frequency security after unintentional islanding events. Furthermore, a SCC-constrained Unit Commitment (UC) model is developed, maintaining a minimum SCC level at different locations in the system such that enough reactive current could be supplied during the fault to trigger the protection devices and maintain the post-fault voltages. Moreover, the static voltage stability in systems with high IBR penetration is also investigated considering the interactions among the IBR units and their reactive power support capability within rating limits.Open Acces},

  abstract = {A central challenge of video prediction lies where the system has to reason the objects' future motions from image frames while simultaneously maintaining the consistency of their appearances across frames. This work introduces an end-to-end trainable two-stream video prediction framework, Motion-Matrix-based Video Prediction (MMVP), to tackle this challenge. Unlike previous methods that usually handle motion prediction and appearance maintenance within the same set of modules, MMVP decouples motion and appearance information by constructing appearance-agnostic motion matrices. The motion matrices represent the temporal similarity of each and every pair of feature patches in the input frames, and are the sole input of the motion prediction module in MMVP. This design improves video prediction in both accuracy and efficiency, and reduces the model size. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that MMVP outperforms state-of-the-art systems on public data sets by non-negligible large margins (about 1 db in PSNR, UCF Sports) in significantly smaller model sizes (84\% the size or smaller).},

  abstract = {Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) have valuable flexibility to provide grid services. The Aggregated Feasible Active Power Region (AFAPR) is useful for aggregating DERs and reducing the computational burden in system-wide DER scheduling. However, the uncertainty of DERs calls for a reliable AFAPR. This paper proposes a novel surrogate polytope method for deriving the inner approximation of the AFAPR that is jointly reliable for all DER constraints and linear network constraints across the scheduling period. Instead of directly applying the chance constraints to the low-level DER constraints and network constraints, the proposed method applies the Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Joint Chance Constraint (WDRJCC) to the surrogate polytope approximation of the AFAPR, which is reformulated into a tractable set of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) constraints. Our derived inner approximation to the reliable AFAPR is less conservative while still being reliable, as demonstrated by comparisons with four benchmarks in extensive case studies, and with the nonlinear Z-Bus power flow simulation applied to validate the satisfaction of network constraints. The historical data size required is small, making the proposed method easier to deploy. The scale of MILP constraints is small and does not increase with the network size nor with the number of DERs.},

  abstract = {The increasing coupling between natural gas and electricity systems by gas-fired generation units brings new challenges to system analysis, such as pressure variations due to consumption perturbations of generation units. The emerging issues require revolutionary modeling and analysis techniques. This paper proposes a novel model to quantify gas pressure variations due to gas-fired power unit ramping and the impact of constraints from natural gas pressure change on ramp rates of gas-fired plants. By utilizing Laplace transform to resolve the governing equations of gas networks, the proposed model can significantly reduce modeling complexity and computational burden. The dynamic behaviors in time scale in s-domain and spatial partial differential equations are transformed into finite difference equations. By introducing the concept of transfer matrices, the relation between states at each node of gas systems can be expressed by transfer parameter matrices. Additionally, a simplified model is introduced to simply the analysis. The explicit expressions of nodal pressure variations in response to demand change are very convenient for analyzing system dynamic performance under disturbances, identifying the most influential factors. The new models are extensively demonstrated on three natural gas networks and benchmarked with traditional simulation approaches. Results illustrate that they produce very close results with the simulation approach, particularly when gas pipelines are long and enter steady states.},

  abstract = {As an innovative paradigm for electric power systems with a high penetration of distributed energy resources, peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading enables direct energy trading between end customers, which is able to facilitate local power and energy balance and potentially support the operation of bulk power systems. In this paper, a framework was proposed to enable ancillary service provision from a P2P energy trading community, creating additional value for both customers in the community and power systems. Specifically, an ancillary service provision mechanism was designed along with P2P energy trading and residual balancing mechanisms to enable the power utility to obtain ancillary service from customers in a P2P energy trading community. Furthermore, the optimal bidding strategy of customers was figured out to maximize their benefits in the proposed mechanisms. Simulation studies were conducted based on a residential community in Great Britain. The results show that the proposed ancillary service mechanism can enable the power utility to obtain a significant or required amount of ancillary services of different types. The proposed mechanisms and optimal bidding strategy can achieve Pareto improvement for the revenue of each customer and result in significantly higher social welfare for the whole community. It is also revealed that increasing ancillary service prices and installation rate of electric vehicles can increase the total amount of ancillary service provision and thus bring higher revenue for the customers in the community. By contrast, increasing installation of PV systems does not necessarily increase the amount of service provision.},

In order to fully utilize the flexibility potential of the CCHP system, this paper divides the system with the energy supply process in an analytical viewpoint of flexibility and proposes a novel operational strategy of following system flexibility to schedule energy dispatch. An indicator called flexibility index is proposed and employed to evaluate the flexibility of CCHP system, which comprehensively reflects system design and operational performance. The flexibility index assesses the contribution of energy storage devices in reducing the underutilized fuel consumption and decreasing grid dependence. A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to improve the economic performance and flexibility of the CCHP system. The results in a case study demonstrate the proposed strategy can use flexibility components to cover 93.75\% and 99.31\% of load scenarios in cooling and heating seasons, respectively. Compared with traditional strategies of following electric load and following thermal load, the proposed method reduces the dependence on the electric grid by 98.04\% and 99.61\%, respectively, and declines the underused fuel consumption by 79.79\% and 84.05\%, respectively. The carbon emissions because of the efficient energy management are reduced by 8.30\% and 21.30\%, respectively.},

In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

  abstract = {The Chinese government has set long-term carbon neutrality and renewable energy (RE) development goals for the power sector. Despite a precipitous decline in the costs of RE technologies, the external costs of renewable intermittency and the massive investments in new RE capacities would increase electricity costs. Here, we develop a power system expansion model to comprehensively evaluate changes in the electricity supply costs over a 30-year transition to carbon neutrality. RE supply curves, operating security constraints, and the characteristics of various generation units are modelled in detail to assess the cost variations accurately. According to our results, approximately 5.8\,TW of wind and solar photovoltaic capacity would be required to achieve carbon neutrality in the power system by 2050. The electricity supply costs would increase by 9.6 CNY¢/kWh. The major cost shift would result from the substantial investments in RE capacities, flexible generation resources, and network expansion.},

  abstract = {Commitments to net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) or greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets now cover 88\% of countries' emissions. Underlying the accounting behind net-zero frameworks is the assumption that emissions can be balanced with removals such that their net climate effect is zero. However, when considering the full climate impacts of CO2 emissions and removals, there are reasons to expect that the two are not equivalent in terms of their climate outcomes. We identify potential contributors to non-equivalence, including impermanence, biogeophysical and non-CO2 GHG effects, and argue that these non-equivalencies need to be accounted for to achieve climate goals. Given key uncertainties about the full climate impact of CO2 removal, it is prudent to prioritize emission reductions over removals.},

The OPF architecture is designed to be extensible, making it easy to add user-defined variables, costs, and constraints to the standard OPF problem. This paper presents the details of the network modeling and problem formulations used by MATPOWER, including its extensible OPF architecture. This structure is used internally to implement several extensions to the standard OPF problem, including piece-wise linear cost functions, dispatchable loads, generator capability curves, and branch angle difference limits. Simulation results are presented for a number of test cases comparing the performance of several available OPF solvers and demonstrating MATPOWER's ability to solve large-scale AC and DC OPF problems.},

  abstract = {The extensive installation of gas-fired power plants in many parts of the world has led electric systems to depend heavily on reliable gas supplies. The use of gas-fired generators for peak load and reserve provision causes high intraday variability in withdrawals from high-pressure gas transmission systems. Such variability can lead to gas price fluctuations and supply disruptions that affect electric generator dispatch, electricity prices, and threaten the security of power systems and gas pipelines. These infrastructures function on vastly different spatio-temporal scales, which prevents current practices for separate operations and market clearing from being coordinated. In this paper, we apply new techniques for control of dynamic gas flows on pipeline networks to examine day-ahead scheduling of electric generator dispatch and gas compressor operation for different levels of integration, spanning from separate forecasting, and simulation to combined optimal control. We formulate multiple coordination scenarios and develop tractable physically accurate computational implementations. These scenarios are compared using an integrated model of test networks for power and gas systems with 24 nodes and 24 pipes, respectively, which are coupled through gas-fired generators. The analysis quantifies the economic efficiency and security benefits of gas-electric coordination and dynamic gas system operation.},
