  abstract = {Adaptive robust optimization (ARO) is a well-known technique to deal with the parameter uncertainty in optimization problems. While the ARO framework can actually be borrowed to solve some special problems without uncertain parameters, such as the power flexibility aggregation problem studied in this paper. To effectively harness the significant flexibility from massive distributed energy resources (DERs), power flexibility aggregation is performed for a distribution system to compute the feasible region of the exchanged power at the substation over time. Based on two-stage ARO, this paper proposes a novel method to aggregate system-level multi-period power flexibility, considering heterogeneous DER facilities, network operational constraints, and an unbalanced power flow model. This method is applicable to aggregate only the active (or reactive) power, and the joint active-reactive power domain. Accordingly, two power aggregation models with two-stage optimization are developed: one focuses on aggregating active power and computes its optimal feasible intervals over multiple periods, and the other solves the optimal elliptical feasible regions for the aggregate active-reactive power. By leveraging the ARO technique, the disaggregation feasibility of the obtained feasible regions is guaranteed with optimality. Numerical simulations on a real-world distribution feeder with 126 multi-phase nodes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

To exploit this flexibility and to use the capacity potential of aggregate DERs, feasible substation power injection trajectories need to be efficiently characterized. This paper provides an ellipsoidal inner approximation of the set of feasible power injection trajectories at the substation such that for any point in the set, there exists a feasible disaggregation strategy of DERs for any load uncertainty realization. The problem is formulated as one of finding the robust maximum volume ellipsoid inside the flexibility region under uncertainty. Though the problem is NP-hard even in the deterministic case, this paper derives novel approximations of the resulting adaptive robust optimization problem based on optimal second-stage policies. The proposed approach yields less conservative flexibility characterization than existing flexibility region approximation formulations. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated on a realistic distribution feeder.},

To capture the capability of renewable energy integration more accurately on a short timescale, this paper proposes a security region evaluation method obtaining every feasible point rather than the only maximum output point of renewable generators. This evaluation method is based on multi-parametric programming considering network operational constraints, including N-1 security constraints and variable limits. In the obtained security region, each feasible point can map the values of the objective function and optimal variables of the OPF model, which is beneficial for the real-time dispatch. Furthermore, the flexible spaces including the deep peak regulation of generators and the emergency transmission rates of lines are considered to extend the security region of renewable energy integration. The security regions of renewable generator outputs and the transmission power of tie lines, which reflect the range of renewable energy self-accommodation and outside-accommodation, are quantified considering these flexible spaces. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.},

  abstract = {In power industries, it is a common practice to use an equivalent model of the external power network in an optimization model of the internal power network in order to protect data privacy. However, existing equivalent models cannot accurately consider the operational constraints of an external power network. In this paper, a unified equivalent model is proposed to precisely capture the transfer capacity region of tie lines. The operational constraints of the external power network are preserved via multi-parametric programming. The operational costs of the external power network are formulated as an explicit function of power transmission on tie lines. This unified equivalent model can consider both AC and DC tie lines. The intuitive difference between the transfer capacity of AC and DC tie lines is revealed from a new perspective. On this basis, a market model for the internal power network with the equivalence of the operational constraints for the external power network is presented. Two typical trading modes are considered: the bulk sale mode and the direct power purchase mode. The exact convex relaxation formulation of the market model is derived under the direct power purchase mode.},

  abstract = {Tie-line power exchanges among regional power systems facilitate renewable accommodations. Power exchanges can be calculated based on a tie-line security region that provides the feasible region of coupling parameters. However, a tie-line security region is a high-dimension polytope due to multiple time periods and border buses in power system operations, generally leading to a heavy computational burden. A fast calculation for high-dimension tie-line security regions is studied in this paper. The high-dimension polytope across all the time periods is decomposed as a Cartesian production of lower-dimension polytopes at each time period by leveraging dispatch levels of generations. For each lower-dimension polytope, the computational burden brought by multiple border buses is alleviated by aggregating tie-line power. Minimum renewable curtailments are preserved in the tie-line security region by adding an additional dimension, providing the information for renewable accommodations based on the tie-line security region. For coupling parameters within our tie-line security region, a feasible decision of the regional power system always exists. Finally, a decentralized and non-iterative framework is demonstrated to utilize our tie-line security region for renewable accommodations in an interconnected power system. The effectiveness of our methods is corroborated in the IEEE 9-bus system, a 661-bus utility system, and a five-region system.},

  abstract = {The identification of a tie-line power transmission region is crucial for the secure operation of interconnected power grids. The characterization of a tie-line power transmission region with regional operational constraints is inherently a multi-parametric programming problem, which greatly suffers from a heavy computational burden. In this paper, we propose a fast boundary search approach to efficiently characterize the tie-line power transmission region in AC/DC hybrid grids. The multi-parametric programming method is improved in the following three aspects: (1) the search direction is fixed along the boundary of a region, which avoids the search inside a region; (2) the abundant search of subregions that share a boundary facet is avoided; and (3) a fast guess of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is presented, which reduces the number of optimization calculations. Furthermore, an expansion strategy is presented to enlarge the tie-line power transmission region via quantifying the impact of system parameters on the transmission region. Simulations based on the IEEE 118-bus test system and a 661-bus utility system show that (1) the proposed method can be over 30 times faster than existing methods and (2) the proposed method successfully expands the tie-line power transmission region by identifying the key parameters.},

  abstract = {A tie-line security region provides all possible tie-line power injections with which constraints in a regional network will not be violated. With the high penetration of renewables, a sharp increase or decrease of renewable power requires a good depiction of the tie-line security region considering time coupling. However, the tie-line power security region with time coupling is a high-dimension polytope, which leads to a considerable computational burden. This paper presents a fast algorithm to approximate the original high-dimension tie-line security region considering time coupling. A few lower-dimension polytopes associated with combinations of different periods are calculated for the approximation. An evaluation method with clear physical explanations is established to measure the accuracy of the approximation. The method converts the evaluation to two linear programming problems based on the mathematical relationship between optimal points and polytope vertices. Under a Monte Carlo framework, the statistical analysis is employed to measure the accuracy using five presented indices. The performance of the proposed method is verified by the case studies on the IEEE 118-bus test system and a 661-bus utility system.},

  abstract = {Inter-regional power trading plays a crucial role in optimal resource utilization. However, intra-regional operation constraints are currently not well considered in practical implementation, which may lead to internal congestions and economic loss. In this paper, a non-iterative tie-line scheduling framework taking account of both intra- and inter-regional network constraints is proposed. Based on projection theory, admissible set of tie-line injections (ASTI) is defined as the allowable range of tie-line power injections that can be met by a regional system. Then, the ASTI is implemented in tie-line scheduling to ensure the feasibility of the tie-line schedule result for each region. Requirements for practical algorithms that calculate the ASTI in power system applications are analyzed, and a novel vertex-oriented projection algorithm is proposed to efficiently calculate the ASTI. Case studies based on several IEEE and Polish test systems verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed projection algorithm. Simulations based on a four-region system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tie-line scheduling framework.},

In this paper, we formulate the flexibility evaluation problem as a chance constrained optimization model incorporated the randomness of renewables. To make it tractable, the evaluated flexibility is represented by the combination of a virtual generator and a virtual battery which is decomposed by a robust optimization algorithm. Then, a novel high-dimensional polytope based bound shrinking method is proposed to estimate the parameters of the virtual generator and virtual battery. The numerical test results show the proposed method obtain much more precise results with lower conservativeness than those of existing methods. The disaggregation feasibility of the evaluation results is also verified.},

  abstract = {The aggregation of distributed energy resources (DERs) draws much attention since their penetration increases continuously. We derive the mathematical formulation of the exact aggregate feasible region (AFR) of multiple DERs. The derivation is based on analyzing the redundancy of all possible constraints in the Fourier-Motzkin Elimination (FME) process. In the exact AFR model, the number of constraints is regardless of the number of DERs but exponential with the number of time intervals. Although the computational complexity of the exact AFR is dramatically simplified compared with the original FME, there are still too many constraints for the exact AFR model to be applied in practice. Hence, we propose the k th-order approximate models and two types of multi-timescale approximate models. Illustrative cases show the necessity of each constraint in the proposed models compared with the aggregated power and energy boundary model. Numerical simulations verify the accuracy of the exact AFR model. Besides, the second-order approximate model performs best considering the balance between accuracy, economics, and computational complexity.},
