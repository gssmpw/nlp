In light of the established similarities between MSIP and Lloyd's algorithm, this work opens the door to further theoretical developments for MMD minimization which bypass mean-field analysis. In particular, \Cref{thm:gradient_opt_mmd} suggests that the extensive theory developed for Lloydâ€™s algorithm may be leveraged for MSIP. For instance, a natural question is whether this analogy extends further through an analysis of the non-degeneracy of the map $\bm{\Psi}_{\MMS}$ \cite{EmJuRa08}, which would allow us to prove that MSIP converges to critical points of the $\MMD$. In this regard, a promising direction would be to study the monotonicity of the MMD for the iterates of MSIP, where \Cref{thm:gradient_opt_mmd} might be useful. For this, the rich literature on quasi-Newton methods could further our understanding of MSIP and WFR \cite{NoWr99}. Proving a descent property for MSIP would involve studying technical properties of the method, including analyzing second order properties of the function $F_M$ as was done for Lloyd's map~\cite{DuFaGu99}. 
Beyond convergence guarantees, an interesting direction for future research is to explore the impact of this approach on the understanding of neural network training, as studied in \cite{ArKoSaGr19,RoJeBrVa19}, and on sparse measure reconstructions \cite{DeGa12,Chi22,BeGr24}. Generally, our methods show promising results for mode-seeking using interacting particle systems, which we hope will better tackle general non-convex high-dimensional approximation problems.
