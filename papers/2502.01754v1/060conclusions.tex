In this work, we have introduced a causal model of coupled autoregressive generation that enables the evaluation and comparison of different LLMs under the same source of randomness.

%We have shown theoretically that coupled autoregressive generation can lead to sample size savings in evaluating the comparitive performance of LLMs using benchmark datasets.
In several canonical settings, we have shown that, in evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation can provably reduce the number of samples required to reliably compare the performance of LLMs and, in evaluations based on pairwise comparisons, it can provably lead to different and, perhaps more intuitive, rankings of LLMs in comparison with independent autoregressive generation.

Lastly, we have empirically demonstrated that our theoretical results generalize to several state of the art LLMs and datasets commonly used for the evaluation and ranking of LLMs.
