\begin{abstract}
    Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs) are designed to assess students' cognitive states by analyzing their performance across a series of exercises. However, existing CDMs often struggle with diagnosing infrequent students and exercises due to a lack of rich prior knowledge. 
    With the advancement in large language models (LLMs), which possess extensive domain knowledge, their integration into cognitive diagnosis presents a promising opportunity.
    Despite this potential, integrating LLMs with CDMs poses significant challenges. LLMs are not well-suited for capturing the fine-grained collaborative interactions between students and exercises, and the disparity between the semantic space of LLMs and the behavioral space of CDMs hinders effective integration.
    To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{K}nowledge-enhanced \textbf{C}ognitive \textbf{D}iagnosis (KCD) framework, which is a model-agnostic framework utilizing LLMs to enhance CDMs and compatible with various CDM architectures. The KCD framework operates in two stages: LLM Diagnosis and Cognitive Level Alignment. In the LLM Diagnosis stage, both students and exercises are diagnosed to achieve comprehensive and detailed modeling. In the Cognitive Level Alignment stage, we bridge the gap between the CDMs' behavioral space and the LLMs' semantic space using contrastive learning and mask-reconstruction approaches.
    Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose a model-agnostic framework KCD that can efficiently employ LLMs to enhance the knowledge of conventional CDMs.
By utilizing LLM diagnosis and cognitive level alignment, the framework can leverage the rich knowledge of LLMs and align the semantic space of LLMs and the behavioral space of CDMs to achieve optimal diagnostic results.
Several experiments on four real-world datasets for cognitive diagnosis demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, surpassing all the baseline CDMs.
%Future work mainly focuses on other effective approaches to integrate LLMs and CDMs to provide accurate, explainable diagnoses which are also easier for downstream applications to utilize.
