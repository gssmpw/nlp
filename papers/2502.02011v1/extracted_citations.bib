abstract = {Abstract In recent work, Nanite has demonstrated how to rasterize virtualized micro-poly geometry in real time, thus enabling immense geometric complexity. We present a system that employs similar methods for real-time ray tracing of micro-poly geometry. The geometry is preprocessed in almost the same fashion: Nearby triangles are clustered together and clusters get merged and simplified to obtain hierarchical level of detail (LOD). Then these clusters are compressed and stored in a GPU-friendly data structure. At run time, Nanite selects relevant clusters, decompresses them and immediately rasterizes them. Instead of rasterization, we decompress each selected cluster into a small bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) in the format expected by the ray tracing hardware. Then we build a complete BVH on top of the bounding volumes of these clusters and use it for ray tracing. Our BVH build reaches more than 74\% of the attainable peak memory bandwidth and thus it can be done per frame. Since LOD selection happens per frame at the granularity of clusters, all triangles cover a small area in screen space.},

abstract = {Abstract Silhouette is a key feature that distinguishes displacement mapping from normal mapping. However the silhouette rendering in the GPU implementation of displacement mapping (which is often called inversed displacement mapping) is tricky. Previous approaches rely mostly on construction of additional extruding prism-like geometry, which slows down the rendering significantly. In this paper, we proposed a method for solving the silhouette rendering problem in inverse displace mapping without using any extruding prism-like geometry. At each step of intersection finding, we continuously bends the viewing ray according to the current local tangent space associated with the surface. Thus, it allows mapping a displacement map onto an arbitrary curved surface with more accurate silhouette. While our method is simple, it offers surprisingly good results over Curved Relief Map (CRM) [OP05] in many difficult or degenerated cases.},

abstract = {We introduce an adaptive level-of-detail technique for ray tracing triangle meshes that aims to reduce the memory bandwidth used during ray traversal, which can be the bottleneck for rendering time with large scenes and the primary consumer of energy. We propose a specific data structure for hierarchically representing triangle meshes, allowing localized decisions for the desired mesh resolution per ray. Starting with the lowest-resolution triangle mesh level, higher-resolution levels are generated by tessellating each triangle into four via splitting its edges with arbitrarily-placed vertices. We fit the resulting mesh hierarchy into a specialized acceleration structure to perform on-the-fly tessellation level selection during ray traversal. Our structure reduces both storage cost and data movement during rendering, which are the main consumers of energy. It also allows continuous transitions between detail levels, while locally adjusting the mesh resolution per ray and preserving watertightness. We present how this structure can be used with both primary and secondary rays for reflections and shadows, which can intersect with different tessellation levels, providing consistent results. We also propose specific hardware units to cover the cost of additional compute needed for level-of-detail operations. We evaluate our method using a cycle-accurate simulation of a custom ray tracing hardware architecture. Our results show that, as compared to traditional bounding volume hierarchies, our method can provide more than an order of magnitude reduction in energy use and render time, given sufficient computational resources.},

In the context of hardware tessellation supported by GPUs, this paper aims at feature-preserving surface reconstruction, and proposes the generation of a displacement map that displaces more vertices towards the higher-frequency feature parts of the target mesh. In order to generate the feature-preserving displacement map, surface features of the target mesh are estimated, and then the target mesh is parametrized and sampled using the features. At run time, the base surface is semi-uniformly tessellated by hardware, and then the vertices of the tessellated mesh are displaced non-uniformly along the 3-D vectors stored in the displacement map. The experimental results show that the surfaces reconstructed by the proposed method are of a higher quality than those reconstructed by other methods.},

The parameters used to evaluate the base surface are precomputed such that scalar displacement from the evaluated points reaches the features of the original surface. The parameters are stored in the displacement map together with the displacement scalars. The run-time algorithm uses the hardware tessellation capability of GPU and reconstructs the high-frequency surface.

Ray tracing algorithms employing interval arithmetic (IA) or affine arithmetic (AA) for root-funding are robust and general in the class of surfaces they support, but traditionally slow. Nonetheless, implemented efficiently using a stack-driven iterative algorithm and SIMD vector instructions, these methods can achieve interactive performance for common algebraic surfaces on the CPU. A similar algorithm can also be implemented stacklessly, allowing for efficient ray tracing on the GPU. This paper presents these algorithms, as well as an inclusion-preserving reduced affine arithmetic (RAA) for faster ray-surface intersection. Shader metaprogramming allows for immediate and automatic generation of symbolic expressions and their interval or affine extensions. Moreover, we are able to render even complex forms robustly, in real-time at high resolution.},

This generalizes classical parallax mapping, but is trained without supervision by any explicit heightfield.

The materials have small storage (on the order of standard mipmapping except with more texture channels), and can be integrated within common Monte-Carlo path tracing systems.

We present a simple, automatic scheme for converting detailed geometric models into such a representation. The challenge in this conversion process is to find a simple subdivision surface that still faithfully expresses the detailed model as its offset. We demonstrate that displaced subdivision surfaces offer a number of benefits, including geometry compression, editing, animation, scalability, and adaptive rendering.

We provide a comprehensive solution to these problems by introducing a smooth analytic displacement function. Coefficients are stored in a GPU-friendly tile-based texture format, and a multiresolution mip hierarchy of this function is formed. We propose a novel level-of-detail scheme by computing per-vertex adaptive tessellation factors and select the appropriate prefiltered mip levels of the displacement function. Our method obviates the need for a precomputed normal map since normals are directly derived from the displacements. Thus, we are able to perform authoring and rendering simultaneously without typical displacement map extraction from a dense triangle mesh. This not only is more flexible than the traditional combination of discrete displacements and normal maps, but also provides faster runtime due to reduced memory I/O.},

As a result of recent advances in graphics hardware, in particular the GPU tessellation unit, complex geometry can now be generated on the fly within the GPU's rendering pipeline. This has enabled the generation and displacement of smooth parametric surfaces in real-time applications. However, many well-established approaches in offline rendering are not directly transferable due to the limited tessellation patterns or the parallel execution model of the tessellation stage. In this survey, we provide an overview of recent work and challenges in this topic by summarizing, discussing, and comparing methods for the rendering of smooth and highly detailed surfaces in real time.},

This paper introduces a new efficient approach to perform acceleration structure traversal and intersection tests against microtriangles entirely in texture space by formulating nonlinear rays as degree-2 rational functions.

The resulting texture is then mapped onto the polygon using standard texture mapping. The 1-D warping functions work in texture coordinates to handle the parallax and visibility changes that result from the 3-D shape of the displacement surface.

Displacement mapping is an important technique for adding detail to surface geometry in rendering systems. It allows complex geometric variation to be added to simpler geometry, without the cost in geometric complexity of completely describing the nuances of the geometry at modeling time and with the advantage that the detail can be added adaptively at rendering time.",

abstract = {A shell map is a bijective mapping between shell space and texture space that can be used to generate small-scale features on surfaces using a variety of modeling techniques. The method is based upon the generation of an offset surface and the construction of a tetrahedral mesh that fills the space between the base surface and its offset. By identifying a corresponding tetrahedral mesh in texture space, the shell map can be implemented through a straightforward barycentric-coordinate map between corresponding tetrahedra. The generality of shell maps allows texture space to contain geometric objects, procedural volume textures, scalar fields, or other shell-mapped objects.},

abstract = {This work introduces a new technique for real-time rendering of arbitrary volumetric geometry into a polygonal mesh's shell space. The shell space is a layer of variable thickness on top or below the polygonal mesh. The technique computes view ray shell geometry intersections in a pixel shader. In addition to arbitrary volumetric shell geometry, represented as volume textures, it can handle also the less general case of height-field shell geometry. To minimize the number of ray tracing steps, a 3D distance map is used for skipping empty space in the shell volume. The shell volume is defined by a pre-computed tetrahedra mesh. The tetrahedra subdivide prisms extruded from the polygonal base mesh. A vertex shader computes tetrahedron face plane distances for generating the per-pixel tetrahedron thickness using non-linear interpolation. The technique includes local lighting and overcomes shortcomings of previous shell space rendering approaches such as high storage requirements and involved per-vertex computations [Wang et al. 2004] or low shell geometry depth complexity and mapping distortions [Policarpo and Oliveira 2006]. Additionally, rendering artifacts for shallow view angles common to many related techniques are reduced. Furthermore, methods for generating a geometry volume texture and the corresponding distance map from a polygonal mesh are presented.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we introduce a new subdivision operator that unifies triangular and quadrilateral subdivision schemes. Designers often want the added flexibility of having both quads and triangles in their models. It is also well known that triangle meshes generate poor limit surfaces when using a quad scheme, while quad-only meshes behave poorly with triangular schemes. Our new scheme is a generalization of the well known Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision algorithms. We show that our surfaces are C 1 everywhere and provide a proof that it is impossible to construct such a C 2 scheme at the quad/triangle boundary. However, we provide rules that produce surfaces with bounded curvature at the regular quad/triangle boundary and provide optimal masks that minimize the curvature divergence elsewhere. We demonstrate the visual quality of our surfaces with several examples. ACM CSS: I.3.5 Computer Graphics—Curve, surface, solid, and object representations},

abstract = {High-performance ray tracing of triangle meshes equipped with displacement maps is a challenging task. Existing methods either rely on pre-tessellation, taking full advantage of the hardware but with a poor memory/quality tradeoff, or use custom displacement-centric acceleration structures, preserving all the geometric details but being orders of magnitude slower. We introduce a method that efficiently probes the displacement-map space to find ray-surface intersections without relying on pre-tessellation. Our method combines inverse displacement mapping and on-the-fly surface-bound computation. It employs a novel data structure that provides tight displacement bounds over rectangular regions in the displacement-map space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a production GPU path tracer. It can achieve over an order of magnitude speed-up in render time compared to state of the art in the most challenging real-time path-tracing scenarios, while maintaining a low memory footprint.},

Unlike traditional displacement mapping, VDM allows for efficient rendering of self-shadows, occlusions and silhouettes without increasing the complexity of the underlying surface mesh. VDM is based on per-pixel processing, and with hardware acceleration it can render mesostructure with rich visual appearance in real time.},
