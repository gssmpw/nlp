\section{Related Work}
\textit{Parallax mapping} renders depth details by offsetting texture samples based on parallax (shifted occlusion) ____. \textit{Parallax occlusion mapping} iteratively samples the height field to ensure correct depth while also supporting occlusion shadows ____. \textit{Prism parallax occlusion} mapping enhances this with correct silhouettes by intersecting view rays with extruded prisms split into three tetrahedra ____. \textit{Relief maps} encode the displaced surface as a color texture with an additional depth channel. The original method was an image-warping technique  ____, whereas later methods traverse the relief map to cover arbitrary base meshes ____. Quadric surfaces may also be covered by relief maps by using ray-quadric intersection before relief stepping ____. Intended for raster pipelines, parallax and relief mapping do not utilize BVHs or support general ray tracing. 

\textit{Cone step mapping} accelerates the intersection search by precomputing a cone map to skip features based on occlusion angle  ________, employing binary search ____, or using a min-max texture ____. However, anti-aliasing cone maps introduces overhead since they cannot be hardware interpolated. These methods are view-dependent, making them unsuitable for ray tracing arbitrary base meshes. 

\textit{Curved rays} map the 3D volume of the displaced surface to nonlinear texture space ____. Tangent-space methods compute the curved mapping between world and depth texture space at each sample, approximating curved rays with piecewise segments ____. We avoid this transform per sample by designing a parallel offset prism with a linear projection to texture space. ____ develops nonlinear rays by solving cubic equations that map world rays into canonical prism volumes. In their work, multiple data structures are provided for acceleration: BVHs for broad phase, and min-max mipmaps for local displacement or BVHs for instanced meso-geometry. Rays are transformed at the leaf nodes (prisms) of the broad-phase BVH, where they become nonlinear in rectified canonical space (see Fig. \ref{fig:prisms}, top right). Although optimizations are mentioned, the pre-computation of data structures and solving cubic equations preclude our goals for interactive editing.

\textit{Parametric surfaces} may be exactly evaluated through root-finding with Newton’s method, whereas complex surfaces must be divided into multiple intervals ________. To guarantee convergence, the intervals must be chosen to locally bound the surface at minima and maxima. ____ construct a tree structure to efficiently traverse the surface. Caching surface trees enables fast parallel ray tracing of parametric surfaces by sharing information with neighboring rays ____. 

\textit{Affine intervals} have been shown to provide better local bounds than min-max intervals ____. ____ construct a D-BVH as a min-max mipmap over affine intervals of the base geometry. Displaced bounds are generated dynamically from quad-tree nodes, requiring significant computation for intersection. Recent work improves performance with a hierarchical data structure, RMIP, over the displacement map using a bidirectional mapping between 2D depth texture and 3D object space  ____. Rectangular regions in RMIP allow for acceleration of anisotropic ray sampling. Since D-BVH and RMIP can be costly during traversal, we explore a direct sampling approach for quality and performance during editing. 
 
\textit{Shell mapping} constructs a bijective map between texture space and shell space - the region between two offset surfaces - where meso-geometry will be rendered locally ____. Rays are traced in shell space and transformed back to world space, mapping a 3D volume onto a surface. Real-time rendering is achieved by ____ utilizing a distance map to accelerate ray tracing within the shell space of the primary object and a volumetric texture to encode the meso-geometry. Both techniques precompute the shell space prism as three tetrahedra.  \textit{Curved shell mapping} removes discontinuities by modeling Coons patches within each prism at the cost of solving a cubic equation per ray step ____.

A different approach to meso-geometry finds ways to precompute intersections through suitable encodings. One such encoding uses singular value decomposition ____, while others use neural networks to evaluate intersections ____. Their work handles meso-geometries yet encoding requires considerable pre-processing that we avoid in favor of interactive performance and editability.

\textit{Tessellation} is an intuitive approach to displacement mapping, generating additional geometry for detail as needed  ____. ____ accelerate fully tessellated surfaces with uniform spatial grids. Full tessellation is memory-intensive, thus research shifted to localized, micro-tessellation techniques, such as geometry caching of sub-triangles ____. \textit{Adaptive hardware tessellation} was introduced as a shader pipeline stage with DirectX 11 ____  enabling real-time adaptive displacement and higher-order surfaces ____.  The tessellation stage can be used to adaptively render displacement-mapped surfaces ________. However, direct hardware tessellation is generally poorly suited to ray tracing since non-view facing reflections and refractions are not easily handled.

\textit{Higher order surfaces} are a commonly tessellated, including Bézier patches  ____________, Catmull-Clark surfaces ____, Gregory patches ____, and Loop subdivision surfaces ____________. These surfaces provide smoothness guarantees with $C^1$ or $C^2$ continuity. We introduce a novel adjustment to the displaced shading normal that achieves visual continuity when ray tracing arbitrary base meshes without an intermediate $C^1$ surface.

\textit{Locally adaptive tessellation} is a recent trend whereby GPU tessellation is applied to increase detail locally on arbitrary base meshes. Nanite introduced virtual geometry to compress source geometry into small triangle clusters which are loaded and rendered as dynamic, regional levels of detail (LOD) on-the-fly ____. To support ray tracing, ____ insert triangle clusters into a dynamic, GPU-accelerated BVH per frame. These methods depend on a high-resolution source mesh which is preprocessed through clustering and decimation of triangle groups.  ____ introduces locally adaptive ray tracing which does not split the mesh but instead refines each triangle through an explicit one-to-four triangle subdivision. Pre-computed acceleration is achieved by inserting each division into a custom tessellation tree, which can be used to select per-triangle LODs on-the-fly.

Micro-Meshes ____ is an API for rendering highly detailed objects as locally adaptive subdivided triangles with data compression via barycentric maps. This eliminates the need for UV mapping since sampling is implicit. Primarily  intended to compress detailed base models, displacement mapping is supported by remapping from a depth texture to the barycentric map. Although this precludes interactive editing we examine Micro-Meshes in terms of rendering quality compared to our approach. 

Modern techniques for locally adaptive tessellation can give good rendering performance over highly detailed source meshes, yet this is often at the cost of complex data structures utilizing the most recent GPU hardware.
