\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:con}
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of software security within SDN, drawing upon an SLR encompassing 58 key publications. We introduce a taxonomy to classify existing research based on its focus (functional vs. non-functional security objectives) and methodological approaches.

Discussion about our findings highlights the pressing need for standardized benchmarks to enable the quantitative assessment and advancement of SDN software security. Beyond summarizing existing research, we identify and delve into emerging challenges in this domain while proposing innovative research directions. By proactively addressing these challenges and pursuing these new avenues of investigation, we can significantly enhance the software security posture of SDN, mitigating vulnerabilities and strengthening its resilience against software bugs. This, in turn, will foster greater trust and reliability in SDN as a critical networking paradigm.
