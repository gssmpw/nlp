\section{Threats To Validity}\label{sec:ttv}
Our SLR aims to be comprehensive, but some limitations should be acknowledged. While we searched popular repositories (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Springer, and ScienceDirect) and employed both backward and forward snowballing techniques on recent publications, the possibility of unintentional inclusion or exclusion of relevant studies remains. The authors carefully evaluated publications that fell on the borderline of inclusion/exclusion criteria to mitigate this risk.

Furthermore, our SLR focused exclusively on peer-reviewed journal articles and conference publications published in English. This decision was made to streamline the review process and ensure a high standard of research quality. However, it is important to acknowledge that relevant information may exist in other sources, such as books, theses, and non-English publications, which were not included in this review.

In addition, we deliberately excluded publications that primarily addressed network security, architecture, or systems that utilized SDN as a component. We aimed to maintain a focused review on the software security aspects of SDN itself. This means that studies analyzing SDN's role in broader contexts, such as cloud security or Internet of Things (IoT) networks, were not included. While this approach ensured a clear research focus, it may have overlooked valuable insights on the broader implications of SDN software security.

Overall, while we believe our SLR provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on SDN software security, readers should be aware of these limitations when interpreting our findings.
