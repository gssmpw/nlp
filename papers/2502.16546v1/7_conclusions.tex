\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
We conducted a case study to understand the process employed by Mozilla Firefox developers to solve software issues. By implementing a multi-coder open-coding methodology, we qualitatively analyzed the issue report comments, identified six issue resolution stages, and derived an overall process model. We found 47 issue resolution patterns, which are instances of the process and represent how Firefox developers resolve issues in practice. This process is iterative and deviates widely from the theoretical linear process from the literature.
