\textbf{Firefox's Issue Resolution in Practice.} 
Our study highlights the iterative and diverse nature of Firefox's issue resolution process, which widely deviates from the theoretical linear models often assumed in the literature (\eg Rajlich's incremental change process~\cite{rajlich2011software}). Instead of following a straightforward path, developers address various types of issues by moving back and forth through multiple stages as needed. This reflects the iterative and incremental approach characteristic of modern software development, aligning more closely with agile methodologies than with rigid frameworks like Waterfall~\cite{rajlich2011software}.

	\textbf{Patterns Generalizability.} 
	While the results only apply to Firefox, we conducted a small case study that annotated 20 issue reports (of different kinds)
    from two open-source projects: Chromium~\cite{chromium} and GnuCash~\cite{gnucash}. The goal was to validate if these projects follow resolution patterns similar to Firefox's.
	Details of the study methodology are found in our replication package~\cite{repl_pack}.
	
	We identified seven distinct resolution patterns for the 10 Chromium issue reports, all of which correspond to Firefox's patterns. Three patterns, \texttt{\textbf{`I,CR'}}, \texttt{\textbf{`I,CR,V'}}, and \texttt{\textbf{`SD,I,CR,V'}} appeared in two issues each, aligning with Firefox patterns \texttt{\textbf{`I,CR,I?'}}, \texttt{\textbf{`I,CR,V,I?'}}, and \texttt{\textbf{`SD,I,CR,(I$\mid$V)'}} which appeared in 64, 16, and 24 issues respectively.
	Notably, these Firefox patterns are among the top seven most recurrent patterns, which strengthens pattern generalizability (they are found in Chromium issues).
	As for GnuCash, we identified 10 resolution patterns across the 10 issues, with nine of these patterns aligning with nine of the 47 Firefox patterns. The nine Firefox patterns are fairly common as they were observed in 4 to 22 issues. The GnuCash pattern \texttt{\textbf{`(A,I)+'}} does not have any corresponding Firefox pattern.
	
	The 7 and 10 patterns identified for Chromium and GnuCash indicate that developers in these projects also employ diverse approaches to issue resolution. This suggests that some Firefox patterns may generalize across projects of varying scales and governance. However, a large-scale study with a statistically significant sample is needed to confirm these observations.
