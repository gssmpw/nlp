\label{sec:benchmarks}
To evaluate our \coam{} algorithm,
%
we consider a benchmark suite of eight circuit families that include both near-term and future fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.
%
For each family, we select circuits with different sizes by changing the number of qubits.
%
Our benchmark suite includes advanced quantum algorithm such as
%
Grover's algorithm~ for unstructured search~\cite{grover1996fast},
%
the HHL algorithm for solving linear systems of equations~\cite{harrow2009quantum},
%
Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers~\cite{shor1994algorithms},
and
%
the Binary Welded Tree (bwt) quantum walk algorithm~\cite{childs2003exponential}.
%
In addition, our benchmarks include  near-term algorithms like Variational Quantum Eigensolver (vqe)~\cite{peruzzo2014variational}
and reversible arithmetic algorithms~\cite{amy2014polynomial,Nam_2018}
such as boolean satisfaction problems (boolsat) and square-root algorithm (sqrt).


%These circuit are generated using a combination of
%PennyLane~\cite{bergholm2018pennylane}, Qiskit~\cite{qiskit-2019} and NWQBench~\cite{li2021qasmbench}.
%
%
%They also require a large numbers of gates,
%which allows us to evaluate the scalability of different optimizers.

% For each circuit family, we generate circuits of different sizes by
% appropriately changing the number of qubits.
%
% To generate the suite, we use PennyLane~\cite{bergholm2018pennylane} or Qiskit~\cite{qiskit-2019}, depending on the benchmark.
%We evaluate our optimizer on two different gate sets.
%
The benchmark suite is written in the Nam gate set~\cite{Nam_2018}, which consists of the
%The Nam gate set consists of the
% The Nam gate set contains the
Hadamard ($\mathsf{H}$),
Pauli-X ($\mathsf{X}$),
controlled-NOT ($\mathsf{CNOT}$),
and Z-rotation ($\mathsf{R_Z}$) gates~\cite{Nam_2018}.
%
%
%For the Nam gate set,
We preprocess all our benchmarks with the \quartz{} preprocessor,
%in the Nam gate set,
which merges rotation gates~\cite{quartz-2022}.
%


%
% results with \quartz{} and \queso{} could apply
% to other gate sets, including the IBM gate set,
% the Rigetti gate set, and the Ion gate set.
% %
% This is because \quartz{} and \queso{} have shown competitive performance
% for all these gate sets~\cite{quartz-2022, queso-2023},
% and their performance
% would translate to our setting because we use them for all our optimizations.

% we use the benchmark suite provided by the authors of \feyntool{}~\cite{amy2019formal}.
% These benchmarks are primarily expressed in the Clifford+T gate set,
% but also contain other gates such as the Toffoli gate (\lstinline{CCX} gate).
% %
% We also port some of the Nam benchmarks to the Clifford+T gate set using Qiskit.

% Specifically,
% when \coamwith{\quartzt{t}} calls the oracle \quartz{}
% for a circuit containing $k$ gates,
% it gives \quartz{} a timeout of $k*t$.
% %
% The timeout resets after each optimization, meaning
% that \quartzt{t} can run for any amount of time as long as it finds optimizations,
% but it stops when it has not discovered an optimization in $k*t$ time.
% %
% With this policy,
% the \quartzt{t} returns an optimal circuit,
% in the sense that calling \quartzt{t} will not find more optimizations.
