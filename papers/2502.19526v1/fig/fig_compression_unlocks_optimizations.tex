    \caption{The figure illustrates how our rewriting semantics optimizes circuits for $\Omega = 2$.
        The figure implicitly assumes an oracle that removes any two consecutive $H$ and $X$ gates.
        %
        At each step, our semantics either selects a segment of size $2$ (denoted by green boxes)
        and performs an optimization,
        or picks a gate and shifts it left.
