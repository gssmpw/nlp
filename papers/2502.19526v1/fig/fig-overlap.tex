\caption{
The figure shows a circuit in the layer representation
and defines $\Omega-$optimality.
%
$\Omega-$optimality requires that all $\Omega-$segments are optimal relative
a given oracle optimizer.
%
An $\Omega-$segment $W_i$ starts at layer $i$ and goes up layer $i + \Omega$.
%
The dashed lines are separated by $\Omega$ layers.
%
To verify $\Omega$-optimality, an algorithm must check that every $\Omega-$segment
is optimal (relative to the oracle).
%
% Confirming $\Omega$-optimality using many overlapping $2\Omega$-segments.
% Every possible $\Omega$-segment
% (for example, two such segments are highlighted in red) is entirely contained
% within at least one $2\Omega$-segment sent to the oracle.
