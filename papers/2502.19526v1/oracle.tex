Researchers have proposed many techniques for optimizing quantum circuits,


To optimize quantum circuits,
researchers have proposed substitution-based algorithms,
algorithms that substitute components of a circuit with equivalent components, reducing the size of the circuit.
%
Many such algorithms rely on a partial function
that maps circuits to equivalent circuits.
%
The algorithms apply the partial function to the original circuit by
identifying a sub circuit which is in the domain of the partial function
and substituting the sub circuit with the corresponding value of that function.
%
The partial function is applied repeatedly,
until the function is exhausted,
or a terminating condition (defined by ad-hoc heuristics) is satisfied.
%
We refer to such algorithms as \defn{substitution oracles},
and call the corresponding partial function \defn{transformer}.
%
Formally,
an oracle $\mathcal{O}$ takes a circuit $\mathsf{C}$, a transformer $\mathsf{t}$,
and returns a sub circuit $\mathsf{C}'$ such that $\mathsf{C}' = \mathcal{O}(\mathsf{t}, \mathsf{C})$.


The main problem with oracles that have been designed is
that they scale poorly with the size of the circuit.
%
Each time....


We define the \defn{width} of a transformer $\mathsf{t}$,
denoted as $\Omega(\mathsf{t})$, as
the maximum size of the circuit in the domain of the transformer.
%
We say that a transformer is $\defn{greedy}$ if it always maps a circuit to a smaller circuit.
%

Given a greedy transformer $\mathsf{t}$ and oracle $\mathcal{O}$,
we design an algorithm that makes a \emph{succinct} number of \emph{precise} calls to the oracle,
and transforms a circuit $\mathsf{C}$ to another circuit $\mathsf{C'}$ such that it is optimal w.r.t.
the oracle and the transformer, i.e, $\mathcal{O}(t, \mathsf{C'}) = \mathsf{C'}$.
%
To achieve this,
our algorithm uses the oracle on circuits of size $O(\Omega(t))$,
and only makes $O(\lvert\mathsf{C}\rvert  + k)$ calls to the oracle,
where $k$ is the number of optimizations ($\lvert\mathsf{C}\rvert - \lvert\mathsf{C'}\rvert$).
%
Crucially, the number of calls to the oracle scales linearly with the size of the circuit
and the number of optimizations.
