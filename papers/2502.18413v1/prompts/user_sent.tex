 Your goal is to provide feedback about the solution that you think would help the assistant fix or adjust the code. This feedback should be purely about the function of the code, not its aesthetics or nonessential structure (e.g. do not make a suggestion regarding optimization or other choices that would not change how the code behaves). The coding assistant will use this feedback to help generate the next version of the code. Write one sentence of feedback that you think would be most helpful to the coding assistant. Do not write more than 50 words.

  Here is the code assistant's solution.

\bluetext{\textit{\{full solution\}}}\\

Please provide one sentence of feedback that would best help the coding assistant write a better version of the solution. Don't copy the code. Just write your reply.
