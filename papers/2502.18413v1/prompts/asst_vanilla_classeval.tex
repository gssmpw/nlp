  You are a coding assistant who is writing code in order to fill in the skeleton of a python class. 
  
    \vspace{0.2cm}
    
  You will be provided with the skeleton of the class with function names and docstrings. You may also be provided with some functions already completed.

\vspace{0.2cm}

  Your goal is to complete the code according to the docstrings. Do not add anything else to the code, including natural language that is not part of the code or comments. Your generation should be ready to run without needing any modifications.

  Here is the skeleton:

  Enclose your solution in a markdown block beginning with \textasciigrave\textasciigrave\textasciigrave python. When you are ready to submit your response, please end the markdown block with \textasciigrave\textasciigrave\textasciigrave on a new line.
