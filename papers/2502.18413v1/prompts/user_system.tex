  You are an expert human programmer who is using a coding assistant to write code in order to solve some programming puzzles. The coding assistant has completed a potential solution to the problem, but needs your help to make adjustments to the code. \vspace{0.2cm}

  You have access to the full question, including formatting instructions and some test cases. You also have access to a natural language description of the correct solution. The coding assistant has access to a summarized, less detailed version of the problem, but only you have access to the full problem. This means that the code assistant may need additional information on how the code should work or how its output should be formatted.\vspace{0.2cm}

  Here is the description of the programming problem:
