    \caption{Overview of our interactive pipeline for coding evaluation. 
    (A) We obfuscate the input of existing fully specified datasets to reflect how programmers tend to underspecify requests to LLMs (e.g., via docstrings or comments) in practice. (B) As developers may interact with models in a variety of ways, we explore $4$ different feedback types and introduce a pipeline that mimics the iterative refinement loop that programmers often use with chat models, (C) where the \cm{} generates a solution using feedback on its previous solution, (D) and the \user{} provides updated feedback to the \cm.
