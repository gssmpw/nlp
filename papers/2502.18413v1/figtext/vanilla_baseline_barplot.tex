        Comparison between \vanilla, \baseline, and the best-performing interactive feedback type aggregated across datasets. The performance drops significantly in the \baseline{} setting compared to the \vanilla{} setting but recovers with feedback, showing that collaboration with the \user{} is required for performance on obfuscated inputs to be comparable with the \vanilla{} setting.
