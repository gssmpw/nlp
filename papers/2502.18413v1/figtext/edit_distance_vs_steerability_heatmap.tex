    \caption{
        Distribution of surface-level steerability ($x$-axis) vs. behavioral steerability ($y$-axis) for all models during the first step of iterative refinement. While some models make only surface-level changes that do not induce much behavioral change in code (e.g. \gemmaSmall), others are also able to make highly effective edits that induce large changes in the behavior of the solution (e.g., \sonnet, \qwenLarge, \gpt).
