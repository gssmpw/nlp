\section{General Problem Formulation}

We first describe the general problem formulation of humans interacting with AI assistants, and later propose an evaluation pipeline to study the problem in detail through the lens of coding assistants.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Given an underspecified problem, there are multiple possible implementations that satisfy the set of criteria put forth by the current problem definition
    \item Conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assistant alone (and self-critique)
        \item Assistant + human: 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Evaluation: Solution is evaluated via a function. In addition we might care about the human effort required.
\end{itemize}
