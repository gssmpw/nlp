\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying and repairing real-world bugs using CTL specifications. We propose a method that transforms a given program into a Datalog program, enabling its repair by adjusting Datalog facts.
Our technical contribution includes support for repairing both safety and liveness properties. We take extra care in constructing summaries for both terminating and non-terminating behaviours and advance existing Datalog repair techniques to encompass analyses defined by both least-fixpoint and greatest-fixpoint semantics. 
We have developed a prototype to illustrate our proposal and present experimental results that showcase its utility. Instead of generating counterexamples and fixing them individually, our tool provides a comprehensive find-and-fix framework for addressing CTL violations.
