@inproceedings{10.1145/3447548.3467268,
	abstract = {In differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD), gradient clipping and random noise addition disproportionately affect underrepresented and complex classes and subgroups. As a consequence, DPSGD has disparate impact: the accuracy of a model trained using DPSGD tends to decrease more on these classes and subgroups vs. the original, non-private model. If the original model is unfair in the sense that its accuracy is not the same across all subgroups, DPSGD exacerbates this unfairness. In this work, we study the inequality in utility loss due to differential privacy, which compares the changes in prediction accuracy w.r.t. each group between the private model and the non-private model. We analyze the cost of privacy w.r.t. each group and explain how the group sample size along with other factors is related to the privacy impact on group accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a modified DPSGD algorithm, called DPSGD-F, to achieve differential privacy, equal costs of differential privacy, and good utility. DPSGD-F adaptively adjusts the contribution of samples in a group depending on the group clipping bias such that differential privacy has no disparate impact on group accuracy. Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of our removal algorithm on achieving equal costs of differential privacy with satisfactory utility.},

	abstract = {While deep learning has proved success in many critical tasks by training models from large-scale data, some private information within can be recovered from the released models, leading to the leakage of privacy. To address this problem, this paper presents a differentially private deep learning paradigm to train private models. In the approach, we propose and incorporate a simple operation termed grouped gradient clipping to modulate the gradient weights. We also incorporated the smooth sensitivity mechanism into differentially private deep learning paradigm, which bounds the adding Gaussian noise. In this way, the resulting model can simultaneously provide with strong privacy protection and avoid accuracy degradation, providing a good trade-off between privacy and performance. The theoretic advantages of grouped gradient clipping are well analyzed. Extensive evaluations on popular benchmarks and comparisons with 11 state-of-the-arts clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and genearalizability of our approach.},

@inproceedings{fredrikson-etal:2015:CCS,
	abstract = {Machine-learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly utilized in privacy-sensitive applications such as predicting lifestyle choices, making medical diagnoses, and facial recognition. In a model inversion attack, recently introduced in a case study of linear classifiers in personalized medicine by Fredrikson et al., adversarial access to an ML model is abused to learn sensitive genomic information about individuals. Whether model inversion attacks apply to settings outside theirs, however, is unknown. We develop a new class of model inversion attack that exploits confidence values revealed along with predictions. Our new attacks are applicable in a variety of settings, and we explore two in depth: decision trees for lifestyle surveys as used on machine-learning-as-a-service systems and neural networks for facial recognition. In both cases confidence values are revealed to those with the ability to make prediction queries to models. We experimentally show attacks that are able to estimate whether a respondent in a lifestyle survey admitted to cheating on their significant other and, in the other context, show how to recover recognizable images of people's faces given only their name and access to the ML model. We also initiate experimental exploration of natural countermeasures, investigating a privacy-aware decision tree training algorithm that is a simple variant of CART learning, as well as revealing only rounded confidence values. The lesson that emerges is that one can avoid these kinds of MI attacks with negligible degradation to utility.},

@article{dwork-roth:2014,
	abstract = {The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations --- not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed.We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed.Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey --- there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it.},

	abstract = {Human ability to understand language is \textit{general, flexible, and robust}. In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific task and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with understanding beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs and outputs, then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a range of linguistic tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in this direction, we present the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE, gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset for probing models for understanding of specific linguistic phenomena, and an online platform for evaluating and comparing models. For some benchmark tasks, training data is plentiful, but for others it is limited or does not match the genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models that can represent linguistic knowledge in a way that facilitates sample-efficient learning and effective knowledge-transfer across tasks. While none of the datasets in GLUE were created from scratch for the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held test data, which is used to ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate baselines that use ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique, as well as state-of-the-art sentence representation models. The best models still achieve fairly low absolute scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields similarly weak performance over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.},

	abstract = {Directional data is an important class of data where the magnitudes of the data points are negligible. It naturally occurs in many real-world scenarios: For instance, geographic locations (approximately) lie on a sphere, and periodic data such as time of day, or day of week can be interpreted as points on a circle. Massive amounts of directional data are collected by location-based service platforms such as Google Maps or Foursquare, who depend on mobility data from users' smartphones or wearable devices to enable their analytics and marketing businesses. However, such data is often highly privacy-sensitive and hence demands measures to protect the privacy of the individuals whose data is collected and processed. Starting with the von Mises-Fisher distribution, we therefore propose and analyze two novel privacy mechanisms for directional data by combining directional statistics with differential privacy, which presents the current state-of-the-art for quantifying and limiting information disclosure about individuals. As we will see, our specialized privacy mechanisms achieve a better privacy-utility trade-off than ex post adaptions of established mechanisms to directional data.},

	abstract = {We propose Noise-Augmented Privacy-Preserving Empirical Risk Minimization (NAPP-ERM) that solves ERM with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Existing privacy-preserving ERM approaches may be subject to over-regularization with the employment of a {\$}{\$}l{\_}2{\$}{\$}l2term to achieve strong convexity on top of the target regularization. NAPP-ERM improves over the current approaches and mitigates over-regularization by iteratively realizing the target regularization through appropriately designed noisy augmented data and delivering strong convexity via a single adaptively weighted dual-purpose {\$}{\$}l{\_}2{\$}{\$}l2regularizer. When the target regularization is for variable selection, we propose a new regularizer that achieves privacy and sparsity guarantees simultaneously. Finally, we propose a strategy to retrieve the privacy budget when the strong convexity requirement is met, which can be returned to users such that DP is guaranteed at a lower privacy cost than originally planned, or be recycled to the ERM optimization procedure to reduce the magnitude of injected DP noise and improve the utility of DP-ERM. From an implementation perspective, NAPP-ERM can be achieved by optimizing a non-perturbed object function given noise-augmented data and can thus leverage existing tools for non-private ERM optimization. We illustrate through extensive experiments the mitigation effect of the over-regularization and private budget retrieval by NAPP-ERM on variable selection and outcome prediction.},

@article{papernot-etal:2021:AAAI,
	abstractnote = {Because learning sometimes involves sensitive data, machine learning algorithms have been extended to offer differential privacy for training data. In practice, this has been mostly an afterthought, with privacy-preserving models obtained by re-running training with a different optimizer, but using the model architectures that already performed well in a non-privacy-preserving setting. This approach leads to less than ideal privacy/utility tradeoffs, as we show here. To improve these tradeoffs, prior work introduces variants of differential privacy that weaken the privacy guarantee proved to increase model utility. We show this is not necessary and instead propose that utility be improved by choosing activation functions designed explicitly for privacy-preserving training. A crucial operation in differentially private SGD is gradient clipping, which along with modifying the optimization path (at times resulting in not-optimizing a single objective function), may also introduce both significant bias and variance to the learning process. We empirically identify exploding gradients arising from ReLU may be one of the main sources of this. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally how a general family of bounded activation functions, the tempered sigmoids, consistently outperform the currently established choice: unbounded activation functions like ReLU. Using this paradigm, we achieve new state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR10 without any modification of the learning procedure fundamentals or differential privacy analysis. While the changes we make are simple in retrospect, the simplicity of our approach facilitates its implementation and adoption to meaningfully improve state-of-the-art machine learning while still providing strong guarantees in the original framework of differential privacy.},

	abstract = {Membership inference is one of the simplest privacy threats faced by machine learning models that are trained on private sensitive data. In this attack, an adversary infers whether a particular point was used to train the model, or not, by observing the model's predictions. Whereas current attack methods all require access to the model's predicted confidence score, we introduce a label-only attack that instead evaluates the robustness of the model's predicted (hard) labels under perturbations of the input, to infer membership. Our label-only attack is not only as-effective as attacks requiring access to confidence scores, it also demonstrates that a class of defenses against membership inference, which we call ``confidence masking'' because they obfuscate the confidence scores to thwart attacks, are insufficient to prevent the leakage of private information. Our experiments show that training with differential privacy or strong L2 regularization are the only current defenses that meaningfully decrease leakage of private information, even for points that are outliers of the training distribution.},

	abstract = {Attacks that aim to identify the training data of neural networks represent a severe threat to the privacy of individuals in the training dataset. A possible protection is offered by anonymization of the training data or training function with differential privacy. However, data scientists can choose between local and central differential privacy, and need to select meaningful privacy parameters ϵ. A comparison of local and central differential privacy based on the privacy parameters furthermore potentially leads data scientists to incorrect conclusions, since the privacy parameters are reflecting different types of mechanisms.Instead, we empirically compare the relative privacy-accuracy trade-off of one central and two local differential privacy mechanisms under a white-box membership inference attack. While membership inference only reflects a lower bound on inference risk and differential privacy formulates an upper bound, our experiments with several datasets show that the privacy-accuracy trade-off is similar for both types of mechanisms despite the large difference in their upper bound. This suggests that the upper bound is far from the practical susceptibility to membership inference. Thus, small ϵ&nbsp;in central differential privacy and large ϵ&nbsp;in local differential privacy result in similar membership inference risks, and local differential privacy can be a meaningful alternative to central differential privacy for differentially private deep learning besides the comparatively higher privacy parameters.},

@inproceedings{10.5555/3294996.3295074,
	abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

@article{hu-etal:2022,
	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models have been widely applied to various applications, including image classification, text generation, audio recognition, and graph data analysis. However, recent studies have shown that ML models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to infer whether a data record was used to train a target model or not. MIAs on ML models can directly lead to a privacy breach. For example, via identifying the fact that a clinical record that has been used to train a model associated with a certain disease, an attacker can infer that the owner of the clinical record has the disease with a high chance. In recent years, MIAs have been shown to be effective on various ML models, e.g., classification models and generative models. Meanwhile, many defense methods have been proposed to mitigate MIAs. Although MIAs on ML models form a newly emerging and rapidly growing research area, there has been no systematic survey on this topic yet. In this article, we conduct the first comprehensive survey on membership inference attacks and defenses. We provide the taxonomies for both attacks and defenses, based on their characterizations, and discuss their pros and cons. Based on the limitations and gaps identified in this survey, we point out several promising future research directions to inspire the researchers who wish to follow this area. This survey not only serves as a reference for the research community but also provides a clear description for researchers outside this research domain. To further help the researchers, we have created an online resource repository, which we will keep updated with future relevant work.

Performing an in-depth case study on privacy in personalized warfarin dosing, we show that suggested models carry privacy risks, in particular because attackers can perform what we call model inversion: an attacker, given the model and some demographic information about a patient, can predict the patient's genetic markers.As differential privacy (DP) is an oft-proposed solution for medical settings such as this, we evaluate its effectiveness for building private versions of pharmacogenetic models. We show that DP mechanisms prevent our model inversion attacks when the privacy budget is carefully selected. We go on to analyze the impact on utility by performing simulated clinical trials with DP dosing models. We find that for privacy budgets effective at preventing attacks, patients would be exposed to increased risk of stroke, bleeding events, and mortality. We conclude that current DP mechanisms do not simultaneously improve genomic privacy while retaining desirable clinical efficacy, highlighting the need for new mechanisms that should be evaluated in situ using the general methodology introduced by our work.},

	abstractnote = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A key tool for building differentially private systems is adding Gaussian noise to the output of a function evaluated on a sensitive dataset. Unfortunately, using a continuous distribution presents several practical challenges. First and foremost, finite computers cannot exactly represent samples from continuous distributions, and previous work has demonstrated that seemingly innocuous numerical errors can entirely destroy privacy. Moreover, when the underlying data is itself discrete (e.g., population counts), adding continuous noise makes the result less interpretable.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;With these shortcomings in mind, we introduce and analyze the discrete Gaussian in the context of differential privacy. Specifically, we theoretically and experimentally show that adding discrete Gaussian noise provides essentially the same privacy and accuracy guarantees as the addition of continuous Gaussian noise. We also present an simple and efficient algorithm for exact sampling from this distribution. This demonstrates its applicability for privately answering counting queries, or more generally, low-sensitivity integer-valued queries.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

In this paper, we present a surprising result: Even without training or memorizing the data, we can fully reconstruct the training samples from a single gradient query at a randomly chosen parameter value. We prove the identifiability of the training data under mild assumptions: with shallow or deep neural networks and wide range of activation functions. We also present a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm based on tensor decomposition to reconstruct the training data. As a provable attack that reveals sensitive training data, our findings suggest potential  severe threats to privacy, especially in federated learning.},

	abstract = {From smartphones owned by the majority of teenage and adult populations to omnipresent closed-circuit television systems, the ubiquity of image-capturing devices in our everyday lives ensures that digital images of individuals are taken in the hundreds of millions on a daily basis. Many of these images capture individuals{\^a}€{\texttrademark} faces which, through facial recognition techniques, identify the individuals and thus represent a major privacy concern. Many countries and companies require facial obfuscation to conform to privacy laws or policies. Since images should be useful and look realistic, a trade-off arises between privacy and utility. The task is therefore to find a method of obfuscation that offers a formal privacy guarantee while preserving visual quality and maintaining facial attributes deemed acceptable for release (e.g., the pose of the head, gender, etc.). We address this task by proposing facial identity obfuscation through the application of differential privacy to image encodings in a generative adversarial network. We provide details on the design of the model architecture and training process that allow for the generation of photo-realistic obfuscated images. Through the use of principal component analysis, we control the application of noise to the model encodings in order to achieve a favourable trade-off between privacy and utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an experimental comparison against other methods of obfuscation which also offer a formal guarantee of privacy.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of camera technology in every-day life begets a modern reality in which images of individuals are routinely captured on a daily basis. Although this has enabled many benefits, it also infringes on personal privacy. To mitigate the loss of privacy, researchers have investigated methods of facial obfuscation in images. A promising direction has been the work in the k-same family of methods which employ the concept of k-anonymity from database privacy. However, there are a number of deficiencies of k-anonymity which carry over to the k-same methods, detracting from their usefulness in practice. In this paper, we first outline several of these deficiencies and discuss their implications in the context of facial obfuscation. We then develop the first framework to apply the formal privacy guarantee of differential privacy to facial obfuscation in generative machine learning models for images. Next, we discuss the theoretical improvements in the privacy guarantee which make this approach more appropriate for practical usage. Our approach provides a provable privacy guarantee which is not susceptible to the outlined deficiencies of k-same obfuscation and produces photo-realistic obfuscated output. Finally, while our approach provides a stronger privacy guarantee, we demonstrate through experimental comparisons that it can achieve comparable utility to k-same approaches in the context of preservation of demographic information in the images. The preservation of such information is of particular importance for enabling effective data mining on the obfuscated images.},

@article{pan-etal:2024:Neurocomputing,
	abstract = {The widespread adoption of deep learning is facilitated in part by the availability of large-scale data for training desirable models. However, these data may involve sensitive personal information, which raises privacy concerns for data providers. Differential privacy has been thought of as a key technique in the privacy preservation field, which has drawn much attention owing to its capability of providing rigorous and provable privacy guarantees for training data. Training deep learning models in a differentially private manner is a topic that is gaining traction as this alleviates the reconstruction and inference of sensitive information effectively. Taking this cue, in this paper, we present here a comprehensive and systematic study on differentially private deep learning from the facets of privacy attack and privacy preservation. We explore a new taxonomy to analyze the privacy attacks faced in deep learning and then survey the type of privacy preservation based on differential privacy to tackle such privacy attacks in deep learning. Finally, we propose the first probe into the real-world application of differentially private deep learning, and then conclude with several potential future research avenues. This survey provides promising directions for protecting sensitive information in training data via differential privacy during deep learning model training.},

These methods without a doubt can include private or otherwise personally identifiable information. As such, the question of privacy in NLP has gained fervor in recent years, coinciding with the development of new Privacy- Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Among these PETs, Differential Privacy boasts several desirable qualities in the conversation surrounding data privacy. Naturally, the question becomes whether Differential Privacy is applicable in the largely unstructured realm of NLP. This topic has sparked novel research, which is unified in one basic goal how can one adapt Differential Privacy to NLP methods? This paper aims to summarize the vulnerabilities addressed by Differential Privacy, the current thinking, and above all, the crucial next steps that must be considered.},
