\textbf{P:} \textit{\underline{A dog}} has its head inside a red and green gift bag \\ 
\textbf{H:} \textit{\underline{The red and brown dog}} is not digging its nose inside a holiday gift bag \\ \\
\vspace{-5mm}
\textbf{Reasoning process:}
The premise states that "{ A dog} has its head inside a red and green gift bag," which \ul{ clearly indicates that the dog is interacting with the gift bag by having its head inside it.} The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that "The red and brown dog is not digging its nose inside a holiday gift bag." This directly contradicts the premise because  \ul{it asserts that the dog is not interacting with the gift bag in the manner described.} Therefore, the hypothesis is false given the premise, \ul{leading to a label of contradiction.}\\
