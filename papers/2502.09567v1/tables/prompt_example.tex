Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Please generate intermediate sentences from `Sentence 1` to `Sentence 2`, essentially morphing `Sentence 1` to `Sentence 2` through successive atomic edits. Each edit gives another interpolated sentence. Limit the number of interpolation/changes to at most 7. The atomic edits that you are allowed to do have the following structure, manipulating short parts of text:\\ \\
        1. Replace operations - (replace, <old\_text>, <new\_text>)\\
	2. Remove operations - (remove, <text>)\\
        3. Insert operations - (insert, <text>) \\\\
            
You are required to do all the operations in the order specified above: first just replacements, then removals and lastly insertions if needed. Each edit must consider similar syntactic groups, so you are not allowed to break syntactic boundaries. Perform multiple small operations, rather than one operation that changes the whole text. For example, a replace operation that changes most of the text could be broken down into multiple replace operations, followed by remove operations.\\
\\
The replacements are the most usual operations. These operations must be done by comparing syntactically similar word groups from the current sentence with ones from the target sentence (Sentence 2). The replacement text may be a rephrase of the starting text group, or even a contradictory statement, depending on the form and meaning of the final sentence. \\ \\
The removals are done on groups of text that are totally unrelated to the final sentence. This includes additional information specified in the starting sentence that disappears while morphing towards the final sentence.\\ \\
The insertions represent new text that is unrelated to the knowledge presented in the starting sentence. Do inserts only when it is necessary, when inserting text that is totally unrelated to the textual constructs of the current sentence. Under no circumstances you are allowed to remove certain words then insert related words. This should be done using a replacement operation instead.\\ \\
I will give some examples below. Keep the same structure of your response as seen in the examples, with no additional text/explanations.\\ \\

\{Example\ 1\}\\
\{Example 2\}\\
... \\
\{Example 12\}\\ \\
Generate the intermediate sentences and print the atomic edits for the following pair of sentences:\\

Sentence 1:\\
\{Premise\}\\

Sentence 2:\\
\{Hypothesis\}\\ \\
