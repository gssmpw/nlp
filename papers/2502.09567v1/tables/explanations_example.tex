You have to provide the label and explanations for a Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. Natural Language Inference is the task of determining whether a "hypothesis" is true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a "premise".
You will be given the premise and the hypothesis, and must state if they have an entailment, contradiction or neutral relation. You are then required to provide the reasoning process that explains why the label applies for the pair of sentences.
The explanations must be clear and concise, using natural language.   \\ \\
