\section{Literature review}
The literature review focuses on WSN data synchronization using Node-MCU memory for precision agriculture applications. It explores existing research and studies related to the synchronization of data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) specifically using Node-MCU memory as a synchronization mechanism. The review aims to depict the existing state of knowledge, research gaps, and potential options in leveraging Node-MCU memory for achieving accurate and reliable data synchronization in the context of precision agriculture applications. By analyzing the work of Liu et al. [1] and Chen et al. [2], which introduced an efficient synchronization protocol for WSNs, we see that these protocols often rely on periodic beacon transmissions to maintain clock synchronization.

Another relevant study is that of Patel et al. [3], who proposed a novel approach to data synchronization using a distributed consensus algorithm. Their solution aims to minimize energy consumption by reducing the number of messages exchanged between nodes. However, it requires a high degree of connectivity among nodes and can be vulnerable to network partitioning.

The work of Kumar et al. [4] also focuses on data synchronization in WSNs, proposing a hybrid approach that combines both periodic and event-driven synchronization mechanisms. Their solution is designed to balance energy efficiency with accuracy and can adapt to changing network conditions. Nevertheless, it may not perform well in highly dynamic or large-scale networks.

In addition to these studies, researchers have also explored the use of machine learning techniques for data synchronization in WSNs. For instance, the work of Wang et al. [5] proposes a deep learning-based approach that leverages temporal and spatial patterns in sensor data to improve synchronization accuracy.

\subsection*{Research Gap}
Achieving accurate data synchronization and efficient storage in Wireless Sensor Networks for precision agriculture applications involves overcoming several complex challenges. Timestamp-based solutions often lead to issues such as record duplication and storage inefficiencies, which compromise the effectiveness of data analysis and decision-making. Advanced synchronization protocols are essential to ensure precise time alignment of sensor data, thereby eliminating redundant records and maintaining data integrity.

\subsection*{Problem Statement}
Accurate data synchronization among sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for precision agriculture applications, as reliable data storage is now highly demanded for local monitoring stations and online live servers through the internet. In precision agriculture, accurate and synchronized data collection is crucial for effective analysis and decision-making.
