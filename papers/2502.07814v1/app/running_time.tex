\section{Running Time and Resource Consumption}
\cref{time} shows the running time and resource consumption of SGD during the training and the sampling process. 
To enhance the inference efficiency, we have also tested our SGD on 50-step DDIM sampling to generate HR ERA5 maps within one minute, making it a feasible approach for practical use.
The efficiency and performance of DDIM sampling will be added to the revision.
