\section{Additional Visualization Results}
In this section, we present the downscaling results of SGD for the variables $V_{10}$ and $MSL$. 
\cref{fig:app_results} shows that SGD exhibits more faithful details in the maps as compared to interpolation-based and diffusion-based methods. 
Furthermore, SGD exhibits no discernible disparity in overall intensity when compared to ERA5 at a scale of $25km\times 25km$. 
Combining the results of the other two variables in the main text, it is validated that SGD is capable of producing highly satisfactory downscaling results across all four variables.
