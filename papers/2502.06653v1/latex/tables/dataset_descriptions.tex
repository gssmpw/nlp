  \midrule
  QNLI \citep{wang-etal-2018-glue} & The Stanford Question Answering Dataset. A corpus of question-sentence pairs, with context sentences extracted from Wikipedia and questions written by a human annotator. The model is tasked with determining whether the context contains the answer to (entails) the question. \\
  \midrule
  RTE \tablefootnote{\citep{dagan2006pascal, bar2006second, giampiccolo2007third, bentivogli2009fifth}} & The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) datasets. A corpus constructed from annual textual entailment challenges based on news and Wikipedia text.\\
  \midrule
  WNLI \citep{levesque2011winograd} & The Winograd Schema Challenge. A corpus of reading comprehension sentence pairs, where ambiguous pronouns are replaced with each possible referent. The task is to predict if the substituted sentence is entailed by the original sentence.\\
  \midrule
  HANS \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1902-01007} & Heuristic Analysis for NLI Systems. A corpus of challenging premise and hypothesis pairs designed to target evaluation of lexical overlap, sub-sequence, and constituent heuristics. \\

  PAWS-X$_{\textsc{en}}$ \citep{yang-etal-2019-paws} & Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling - Cross-lingual. A corpus of challenging paraphrase and non-paraphrase pairs created using data from Wikipedia. Sentence pairs were generated using controlled word swapping and back translation to ensure high lexical overlap, and human raters judged semantic equivalence. Our experiments utilize the English data split.\\
