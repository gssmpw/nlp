\section*{Correlation between variables}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SI_correlation_h.png} 
    \caption{
    Hexbin plot~\cite{matplotlib_hexbin} of perceived trustworthiness, competence, fairness, and willingness in the pre-treatment survey by manager type (A, B, C, D) and gender (E, F, G, H), with smoother background shading using a 2D Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE)~\cite{scipy_gaussian_kde} overlay beneath the hexbin plot to enhance the overall visualization.} 
    \label{fig:correlation} 
\end{figure} 


%Figure~\ref{fig:correlation} illustrates the correlation of the perceived fairness in the pre-treatment survey across manager type and gender. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:correlation}A, the perceived fairness of the manager decision between human and AI is weakly positively correlated ($\mathrm{r}$ = 0.097), suggesting different evaluation criteria for human and AI managers. In contrast, Fig.~\ref{fig:correlation}B reveals a strong positive correlation ($\mathrm{r}$ = 0.653s) beween fairness perceptions of male and female managers, indicating consistency in how participants evaluate them. Similar patterns are observed for perceptions of manager trustworthiness, competency, and willingness to collaborate in future teams, highlighting distinct perceptions of human and AI managers but little differentiation by gender.
