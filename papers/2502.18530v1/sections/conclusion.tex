In this paper, we introduced Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for designing LLM agent-based pipeline optimization systems by decomposing pipelines into independent components and refining each in isolation, enhancing interpretability and consistency while ensuring systematic improvements. To evaluate Iterative Refinement, we implemented IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework that autonomously generates image classification models. Beyond Iterative Refinement, IMPROVE integrates several innovative features, including dataset-aware decision-making, automated code execution, and unified pipeline initialization, which together create a robust and adaptive optimization process. Our experiments demonstrated that IMPROVE consistently outperforms models generated through zero-shot LLM prompting, achieves results comparable to top human ML practitioners, and exhibits robustness against corrupted datasets while effectively adapting to diverse image domains. These findings highlight the potential of IMPROVE for real-world applications.
