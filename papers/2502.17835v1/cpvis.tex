\begin{abstract}
As programming education becomes more widespread, many college students from non-computer science backgrounds begin learning programming. Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop \textit{CPVis}, \RR{an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically.} Specifically, \textit{CPVis} enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. \textit{CPVis} employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), \RR{comparing \textit{CPVis} with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.}

\textbf{\textit{Motivations:}}
Participants unanimously agreed that collaborative programming is an important teaching strategy for programming education. However, different teachers had varying focuses and practices regarding collaborative programming. 
Teachers specializing in computer science tended to have students complete tasks independently in foundational programming courses (e.g., Python, Java) while implementing collaborative programming for more complex projects. 
For example, \textit{T3 stated, ``I consider collaborative learning only when the programming project requires different students' creative input, innovation, exploration, and discovery of new content, or when the workload is too large for one person to complete.''}
In contrast, teachers of non-computer science courses held different views. 
E2 pointed out that for beginners who are new to programming languages, even a fundamental programming problem can be daunting.
Collaborative programming can significantly alleviate this issue and improve students' efficiency. 
Group members can work together to complete a programming task, which motivates students, allows them to learn from each other, and reduces the teaching burden (T4).
Additionally, in collaborative programming classes, teachers focus on students' cognitive skills (e.g., knowledge acquisition) and non-cognitive skills (e.g., computational thinking, problem-solving abilities). Most participants believed that these two aspects do not conflict and are part of the overall teaching goals. 
\textit{T5 stated that her course design primarily focuses on developing non-cognitive skills, particularly enhancing students' abilities during the collaboration process. }
T4 believed that cognitive skills can be supplemented with extra time or individual tutoring, but problem-solving and collaboration skills are challenging to develop outside of class. 
Furthermore, E1, T4, and T3 mentioned that quantifying the improvement of students' non-cognitive skills is very challenging.
On one hand, teachers and assistants are busy answering students' questions, making it challenging to observe students' performance. 
On the other hand, non-cognitive skills are not as quickly assessed through tests as knowledge-based content.

Despite the unanimous recognition of the importance of collaborative programming, participants shared several challenges they faced in practice, summarized as follows:

\textit{\textbf{Group Formation:}}
For group size, most participants preferred group sizes of 2-3 students, noting that larger groups (up to 5 members) could decrease the quality of collaboration and make it difficult for students to find their roles. T4 favored pair programming but often had to form groups of three due to large class sizes. T1 and T3 typically recommended groups of 4-5 students, given the complexity and workload of their programming projects, which smaller groups might struggle to complete.
For the group formation method, participants had various approaches to forming groups. T2, T3, T4, and T5, whose students come from fixed classes, generally allowed students to create their own groups. In contrast, T6, T1, E1, and E2 taught general education courses open to all students across the university. These students came from different majors and did not know each other, making self-selection difficult. E2 conducted preliminary assessments of students and formed balanced groups based on their prior knowledge. However, determining how to create groups remains a significant challenge, as different criteria can lead to varying outcomes. Arbitrarily formed groups might result in imbalanced teams, where students' abilities are insufficient to complete the tasks.

\textit{\textbf{Evaluating the Learning Objectives:}}
Evaluating whether the teacher has achieved the learning objectives is an essential criterion for assessing the quality of collaborative programming courses. All participants stated that they generally meet the learning objectives and sometimes even exceed expectations. T4 mentioned that at the start of the collaborative course, she assigned a group leader to each group to take on a leadership role. While she initially spent a significant amount of time guiding the group leaders and facilitating student collaboration, by the second half of the semester, the group leaders were typically able to function as ``little teachers,'' helping group members complete tasks. This allowed the teacher to free up time and energy for other responsibilities.

\RR{\textbf{Spearman Correlation Matrix:}
To assess the consistency between rankings, we used Spearman's Rank Correlation to calculate the correlation of rankings between each participant., The Spearman correlation matrix shows the consistency of the rankings between participants (Fig.~\ref{fig:myplot}). The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1:
- A value closer to 1 indicates that the two evaluators' rankings are more consistent.
- A value closer to -1 suggests that the rankings are more inconsistent.
- A value near 0 implies no significant correlation between the two evaluators' rankings. For example, the correlation between participant 0 and participant 9 is 0.809, indicating
relatively consistent rankings. In contrast, the correlation between evaluator seven and evaluator 8 is - 0.150, suggesting their rankings differ considerably.}

\RR{\textbf{Friedman Test Results:}
We conducted a Friedman test to assess whether there are significant differences in rankings among different participants. The Friedman test compares the ranking data of multiple related samples to determine whether there are significant differences in rankings under different conditions. The test statistic is 60.796, and the p-value is 1.84e-07. This very small p-value (< 0.05) indicates that:

- There are significant differences in the rankings of different features. The evaluators' ratings are not random or similar but show clear preferences for specific features over others.

In conclusion, after comprehensively analyzing the results for each feature, our system focuses on implementing features \textbf{F1, F2, F6, F8-14, and F16}.

\subsection{Python Code Evaluation}
\textbf{Prompt:}

I would like you to play the role of a teacher who teaches a Python programming class, and you will be provided a question statement and a Python code, which is the student's answer to the question. 
Regarding the Python code, you need to accomplish two tasks. 
Here are the scoring criteria. Please mark each point according to the scoring criteria and explain the reason. Meanwhile, you should give your final score.
If the score of each aspect is not 5, please point out the demerits of the code. Also, note that you don't need to give the advised code. }

\subsection{Student Role Analysis}
\textbf{Prompt:}}

\RR{
You are a teacher teaching programming class and will be provided some conversation files belonging to one group but in different questions period, including question number, timestamp for each speaker and corresponding conversation recorded in the context of a collaborative programming course. Your jobYour job will be to find students' planning solutions behaviors related to the question for all sentences they said. 
Here is some example: ``This question could go like this...'', ``Combine A and B'', ``Notice the function.'', etc. Specifically, you should indicate each speaker's sentences of planning solutions corresponding timestamp. Besides, there are some misunderstanding sentences that are not planning solutions: ``I'm just messing around with names.'', ``That's good. That's good.'' etc. You need to find valuable comments that contribute or drive the problem-solving process. Notice that you only need to indicate the sentences about planning solutions or providing insights.
Let me explain ``Navigator'', ``Driver'' and ``Monitor''. Each group only have three members, ``Navigator'' is the speaker who's sentence is about planning solutions, ``Driver'' is the member who responsible for coding, this role is non-changeable. I will tell you who are the ``Driver'' in each file's first line. Besides, ``Monitor'' is the role who is neither 
``Navigator'' nor ``Driver''. If the role of ``Driver'' is also planning solutions, then the role of ``Driver'' should be changed to ``Navigator'', and ``Driver'' is None for this sentence. Significantly, if a sentence is not about planning solutions, you also need to list/indicate it. The Navigator should be None, but fill out the speakers of ``Monitors'' and ``Drivers''.

\subsection{Teacher Scaffold Analysis}

\textbf{Prompt:}

You are a teacher teaching programming class and you will be provided a conversation file including timestamp for each speaker and corresponding content recorded in the context of a collaborative programming course. It will be your job to find instructors' assitance category based on the following scaffold.
Analyze the different levels of scaffolding used by instructors during group learning based on the following categories:
Low-control cognitive scaffolding (CS-L): The instructor raises open-ended questions that elicit group thinking without providing new information. This method encourages critical thinking but leaves the group to figure out the details.      
Medium-control cognitive scaffolding (CS-M): The instructor provides hints or clues to help groups solve cognitive problems. This method supports problem-solving but maintains some cognitive challenge.       
High-control cognitive scaffolding (CS-H): The instructor directly provides answers or demonstrates tasks (such as programming) using tools like computers. This method offers direct guidance but may limit students' independent problem-solving.      
Metacognitive scaffolding (MS): The instructor monitors and regulates the group's learning goals and collaborative processes, helping to manage group dynamics and learning strategies.
