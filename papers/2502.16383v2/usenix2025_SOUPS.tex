% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

% Generative AI (GAI) is transforming how youth interact with technology. In this study, we present a Youth-Centered Risk Taxonomy for GAI, by examining 344 chat logs of youth interacting with GAI chatbots, 30,305 Reddit discussions about youth's use of GAI systems, and 153 AI incident reports. We identify six high-level risk categories with 84 specific risks and map them to four interaction pathways. Our findings reveal new risks, e.g., Mental Wellbeing Risks, Behavioral and Social Developmental Risks, and new manifestations of Toxicity, Privacy violations, and Misuse/Exploitation, which are not addressed in existing child online safety taxonomies and AI risk taxonomies. By grounding our taxonomy in empirical evidence, this work provides a structured foundation to help AI practitioners, educators, parents and policymakers better understand and mitigate risks in youth-GAI interactions.

Generative AI (GAI) is reshaping the way young users engage with technology. This study introduces a taxonomy of risks associated with youth-GAI interactions, derived from an analysis of 344 chat transcripts between youth and GAI chatbots, 30,305 Reddit discussions concerning youth engagement with these systems, and 153 documented AI-related incidents. We categorize risks into six overarching themes, identifying 84 specific risks, which we further align with four distinct interaction pathways. Our findings highlight emerging concerns, such as risks to mental wellbeing, behavioral and social development, and novel forms of toxicity, privacy breaches, and misuse/exploitationâ€”gaps that are not fully addressed in existing frameworks on child online safety or AI risks. By systematically grounding our taxonomy in empirical data, this work offers a structured approach to aiding AI developers, educators, caregivers, and policymakers in comprehending and mitigating risks associated with youth-GAI interactions.
