\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This work introduces a novel approach to TOT query elicitation, leveraging LLMs and human participants to move beyond the limitations of CQA-based datasets. Through system rank correlation and linguistic similarity validation, we demonstrate that LLM- and human-elicited queries can effectively support the simulated evaluation of TOT retrieval systems. Our findings highlight the potential for expanding TOT retrieval research into underrepresented domains while ensuring scalability and reproducibility. The released datasets and source code provide a foundation for future research, enabling further advancements in TOT retrieval evaluation and system development.
