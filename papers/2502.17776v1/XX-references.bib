The emergence of several online communities where users pose known-item queries to other users indicates the inability of existing search systems to answer such queries. Research in this domain is hampered by the lack of large, open or realistic datasets. Prior datasets relied on either annotation by crowd workers, which can be expensive and time-consuming, or generating synthetic queries, which can be unrealistic. Additionally, small datasets make the application of modern (neural) retrieval methods unviable, since they require a large number of data-points. In this paper, we collect the largest dataset yet with 15K query-item pairs in two domains, namely, Movies and Books, from an online community using heuristics, rendering expensive annotation unnecessary while ensuring that queries are realistic. We show that our data collection method is accurate by conducting a data study. We further demonstrate that methods like BM25 fall short of answering such queries, corroborating prior research. The size of the dataset makes neural methods feasible, which we show outperforms lexical baselines, indicating that neural/dense retrieval is superior for the TOT-KIR task.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the Fifteenth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining}, pages = {48–56}, numpages = {9}, keywords = {tip of the tongue known item retrieval, known item retrieval}, location = {Virtual Event, AZ, USA}, series = {WSDM '22} }

However, research in this area has been limited by the lack of shareable test collections, making cumulative progress difficult. In this paper, we define desktop search as a semi-structured document retrieval problem and introduce a methodology to automatically build a reusable collection (the pseudo-desktop) that has many of the same properties as a real desktop collection. We then present a comprehensive evaluation of retrieval methods for semi-structured document retrieval on several pseudo-desktop collections and the TREC Enterprise collection. Our results show that a probabilistic retrieval model using the mapping relation between a query term and a document field (PRM-S) has the best performance in collections with more structure, such as email, and that the query-likelihood language model is better for other document types. We further analyze the observed differences using generated queries and suggest ways to improve PRM-S, which makes the performance gains more significant and consistent.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management}, pages = {1297–1306}, numpages = {10}, keywords = {test collection generation, semi-structured document retrieval, information retrieval, desktop search}, location = {Hong Kong, China}, series = {CIKM '09} }

The aim of this article is to increase our understanding of the role that memory plays in the process of refinding personal information.

As this task is very similar to work in meta-search and data fusion, we adapt several hypotheses from those research areas and investigate them in this context. To investigate these hypotheses, we present a mixture-based language model and also examine many of the current meta-search algorithms. We find that compatible output from systems is important for successful combination of document representations. We also demonstrate that combining low performing document representations can improve performance, but not consistently. We find that the techniques best suited for this task are robust to the inclusion of poorly performing document representations. We also explore the role of variance of results across systems and its impact on the performance of fusion, with the surprising result that the correct documents have higher variance across document representations than highly ranking incorrect documents.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 26th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Informaion Retrieval}, pages = {143–150}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {meta-search algorithms, language models, known-item finding, data fusion}, location = {Toronto, Canada}, series = {SIGIR '03} }
