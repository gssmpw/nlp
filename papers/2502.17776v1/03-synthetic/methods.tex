Figure \ref{fig:query-gen-process} illustrates the LLM-elicited TOT query generation process. Given an arbitrary entity for which we want to generate a TOT query, we retrieve the entity’s Wikipedia page, summarize it into a few paragraphs, and construct a prompt template using the summary. This prompt is then used to query an LLM to generate a synthetic TOT query.

The query generation process consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Sampling a target entity}:\\
A random entity is selected as the target for TOT query generation. In the Movie domain, the MS-TOT test set serves as the pool of entities, while for the Landmark and Person domains, we manually curated the entity pool.

\item \textit{Retrieving and summarizing the entity’s Wikipedia page}:\\
The entity’s Wikipedia page is retrieved and used to construct a summarization prompt for the GPT-4o model\footnote{GPT4o-2024-05-13}. To ensure the content fits within the model’s token limit, the page is truncated if necessary. The model processes the page into a two-paragraph summary. For Movie domain entities, we check for a dedicated \textit{Plot} section and ensure its content is included in the summarization prompt, as it often provides essential context for generating realistic TOT queries.

\item \textit{Constructing a domain- and entity-specific prompt}:\\
Following summarization, a domain- and entity-specific prompt is constructed, incorporating the summarized information to generate a TOT query. The same GPT-4o model is used for query elicitation. 
We tested various prompt configurations and temperature settings to identify the best-performing strategy in the Movie domain, then applied it to the Landmark and Person domains.\footnote{Details on the different prompt versions we tested are available at \url{https://github.com/kimdanny/llm-tot-query-elicitation}.}


\item \textit{Ensuring entity name anonymity in the generated query}:\\
An essential consideration in the query generation process is ensuring that the generated TOT query does not contain the target entity’s name. To address this, we implement a name-checking step: if the generated query includes the entity name, we retry the generation using the same prompt, with a maximum of three retries before discarding the query.
\end{enumerate}
