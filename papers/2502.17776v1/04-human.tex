\section{TOT Query Elicitation from Human}\label{sec:human-elicitation}


The study of the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon has been a long-standing area of research in psychology \cite{burke1991tip, jones1989back}. Many studies have attempted to induce TOT states in participants using auditory \cite{reefer1995name} or visual stimuli \cite{tranel2005landmarks}, enabling researchers to examine recognizability (whether a subject recognizes an entity from the stimulus) and retrievability (whether they can recall the entity's name or title).

Building on these methodologies, we employ visual stimuli in the Movie, Landmark, and Person domains to develop an interface that places participants in a TOT state and allows them to compose TOT queries about the entities they struggle to recall.

In this section, we describe the design process of our interface for eliciting human-written TOT queries from trained contracted participants, along with an analysis of the collected human-elicited queries.
