\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents an instance of group convolutions on the continuous domain, which is equivariant to SE(3).
Using a carefully constructed subset of group elements makes our operation computationally and memory efficient, obtaining competitive performance when only one sample is taken to solve the integral over the SO(3) group and, therefore, not requiring additional resources over a standard convolution. 
Moreover, by restricting the receptive field of our convolution, our operation becomes local equivariant, allowing us to be robust to local transformations.
Our extensive evaluation presents our approach as a viable solution to incorporate local equivariance in deep network architectures for point clouds without significant additional cost.
