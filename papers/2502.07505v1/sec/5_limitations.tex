\label{sec:limitations}

Although the proposed convolution operation is local equivariant via the restricted receptive field, when multiple layers are combined in a deep network, the full model does not become local equivariant and remains global equivariant.
However, from the experiments presented in Sec.~\ref{sub-sec:segmentation}, where the network aims to perform local predictions, our model shows robustness to such scenarios which indicates that the model relies on local features to perform the predictions.
