\section{Overhead of \ourSystem.}
We report the size and inference time of the model for NeRF and \ourSystem in Table~\ref{table_overhead}.  
The results indicate that \ourSystem has a larger model size than NeRF, \ie 27.1 \vs 8.0\,MB.  
Correspondingly, \ourSystem exhibits a longer inference time, \ie 1.79 \vs 0.43\,s.  
Unlike NeRF, \ourSystem requires neighboring spectra as input. 
During inference, the target transmitter's neighbors are extracted from the training dataset, so \ourSystem does not incur additional data burdens.  
Moreover, since \ourSystem can operate in unseen scenes, it significantly reduces the requirement for a time-consuming training process.
