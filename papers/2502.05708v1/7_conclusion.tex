The proposed framework, \ourSystem, introduces a novel generalizable wireless radiance field for modeling wireless signal propagation, offering contributions to both machine learning research and practical applications in wireless communication and sensing. 
Below, we outline the broader scientific and societal impacts of this work:

\textbf{1) Advancing ML for Wireless Domains.}
\ourSystem bridges the gap between optical and wireless domains by extending NeRF to wireless signal propagation modeling. 
Addressing the generalization challenges in unseen scenes, it contributes to the broader field of machine learning through advancements in spatial interpolation and geometry-aware learning tailored for non-optical domains. 
This work highlights the versatility of neural frameworks in tackling domain-specific challenges beyond their original applications.



\textbf{2) Transforming Wireless Network Planning.}
Current approaches to network planning rely on expensive and time-intensive site surveys or Computer-Aided Design~(CAD)-based simulations, which are often impractical in real-world environments. 
\ourSystem provides a scalable, data-driven alternative that improves the accuracy of signal propagation modeling while reducing the need for extensive manual data collection. 
This transformation has the potential to accelerate the deployment and optimization of wireless networks, including 5G and future communication technologies.
