It is challenging to apply a well-trained \nerft model to different 3D environments.
This difficulty arises because \nerft encodes 3D scenes into the weights of an MLP.
Given the limited representational capacity of MLPs~\cite{mihajlovic2023resfields}, the trained MLP tends to overfit~\cite{wang2021ibrnet, liu2022neural}, making it effective at representing only a single 3D scene but struggling to generalize across new environments.



We collect datasets D2, D3, and D4 from three different 3D scenes (details in Section~\ref{sec_experimental_setting}) to evaluate the generalization ability of \nerft.
Datasets D2 and D3 are both collected in a conference room, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig_exp_3d}(b), with the only difference being the addition of two chairs (C1 and C2) in D3.
Dataset D4, on the other hand, is collected in a different office room with a distinct layout and set of objects compared to the conference room, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig_exp_3d}(c).



Figure~\ref{fig_motivation} illustrates the performance variations when training \nerft on dataset D2 and applying the trained model to datasets D2, D3, and D4.
When the trained \nerft model is tested on datasets D2 and D3, it exhibits a decrease of 12.6\% in the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)~\cite{wang2004image} and 7.4\% in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). 
This demonstrates that even minor changes, such as the addition of two chairs in a 3D scene, can degrade the performance of \nerft.
Furthermore, the performance of \nerft declines even more dramatically, with a drop of 57.5\% in SSIM and 41.7\% in PSNR when tested on dataset D4 compared to its performance on dataset D2.
These results underscore the significant decrease in the spatial spectrum synthesis performance of \nerft when the 3D scene changes, exposing its weak generalization ability across different environments.
