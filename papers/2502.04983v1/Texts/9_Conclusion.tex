\section{Conclusion}
This paper has introduced \sysName, a novel LLM-based system to simplify the creation of 2D interactive scenes without coding from natural language input and graphical control. We utilized content analysis on video tutorials about creating interactive scenes using ChatGPT and existing AI coding tools, and distilled several issues including the lack of independent generation and refinement, graphical control, and precise refinement. Based on these findings, we proposed a context-aware modularization technique that processes textual descriptions through individual LLM modules, with a central module coordinating interactions, allowing for independent refinement of each element. Our graphical user interface combined these modular LLMs with advanced graphical controls, enabling seamless code generation for 2D interactive scenes and direct integration of graphical information. We conducted a comparative study between \sysName~and \yh{Cursor Composer}, and found \sysName~significantly reduced the time, prompt trials, and prompt lengths and achieved better graphical and precise control in creating interactive scenes. Another open-ended usability study demonstrated that \sysName~allowed users to create various desired scenes easily without the need for coding, benefiting diverse application scenarios.
