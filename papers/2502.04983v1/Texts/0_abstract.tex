Creating interactive 
%2D 
scenes {often} involves complex programming tasks. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate code 
% excel at generating codes 
from natural language, {their} %the 
output is often error-prone, particularly when scripting {interactions}
% interactive behaviors 
among multiple elements. The linear conversational structure limits {the editing of individual elements,}
% the editing
% % and updating 
% of individual 
{and lacking graphical and precise control}
% components,
% and the lack of graphical control 
complicates {visual integration.}
% the integration of visual information into text inputs. 
To address these issues, {we \yh{integrate
% introduce 
an \emph{element-level modularization}} technique that processes textual descriptions for individual elements through separate LLM modules, with a central module managing interactions {among elements.}}
{This modular approach allows for refining each element independently.} We design a graphical user interface, {\sysName}, which combines modular LLMs with enhanced graphical control to generate code{s} for {2D} interactive scenes. {It enables direct integration of graphical information and offers quick, precise control through automatically generated sliders.}
