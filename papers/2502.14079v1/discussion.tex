\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we investigate the control of population dynamics in a partially observable setting. Despite its practical significance, this problem presents several nontrivial technical challenges due to the interplay between simplex constraints and partial observability.

We develop controller algorithms with $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret that perform effectively against both linear Markov controllers and a broader class of non-Markov linear dynamic controllers. Our results build upon the frameworks of \cite{golowich2024online, simchowitz2020improper}, incorporating key algorithmic and analytical innovations to address the unique challenges of the problem.
