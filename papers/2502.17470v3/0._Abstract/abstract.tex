% ============
Sleep profoundly affects our health, and sleep deficiency or disorders can cause physical and mental problems. 
%
Despite significant findings from previous studies, challenges persist in optimizing deep learning models, especially in multi-modal learning for high-accuracy sleep stage classification. 
%
Our research introduces MC$^2$SleepNet (Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive learning for Sleep stage classification Network). It aims to facilitate the effective collaboration between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures for multi-modal training
%
with the help of contrastive learning and cross-masking.
% 
Raw single channel EEG signals and corresponding spectrogram data provide differently characterized modalities for multi-modal learning.
%
Our MC$^2$SleepNet has achieved \textit{state-of-the-art} performance with an accuracy of both 84.6\% on the SleepEDF-78 and 88.6\% accuracy on the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS).
%
These results demonstrate the effective generalization of our proposed network across both small and large datasets.
