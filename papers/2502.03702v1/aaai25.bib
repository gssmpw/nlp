It does not inherently suffer from the curse of dimensionality, it has asymptotically the same number of parameters as the canonical decomposition, but it is stable and its computation is based on low-rank approximation of auxiliary unfolding matrices. The new form gives a clear and convenient way to implement all basic operations efficiently. A fast rounding procedure is presented, as well as basic linear algebra operations. Examples showing the benefits of the decomposition are given, and the efficiency is demonstrated by the computation of the smallest eigenvalue of a 19-dimensional operator. }

We argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new compilation approaches within the context of existing ones. We also go beyond classical, flat target compilation languages based on CNF and DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large number of target compilation languages.},

abstract = {A recent and effective approach to probabilistic inference calls for reducing the problem to one of weighted model counting (WMC) on a propositional knowledge base. Specifically, the approach calls for encoding the probabilistic model, typically a Bayesian network, as a propositional knowledge base in conjunctive normal form (CNF) with weights associated to each model according to the network parameters. Given this CNF, computing the probability of some evidence becomes a matter of summing the weights of all CNF models consistent with the evidence. A number of variations on this approach have appeared in the literature recently, that vary across three orthogonal dimensions. The first dimension concerns the specific encoding used to convert a Bayesian network into a CNF. The second dimensions relates to whether weighted model counting is performed using a search algorithm on the CNF, or by compiling the CNF into a structure that renders WMC a polytime operation in the size of the compiled structure. The third dimension deals with the specific properties of network parameters (local structure) which are captured in the CNF encoding. In this paper, we discuss recent work in this area across the above three dimensions, and demonstrate empirically its practical importance in significantly expanding the reach of exact probabilistic inference. We restrict our discussion to exact inference and model counting, even though other proposals have been extended for approximate inference and approximate model counting.}

From first principles, we derive a semantic loss function that bridges between neural output vectors and logical constraints. This loss function captures how close the neural network is to satisfying the constraints on its output. An experimental evaluation shows that it effectively guides the learner to achieve (near-)state-of-the-art results on semi-supervised multi-class classification. Moreover, it significantly increases the ability of the neural network to predict structured objects, such as rankings and paths. These discrete concepts are tremendously difficult to learn, and benefit from a tight integration of deep learning and symbolic reasoning methods.}

abstract = {Knowledge compilation has been emerging recently as a new direction of research for dealing with the computational intractability of general propositional reasoning. According to this approach, the reasoning process is split into two phases: an off-line compilation phase and an on-line query-answering phase. In the off-line phase, the propositional theory is compiled into some target language, which is typically a tractable one. In the on-line phase, the compiled target is used to efficiently answer a (potentially) exponential number of queries. The main motivation behind knowledge compilation is to push as much of the computational overhead as possible into the off-line phase, in order to amortize that overhead over all on-line queries. Another motivation behind compilation is to produce very simple on-line reasoning systems, which can be embedded cost-effectively into primitive computational platforms, such as those found in consumer electronics.One of the key aspects of any compilation approach is the target language into which the propositional theory is compiled. Previous target languages included Horn theories, prime implicates/implicants and ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). We propose in this paper a new target compilation language, known as decomposable negation normal form (DNNF), and present a number of its properties that make it of interest to the broad community. Specifically, we show that DNNF is universal; supports a rich set of polynomial--time logical operations; is more space-efficient than OBDDs; and is very simple as far as its structure and algorithms are concerned. Moreover, we present an algorithm for converting any propositional theory in clausal form into a DNNF and show that if the clausal form has a bounded treewidth, then its DNNF compilation has a linear size and can be computed in linear time (treewidth is a graph-theoretic parameter that measures the connectivity of the clausal form). We also propose two techniques for approximating the DNNF compilation of a theory when the size of such compilation is too large to be practical. One of the techniques generates a sound but incomplete compilation, while the other generates a complete but unsound compilation. Together, these approximations bound the exact compilation from below and above in terms of their ability to answer clausal entailment queries. Finally, we show that the class of polynomial--time DNNF operations is rich enough to support relatively complex AI applications, by proposing a specific framework for compiling model-based diagnosis systems.},
