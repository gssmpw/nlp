abstract = {Recent developments related to the energy transition pose particular challenges for distribution grids. Hence, precise load forecasts become more and more important for effective grid management. Novel modeling approaches such as the Transformer architecture, in particular the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), have emerged as promising methods for time series forecasting. To date, just a handful of studies apply TFTs to electricity load forecasting problems, mostly considering only single datasets and a few covariates. Therefore, we examine the potential of the TFT architecture for hourly short-term load forecasting across different time horizons (day-ahead and week-ahead) and network levels (grid and substation level). We find that the TFT architecture does not offer higher predictive performance than a state-of-the-art LSTM model for day-ahead forecasting on the entire grid. However, the results display significant improvements for the TFT when applied at the substation level with a subsequent aggregation to the upper grid-level, resulting in a prediction error of 2.43\% (MAPE) for the best-performing scenario. In addition, the TFT appears to offer remarkable improvements over the LSTM approach for week-ahead forecasting (yielding a predictive error of 2.52\% (MAPE) at the lowest). We outline avenues for future research using the TFT approach for load forecasting, including the exploration of various grid levels (e.g., grid, substation, and household level).},

abstract = {Forecasting electricity demand plays a critical role in ensuring reliable and cost-efficient operation of the electricity supply. With the global transition to distributed renewable energy sources and the electrification of heating and transportation, accurate load forecasts become even more important. While numerous empirical studies and a handful of review articles exist, there is surprisingly little quantitative analysis of the literature, most notably none that identifies the impact of factors on forecasting performance across the entirety of empirical studies. In this article, we therefore present a Meta-Regression Analysis (MRA) that examines factors that influence the accuracy of short-term electricity load forecasts. We use data from 421 forecast models published in 59 studies. While the grid level (esp. individual vs. aggregated vs. system), the forecast granularity, and the algorithms used seem to have a significant impact on the MAPE, bibliometric data, dataset sizes, and prediction horizon show no significant effect. We found the LSTM approach and a combination of neural networks with other approaches to be the best forecasting methods. The results help practitioners and researchers to make meaningful model choices. Yet, this paper calls for further MRA in the field of load forecasting to close the blind spots in research and practice of load forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {Using extensive databases and known algorithms to predict short-term energy consumption comprises most computational solutions based on artificial intelligence today. State-of-the-art approaches validate their prediction models in offline environments that disregard automation, quality monitoring, and retraining challenges present in online scenarios. The existing demand response initiatives lack personalization, thus not engaging consumers. Obtaining specific and valuable recommendations is difficult for most digital platforms due to their solution pattern: extensive database, specialized algorithms, and using profiles with similar aspects. The challenges and present personalization tactics have been researched by adopting a digital twin model. This study creates a different approach by adding structural topology to build a new category of recommendation platform using the digital twin model with real-time data collected by IoT sensors to improve machine learning methods. A residential study case with 31 IoT smart meter and smart plug devices with 19-month data (measurements performed each second) validated Digital Twin MLOps architecture for personalized demand response suggestions based on online short-term energy consumption prediction.},
