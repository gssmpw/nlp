Recently, o1-like models have drawn significant attention, where these models produce the long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning steps to improve the reasoning abilities of existing Large Language Models (LLMs).
% However, the qualities of these long CoTs have not been well investigated.
In this paper,
% Therefore, 
to understand the qualities of these long CoTs and measure the critique abilities of existing LLMs on these long CoTs,
we introduce the \textbf{DeltaBench}\footnote{The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/OpenStellarTeam/DeltaBench}.} including the generated long CoTs from different o1-like models  (e.g., QwQ, DeepSeek-R1) for different reasoning tasks (e.g., Math, Code, General Reasoning), to measure the ability to \textbf{D}etect \textbf{E}rrors in \textbf{L}ong Co\textbf{T} Re\textbf{A}soning.
Based on DeltaBench, we first perform 
fine-grained analysis of the generated long CoTs to discover the effectiveness and efficiency of different o1-like models.
Then, we conduct extensive evaluations of existing process reward models (PRMs) and critic models to detect the errors of each annotated process, which aims to investigate the boundaries and limitations of existing PRMs and critic models.
Finally, we hope that DeltaBench could guide developers to better understand the long CoT reasoning abilities of their models.

% In this work,
% we present \textbf{Chinese SimpleQA}, the first comprehensive Chinese benchmark to evaluate the factuality ability of LLMs to answer short questions, and Chinese SimpleQA mainly has five properties (i.e., Chinese, Diverse, High-quality, Static, Easy-to-evaluate).
% Specifically,
% first, 
% we focus on the \textbf{Chinese} language over 6 major topics with 99 \textbf{diverse} subtopics.
% Second, we conduct a comprehensive quality control process to achieve \textbf{high-quality} questions and answers,
% where reference answers are \textbf{static} and cannot be changed over time.
% Third,
% following SimpleQA, questions and answers are very short, and the grading process is \textbf{easy-to-evaluate}. Based on Chinese SimpleQA, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the factuality abilities of existing LLMs.
