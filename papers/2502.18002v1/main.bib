abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

  abstract={Anomaly or outlier detection is considered as one of the vital applications of data mining, which deals with anomalies or outliers. Anomalies are considered as data points that are dramatically different from the rest of the data points. In this survey, we comprehensively present anomaly detection algorithms in an organized manner. We begin this survey with the definition of anomaly, then provide essential elements of anomaly detection, such as different types of anomaly, different application domains, and evaluation measures. Such anomaly detection algorithms are categorized in seven categories based on their working mechanisms, which includes a total of 52 algorithms. The categories are anomaly detection algorithms based on statistics, density, distance, clustering, isolation, ensemble and subspace. For each category, we provide the time complexity of each algorithm and their general advantages and disadvantages. In the end, we compared all discussed anomaly detection algorithms in detail.}

Simultaneously, it opens a path to exploitable vulnerabilities that go well beyond human control capability. The vulnerabilities deem cyber-security mechanisms essential to assume communication exchange. Secure communication requires security measures to combat the threats and needs advancements to security measures that counter evolving security threats. This paper proposes the use of deep learning architectures to develop an adaptive and resilient network intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and classify network attacks. The emphasis is how deep learning or deep neural networks (DNNs) can facilitate flexible IDS with learning capability to detect recognized and new or zero-day network behavioral features, consequently ejecting the systems intruder and reducing the risk of compromise. To demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, we used the UNSW-NB15 dataset, reflecting real modern network communication behavior with synthetically generated attack activities.}

abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series is an important task in time series analytics because it serves the identification of special events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker. Consequently, many algorithms have been developed for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The enormous number of approaches (i. e., more than 158 as of today), the lack of properly labeled test data, and the complexity of time series anomaly benchmarking have, though, led to a situation where choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.In this demonstration, we present TimeEval, an extensible, scalable and automatic benchmarking toolkit for time series anomaly detection algorithms. TimeEval includes an extensive data generator and supports both interactive and batch evaluation scenarios. With our novel toolkit, we aim to ease the evaluation effort and help the community to provide more meaningful evaluations.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a standard test to monitor the activity of the heart. Many cardiac abnormalities are manifested in the ECG including arrhythmia that refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. The basis of arrhythmia diagnosis is the identification of normal versus abnormal heart beats, and their correct classification based on ECG morphology. This paper proposes a novel and robust approach for representation learning of ECG sequences using a LSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection. The encoder part encodes the ECG signal into a lower dimensional latent space representation and decoder part then tries to reconstruct the specified ECG signal. The model is trained only on normal (non-anomalous) ECG signals. Then reconstruction loss of test ECG signals are calculated. Next a reconstruction loss threshold value is determined from the frequency distribution of the reconstruction losses so that from the reconstruction loss value above a certain threshold is determined as anomaly, otherwise it will be treated as normal. Determination of threshold is done using manual and Kapur’s automated thresholding procedures. The aforementioned model has been applied on publicly available ECG5000 dataset. From the experimental results it is observed that the proposed model achieved more than 98% accuracy having precision, recall and F1 values more than 0.94, 0.97, 0.96 respectively. The performance of the proposed method is also found to be superior in most of the cases as compared to the results of seven other recent counter-part methods reported in the literature.}

  abstract  = {Nowadays, cloud computing provides easy access to a set of variable and configurable computing resources based on user demand through the network. Cloud computing services are available through common internet protocols and network standards. In addition to the unique benefits of cloud computing, insecure communication and attacks on cloud networks cannot be ignored. There are several techniques for dealing with network attacks. To this end, network anomaly detection systems are widely used as an effective countermeasure against network anomalies. The anomaly-based approach generally learns normal traffic patterns in various ways and identifies patterns of anomalies. Network anomaly detection systems have gained much attention in intelligently monitoring network traffic using machine learning methods. This paper presents an efficient model based on autoencoders for anomaly detection in cloud computing networks. The autoencoder learns a basic representation of the normal data and its reconstruction with minimum error. Therefore, the reconstruction error is used as an anomaly or classification metric. In addition, to detecting anomaly data from normal data, the classification of anomaly types has also been investigated. We have proposed a new approach by examining an autoencoder’s anomaly detection method based on data reconstruction error. Unlike the existing autoencoder-based anomaly detection techniques that consider the reconstruction error of all input features as a single value, we assume that the reconstruction error is a vector. This enables our model to use the reconstruction error of every input feature as an anomaly or classification metric. We further propose a multi-class classification structure to classify the anomalies. We use the CIDDS-001 dataset as a commonly accepted dataset in the literature. Our evaluations show that the performance of the proposed method has improved considerably compared to the existing ones in terms of accuracy, recall, false-positive rate, and F1-score metrics.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an area that has received much attention in recent years. It has a wide variety of applications, including fraud detection and network intrusion detection. A good deal of research has been performed in this area, often using strings or attribute-value data as the medium from which anomalies are to be extracted. Little work, however, has focused on anomaly detection in graph-based data. In this paper, we introduce two techniques for graph-based anomaly detection. In addition, we introduce a new method for calculating the regularity of a graph, with applications to anomaly detection. We hypothesize that these methods will prove useful both for finding anomalies, and for determining the likelihood of successful anomaly detection within graph-based data. We provide experimental results using both real-world network intrusion data and artificially-created data.},

  abstract = 	 {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied for graph anomaly detection. As one of the key components for GNN design is to select a tailored spectral filter, we take the first step towards analyzing anomalies via the lens of the graph spectrum. Our crucial observation is the existence of anomalies will lead to the ‘right-shift’ phenomenon, that is, the spectral energy distribution concentrates less on low frequencies and more on high frequencies. This fact motivates us to propose the Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network (BWGNN). Indeed, BWGNN has spectral and spatial localized band-pass filters to better handle the ‘right-shift’ phenomenon in anomalies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BWGNN on four large-scale anomaly detection datasets. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/squareRoot3/Rethinking-Anomaly-Detection.}

	abstract = {Supervised machine learning is the search for algorithms that reason from externally supplied instances
to produce general hypotheses, which then make predictions about future instances. In other words, the
goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms of
predictor features. The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances
where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown. This paper describes various supervised machine learning classification techniques. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all supervised machine learning classification algorithms (also known induction classification algorithms), yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.},

	abstract = {Anomalies refer to the departure of systems and devices from their normal behaviour in standard operating conditions. An anomaly in an industrial device can indicate an upcoming failure, often in the temporal direction. In this paper, we make two contributions: 1) we estimate conditional quantiles and consider three different ways to define anomalies based on the estimated quantiles. 2) we use a new learnable activation function in the popular Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) architecture to model temporal long-range dependency. In particular, we propose Parametric Elliot Function (PEF) as an activation function (AF) inside LSTM, which saturates lately compared to sigmoid and tanh. The proposed algorithms are compared with other well-known anomaly detection algorithms, such as Isolation Forest (iForest), Elliptic Envelope, Autoencoder, and modern Deep Learning models such as Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The algorithms are evaluated in terms of various performance metrics, such as Precision and Recall. The algorithms have been tested on multiple industrial time-series datasets such as Yahoo, AWS, GE, and machine sensors. We have found that the LSTM-based quantile algorithms are very effective and outperformed the existing algorithms in identifying anomalies.},

Such approaches often use well-known methods from machine learning and system identification, i.e., the Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, and Deep Auto Encoders to create process anomaly detectors. Such detectors are then evaluated using data generated from an operational plant or a simulator; rarely is the assessment conducted in real time on a live plant. Regardless of the method to create an anomaly detector, and the data used for performance evaluation, there remain significant challenges that ought to be overcome before such detectors can be deployed with confidence in city-scale plants or large electric power grids. This position paper enumerates such challenges that the authors have faced when creating data-centric anomaly detectors and using them in a live plant.},

However, the Cyber-attacks challenges represent a real threat to systems based on this technology. The resort to the systems of anomaly detection focused on deep learning, also called deep anomaly detection, is an appropriate and efficient means to tackle cyber-attacks on the blockchain. This paper provides an overview of the blockchain technology concept, its characteristics, challenges and limitations, and its systems taxonomy. Numerous blockchain cyber-attacks are discussed such as 51% attacks, selfish mining attacks, double spending attacks, and Sybil attacks, etc. Furthermore, we surveyed an overview of deep anomaly detection systems with their challenges and unresolved issues. In addition, this article gives a glimpse of various deep learning approaches implemented for anomaly detection in the blockchain environment, also presenting several methods that enhance the security features of anomaly detection systems. Finally, we discussed the benefits and drawbacks of these recent advanced approaches in light of three categories, which are discriminative, generative, and hybrid learning with other methods based on graphs and highlighting the ability of the proposed approaches to perform real-time anomaly detection.}

abstract = {We implemented versions of the SVM appropriate for one-class classification in the context of information retrieval. The experiments were conducted on the standard Reuters data set. For the SVM implementation we used both a version of Schoelkopf et al. and a somewhat different version of one-class SVM based on identifying "outlier" data as representative of the second-class. We report on experiments with different kernels for both of these implementations and with different representations of the data, including binary vectors, tf-idf representation and a modification called "Hadamard" representation. Then we compared it with one-class versions of the algorithms prototype (Rocchio), nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, and finally a natural one-class neural network classification method based on "bottleneck" compression generated filters.The SVM approach as represented by Schoelkopf was superior to all the methods except the neural network one, where it was, although occasionally worse, essentially comparable. However, the SVM methods turned out to be quite sensitive to the choice of representation and kernel in ways which are not well understood; therefore, for the time being leaving the neural network approach as the most robust.},

abstract = {Access to high-quality data repositories and benchmarks have been instrumental in advancing the state of the art in many experimental research domains. While advanced analytics tasks over time series data have been gaining lots of attention, lack of such community resources severely limits scientific progress. In this paper, we present Exathlon, the first comprehensive public benchmark for explainable anomaly detection over high-dimensional time series data. Exathlon has been systematically constructed based on real data traces from repeated executions of large-scale stream processing jobs on an Apache Spark cluster. Some of these executions were intentionally disturbed by introducing instances of six different types of anomalous events (e.g., misbehaving inputs, resource contention, process failures). For each of the anomaly instances, ground truth labels for the root cause interval as well as those for the extended effect interval are provided, supporting the development and evaluation of a wide range of anomaly detection (AD) and explanation discovery (ED) tasks. We demonstrate the practical utility of Exathlon's dataset, evaluation methodology, and end-to-end data science pipeline design through an experimental study with three state-of-the-art AD and ED techniques.},

abstract = {The detection of anomalies in time series has gained ample academic and industrial attention. However, no comprehensive benchmark exists to evaluate time-series anomaly detection methods. It is common to use (i) proprietary or synthetic data, often biased to support particular claims; or (ii) a limited collection of publicly available datasets. Consequently, we often observe methods performing exceptionally well in one dataset but surprisingly poorly in another, creating an illusion of progress. To address the issues above, we thoroughly studied over one hundred papers to identify, collect, process, and systematically format datasets proposed in the past decades. We summarize our effort in TSB-UAD, a new benchmark to ease the evaluation of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods. Overall, TSB-UAD contains 13766 time series with labeled anomalies spanning different domains with high variability of anomaly types, ratios, and sizes. TSB-UAD includes 18 previously proposed datasets containing 1980 time series and we contribute two collections of datasets. Specifically, we generate 958 time series using a principled methodology for transforming 126 time-series classification datasets into time series with labeled anomalies. In addition, we present data transformations with which we introduce new anomalies, resulting in 10828 time series with varying complexity for anomaly detection. Finally, we evaluate 12 representative methods demonstrating that TSB-UAD is a robust resource for assessing anomaly detection methods. We make our data and code available at www.timeseries.org/TSB-UAD. TSB-UAD provides a valuable, reproducible, and frequently updated resource to establish a leaderboard of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods.},

abstract = {In recent years, specific evaluation metrics for time series anomaly detection algorithms have been developed to handle the limitations of the classical precision and recall. However, such metrics are heuristically built as an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe out the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the limitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of the recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary algorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak assumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of "affiliation'' between the ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our proposal against various public time series anomaly detection datasets, algorithms and metrics. We further derive theoretical properties of the affiliation metrics that give explicit expectations about their behavior and ensure robustness against adversary strategies.},

abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.},

However, most studies apply a peculiar evaluation protocol called point adjustment (PA) before scoring. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally reveal that the PA protocol has a great possibility of overestimating the detection performance; even a random anomaly score can easily turn into a state-of-the-art TAD method. Therefore, the comparison of TAD methods after applying the PA protocol can lead to misguided rankings. Furthermore, we question the potential of existing TAD methods by showing that an untrained model obtains comparable detection performance to the existing methods even when PA is forbidden. Based on our findings, we propose a new baseline and an evaluation protocol.

abstract = {One truism of deep learning is that the automatic feature engineering (seen in the first layers of those networks) excuses data scientists from performing tedious manual feature engineering prior to running DL. For the specific case of deep learning for defect prediction, we show that that truism is false. Specifically, when we pre-process data with a novel oversampling technique called fuzzy sampling, as part of a larger pipeline called GHOST (Goal-oriented Hyper-parameter Optimization for Scalable Training), then we can do significantly better than the prior DL state of the art in 14/20 defect data sets. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results significantly faster deep learners. These results present a cogent case for the use of oversampling prior to applying deep learning on software defect prediction datasets.},

abstract = {Outlier detection refers to the identification of rare items that are deviant from the general data distribution. Existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, low predictive capability, and limited interpretability. As a remedy, we present a novel outlier detection algorithm called COPOD, which is inspired by copulas for modeling multivariate data distribution. COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of &quot;extremeness&quot;. Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.},

Those approaches which do exist involve networks trained to perform a task other than anomaly detection, namely generative models or compression, which are in turn adapted for use in anomaly detection; they are not trained on an anomaly detection based objective. In this paper we introduce a new anomaly detection method—Deep Support Vector Data Description—, which is trained on an anomaly detection based objective. The adaptation to the deep regime necessitates that our neural network and training procedure satisfy certain properties, which we demonstrate theoretically. We show the effectiveness of our method on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image benchmark datasets as well as on the detection of adversarial examples of GTSRB stop signs.}

abstract="Many of the existing approaches to anomaly detection are based upon supervised learning and heavily dependent on training datasets. However, anomalies rarely occur in most industrial systems. Hence it is challenging to retrieve a training dataset labeled with true anomalies. Therefore, this motivates us to investigate such scenarios where it is arduous to get labeled data for anomalies. This paper has proposed a clustering-based recursive anomaly detection algorithm; dynamic-Binary Tree Anomaly Identifier (d-BTAI). d-BTAI has been applied on industrial devices since anomalies in large industrial devices can incur massive losses. The algorithm has experimented on various publicly available industrial datasets such as Cloudwatch, Yahoo, and Backblaze. d-BTAI has attained a higher Area under the ROC curve (AUC) in comparison with Isolation Forest (iForest), One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), and Elliptic Envelope. The higher Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and specificity value demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy on multiple datasets.",

More challengingly, how can we do this in a way that captures complex inter-sensor relationships, and detects and explains anomalies which deviate from these relationships? Recently, deep learning approaches have enabled improvements in anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets; however, existing methods do not explicitly learn the structure of existing relationships between variables, or use them to predict the expected behavior of time series. Our approach combines a structure learning approach with graph neural networks, additionally using attention weights to provide explainability for the detected anomalies. Experiments on two real-world sensor datasets with ground truth anomalies show that our method detects anomalies more accurately than baseline approaches, accurately captures correlations between sensors, and allows users to deduce the root cause of a detected anomaly.}, number={5}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Deng, Ailin and Hooi, Bryan}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={4027-4035} }

	abstract = {The development of neural techniques has opened up new avenues for research in machine translation. Today, neural machine translation (NMT) systems can leverage highly multilingual capacities and even perform zero-shot translation, delivering promising results in terms of language coverage and quality. However, scaling quality NMT requires large volumes of parallel bilingual data, which are not equally available for the 7,000+ languages in the world1. Focusing on improving the translation qualities of a relatively small group of high-resource languages comes at the expense of directing research attention to low-resource languages, exacerbating digital inequities in the long run. To break this pattern, here we introduce No Language Left Behind—a single massively multilingual model that leverages transfer learning across languages. We developed a conditional computational model based on the Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts architecture2–7, which we trained on data obtained with new mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. Furthermore, we devised multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. We evaluated the performance of our model over 40,000 translation directions using tools created specifically for this purpose—an automatic benchmark (FLORES-200), a human evaluation metric (XSTS) and a toxicity detector that covers every language in our model. Compared with the previous state-of-the-art models, our model achieves an average of 44\% improvement in translation quality as measured by BLEU. By demonstrating how to scale NMT to 200 languages and making all contributions in this effort freely available for non-commercial use, our work lays important groundwork for the development of a universal translation system.},
