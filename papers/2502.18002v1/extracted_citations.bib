abstract = {The widespread use of interconnectivity and interoperability of computing systems have become an indispensable necessity to enhance our daily activities. Simultaneously, it opens a path to exploitable vulnerabilities that go well beyond human control capability. The vulnerabilities deem cyber-security mechanisms essential to assume communication exchange. Secure communication requires security measures to combat the threats and needs advancements to security measures that counter evolving security threats. This paper proposes the use of deep learning architectures to develop an adaptive and resilient network intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and classify network attacks. The emphasis is how deep learning or deep neural networks (DNNs) can facilitate flexible IDS with learning capability to detect recognized and new or zero-day network behavioral features, consequently ejecting the systems intruder and reducing the risk of compromise. To demonstrate the model’s effectiveness, we used the UNSW-NB15 dataset, reflecting real modern network communication behavior with synthetically generated attack activities.}

abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series is an important task in time series analytics because it serves the identification of special events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker. Consequently, many algorithms have been developed for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The enormous number of approaches (i. e., more than 158 as of today), the lack of properly labeled test data, and the complexity of time series anomaly benchmarking have, though, led to a situation where choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.In this demonstration, we present TimeEval, an extensible, scalable and automatic benchmarking toolkit for time series anomaly detection algorithms. TimeEval includes an extensive data generator and supports both interactive and batch evaluation scenarios. With our novel toolkit, we aim to ease the evaluation effort and help the community to provide more meaningful evaluations.},

abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a standard test to monitor the activity of the heart. Many cardiac abnormalities are manifested in the ECG including arrhythmia that refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. The basis of arrhythmia diagnosis is the identification of normal versus abnormal heart beats, and their correct classification based on ECG morphology. This paper proposes a novel and robust approach for representation learning of ECG sequences using a LSTM autoencoder for anomaly detection. The encoder part encodes the ECG signal into a lower dimensional latent space representation and decoder part then tries to reconstruct the specified ECG signal. The model is trained only on normal (non-anomalous) ECG signals. Then reconstruction loss of test ECG signals are calculated. Next a reconstruction loss threshold value is determined from the frequency distribution of the reconstruction losses so that from the reconstruction loss value above a certain threshold is determined as anomaly, otherwise it will be treated as normal. Determination of threshold is done using manual and Kapur’s automated thresholding procedures. The aforementioned model has been applied on publicly available ECG5000 dataset. From the experimental results it is observed that the proposed model achieved more than 98% accuracy having precision, recall and F1 values more than 0.94, 0.97, 0.96 respectively. The performance of the proposed method is also found to be superior in most of the cases as compared to the results of seven other recent counter-part methods reported in the literature.}

abstract = {Access to high-quality data repositories and benchmarks have been instrumental in advancing the state of the art in many experimental research domains. While advanced analytics tasks over time series data have been gaining lots of attention, lack of such community resources severely limits scientific progress. In this paper, we present Exathlon, the first comprehensive public benchmark for explainable anomaly detection over high-dimensional time series data. Exathlon has been systematically constructed based on real data traces from repeated executions of large-scale stream processing jobs on an Apache Spark cluster. Some of these executions were intentionally disturbed by introducing instances of six different types of anomalous events (e.g., misbehaving inputs, resource contention, process failures). For each of the anomaly instances, ground truth labels for the root cause interval as well as those for the extended effect interval are provided, supporting the development and evaluation of a wide range of anomaly detection (AD) and explanation discovery (ED) tasks. We demonstrate the practical utility of Exathlon's dataset, evaluation methodology, and end-to-end data science pipeline design through an experimental study with three state-of-the-art AD and ED techniques.},

abstract = {The detection of anomalies in time series has gained ample academic and industrial attention. However, no comprehensive benchmark exists to evaluate time-series anomaly detection methods. It is common to use (i) proprietary or synthetic data, often biased to support particular claims; or (ii) a limited collection of publicly available datasets. Consequently, we often observe methods performing exceptionally well in one dataset but surprisingly poorly in another, creating an illusion of progress. To address the issues above, we thoroughly studied over one hundred papers to identify, collect, process, and systematically format datasets proposed in the past decades. We summarize our effort in TSB-UAD, a new benchmark to ease the evaluation of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods. Overall, TSB-UAD contains 13766 time series with labeled anomalies spanning different domains with high variability of anomaly types, ratios, and sizes. TSB-UAD includes 18 previously proposed datasets containing 1980 time series and we contribute two collections of datasets. Specifically, we generate 958 time series using a principled methodology for transforming 126 time-series classification datasets into time series with labeled anomalies. In addition, we present data transformations with which we introduce new anomalies, resulting in 10828 time series with varying complexity for anomaly detection. Finally, we evaluate 12 representative methods demonstrating that TSB-UAD is a robust resource for assessing anomaly detection methods. We make our data and code available at www.timeseries.org/TSB-UAD. TSB-UAD provides a valuable, reproducible, and frequently updated resource to establish a leaderboard of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods.},

abstract = {In recent years, specific evaluation metrics for time series anomaly detection algorithms have been developed to handle the limitations of the classical precision and recall. However, such metrics are heuristically built as an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe out the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the limitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of the recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary algorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak assumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of "affiliation'' between the ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our proposal against various public time series anomaly detection datasets, algorithms and metrics. We further derive theoretical properties of the affiliation metrics that give explicit expectations about their behavior and ensure robustness against adversary strategies.},

abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.},

However, most studies apply a peculiar evaluation protocol called point adjustment (PA) before scoring. In this paper, we theoretically and experimentally reveal that the PA protocol has a great possibility of overestimating the detection performance; even a random anomaly score can easily turn into a state-of-the-art TAD method. Therefore, the comparison of TAD methods after applying the PA protocol can lead to misguided rankings. Furthermore, we question the potential of existing TAD methods by showing that an untrained model obtains comparable detection performance to the existing methods even when PA is forbidden. Based on our findings, we propose a new baseline and an evaluation protocol.
