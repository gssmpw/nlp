\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Robust Frequentist Federated Learning} In the frequentist setting, building on the seminal paper of ____, many approaches have aimed at mitigating challenges in FL, such as robustness to adversarial servers through secure aggregation ____, to stragglers ____, heterogenous data in out--of--distribution generalisation ____, heterogeneous and asynchronous clients ____, or finding weaknesses in communications ____. 
More recently, %
work on robust server aggregations achieves robustness against Byzantine clients that aim to deteriorate model performance ____. However these do not allow principled uncertainty quantification.

\paragraph{Federated Bayesian Inference}
Federated and distributed Bayesian methods aim to approximate the posterior as if it had been computed with the data of all clients available at a central server. 
Early work on distributed Bayesian inference includes Bayesian opinion pools ____, and the Bayesian Committee machine ____, which aim to find a consensus among a collection of Bayesian beliefs. 
Works that aim to operationalise this in the distributed setting, where data is split IID across clients, include Expectation Propagation ____, and consensus based Monte Carlo ____.
In the Federated setting this assumption is often violated, as data is not split homogeneously and IID across participating devices. 
From this perspective, most approaches to Bayesian FL can be categorised into finding an approximate posterior through variational inference ____,  Markov Chain Monte Carlo ____, or directly learning a Bayesian neural network ____ or Gaussian Process ____. However, none of these  are robust to contamination and model misspecification.



\paragraph{Robust Bayesian Inference} 
Although the existing Bayesian FL methods address some of the challenges of federated learning, such as communication constraints and data heterogeneity, they still aim to approximate the Bayesian posterior, which in itself is a flawed objective under model misspecification ____.
In the global, non-federated case, several methods have been proposed to combat misspecification in the Bayesian setting ____, with the most promising direction being Generalised Bayesian Inference ____. In this work we capitalise on this front and bring robustness to model misspecification in the federated setting.
