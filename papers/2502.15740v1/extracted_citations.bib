    abstract = "Source code authorship attribution is the task of identifying who develops the code based on learning based on the programmer style. It is one of the critical activities which used extensively in different aspects such as computer security, computer law, and plagiarism. This paper attempts to investigate source code authorship attribution by capturing natural language aspects of the code rather than only using minimal set of syntactic and stylistic code features as explored in the previous literature. It proposes an evolutionary feature selection model to improve the accuracy of authorship attribution by implementing two language models (uni-gram and bi-gram). The proposed approach uses K-Nearest Neighbor as a classifier and Genetic Algorithm as a feature selection technique. Two experiments have been demonstrated on a public Authorship Attribution dataset on GitHub, the experiments include various evolutionary feature selection models. Notably, the obtained results in both experiments were compared with the related studies, and show a significant improvement in terms of accuracy.",

ABSTRACT = {Software authorship attribution, defined as the problem of software authentication and resolution of source code ownership, is of major relevance in the software engineering field. Authorship analysis of source code is more difficult than the classic task on literature, but it would be of great use in various software development activities such as software maintenance, software quality analysis or project management. This paper addresses the problem of code authorship attribution and introduces, as a proof of concept, a new supervised classification model AutoSoft for identifying the developer of a certain piece of code. The proposed model is composed of an ensemble of autoencoders that are trained to encode and recognize the programming style of software developers. An extension of the AutoSoft classifier, able to recognize an unknown developer (a developer that was not seen during the training), is also discussed and evaluated. Experiments conducted on software programs collected from the Google Code Jam data set highlight the performance of the proposed model in various test settings. A comparison to existing similar solutions for code authorship attribution indicates that AutoSoft outperforms most of them. Moreover, AutoSoft provides the advantage of adaptability, illustrated through a series of extensions such as the definition of class membership probabilities and the re-framing of the AutoSoft system to address one-class classification.},
