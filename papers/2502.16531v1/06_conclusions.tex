\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This work focuses on MAS coordination and synchronization under recurring LTL. We extended the bottom-up scheme for distributed motion and task coordination of MAS in \cite{meng_paper}, reducing computational complexity to enhance scalability and enable deployment on robotic hardware. The package was developed in ROS2, with a synchronization mechanism to handle action delays in experiments. Future work will focus on developing additional actions and incorporating human-in-the-loop scenarios.
