    \caption{Illustration of the critique-correction process for a coding problem. Top: An initial solution is proposed by the task-performing using a min-heap approach. Bottom: The critic identifies flaws in the implementation (incorrect heap access and inefficient query handling) and suggests specific improvements, leading to a corrected max-heap solution. This example is taken from critiques of {\ours} on LiveCodeBench, which demonstrates how structured feedback from the critic can guide meaningful improvements in code generation.}
