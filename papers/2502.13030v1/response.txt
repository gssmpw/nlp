%The basic concept of prediction sets dates back to foundational works such as Vieira2010, Shafer2008, Dawid2000, and Koltchinskii2009.
The early ideas of conformal prediction were developed in Vovk2001.
With the rise of machine learning, conformal prediction has emerged as a widely used framework for constructing prediction sets Lei2013distribution.

% A wide range of predictive inference methods have been developed  Lei2019uncertainty.
Classical conformal prediction guarantees validity when the calibration and test data are drawn from the same distribution. In contrast, when there is distribution shift between the calibration and test data Lei2018distribution, coverage may not hold.
%One common type of dataset shift is covariate shift, where only the distribution of input features changes while the conditional distribution of the outcome given the features remains unchanged.
Covariate shift is a type of dataset shift that arises in many settings, e.g., when predicting disease risk for individuals whose features may evolve over time, while the outcome distribution conditioned on the features remains stable Lei2013distribution. 
%Covariate shift is also observed in domains like image processing, where variations in color and lighting Guan2022prediction or adversarial perturbations Guan2023localized alter the input distribution without affecting the labels' conditional distribution.

Numerous works have addressed conformal prediction under various types of distribution shift Lei2019uncertainty. For example, Guan2022prediction investigated conformal prediction under covariate shift, assuming the likelihood ratio between source and target covariates is known. Guan2023localized allowed the likelihood ratio to be estimated, rather than assuming it is known. Romano2020classification developed prediction sets with a calibration-set conditional (PAC) property under covariate shift. Dobriban2023symmpi developed prediction sets with asymptotic coverage that are doubly robust in the sense that their coverage error is bounded by the product of the estimation errors of the quantile function of the score and the likelihood ratio. Lei2019conformal construct prediction sets based on a distributionally robust optimization approach.
% ____ develop methods based on an isotonic regression estimate of the likelihood ratio.
% ____ combine a parametric working model with a resampling approach to construct prediction sets under covariate shift.
% ____ analyze weighted conformal prediction in the special case of covariate shifts defined by a finite number of groups.
% ____ reweight samples to adapt to covariate shift, while simultaneously using distributionally robust optimization to protect against worst-case distribution shifts.
% ____ construct prediction sets by using unlabeled test data to modify the score function used for conformal prediction.

In contrast, our algorithm entirely avoids estimating the likelihood ratio function. Rather, it works by constructing a novel regularized regression objective, whose stationary conditions ensure coverage in the test domain.
We can minimize the objective by estimating certain expectations of the data distribution---which implicitly involve estimating only certain functionals of the likelihood ratio.
We further show that the coverage is retained in finite samples via a novel analysis of coverage leveraging stability bounds Lei2024batch. We illustrate that our algorithms behave better in high-dimensional datasets than existing methods.

We build on their approach, but develop a novel regularization scheme that Guan2023localized allows us to effectively optimize over a data-driven class,
adaptive to the unknown shift $r$.
