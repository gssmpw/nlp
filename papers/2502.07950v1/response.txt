%\subsection{Soft Skills in SE Education}
\subsubsection{Unveiling the Challenge: Enhancing Soft Skills in SE Students}

Traditionally, SE programs have primarily emphasized technical skills (also known as ``hard skills'') like programming, software testing, and system architecture. However, the constantly evolving nature of the software industry and the collaborative demands of modern workplaces have emphasized the importance of soft skills. These skills encompass a broad range of characteristics, including personality traits, social interaction abilities, communication, and personal habits ____**Kechagias, "Soft Skills in Software Engineering"**, ____**Capretz and Ahmed, "Promoting Soft Skills in SE"**. According to **Kechagias**, soft skills can be defined as ``intra and inter personal (socio-emotional) skills'' that are essential for personal development, social participation, and workplace success. **Capretz and Ahmed** ____ advocate for promoting soft skills in SE to enhance career prospects and better prepare practitioners for the industry's challenges. This need is also driven by the increasing complexity and interdisciplinary nature of software projects ____.

%Capretz and Ahmed ____ advocate for promoting soft skills in SE to enhance career prospects and better prepare practitioners for the industry's challenges and rapid evolution. Another key driver of this shift is the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of software projects ____.

%Consequently, SE scholars are striving to balance the development of both technical and soft skills to better prepare students for real-world challenges.

%Successful software development depends on how software practitioners perform their tasks and how they interact with their peers ____. As stated by **Kechagias, "Software as a By-Product"**, ``software is a by-product of human activities, such as problem solving capabilities, cognitive aspects, and social interaction''.

%The job requirements in the field of SE usually divide the skill requirements into the two categories of “hard skills” (technical requirements and knowledge a person should have to carry out a task) and “soft skills” (a broad range of characteristics involving personality types, social interaction abilities, communication, and personal habit) ____. In line with this definition, ____ claim that soft skills could be understood as “intra and inter personal (socio-emotional) skills” essential for personal development, social participation and workplace success. While much of our SE research is technical and comprise hard skills, the importance of addressing soft skills has been also attracting considerable attention both by industry and academy ____.

From an educational lens, teaching soft skills presents challenges because these skills cannot be passively acquired through theoretical knowledge alone ____. SE scholars have been investigated active learning methods to enhance students' soft skills. These proposals include, for example, project-based learning ____, game-based learning ____, and problem-based learning ____.  While these approaches are valuable and contribute to soft skill development, they may not fully replicate the fast-paced, high-pressure, and collaborative nature of software projects. Hackathons, in contrast, provide an immersive environment where students must rapidly adapt and collaborate under specific constraints, making them a promising complementary strategy for enhancing soft skills ____**Kolb, "Experiential Learning"**, ____**Dewey, "Democracy and Education"**.

%Researchers have been closely studying the pedagogical potential of hackathons in SE education. For example, ____ conducted a literature review, drawing from their years of learning experiences, as well as written and interview materials from students and industry participants, to provide an overview of hackathons and code camps. More ahead, ____ conducted a systematic literature review to investigate the current state of using code camps and hackathons in SE and computer science education.

%____, conducted a case study on an educational hackathon to understand the factors that may affect students' participation, their perceptions of the event, and the SE practices they adopt. They found that hackathons can serve practical pedagogical purposes since students believe they can improve their skills through participation in these competitions. In another study, ____ investigated the professional skills developed by students who participate in hackathons and how intense collaboration takes place in an atypical scenario while solving problematic situations. In turn, ____ evaluated students' capability to apply the skills they learned in their courses to the hackathon setting, especially those related to SE best practices. 

%____ introduced hackathons as part of their SE program curriculum and proposed a specific hackathon setup. The outcome of the hackathon was evaluated based on a survey completed by students, mentors, and industry representatives. All groups reported high satisfaction with the hackathon. ____ also examined the educational contribution of hackathons as a replacement for exams in software engineering education. Their preliminary study at an IT university revealed a positive reception among students. They found that hackathons are suitable for final evaluations in Software Quality courses, as they motivate students to learn material beyond the course curriculum.

%____ showcased a real-life case study involving a hackathon for potential college students in a university's data science program. They offered a structured framework and suggests practical principles and guidelines for designing hackathons.  ____ introduced a methodology to be used in project-oriented undergraduate courses where a hackathon dynamic can be employed as a realistic scenario to practice the knowledge acquired in classes. They conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis to evaluate the usage of the methodology in an IoT undergraduate course. ____ investigated the proposition of a hackathon blended model as an appropriate method for increasing students’ interest and understanding in computer science and encouraging their engagement in using computing skills and knowledge. Preliminary findings have produced not significant, but positive results acceptable to apply hackathon to the curricular.

%____ integrated a hackathon component in a software development and architecture course curriculum to evaluate the effect of working on a real-world web development project in a hackathon setting on deepening the theoretical concepts learnt in lectures. The data is collected through two surveys which were accessible to students before and after the hackathon and students code commits on GitHub.  Research findings shown the importance of hackathon participation on students’ performance and state of knowledge.

%____ builds upon a previously published work ____ in progress, finding that students who attended hackathons and a project-based learning Software Engineering degree, built transferable skills between hackathons and capstones. Participants described the employment of software design methodologies in both hackathons and capstone projects, various problem solving and researching approaches used, and a distinct level of attention to the context of development, informal or formal, to determine their courses of actions.

\subsubsection{Research Gap} Although some papers have previously addressed this issue, there is a scarcity of studies specifically focusing on the role of hackathons in developing soft skills among SE students. We found no other work discussing these results through the lens of SDT. Further exploration of these aspects could help optimize hackathon design to enhance their educational impact and bridge the gap between technical proficiency and soft skills development in SE education.

%Even though some papers have already addressed this issue, there is a general scarcity of studies focusing specifically on the role of hackathons in developing soft skills among SE students. We also do not found other work discussing the results in the light of SDT. Continuing to examine these aspects can offer guidance on how to optimize hackathon structures to maximize their educational impact and, consequently, bridge the gap between technical proficiency and soft skills development in SE education.

%Even with som paper already addressing, there is a overall scarcity of studies whose primary aim is to investigate the role of hackathons in developing soft skills among SE students. More specifically, exploring these aspects can provide directions into optimizing hackathon structures to maximize their educational impact, thus bridging the gap between technical proficiency and soft skills development in SE education.
