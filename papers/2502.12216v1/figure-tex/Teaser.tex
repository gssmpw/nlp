    \caption{Comparison between fixed-budget-based methods and \sys. Fixed-budget-based methods may select excessive tokens or have a large difference from full attention score. In contrast, \sys dynamically selects tokens to efficiently approximate full attention based on a cumulative attention score, considering variation of sparsity across different query tokens and contexts.}
