    \caption{t-SNE visualization of 500 Key vectors. Consecutive tokens are connected by lines. There are significant jumps and discontinuities even if tokens are consecutive. This indicates that adjacent tokens may not have similar K-vectors. Nonetheless, at the center of the figure (circled), K-vectors from different segments of the text show high similarity.}
