\section{Limitations}
While our work provides new insights into the geometry of refusal in LLMs, some limitations remain. The refusal directions we compute are all optimized on the same targets, which may limit their ability to capture fully distinct mechanisms. Extending our method to incorporate diverse targets or leveraging reinforcement learning with a judge-based reward function could help identify additional independent mechanisms \cite{geisler_reinforce_2025}.
Furthermore, while we establish the existence of higher-dimensional refusal cones, we cannot rule out the possibility of other yet-undiscovered regions in the model that mediate refusal. %
