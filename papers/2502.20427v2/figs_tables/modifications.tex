\hline

\textbf{No Attack}: Original audio, no modifications.\\ \hline
%\todo{AS: Wouldn't this look better in double columns?} 
\textbf{Add Background Music}: Music from \texttt{Musan}~\cite{musan} or \texttt{Free Music Archive}~\cite{free-music-archive} overlaid at 50\% volume. \\ \hline
\textbf{Add Background Noise}: Noise from \texttt{Noise ESC 50}~\cite{esc-50} or \texttt{Musan}~\cite{musan} datasets added at 50\% relative volume. \\ \hline
\textbf{Amplitude Modulation}: Amplitude modulated by multiplying the signal with a sine wave of frequency between 0.5 and 5 Hz. \\ \hline
\textbf{Autotune}: Pitch corrected to the nearest value in a predefined scale (e.g., C major) using~\cite{autotune-software}. \\ \hline
\textbf{Bit Depth Change}: Reduced to 8 bits using \texttt{pydub.AudioSegment.set\_sample\_width(8)}~\cite{pydub}. \\ \hline
\textbf{Echo}: Echo added with delay between 0.1 and 1 second and decay between 0.3 and 0.9. \\ \hline
\textbf{Equalization}: 2 to 10 bands (1,000–10,000 Hz) with gains between ±4 and 15 dB. \\ \hline
\textbf{Freq Minus}: Subtracts 0.01–0.1 energy at random STFT frequencies between 0 and 4300 Hz. \\ \hline
\textbf{Freq Plus}: Adds 0.01–0.1 energy at random STFT frequencies between 0 and 4300 Hz. \\ \hline
\textbf{Gaussian Noise}: Gaussian noise with mean 0 and a standard deviation randomly selected between 0.01 and 0.2 added to the audio. \\ \hline
\textbf{High Pass Filter}: Butterworth high-pass filter applied with a cutoff frequency randomly selected between 2000 and 4000 Hz. \\ \hline
\textbf{Low Pass Filter}: Butterworth low-pass filter applied with a cutoff frequency randomly selected between 300 and 3000 Hz. \\ \hline
\textbf{MP3 Compression}: Converted to MP3 with a randomly selected bitrate between 4 and 48 kbps using \texttt{pydub.AudioSegment.export()}~\cite{pydub}. \\ \hline
\textbf{Pitch Shift}: Pitch shifted by -5 to +5 semitones using \texttt{librosa.effects.pitch\_shift()}~\cite{librosa}. \\ \hline
\textbf{Reverb}: Reverb applied via convolution with a randomly chosen decay factor between 1 and 10. \\ \hline
\textbf{Silence Injection}: Inserts a silent segment of random length between 0.1 and 2 seconds at the beginning of the audio. \\ \hline
\textbf{Time Stretch}: Audio speed modified by a factor between 0.8 (slower) and 1.2 (faster) using \texttt{librosa.effects.time\_stretch()}~\cite{librosa}. \\ \hline
