Suppose we have a source domain $D^{s} = \{(X^{s}_{i}, Y^{s}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N_{s}}$ and an unseen target domain $D^{t} = \{(X^{t}_{i}, Y^{t}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N_{t}}$, where s and t represent source and target domain respectively. $N_{s}$ is the number of source domain samples while $X^{s}_{i}$ means the $i$-th source point cloud and $Y^{s}_{i}$ is it's corresponding label. The label $Y^{s}_{i}$ is parameterized by its center $(c_{x}, c_{y}, c_{z})$, size $(l, w, h)$, and the heading angle $\theta$. Our objective is to train a 3D object detector on the source domain $D^{s}$, enhancing its generalization ability so that it excels not only in the source domain but also demonstrates strong performance on unseen domain $D^{t}$.
