\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a method to enhance the generalization ability of LiDAR-based 3D object detection, making the detector more robust to changes in point clouds density. We introduce confidence-based downsampling to simulate point clouds under various densities based on the confidence score. We also adopt the student-teacher framework with our proposed alignment losses to preserve both the low-level content consistency and the high-level relationship consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits better generalization ability compared to other baselines.
