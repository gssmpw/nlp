In the appendix, we provide a more comprehensive analysis of the main text, enriched with additional details to enhance understanding.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_com_pixart}, we provide a detailed comparison between our method and the baseline method, Pixart-$\alpha$~\cite{chen2023pixart}, which demonstrates weaker text comprehension capabilities. Our approach shows significant improvements in terms of aesthetic quality and prompt adherence.

In Fig~\ref{fig:appendix_hi}, we perform an extensive comparison utilizing the Human Instruction with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct~\cite{yang2024qwen2} of a large language model (LLM), consistent with the version applied in the main text. Our Human Instruction method ensures that the LLM's outputs not only sustain a high CLIP score but also avoid generating non-existent information. Furthermore, this method enhances the accuracy of text embeddings, leading to more reliable outcomes.

Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_multi} displays more multilingual generation results. Although some images show slight deficiencies in adhering to the prompts, they still produce outstanding results for many common scene. 


Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_more_vis} showcases images produced from multiple perspectives, including color, theme, style, etc. These varied perspectives effectively illustrate the effectiveness and adaptability of LDGen,
