\section{Closing Remarks}

Our key contribution is the proposal of using an ODE to enable concise representation and efficient optimization for 
bundle distributions in menu-based CA deep learning, where these bundle distributions could in principle require an exponential representation size. We show that maintaining and effectively manipulating these  bundle distributions is important in achieving superior auction revenue. We also discuss possible directions for extending our method to a general multi-bidder CA design algorithm. We hope these ideas and findings can provide new inspiration and perspectives for research in combinatorial auctions.
