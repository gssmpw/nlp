\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose \solution, a system that unlocks the full efficiency of token filtering in LLM training. \solution maintains sparsity by further filtering the activations and transforms sparse GEMM into dense GEMM to optimize efficiency on existing hardware. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that \solution effectively achieves its design targets.
