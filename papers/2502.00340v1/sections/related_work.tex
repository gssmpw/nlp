\section{Related Work} \label{sec:related_work}

Apart from the studies introduced in \S\ref{sec:background_motivation}, the following research topic is also closely related to our work.

\parab{Data Selection.} Data selection is a pre-processing technique (\ie, applied before training) aimed at improving data quality. Typically, it involves selecting diverse and high-quality training samples~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2410-08102}. Data selection occurs at the sample level prior to training, while our work focuses on token-level filtering during the training process. Theoretically, \solution functions as a fine-grained data selection method during training, selecting important tokens.
