  comment    = {介绍WekaCoin的共识机制PoL，通过这一机制可以完全将算力用于有意义的模型训练中，但是需要以一个可以接受的速率保证机器学习任务的供给。
该共识机制中设计了三种交易类型，分别为标准交易、任务发布交易与模型交易，共识中涉及三种角色：supplier、trainer、validator。
supplier是提供机器学习竞赛的平台，需要通过任务发布交易发布机器学习任务。在任务发布交易中除了任务信息还包含了报酬以及发布测试集的区块高度。supplier必须及时在区块链达到约定的区块高度之后发布测试集，之后从validator处得到模型。
trainer选择一个任务进行训练，通过模型交易支付参与费并将训练好的模型的哈希值注册在区块链上，并在supplier发布测试数据之后将模型数据上传。（没有办法避免其他节点得到模型哈希值之后抢先注册在区块链上）
validator根据trainer提交的模型交易中的哈希值在IPFS上下载模型，并在supplier提供的测试数据上评估该模型。之后根据性能指标产生候选排行表，产生新块。最后通过流言协议将新块和候选排行发送给其他验证者。验证者之间相互验证，得到“真”候选排行。最后validator合并候选排行和候选块，在一定次数的迭代之后得到共识区块和共识排行。（通过VRF实现加密货币抽签，确定委员会成员；通过存储证明方法对每个节点加权，被选择的可能性与节点存储的数据集、模型的容量成比例，但是这两点似乎没有体现在验证过程中。）
最后在区块提交阶段在区块中添加交易完成激励的分配。任务奖励分配给排名最高的trainer，任务主持费用平均分配给所有有效的validator，排名前25%的trainer返还任务参与费而剩余的参与费平均分配给validator，新的weka币平分给所有有效validator。（这种分配方式可能无法对trainer产生足够激励。）

  abstract  = {Blockchains based on Proof-of-Work can maintain a distributed ledger with a high security guarantee but also lead to severe energy waste due to the useless hash calculation. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) mechanisms are alternatives, but finding hard puzzles with easy verification and useful results is challenging. Recent popular deep learning algorithms require large amount of computation resources due to the large-scale training datasets and the complexity of the models. The work of deep learning training is useful, and the model verification process is much shorter than its training process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose DLchain, a PoUW-based blockchain using deep learning training as the hard puzzle. Theoretical analysis shows that DLchain can achieve a security level comparable to existing PoW-based cryptocurrency when the miners' best interest is to maximize their revenue. Notably, this is achieved without relying on common assumptions made in existing PoUW-based blockchain such as globally synchronized timestamps. Simulated experiments also show that the extra network delay caused by data transfer and the full nodes' validation is acceptable.},

  abstract   = {In most popular public accessible cryptocurrency systems, the mining pool plays a key role because mining cryptocurrency with the mining pool turns the non-profitable situation into profitable for individual miners. In many recent novel blockchain consensuses, the deep learning training procedure becomes the task for miners to prove their workload. Thus, the computation power of miners will not purely be spent on the hash puzzle. In this way, the hardware and energy will support the blockchain service and deep learning training simultaneously. While the incentive of miners is to earn tokens, individual miners are motivated to join mining pools to become more competitive. In this paper, we are the first to demonstrate a mining pool solution for novel consensuses based on deep learning. The mining pool manager partitions the full searching space into subspaces, and all miners are scheduled to collaborate on the Neural architecture search (NAS) tasks in the assigned subspace. Experiments demonstrate that the performance of this type of mining pool is more competitive than that of an individual miner. Due to the uncertainty of miners' behaviors, the mining pool manager checks the standard deviation of the performance of high reward miners and prepares backup miners to ensure completion of the tasks of high reward miners.},

On the other hand, in order to generate a new consensus block, Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchain systems routinely perform a huge amount of computation that does not achieve practical purposes but to solving a difficult cryptographic hash puzzle problem.In this study, we propose a new consensus mechanism, Proof of Learning (PoLe), which directs the computation spent for block consensus toward optimization of neural networks. In our design, the training and testing data are released to the entire blockchain network and the consensus nodes train NN models on the data, which serves as the proof of learning. As a core component of PoLe, we design a secure mapping layer (SML) to prevent consensus nodes from cheating, which can be straightforwardly implemented as a linear NN layer. When the consensus on the blockchain network is achieved, a new block is appended to the blockchain. We experimentally compare the PoLe protocol with Proof of Work (PoW) and show that PoLe can achieve a more stable block generation rate, which leads to more efficient transaction processing. Experimental evaluation also shows the PoLe can achieve a stable block generation rate without significantly sacrificing training performance.},

作者声称与Baldominos2019、BravoMarquez2019、Lihu2020三篇文章相比更优越，同时实现了神经网络任务自定义、禁止预训练、模型防偷窃三种特性。

采用Proof of Learning共识机制的网络中主要有两种节点：数据节点与共识节点。共识过程实际上分为两个阶段，第一个阶段数据节点向网络广播训练任务、支付报酬，该任务会加入区块中的任务列表，共识节点选择最有价值的任务开始、下载训练数据、创建SML层在数据节点提供的模型的输入层前，然后训练模型，训练正确率大于数据节点要求的正确率之后创建区块并向其他共识节点广播；如果数据节点发布测试集或者超过最大训练时间，则进入第二阶段，开始对接收到的区块进行验证，对SML层验证后确定区块时间戳是否早于测试集发布的时间戳，计算区块中模型在测试集上的正确率，正确率最高的有效块将会成为获胜的区块。
区块中存储了获胜共识节点从数据节点接收到的任务的列表，分为尚未解决任务列表与新任务列表。
部分奖励会分配给叔块的产生者，分配量根据公式（1）决定。
通过三个实验，文章证明了：（1）PoLe的出块时间方差显著地低于PoW（2）SML层对模型性能的影响较小（3）如果恶意变更SML层来复用模型或偷窃模型，模型性能会严重劣化。

  abstract  = {Recent technological evolution enables Artificial Intelligence (AI) model training by users' mobile devices, which accelerates decentralized big data analysis. In particular, Federated Learning (FL) is a key enabler to realize decentralized AI model update without user's privacy disclosure. However, since the behaviour of workers, who are assigned a training task, cannot be monitored, the state-of-the-art methods require a special hardware and/or cryptography to force the workers behave honestly, which hinders the realization. Furthermore, although blockchain-enabled FL has been proposed to give workers reward, any rigorous reward policy design has not been discussed. In this paper, to tackle these issues, we present a novel method using mechanism design, which is an economic approach to realize desired objectives under the situation that participants act rationally. The key idea is to introduce repeated competition for FL so that any rational worker follows the protocol and maximize their profits. With mechanism design, we propose a generic full-fledged protocol design for FL on a public blockchain. We also theoretically clarify incentive compatibility based on contest theory which is an auction-based game theory in economics.},
