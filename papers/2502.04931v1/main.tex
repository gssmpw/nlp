\begin{abstract}
Game-based interventions are widely used to combat misinformation online by employing the "inoculation approach". However, most current interventions are designed as single-player games, presenting players with limited predefined choices. Such restrictions reduce replayability and may lead to an overly simplistic understanding of the processes of misinformation phenomenon and the debunking. This study seeks to address these issues, and empower people to better understand the opinion influencing and  misinformation debunking processes. We did this by creating a Player versus Player (PvP) game where participants attempt to either generate or debunk misinformation to convince LLM-represented public opinion. Using a within-subjects mixed-methods study design (N=47), we found that this game significantly raised participants' media literacy and improved their ability to identify misinformation. 
Our qualitative exploration revealed how participants' use of debunking and content creation strategies deepened their understanding of the nature of disinformation. We demonstrate how LLMs can be integrated into PvP games to foster greater understanding of contrasting viewpoints and highlight social challenges.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}
\input{sections/01_Intro}
%The prevalence of misinformation is a growing concern around the globe. Misinformation damages society in numerous ways. It can threaten trust in vaccines and health policies\cite{do2022infodemics,macdonald2023meme}, cause violence and harassment\cite{cdtFromFellows}, undermine democratic processes and elections\cite{bovet2019influence,groshek2017helping} and harm well-being\cite{verma2022examining}. For example, during the 2018 Brazilian presidential election, manipulated photos, decontextualized videos, and audio hoaxes favored the far-right winner and significantly impacted the election results\cite{theguardianWhatsAppFake,santos2020social}. Another instance is the COVID-19 pandemic, where false information led people to mistakenly believe that alcohol-based cleaning products could cure the virus, resulting in fatalities\cite{bbcHundredsDead}. Thus, it is imperative that researchers, journalists, policymakers, and social media platforms develop solutions to counter the negative influence of misinformation.

%Misinformation refers to false or incorrect information created and disseminated for various reasons without an intention to cause harm and deceive audiences\cite{treen2020online}. In this work, we refer \textit{misinformation as an umbrella term include all false or inaccurate information that is
%spread in social media} \cite{wu2019misinformation}. A variety of countermeasures have been investigated to combat misinformation. These interventions can be divided into two major groups: pre-emptive intervention (prebunking) and reactive intervention (debunking)\cite{ecker2022psychological}. Prebunking involves providing preemptive corrections before misinformation is encountered, effectively reducing reliance on misinformation. This includes digital media literacy education activities\cite{dame2022combating,cook2017neutralizing} and designing serious games to improve media literacy\cite{roozenbeek2019fake,cook2023cranky}. Debunking, on the other hand, involves fact-checking and correcting misinformation after it has been encountered. The most common debunking approach uses fact-checked information to dispute misinformation and provide accurate information\cite{hameleers2020misinformation,facebookIntoFacebook,aghajari2023reviewing}. However, due to the continued influence of misinformation—once people are exposed to a falsehood, it is difficult to correct\cite{roets2017fake,lewandowsky2012misinformation}—and the limited scale of fact-checking strategies\cite{roozenbeek2020prebunking}, there is a need to design educational interventions to help people navigate credible, biased, and false information.

%Recent research showed that the game-based learning approach is a promising prebunking intervention to educate people and build resistance to misinformation\cite{traberg2022psychological,kiili2024tackling}. Several attempts at gamifying misinformation education have been made, such as "Bad News,"\cite{roozenbeek2019fake} "Harmony Square,"\cite{roozenbeek2020breaking} "Go Viral!"\cite{camCambridgeGame} and "Trustme!"\cite{yang2021can}.In these games, players adopt the role of a misinformation producer whose task is to create and spread misinformation as efficiently as possible. During the game, players learn how several misinformation manipulation techniques can be used to produce credible fake news\cite{roozenbeek2019fake}. Another type of game involves players acting as fact-checkers whose task is to identify misinformation or fake news [REF].However, these games may overlook key features of misinformation. One noticeable feature is that misinformation typically involves more than isolated instances. During significant events like elections, wars, or health crises, misinformation evolves across various formats (text, pictures, infographics, videos) and stages. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation ranged from false cures and conspiracy theories about the virus's origin to vaccine misinformation, each gaining prominence at different stages[REF]. Another feature is that misinformation is constantly changing. Research found that political false rumors tend to become more intense and extreme over time\cite{shin2018diffusion}, and health misinformation statuses change as new evidence emerges\cite{tang2024knows}.

%Therefore, there is a need to design a game that not only enhances the ability to distinguish misinformation but also raises awareness of its evolving characteristics and various forms. Advancements in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) open the opportunities for creating engaging games. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have been applied in video games for generative narratives\cite{park2023generative}, NPC dialogue\cite{ashby2023personalized,uludaugli2023non}, and role-playing\cite{xu2023exploring}. Integrating LLMs into misinformation learning games could dynamically adapt to player interactions, providing a more engaging and personalized experience. This is particularly useful for capturing and reflecting the dynamic nature of misinformation events. However, further exploration is needed to detail this integration.

%To bridge the gap in misinformation education games and explore LLM-driven games, this research proposes a misinformation education game based on events rather than isolated posts or headlines. In this game, two different countries are engaged in a battle for influence, control, and the hearts and minds of their citizens and the global community. Two players will be randomly assigned the role of a misinformation maker or a misinformation stopper. One player will start with an unfolding event and experience the creation and dissemination of information and misinformation in various formats and stages. The other player will have to identify misinformation and use different countermeasures to respond and combat misinformation in the game. After the second player's responses to misinformation, they will receive simulated reactions from a group of citizens, generated by LLM, and decide on the next steps. After a few rounds, mimicking misinformation diffusion patterns, the game will have results. The win condition for both players is to persuade the simulated group of citizens to align more closely with their direction. Once the game is finished, the ground truth of the information will be revealed, and players will have a chance to review their strategies at different stages. This training aims to prepare their discernment abilities and awareness of misinformation for real-world encounters.

%Research Questions:

%RQ1: How do we design a GenAI-based game that can effectively teach players to recognize common techniques used in creating and disseminating misinformation?

%RQ2: How do we design a GenAI-based game that can increase players' confidence and ability to identify and debunk misinformation?

%RQ3: What behaviors do players exhibit when they are asked to generate vs protect again misinformation?
