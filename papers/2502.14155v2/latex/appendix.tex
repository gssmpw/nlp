        Here we outline all our prompts used to create items in our dataset for transparency. In the OpenAI API, a system prompt sets the initial instructions and context for guiding the model's behavior, while a human prompt represents the user's input or query during the conversation. All premises and conclusions are rephrased using the system prompt: ``You are a writing assistant for a linguist named Steve. Steve comes to you because you are good at writing sentences that are understandable and grammatically correct. Steve will give you a sentence. You need to rephrase the sentence such that it is easier to understand. Preserving all information is not necessary, but preferred. Just write the sentence and nothing else before or after it.'' and the human prompt: ``Sentence: \texttt{\{sentence\}}''.
