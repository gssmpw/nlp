{The authors of **Bharadia et al., "Full Duplex Radios"** discussed the transmission power minimization problem while guaranteeing the traffic demands with quality of service (QoS) constraints.}

{To be more specific, the authors of **Ponnampalam et al., "Transmission Power Minimization"** focused on satisfying the QoS of each beam while jointly minimizing the carrier utilization and transmission power using SDMA.}
% Attempted 도 쓰일 수 있겠네
{In **Ghavami et al., "A Novel Linear Precoder"**, the authors investigated an optimal linear precoder and beam-hopping (BH) architecture to minimize the transmission power while satisfying the QoS of users.}

{ However, the power minimization problems with QoS constraints **Ponnampalam et al., "Optimal Resource Allocation"** can result in infeasible solutions when the available power budget is insufficient or the channel condition is unfavorable for satisfying the traffic demands. This, in turn, poses fundamental challenges in reliably satisfying the traffic requirements of users in SATCOM, where power-hungry payloads are common.
Minimizing transmit power under QoS constraints risks destabilizing the system in SATCOM, which degrades the user experience. As such, SATCOM requires a more sophisticated approach that can directly address traffic mismatches and ensure reliable communication services, regardless of the available power budget or user channel conditions.}

{To tackle this issue, the authors in **Zhang et al., "Flexible Resource Management"** studied the flexible resource management problem based on NOMA to maximize the minimum value of the ratio of the offered capacity to the required traffic.}

{In addition, the SDMA-based linear precoder design and NOMA-based beam power optimization problems were studied in **Ghavami et al., "Optimal Linear Precoder"** and **Ponnampalam et al., "Beam Power Optimization"**, respectively, to minimize the difference between the traffic demands and offered rates.}
