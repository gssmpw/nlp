{A number of studies considered the issue of traffic mismatches for SATCOM under heterogeneous traffic patterns among beams, including ____.}
{The authors of ____ discussed the transmission power minimization problem while guaranteeing the traffic demands with quality of service (QoS) constraints.}
% under perfect CSI conditions
% S + V + O 는 붙어 있는게 좋음 / usage -> utilized / discuss
{To be more specific, the authors of ____ focused on satisfying the QoS of each beam while jointly minimizing the carrier utilization and transmission power using SDMA.}
% Attempted 도 쓰일 수 있겠네
{In ____, the authors investigated an optimal linear precoder and beam-hopping (BH) architecture to minimize the transmission power while satisfying the QoS of users.}
% 목적어 자리에는 동명사 보다는 명사 그 자체를 많이 쓰네
{ However, the power minimization problems with QoS constraints ____ can result in infeasible solutions when the available power budget is insufficient or the channel condition is unfavorable for satisfying the traffic demands. This, in turn, poses fundamental challenges in reliably satisfying the traffic requirements of users in SATCOM, where power-hungry payloads are common.
Minimizing transmit power under QoS constraints risks destabilizing the system in SATCOM, which degrades the user experience. As such, SATCOM requires a more sophisticated approach that can directly address traffic mismatches and ensure reliable communication services, regardless of the available power budget or user channel conditions.}
