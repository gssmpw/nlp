\noindent \textbf{Large Language Model Evaluations.}
%LLMs have demonstrated strong performance across diverse domains~\cite{bubeck2023sparks}.

Rigorous evaluation of LLMs has clarified their strengths and weaknesses. % and identified areas for future work. ~\citet{singhal2023large} proposed a framework for evaluating LLMs' answers to medical questions.
%Med-PaLM achieved a passing score on the U.S. Medical Licensing Exam~\cite{singhal2023large}.
\citet{guha2024legalbench} identified six types of legal reasoning tasks and evaluated 20 models on them. 
In chemistry,~\citet{guo2023can} identified three types of capabi, established a benchmark of eight tasks, and evaluated five LLMs.

However, no work, to our knowledge, has formalized key tasks and evaluated LLMs in the sustainable food domain.% We aim to fill this gap.

\noindent \textbf{Large Language Models for Scientific Discovery.}
In chemistry,~\citet{boiko2023autonomous} demonstrated that GPT-4 combined with internet search and code execution can perform experimental design and execution.
In genomics,~\citet{roohani2024biodiscoveryagent} showed that an LLM with access to several tools can design genetic perturbation experiments. In computational nanobody design,~\citet{swanson2024virtual} propose a framework in which LLM agents receive periodic human feedback, and showed promising performance in the design of novel antibodies. In artificial intelligence research,~\citet{si2024can} show that LLMs can generate novel research ideas. However, we are not aware of prior work on LLMs for discovery of novel sustainable foods.

\noindent \textbf{Large Language Models for Simulating Human Preferences.}
%Our work studies what LLMs can contribute to modeling human preferences and perceptions related to food. 
While we are not aware of prior work studying how LLMs can model human preferences and perceptions related to food, a growing literature has shown evidence that LLMs can accurately simulate human behavior in tasks such as search behavior, participation in online communities, hiring scenarios, and classic economic, psycholinguistic, and social psychology experiments~\cite{zhang2024usimagent,park2022social,horton2023large,aher2023using}.%several prior works have studied LLM capabilities for simulating human preferences and opinions in other settings~\cite{santurkar2023whose}.

\noindent \textbf{Large Language Models and Optimization.}
Our work also pertains to the use of LLMs for mathematical optimization, and combining LLMs with optimization techniques. ~\citet{yang2024large} evaluated LLMs for several optimization problems.~\citet{pmlr-v235-ahmaditeshnizi24a} introduce OptiMUS, an LLM-based agent for solving optimization problems. Motivated by sustainable food applications, we propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization techniques that leverages LLMs' knowledge on topics such as human preferences. We further discuss these works and additional related work in Appendix~\ref{sec:extended-related-work}. %\textcolor{red}{Potentially say it could be more general throughout AI.}%We lay the foundation for using optimization tools and LLMs for the sustainable food development.
