\begin{abstract}
Food systems are responsible for a third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. We investigate what Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of food production. We define a typology of design and prediction tasks based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with domain experts, and evaluate six LLMs on four tasks in our typology. For example, for a sustainable protein design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM can reduce time spent by 45\% on average, compared to 22\% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. However, for a sustainable menu design task, LLMs produce suboptimal solutions when instructed to consider both human satisfaction and climate impacts. We propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization to improve reasoning capabilities.
Our approach decreases emissions of food choices by 79\% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. Our results demonstrate LLMs' potential, supported by optimization techniques, to accelerate sustainable food development and adoption.

%Industrial animal agriculture is a major contributor to climate change, motivating the design and adoption of more sustainable alternatives. 
%Here we investigate what large language models (LLMs) can contribute to sustainable food, both the development of substitutes for animal products (``alternative protein'') and increasing adoption of existing sustainable foods. We define a diverse set of tasks based on the sustainable food literature and expert interviews, and evaluate six LLMs on these tasks. To bring the problem of alternative protein design to the attention of the machine learning community, we create a benchmark and define two \textcolor{red}{(or nine if we count each sensory dimension separately)} tasks. For an experimental design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM reduces time spent by 45\% on average, compared to 22\% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. %On other tasks, they perform poorly, highlighting directions for future research. 
%This does not take into account the speed with which LLMs generate outputs compared to humans, suggesting that the actual time savings may be much higher.
%Additionally, we find that, via creative recipes and appealing descriptions, LLMs can be used to revise a university dining hall menu to decrease average emissions of food options by 33\% while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. 
%Additionally, we study an existing task from the sustainable food literature in which the goal is to revise a menu to promote sustainable choices. 
%Additionally, we show how LLMs can be used to revise a menu to decrease average emissions of food choices by 81\% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. 
%Taken together, these tasks and datasets can inform the development of ML-based solutions to sustainable food development problems.

\section{Introduction}
%Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), also known as factory farms, are responsible for myriad environmental and public health harms. Specific harms include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, deforestation, water pollution, biodiversity loss, antibiotic resistance, and zoonotic disease transmission~\cite{allan2023intergovernmental,hopwood2020health,scherer2019opportunity}. Recent estimates suggest that 99\% of livestock in the United States are raised in CAFOs~\cite{ritchie2023}.
%\textcolor{red}{tighten these two paragraphs}
%Industrial animal agriculture, also known as factory farming, is 
Global food production practices are a leading contributor to climate change, deforestation, water pollution, biodiversity loss, antibiotic resistance, and zoonotic disease transmission~\cite{allan2023intergovernmental,hopwood2020health,scherer2019opportunity}. %Animal-based foods are responsible for 57\% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our food system~\cite{xu2021global}, which itself accounts for one-third of all anthropogenic GHG emissions~\cite{crippa2021food}.
%Our food system is responsible for one-third of all anthropogenic GHG emissions~\cite{crippa2021food}, and animal-based food accounts for 57\% of food system emissions~\cite{xu2021global}. 
%The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported that a societal transition from animal-based food to plant-based food by 2050 would reduce land-based GHG emissions by two-thirds relative to baseline~\cite{ipcc2019}. 
%In response to these issues, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, EAT-Lancet Commission, and the World Health Organization have called for a reduction in consumption of animal-based foods~\cite{ipcc2019,willett2019food,goetschel2024animal}, and 
Given the disproportionate harms of industrial animal agriculture in particular, which accounts for 57\% of food systems emissions, a number of companies have formed to develop more sustainable protein sources~\cite{xu2021global,mylan2023big}. Additionally, programs such as the Menus of Change have developed to promote sustainable choices in foodservice operations~\cite{menusofchangeAboutMenus}. These directions require knowledge of both food science and human preferences.%Here we explore what large language models (LLMs) can contribute to sustainable food development and adoption, which requires knowledge of both food science and human psychology.%both directions.
%Two main approaches could help to accelerate a transition away from factory farming: developing novel foods (``alternative protein"), usually simulating animal-based products, and increasing adoption of traditional plant-based food.
%The design and adoption of sustainable foods requires knowledge of both food science and human psychology. 

Though LLMs have shown promise in scientific discovery~\cite{boiko2023autonomous,guo2023can} and modeling human behavior~\cite{park2022social,horton2023large}, applications in sustainable food remain underexplored. Beyond its importance in sustainability and public health, this domain represents a compelling testbed for broader machine learning (ML) challenges, including modeling diverse human preferences, generating creative solutions, and aligning outputs with real-world constraints and societal values~\cite{pmlr-v235-chakraborty24b,yang2024large}. These challenges are not only central to sustainable food but also to other domains, making sustainable food tasks a valuable benchmark for advancing general ML methods.
%\textcolor{red}{(TODO find better refs for LLMs modeling human preferences)}
%While LLMs have demonstrated success in many domains, to our knowledge no published work has explored their application in sustainable food. We note that their training data includes extensive food science knowledge. 
To initiate an exploration of what LLMs can contribute to sustainable food, we assembled a team consisting of culinary and food science professionals and researchers in ML, natural language processing, and statistics. We make three main contributions: 
\begin{itemize}
\itemsep0em 
%%\noindent \textbf{1. Task typology}
 \item Based on collaboration with expert culinary and food science professionals, we define a typology of tasks grounded in the needs of food scientists and chefs. Our typology covers design and prediction tasks across the resolutions of ingredients, recipes, and food systems.  % and the existing literature
%\noindent \textbf{2. Evaluation framework} 
\item We evaluate six LLMs on four concrete instantiations of tasks in our typology, incorporating two datasets not previously studied by the machine learning community. %Specifically, we study a new sustainable protein dataset of 5,516 sensory evaluations of 47 products, where each evaluation is along 21 dimensions. This dataset is available to academic researchers. We also study a public dataset of 522,517 recipes  and 1,401,982 reviews. %Finally, we build upon a menu design task from the sustainable food literature.
%from 312 different categories
% from 271,907 users
%, using data from publicly available sources to quantify climate impacts. 
%\item We identify data that allow addressing these tasks. In particular, we study a new plant-based meat dataset of 5,725 sensory evaluations of 45 products, where each evaluation is along 21 dimensions. This dataset is available to academic researchers. We also study a publicly available dataset of 522,517 recipes from 312 different categories and 1,401,982 reviews from 271,907 users. Finally, we build upon an existing sustainable food menu design task, using data from publicly available sources to quantify climate impacts. None have previously been studied by the machine learning community.
 %Based on our results, we characterize strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in the sustainable food domain. 
 Notably, LLMs meet or exceed expert human performance on our sustainable protein experimental design task, and also show promising performance in coarse-grained preference prediction. However, they exhibit an omnivore bias, produce suboptimal solutions when balancing multiple constraints (e.g. maintain satisfaction while reducing emissions), and fail to perform well in fine-grained preference prediction.
%\noindent \textbf{3. LLM+optimization approach}
\item We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with combinatorial optimization techniques to address LLMs' relative weakness in mathematical reasoning, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a 79\% average emissions reduction in food choices while maintaining patron satisfaction with their set of choices. %This approach may also be of independent interest.
%\item We present an approach based on integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization techniques for addressing one weakness of LLMs relevant to this domain, of solving constrained optimization problems (e.g. maintaining satisfaction while reducing emissions), which may be of independent interest.
%\item We introduce a framework \textcolor{red}{(if highlighting as a separate contribution, need to develop this more)} for evaluating LLM performance on these tasks by both food science experts and laypeople, and characterize both strengths and weaknesses.

%\subsection{Sustainable Food Background}
%A transition to a sustainable food system could occur via multiple paths. One path does not involve creating novel foods but rather simply shifting consumption toward existing sustainable foods, namely plant-based foods and more sustainable animal-based foods such as .

%\subsection{Typology of Tasks}

%\subsection{Quantification of Climate Impacts}

%The intersection of machine learning and food-related application has gained significant attention, with studies across various communities addressing different aspects of food development. 

\subsection{Typology}
%\textcolor{red}{Switch paragraph order}
We identify a non-exhaustive typology of sustainable food tasks amenable to ML approaches, shown in Table~\ref{tab:taxonomy}.
%, including both traditional and novel foods,
%Traditional foods are defined as foods that have been consumed for centuries or longer. Examples include whole foods like legumes (lentils, chickpeas), grains (wheat, quinoa), vegetables, and fruits, as well as plant-derived products such as tofu, tempeh, and seitan. While some animal-based foods are relatively low in GHG emissions, e.g. pork, chicken, fish, and eggs, these still contribute significantly to other environmental and public health problems such as zoonotic disease transmission, antibiotic resistance, and air and water pollution~\cite{hilborn2018environmental,clark2017comparative,grvzinic2023intensive,hayek2022infectious,jones2013zoonosis}. Additionally, substituting beef, the most harmful food from a climate change perspective~\cite{poore2018reducing}, for these foods can be significantly worse for animal welfare~\cite{mathur2022ethical}. Public opinion polling suggests high levels of concern for animal welfare~\cite{gallupUSMore}. 
%Beyond traditional plant-based foods, we also consider the role of more sustainable animal-based foods such as pork, chicken, fish, and eggs, and consider trade-offs between factors such as consumer satisfaction, sustainability, and animal welfare~\cite{mathur2022ethical}. 
 % We acknowledge that some foods blur the line between traditional and novel. %For example, a traditional form of soymilk - a simple blend of soybeans and water - has been consumed for centuries in East Asia. However, modern soymilk has been industrialized and reformulated to serve as a dairy milk replacement, often fortified with vitamins and minerals or flavored for broader appeal. %We also note that our typology of tasks is non-exhaustive. 
Based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with experts, we identify two types of tasks, (1) design and (2) prediction, across three resolutions, (1) ingredients, (2) recipes, and (3) systems. 
 \textit{Design tasks} focus on creating or optimizing food products or systems to meet specific target properties, such as sensory dimensions (taste, texture, etc.), nutrition, cost, and climate impacts.
 \textit{Prediction tasks} focus on inferring the mapping from a given representation of a food product or system to a property of interest. 
 \textit{Ingredients} are the fundamental components used to create food products, including raw materials (e.g. grains, legumes, oils) and processed components (e.g. protein isolates, flavorings). %that contribute to a food's taste, texture, nutritional profile, and functionality. 
 \textit{Recipes} are structured formulations or instructions for combining ingredients to create food products. %They define the proportions, preparation techniques, and processing steps required to achieve a desired outcome, such as a specific dish or a packaged product. 
 \textit{Systems} refer to the broader processes that govern the production, distribution, and consumption of food. This includes supply chains, foodservice operations, and consumer behavior.%agricultural practices, %For each category (combination of task and resolution), we note both examples of practical challenges faced by food scientists and chefs as well as prior work, if any, applying machine learning to the task in Appendix X. 

We additionally distinguish between novel and traditional foods. Novel sustainable foods, often referred to as ``sustainable proteins" or ``alternative proteins", are defined as foods developed using modern food science and technology to emulate or improve upon animal products with respect to dimensions such as taste. The three main types of sustainable protein technologies are plant-based, cultivated, and fermentation~\cite{gfiScienceAlternative}. Here we focus on plant-based products. Example of novel plant-based products include plant-based meat analogs (e.g. Beyond and Impossible burgers) and plant-based dairy alternatives (e.g. oat milk). While fermentation and cultivated meat are promising approaches for shifting consumption, and we believe our frameworks can be extended to these domains as well, they are outside the scope of the present work. We refer the reader to~\citet{gfiPrecisionFermentation} and~\citet{todhunter2024artificial} to learn about these two technologies.

%First, \textit{prediction tasks} focus on inferring the mapping from a given representation of food to a property of interest. Common properties of interest include sensory dimensions (taste, texture, etc.), nutrition, cost, and climate impacts. At the ingredient level, for traditional foods, models have been designed to predict ingredient pairings and substitutions \cite{zhang2019food,lu2020incorporating,wan2017modeling,mendoza2024foundational}. For novel foods, prediction tasks include estimating the functional properties of .

%Second, \textit{design tasks} focus on creating or optimizing food products or systems to meet specific target properties. 

\subsection{Selected Tasks}
Starting from this general typology, we then selected four tasks to address in the context of both sustainable protein and traditional foods. These tasks include two design tasks (experimental design and menu design) and two prediction tasks (sensory profile prediction and recipe preference prediction). The four tasks were selected based on interviews with food scientists and chefs. %We summarize our tasks in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:selected tasks}.

\noindent \textbf{Experimental Design.}
Taste is a key determinant of food choice~\cite{glanz1998americans}. Food companies depend on ``sensory panels", a group of individuals who provide feedback on food, to routinely quantify sensory properties of their products~\cite{kerth2013science}. 
Once the sensory panel evaluation has been run, food companies will then synthesize the feedback and revise their product accordingly via a series of experiments~\cite{beckley2008accelerating,redefinemeatRoleSensory}. We consider the common task of, given a product formulation and sensory panel feedback, designing a set of experiments to address the identified issues and improve the product.

\noindent \textbf{Menu Design.}
Foodservice operations, such as restaurants and dining halls, aiming to reduce their climate impacts must also balance other factors, such as patron satisfaction, nutrition, and cost. We thus consider the task of revising a menu to promote more sustainable choices while maintaining patron satisfaction and other relevant factors~\cite{banerjee2023sustainable,parkin2022menu}.


\noindent \textbf{Sensory Profile Prediction.}
%Taste is a key, if not primary, determinant of food choice~\cite{glanz1998americans}. Food companies depend on ``sensory panels", a group of trained or untrained individuals who provide feedback on food, to routinely quantify sensory properties of their products~\cite{kerth2013science}. 
%Sensory panel participants are queried not only for their overall satisfaction or purchase intent, but also regarding more specific dimensions of a product's sensory profile such as sweetness, saltiness, juiciness, greasiness, meatiness, etc.~\cite{giezenaar2024profiling,nectarReport}. 
Sensory panel evaluations are very expensive and time consuming to run, and smaller food companies usually cannot afford to run them~\cite{varela2012sensory}. Due to these challenges, we consider the task of estimating a sustainable protein product's sensory profile. While we do not expect to eliminate the need for sensory panels altogether, accurate sensory modeling could reduce the need for experiments and help to efficiently prioritize them. We note that prior work has shown that ML can accurately model the human sense of smell~\cite{lee2023principal}, which is closely related to taste~\cite{spence2015just}. %We are not aware of prior work on using machine learning to predict sensory profiles of alternative protein.

\noindent \textbf{Recipe Preference Prediction.}
Similarly, in the domain of traditional foods, chefs must anticipate patron preferences and design their recipes and menus accordingly. We thus consider the task of predicting the mapping from a traditional recipe to average consumer satisfaction within a specified population. We study how accuracy on this task compares for plant-based versus animal-based recipes. While food preferences of course vary greatly from individual to individual, in both of our prediction tasks the goal is to simulate a representative sample of humans from a specified population~\cite{aher2023using}. %In the language of~\citet{aher2023using}, both of our prediction tasks can be viewed as a ``Turing Experiment".
%\section{Task Definitions}
%The intersection of machine learning and food-related application has gained significant attention, with studies across various communities addressing different aspects of food generation and consumption. Despite the broad interest, less attention has paid on developing a comprehensive evaluation framework that would encompass distinct tasks. To address this gap, from the rich body of existing work, we first identified a comprehensive taxonomy of tasks encompassing ranking, generation, and description, each of which are frequently addressed at three levels of granularity: ingredient, recipe, and menu (Table~\ref{tab:taxonomy}). This taxonomy reflects the complexity of food-related tasks and their intended practical applications, ranging from personalized recommendations to enhancing creativity and menu optimization.

%First, \emph{prediction tasks} focus on evaluating and food-related items to predict and improve user experience and decision-making. At the ingredient level, models have been designed to predict ingredient pairings and substitutions \cite{zhang2019food,lu2020incorporating,wan2017modeling,mendoza2024foundational}. For recipes, ranking often involves assessing relevance or preference based on user queries or dietary needs \cite{zeng-etal-2023-question,li2022ipfc,desai2019recipe}. At the menu level, ranking systems are critical for applications such as restaurant recommendation, leveraging contextual data like user preferences and location \cite{peters2020factors,zhang2016exploiting}. Together, these ranking tasks are crucial in efforts to develop sustainable food systems that meet consumers' preferences.

%Second, \emph{generation tasks} address the creation of food-related content, from ingredient combinations to fully formed recipes and menus. At the ingredient level, generative models have been used to design novel ingredient pairings and formulations \cite{datta2022computer,doherty2021artificial}. Recipe generation has seen significant progress with models like RecipeGPT and RecipeNLG, which synthesize complete recipes from minimal input \cite{h2020recipegpt,bien2020recipenlg,majumder-etal-2019-generating}. Additionally, there has been work on revising or editing existing recipes to accommodate dietary constraints or user preferences \cite{pan2020food,li2022share,antognini2023assistive,liu-etal-2022-plug}, which can be seen as a subtype of constrained generation. At the menu level, generative approaches are less explored but hold promise for crafting cohesive and appealing menus tailored to diverse audiences.

%Third, \emph{description tasks} aim to provide interpretable, engaging, and informative representations of food-related data. For ingredients, descriptive models can communicate nutritional properties or culinary applications \cite{diaz2020international,pecune2022designing}. Recipe-level descriptions often focus on enhancing user engagement and understanding, as seen in persuasive recipe presentation \cite{starke2024tell,pera2024narratives,papies2020using}. At the menu level, research has highlighted the impact of descriptive language on consumer choices and perceptions, emphasizing the role of persuasive language in customer choice \cite{gavrieli2020impact,wansink2005descriptive,roseman2017effects}. The interest in these description tasks highlights the importance of language in influencing food-related decision-making. 


%This taxonomy of food-related tasks provides a comprehensive framework for addressing the diverse tasks found in the literature. By categorizing tasks into ranking, generation, and description across the various granularities, the taxonomy captures the connected nature of these tasks. This structured view highlights the breadth of food-related AI research and offers an opportunity to benchmark models across linked tasks.

%Starting from this taxonomy, we then identified four specific tasks to address in the context of both traditional plant-based food and alternative protein. These tasks include two ranking tasks (sensory profile and preference prediction) and two generation tasks (ingredient improvement generation and menu generation). The four tasks were selected based on expert interviews (i.e., food scientists and dining hall chefs) with whom we identified pain-points and concrete opportunities to assist with machine learning models (see task overview in Table~\ref{tab:selected tasks}).

%For a detailed review of ML/AI applications in cellular agriculture please see~\citet{todhunter2024artificial}.

\section{Datasets}
%\Maya{Might be clearer to introduce each dataset within the task it's used for, especially since additional datasets (Deliveroo, etc.) show up in Task 4.}

\noindent \textbf{NECTAR Sustainable Protein Dataset.}
%The  aims to accelerate the transition to sustainable protein sources via conducting large-scale sensory panel evaluations.
%of the nonprofit organization Food Systems Innovation (\url{fsi.org})
%A sensory panel is a group of (trained or untrained) individuals who evaluate and provide feedback on the sensory attributes of food products.
%NECTAR Initiative 
The NECTAR Initiative's (\url{nectar.org}) sensory panel data\footnote{Access can be requested \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYXkB1yEOt_gMBrnHIpHv_xX9peh5NS1kdbfuY8-6-77kSug/viewform?usp=preview}{here}.} is freely available to academic researchers.
%It is not available more generally to reduce harm to the reputations of the companies whose products performed poorly in the taste testing. 
The dataset, which will continue to expand in size, consists of 47 products across five categories. %: bacon, hot dogs, burgers, chicken tenders, and chicken nuggets
One product in each category is a meat-based reference product, and one product is a hybrid beef and mushroom burger, yielding 41 plant-based products. For each product, at least 100 sensory evaluations from American omnivores were performed along 21 quantitative and qualitative dimensions. More details are in Appendix~\ref{app:nectar}.
%Additionally, qualitative, text-based feedback on what each participant liked and disliked about the product was collected. 

\noindent \textbf{Food.com Recipe Dataset.}
%To study traditional plant-based food, we leverage online recipes and reviews collected from \url{Food.com}. %
%.
The \url{Food.com} dataset\footnote{Publicly available \hyperlink{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews}{here}.} contains 522,517 recipes, including ingredients and preparation instructions. %, and whether the recipe is plant-based or not. 
We use the associated 1,401,982 reviews, containing ratings and text, to capture online users' preferences. %\Maya{Clever and realistic, though one limitation is that users will self-select into recipes to try based on how much they predict they will like it.} 
Given the large number of recipes, the dataset allows for finding pairs of comparable recipes, i.e., similar in dish type and ingredients, but significantly differing in the users's ratings. %\Maya{Interesting! This reduces the issue I raised above.} 
An example recipe is shown in Appendix~\ref{fig:example-food.com-recipe}.

\section{Experimental Evaluation}
We evaluate \claude, \gemini, \gptthree, \gptfouro, \llama,  and \opreview. In the experimental design task, due to limited availability of expert food scientists, we used \opreview\:only, based on feedback on relative LLM performance from our food scientist team member. We use a combination of automated evaluations and human subjects evaluations, including both food science experts and participants recruited on Prolific. IRB approval was obtained. All evaluations were in a zero-shot setting. Additional details for each task, including prompts and additional results, are in Appendices~\ref{app:methods} and~\ref{app:results}. % for all experiments involving human subjects. %We identify strong zero-shot performance of LLMs in experimental design, but note limitations in constrained menu design, which we then address via incorporating optimization techniques in Section~\ref{sec:augmenting}. For prediction tasks, we find that, in both sustainable protein and traditional foods, LLMs outperform a random baseline, particularly for coarse-grained prediction tasks where the underlying preference gap is large, but do not consistently outperform a simple baseline based on nutritional information. 
%\section{Evaluating LLMs for Design Tasks}
%We first evaluate LLMs for the experimental design and menu design tasks.  IRB approval was obtained for all experiments involving human subjects. \textcolor{red}{Reserve discussion for prediction tasks in section 7.}
\subsection{Experimental Design (Sustainable Protein)}
\noindent \textbf{Methods.}
In this task we study whether LLMs can generate an experimental design for systematically improving a sustainable protein product on the basis of qualitative and quantitative sensory panel data. %Due to limited time availability of expert human food scientists, we used \opreview\:only, based on feedback on relative LLM performance from our food scientist team member.
%(not including education)
We evaluate the performance of \opreview\:via the feedback of 20 expert food scientists, with an average of five years of experience in plant-based food science and three years of experience in plant-based meat specifically. In Phase 1, we ask both \opreview\:and expert food scientists to generate experimental designs.  In Phase 2, we ask food scientists to evaluate both \opreview\:and a fellow food scientist (blinded, and in randomized order) along the dimensions of accuracy, specificity, complementarity (to the evaluating food scientist's own thought process), and estimated time saved by collaborating with the anonymous ``scientist.'' We ensured that no food scientists evaluated their own ideas. The food scientists were compensated via \$50 Amazon gift cards, and an additional \$50 bonus was provided to the highest scoring food scientist from Phase 1 to incentivize effort. Before Phase 2, following~\citet{si2024can} we perform style standardization (also with \opreview) on both the LLM and human responses to avoid confounding by style. In order to approximately match the length of the human responses, \opreview\:was instructed to limit its response to  250 words. 
% (either \opreview\:or a human food scientist)
%Further details, including prompts, are in Appendix~\ref{sec:additional-methods-exp-design}.%Lengths are shown in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:exp-design-original-edited-lengths}. 







\noindent \textbf{Results.} Our results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:task2}. Across the 30 products, the mean performance of LLMs was higher on all four dimensions, though only statistically significant (in a $t$-test) for specificity ($p$=0.003) and percent time saved ($p$=0.0002). Mean estimated percent time saved was 22\% for the human food scientists and 45\% for o1-preview. %Percent time saved was computed based on two questions: 1) an estimate for how long creating a full experimental design would take and 2) how much time collaborating with the other scientist would save. Mean specificity was 6.63 for the humans and 8.23 for o1-preview. Mean percent time saved was 22\% for the humans and 45\% for o1-preview.





\subsection{Menu Design (Traditional Foods)}\label{sec:init-menu-design}
\noindent \textbf{Methods.} Here we study what LLMs can contribute to greater adoption of existing sustainable foods. Extensive past work has studied how to shift consumption toward sustainable options in foodservice operations~\cite{lohmann2024choice,attwood2020menu,banerjee2023sustainable,weijers2024nudging}. However, these studies either obtained relatively small improvements in climate impact or did not measure patron satisfaction with their set of choices. Additionally, none accounted for the trade-off known as the ``small body problem", in which simply substituting beef by chicken or fish, a common approach for reducing climate impacts, can be much worse for animal welfare due to the relative sizes of these animals and their typical conditions~\cite{mathur2022ethical}. Public opinion polling suggests high levels of concern for animal welfare~\cite{gallupUSMore}. Given that LLMs' training data includes many recipes and menus, we explore what LLMs can contribute to designing appealing menus under the constraints of ingredient availability, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and animal welfare. Our final approach, described in Section~\ref{sec:augmenting}, can also easily be extended to other constraints such as nutrition, cost, allergies, other dimensions of climate impact, etc.
% \textcolor{red}{(maybe include numbers)}

%$n$ = 30 products. 
\label{fig:task2}
\end{figure}
%The exact survey questions for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 are shown in Appendix X. 

As a reference menu, we use a 36-item menu from~\citet{banerjee2023sustainable}, created using Deliveroo's and Just Eat's top 100 items ordered in the United Kingdom in 2019. %Our initial prompt is shown in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:prompt-task4-direct}. 
Each LLM was instructed to reduce emissions of food choices by 75\% while maintaining satisfaction, cost, nutrition, preparation time, and animal welfare, and using only the same ingredients as the original menu other than standard vegetarian protein sources (most of which were already in the original menu, other than eggs and chickpeas). Adherence to the ingredient availability constraint, as well as meeting the constraint of generating 36 properly formatted recipes, was checked, and the LLM was given up to five chances to correct itself. GPT-3.5 Turbo and \llama\:did not meet the formatting or ingredient constraints. %Additional experimental details, including prompts and evaluation of climate and animal welfare impacts, are in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-methods-menu-design}. 

%A concrete case we are motivated by, that informs our specific choice of experimental evaluation, is shifting consumption at university dining halls. This case has been the focus of past work \citep{vocskieffect,jalil2023low,turnwald2019increasing}, both due to the quantity of meals served - 750,000 per day across the 57 ``Menus of Change'' consortium of universities, an initiative to shift dining hall consumption in a more healthy and sustainable direction, alone \citep{menusofchangeAboutMenus} - and due to the opportunity to raise awareness of sustainable diets at a formative time in student development. A natural question is how to reduce emissions of dining hall menus while meeting other constraints and maintaining satisfaction. Additionally, some universities, such as the University of North Texas, EPFL, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, operate fully plant-based dining halls \citep{untMeanGreens,epfl,illinoisNutritionDietary}. A related question is how to encourage students to patronize these lower emissions dining halls via appealing menus. Thus, in our evaluation, we focus on generation of lower emissions menus and evaluate on human preferences, cost, nutrition, and animal welfare in comparison to a dining hall menu created by human chefs.

%While LLMs are able to generate plausible recipes, their performance on mathematical optimization tasks is inconsistent,  as also shown in \citet{yang2024large}.  %To address this weakness, we design an approach combining LLMs with integer quadratic programming (IQP) to explicitly optimize for predicted patron satisfaction, emissions, and animal welfare.  

\noindent \textbf{Results.}
We found that this approach yielded entirely vegetarian or vegan menus (shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:menus}), known to generally decrease satisfaction in a typical omnivore population~\cite{hartmann2017consumer}. This decrease in satisfaction was further supported in our later experiments (Figure~\ref{fig:task4}), motivating our approach described in Section~\ref{sec:augmenting}.
%noted that prompting LLMs directly to revise this menu to promote sustainable choices (at least a 75\% reduction in GHG emissions) while not worsening patron satisfaction, cost, nutrition, preparation time, or animal welfare (prompt shown in Appendix)

%Finally, we evaluate LLMs on preference prediction tasks. 
%\section{Evaluation of LLMs}
%In Tasks 1-3, we evaluate six LLMs: \claude, \gemini, \gptthree, \gptfouro, \llama,  and \opreview. In Task 4, due to limited time availability of expert human food scientists, we used \opreview\:only, based on feedback on relative LLM performance from our food scientist team member. We use a combination of automated evaluations and human subjects evaluations, including both food science experts and participants recruited on Prolific. %IRB approval was obtained for all experiments involving human subjects (Tasks 2 and 4).% under assurance number FWA00000935.
\subsection{Sensory Profile Prediction (Sustainable Protein)}\label{sec:sensory-profile-prediction}
\noindent \textbf{Methods.}
Here we study whether LLMs can make accurate predictions about the mapping from a sustainable protein product's ingredients and nutritional information to its sensory properties. Of the 21 sensory dimensions in the NECTAR dataset, seven dimensions (overall satisfaction, meatiness, greasiness, sweetness, juiciness, saltiness, purchase intent) were selected for testing, to reduce the number of tests.
%A tool for accomplishing this task could accelerate the development of alternative protein with appealing sensory properties (\textcolor{red}{CITE}). We use the NECTAR alternative protein dataset, in which five categories of alternative protein - burgers, hot dogs, chicken nuggets, chicken tenders, and bacon - were evaluated on several sensory dimensions. 
Within each of the five product categories, and each sensory dimension, we ask LLMs to compare pairs (with randomized ordering, to account for positional biases) of plant-based products with a statistically significant ($p < 0.05$ in a $t$-test) difference on the sensory dimension, as evaluated by human omnivores. This yielded 495 pairs. For the baseline, we use the available nutritional information and prior knowledge from the food science literature. Specifically, for greasiness and juiciness, meatiness, sweetness, and saltiness, the ratio of total fat, protein, sugar, and sodium respectively per serving to serving size are used to predict the sensory dimension. For example, the product that is higher on protein is ranked higher on meatiness according to the baseline. % No baseline was tested for overall satisfaction, purchase intent, meatiness, and smokiness %\textcolor{red}{(could attempt to construct a baseline, e.g. averaging fat and sodium for overall satisfaction or purchase intent)}. 
For overall satisfaction and purchase intent, the average of normalized fat and sodium content is used~\cite{drewnowski1983cream,mattes1997taste}. %Additional details are Appendix~\ref{sec:sensory-profile-prediction}.
%Sample sizes per sensory dimension are shown in Appendix Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-pairs}. Our prompt is shown in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:sensory-profile-prompt}.
%\vspace{-3em}

\noindent \textbf{Results.}
Accuracies are shown in Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results}. Accuracies significant according to a chi-squared test with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing are bolded~\cite{vanderweele2019some}. Performance is generally not meaningfully superior to the baseline. Accuracy for the best  (across all dimensions) LLM, \opreview, improves in the highest quartile of the ground truth difference between the recipes, e.g. to 81\% and 75\% for overall satisfaction and purchase intent. However, it is still not meaningfully superior to the simple baseline, which achieved 86\% and 70\% accuracy on those dimensions in this subset of pairs (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results-q4}). 

%While no LLMs achieve a statistically significant accuracy on purchase intent, Claude 3.5. Sonnet achieves 67\% accuracy on overall satisfaction, and also outperforms a random baseline on meatiness, greasiness, smokiness, juiciness, and saltiness. %Tables with accuracies disaggregated by product category are shown in the Appendix.





\subsection{Recipe Preference Prediction (Traditional Foods)}



\noindent \textbf{Methods.} We created a set of 500 meal recipe pairs with similar ingredients but significantly different average ratings ($p<0.05$ in a $t$-test), ensuring that one recipe is consistently preferred by users. To identify recipe pairs with the highest similarity, the overlap of ingredients was calculated for each pair using the ratio of shared ingredients to the total number of unique ingredients. We addressed the possibility of overlap with LLM training data by curating an additional set of 58 recipe pairs from \url{epicurious.com}. These recipes were posted behind a paywall after the release dates of all the models we tested.
%$\{recipe_1, recipe_2\}$
%We evaluated six models in a zero-shot setting. %, using default parameters (e.g., temperature, maximum tokens). 
Our primary metric was accuracy---whether the models correctly identified the preferred recipe---compared to a random baseline. We tested statistical significance using a chi-squared test with Bonferroni correction when evaluating on multiple conditions. The order in which the recipes were shown was randomized. %, to account for positional biases. 
%Additional details are in Appendix~\ref{app:recipe-rating-prediction}.
%The prompt is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prompt-recipe-rating}. %We used the following prompt text:

\noindent \textbf{Results.} \claude, \gptfouro, and \opreview\:outperform the random baseline (Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results}). The highest accuracy achieved is 64\% (\gptfouro), with accuracy improving to 85\% in the highest quartile of the ground truth review score gap (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:task3a}).
%useful but not highly accurate
Moreover, performance varies widely by comparison type (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:task3b}). Across all the models, accuracy is the highest when two non-vegetarian meals are compared, followed by vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian comparisons, with the worst accuracy observed in vegetarian vs. vegetarian meal comparisons. This aligns with existing literature showing that minority preferences and opinions are modeled less accurately~\cite{santurkar2023whose}. Within the vegetarian vs. non-vegetarian meal comparisons, accuracy is lower when vegetarian options are rated higher, reflecting LLMs' omnivore bias, as LLMs more frequently prefer non-vegetarian options compared to ground truth human preferences. This finding is consistent with the literature on bias amplification in the food domain~\cite{luo2024othering} and points to the need to improve preference prediction performance in order to develop tools that can better  support the development of sustainable food. Finally, similar pairwise accuracy across models on post-cut-off data suggests that performance cannot be fully attributed to memorization (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:task3c}).%the reference signal

%\Maya{Very interesting.}

\section{Augmenting LLMs with Combinatorial Optimization}\label{sec:augmenting}

%Lastly, to demonstrate potential future directions and ways to improve performance on the four tasks, we build upon menu design task, as one use-case. Similar to constrained menu generation in focus here, many real-world design problems require optimizing for human preferences under hard constraints. Whether designing menus, fitness programs, or educational curricula, practitioners must balance subjective quality with quantifiable requirements like emissions, time budgets, or learning objectives. While LLMs show promise in modeling human preferences, they struggle with precise constraint satisfaction~\cite{yang2024large}. We propose a general framework combining LLMs' preference modeling and unconstrained generation capabilities with classical optimization techniques.
%As shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:menus}, w
When prompted directly to revise a menu to reduce emissions by at least 75\% while maintaining patron satisfaction and other factors, LLMs generate entirely plant-based menus (Section~\ref{sec:init-menu-design}, Appendix~\ref{sec:menus}). While this approach achieves the emissions target, it significantly decreases satisfaction (Figure~\ref{fig:task4}). This failure highlights a broader, previously documented challenge: LLMs struggle with optimization problems~\cite{pmlr-v235-ahmaditeshnizi24a,yang2024large}.
However, frequently in real-world applications we need to consider some subjective, human-evaluated property (like satisfaction) while also satisfying other constraints (like emissions targets or budgets). For instance, in education, we may want to maximize student engagement while meeting curriculum requirements. In fitness, we may aim to maximize enjoyment while covering specified muscle groups within time constraints. In travel planning, we may seek to maximize trip enjoyment while meeting budget and scheduling constraints. Additionally, in some settings it may take considerable effort to quantify dimensions such as emissions or other climate impacts of a food item.

We propose to address these challenges by combining LLMs' background knowledge and ability to model human preferences, demonstrated in~\citet{horton2023large},~\citet{park2022social} and in our own experiments, particularly for coarse-grained prediction (Tables~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results},\ref{tab:menu-preference-rating-q4},\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results-q4},\ref{tab:task3a}), with mathematical optimization. While LLMs alone struggle with  optimization, and traditional optimization methods do not have access to LLMs' background knowledge, combining them allows for leveraging the strengths of both approaches.
%\Moses{previous sentence is long and somewhat awkwardly constructed. rephrase?}
%cannot easily capture subjective human preferences, which may be hard to formalize mathematically, or leverage extensive


%Could there be a better way to balance these three factors? More generally, this problem is an example of maximizing subjective quality (according to human judgment), subject to constraints. Addressing such multi-objective optimization problems is critical in many real-world applications, highlighting the need for methods that can navigate these complex trade-offs effectively. Similar problems arise in settings such as education (course planning), health (designing fitness regimens) or planning trips, e.g. maximizing enjoyment while covering muscle groups or meeting time and cost constraints~\cite{roy2011interactive}. 

\subsection{LLM-Guided Combinatorial Optimization}
%Building on recent literature suggesting that LLMs can model human perceptions and behavior~\cite{park2022social,horton2023large}, as well as our own results showing that LLMs can model human food preferences (Figure X), we propose to model subjective quality, as assessed by humans, via the outputs of an LLM.
We begin with the general constrained optimization setting:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x} \quad & f(x)\\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad & g_i(x) \leq 0 \: \forall i \in [1, ..., m] \\
\end{aligned}\label{eq:general-opt}
\end{equation}
We make three assumptions:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em 
    \item The optimization problem involves selecting a subset of items $S$ from a ground set $U = \{u_1, ..., u_N\}$. Each $u_i$ represents an item, e.g. a recipe or exercise. The selection is represented by a binary vector $x \in \{0,1\}^N$, where $x_i = 1$ if $u_i$ is selected, and 0 otherwise. %As in our motivating examples, $x$ (e.g. a menu or fitness program) is a set of items $S = \{s_1, ..., s_K\}$, e.g. a set of recipes or exercises, to be chosen from a ground set $U = \{u_1, ..., u_N\}$, where $|U| = N > K$. 
    \item At least one of $f(x)$ or the constraints $g_i(x)$ can be expressed in terms of a \textit{scoring function} $p(u_i)$, which computes a scalar property (e.g. satisfaction) for each item $u_i$. The scoring function can be estimated by an LLM. For example, if the objective is to maximize the total satisfaction of the end user with the selected items, $f(x)$ can be written as $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N p(u_i)x_i$.
    %At least one of $f(x)$ and $g_i(x)$ can be written as $h(p(x_1), ..., p(x_K))$ for a \textit{scoring function} $p(x_i)$, e.g. satisfaction with a recipe, which can be estimated by an LLM. For example, if the objective function is simply to maximize estimated sum of satisfaction of individual recipes, $h(x) = \sum_{i=1}^K p(x_i)$. %Additionally, a constraint $g_i(x)$ could be on expected emissions, based on the probability distribution associated with $p(x)$. For example, $g_i(x)$ could be $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K p(x_i) e(x_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^K p(x_i)} - C$, where $e(x_i)$ is the emissions for recipe $x_i$ and $C$ is the emissions target.
    %\Moses{Just to clarify: you mean that either $f(x)$ is of this form, OR all the $g_i(x)$ are of this form? Is there a restriction on the combining function $h()$?}
    \item Once $p(u_i)$ is estimated for each $u_i$ in $U$, (\ref{eq:general-opt}) has a tractable form and can be solved exactly or approximately via standard techniques, e.g. submodular optimization or integer programming for small to medium problem sizes~\cite{fujishige2005submodular,wolsey2020integer}. We give a concrete example in Section~\ref{sec:constrained-menu-design}.
    %\Moses{This was confusing to me. $x=\{x_1,\ldots,x_K\}$ is a variable. First, a small typing issue: is $p(x) = (p(x_1),\ldots,p(x_K))$ What does it mean to estimate $p(x)$? Does this mean that you estimate the form of $p()$ from which you can compute $p(x)$ for any $x$? Or, do you mean that you can estimate $p(x)$ for a given value of $x$?}
\end{enumerate}
 
%We consider the case, .  %We additionally assume that $f(S) = \sum_{x \in S} f(x) + \lambda d(S)$, e.g. that satisfaction with a menu or fitness regimen can be decomposed linearly as the sum of satisfaction of the individual recipes or exercises, plus a diversity term $d(S)$. 
We can then solve~(\ref{eq:general-opt}) via the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep0em 
\item Generate the ground set $U = \{u_1, ..., u_N\}$, e.g. a diverse set of recipes or exercises.%, where $N > %K$.
\item Obtain the estimates $\hat{p}(u_i)\: \forall i\in [1, ..., N]$ via an LLM.
\item Solve the combinatorial optimization problem using standard techniques, e.g. submodular optimization or integer programming, depending on the forms of $f(x)$ and $g_i(x)$. This will yield a subset $S \subset U$. %d(S)$ and $g_i(x)$. 
\end{enumerate}
%\Moses{Related to my comment above, I think I might have realized the source of my confusion: you use $x_1, \ldots x_N$ to denote the elements of the ground set, but also the variables in the combinatorial optimization problem. You should have distinct notation for them. Also, what are the values of the variables in your constrained optimization problem? I presume they are indices in \{1,\ldots N\}?}
%, as we do in our menu design experiments,
Step 1 could be performed via an LLM or via other techniques. We discuss the relationship of this framework to prior work in 
Appendix~\ref{sec:extended-related-work}. A natural question is how performance depends on the accuracy of the LLM's estimates $\hat{p}(u_i)$, and other parameters. For our analysis we consider the cardinality constrained setting where $f(x)$ has a component that is linear in $p(u_i)$ for the selected subset, and another component $d(x)$ that does not depend on $p(u_i)$. Concretely, we aim to maximize $f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N p(u_i)x_i + \lambda d(x)$ subject to the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^N x_i = K$, though this result can be extended to more general objectives and constraints.
%$f(S) = \sum_{u_i \in S} p(u_i) + \lambda d(S)$ subject to a cardinality constraint $|S| \leq K$

\begin{proposition}
Let $x^{\ast}$ be the optimal solution with respect to actual preferences $p(u_i)$, and $\hat{x}^{\ast}$ be the optimal solution with respect to estimated preferences $\hat{p}(u_i)$. Let $p(u_i), \hat{p}(u_i) \in [0,1]$, $d(x) \in [0,D]$. If $|\hat{p}(u_i) - p(u_i)| \leq \epsilon$ for all $u_i \in U$, then $|f(\hat{x}^{\ast}) - f(x^{\ast})| \leq 2K\epsilon + 2\lambda D$.
\end{proposition}\label{prop:llm-accuracy}

A simple proof is in Appendix~\ref{sec:proof-prop-1}. Thus, the error can be bounded as a linear function of the number of items selected and the maximum item-level error of the LLM.

\subsection{Constrained Menu Design Formulation}\label{sec:constrained-menu-design}
Now we show how to implement this framework for the setting of constrained menu design. First, we prompt the LLM to generate a set $C$ of plant-based candidate recipes, though this could be modified to allow for also generating animal-based recipes at this stage. As in Section~\ref{sec:init-menu-design}, the LLM is also instructed to not worsen cost, nutrition, or preparation time. We then combine this set with the recipes in the original menu $O$, where $K = |O|$, to form the ground set $U = C \cup O$. We then estimate $p(u_i)\: \forall u_i \in U$ by prompting an LLM to rate each recipe in the ground set by expected preferences of the population of interest (here, American omnivores). Then, integer quadratic programming (IQP) is applied to select a subset of recipes from $U$ for the menu.%(from both the LLM-generated set and recipes from the original menu)

More specifically, we maximize expected satisfaction with the selected recipes, plus a $\lambda d(x)$ term, where $\lambda$ controls the weight on diversity, to encourage a diverse set of recipes, subject to constraints on climate impacts and animal welfare. This approach easily extends to other constraints such as nutrition and cost. The predicted preferences $\hat{p}(u_i)$ are used to compute expected emissions and animal welfare impacts of choices by weighting more preferred options more highly, under the assumption that these options will be chosen more often. %\Maya{I'd move this intuition piece above the algo and have the notation immediately after the algo.} %We define $\mathbb{E}_{p,r}[c_j]$ as $\sum_i \frac{p_i}{1^Tp} r_i c_{ji}$. 
Our problem formulation is thus as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x} \quad & \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{p}(u_i)x_i + \lambda d(x)\\
\textrm{s.t.} \quad & E_{\hat{p}}[l_j(x)] \leq C_j E_{\hat{p}}[l_j(x_O)] \: \forall j \in [1, 2] \\
%\quad &  m^Tc \leq C_c \\
%\quad &  m^Tn \leq C_n \\
%\quad &  m^Ta \leq C_a \\
& \sum_{i=1}^N x_i = K  \\
& x_i \in \{0,1\}\:\forall i \in [1, ..., N] \\
%& r_i \in \{0,1\} \: \forall i %\in [1,...,n] \\
\end{aligned}\label{eq:menu-formulation}
\end{equation}
$x_O$ corresponds to the subset of recipes in the original menu. $E_{\hat{p}}[l_j(x)]$ computes the expected emissions or animal welfare impacts of the chosen subset of recipes, with respect to the probability distribution associated with $\hat{p}(u_i)$. %Specifically, $E_p[l_j(S)] = \sum_{u_i \in S} e_j(u_i)p(u_i)$, where $p(u_i) \in [0,1]$ and $e_j(u_i)$ is the item-level constraint value, e.g. emissions of an individual recipe. 


We set $d(x)$ to be negative pairwise similarity between the recipes in the selected subset. This yields an IQP since all other terms are linear in $x$. %the optimization variable, a binary vector $x$ with each entry corresponding to whether a recipe in $U$ is selected. 
$C_i$ controls the reduction in emissions or animal welfare, and is set to 0.25 for emissions and 1.0 for animal welfare, corresponding to reducing emissions by at least 75\% while maintaining or improving upon animal welfare. We set $K=36$, to match the length of the original menu from~\citet{banerjee2023sustainable}. We instruct the LLM to generate 20 additional recipes, reflecting that a restaurant may not be able to completely revise their full menu. Thus, $N=56$. Finally, we set $\lambda=100$. For computing pairwise recipe similarity we use the Ratcliff/Obershelp sequence matching algorithm as implemented in Python's difflib \citep{ratcliff1988pattern}. The recipes were ordered first by whether they were LLM generated, and second by predicted rating. We included a baseline in which the original menu was simply re-ordered so that vegetarian items were first, to account for the possibility that benefits of the LLM+IQP approach were simply due to placing the LLM generated (and therefore plant-based) recipes first.



\begin{figure*}[ht!]

\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{average_emission_satisfaction_by_arm_v2.pdf}
\caption{Our o1-preview+IQP approach reduces GHG emissions of food choices by 79\% compared to the original menu from~\citet{banerjee2023sustainable} while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. o1-preview+IQP additionally outperforms the baselines of removing meat from the original menu (``Vegetarian") and removing beef (``Remove Beef"), and maintains animal welfare and other satisfaction metrics, as shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix:task4}. As an ablation we also prompt o1-preview directly to revise the menu. Error bars are 95\% confidence intervals. Statistical significance was assessed with a $t$-test, with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing.}
\label{fig:task4}
\end{figure*}


%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%\max_{r} \quad & r^Tp - \lambda \sum_i \sum_j r_ir_js_{ij}\\
%\textrm{s.t.} \quad & \frac{\sum_i p_i r_i c_{ji}}{\sum_i p_i r_i} \leq C_j \forall j \in [1, ..., m] \\

%& 1^Tr = K  \\
%& r_i \in \{0,1\} \forall i \in [1,...,n] \\
%\end{aligned}\label{eq:ilp}
%\end{equation}

%Here, $r \in \{0,1\}^{n}$, where $n$ is the number of recipes in the ground set (both LLM-generated and the original recipes), is the optimization variable. Each entry $r_i$ reflects whether recipe $i$ is chosen for the final menu. $p \in [1, ..., n]$ is the preference ratings from the LLM. $\lambda$ is a user-defined parameter specifying the tradeoff between menu diversity and satisfying predicted recipe-level preferences; higher values of $\lambda$ place a greater weight on diversity. 
%$s_{ij}$ is a measure of similarity between recipes $i$ and $j$. 
%There are $m$ constraints (in our experiments $m=2$, corresponding to emissions and animal welfare), each associated with recipe-level values in $c_j \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and budget $C_j \in \mathbb{R}$. $K$ recipes are required to be selected, to match the length of the baseline human-created menu, so here $K=36$. Figure~\ref{fig:approach-2} depicts our approach. In our experiments we set $C_1$ to be 25\% of the expected (computed based on the predicted preferences $p$) emissions impact of the original menu, and $C_2$ to be equal to the expected animal welfare impact of the original menu. This corresponds to a 75\% emissions reduction while maintaining or improving on animal welfare. %For Approach 2, the baseline is a menu created by human chefs - specifically, the Arrillaga Dining breakfast menu for March 19, 2024. We are unaware of previous published work combining LLMs with combinatorial optimization for menu generation.

We then evaluated our approach via two human subjects experiments (total $n=552$) in which participants recruited via Prolific, constrained to be in the United States and fluent English speakers, were instructed to make a selection from a menu. In the first experiment, the menu was randomly assigned from one of the five LLMs (augmented with IQP) and three baselines (original menu, original menu with beef removed, and a vegetarian subset of the original menu).\footnote{Removal of beef is a common strategy for reducing climate impacts~\cite{grummon2023simple}.} In the second experiment, conducted the following day, the menu was randomly assigned from one of three additional baselines (\opreview\:on its own, without IQP; \opreview+IQP, but with the \opreview\:generated descriptions replaced with a simple list of ingredients; and placing the vegetarian items first in the original menu). The participants were paid \$16 per hour. The evaluation metrics consisted of satisfaction metrics (satisfaction with their set of choices, likelihood of visiting, and likelihood of recommending the restaurant to a friend), emissions of food choices, and animal welfare impacts of food choices. %Additional details are in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix-methods-menu-design}.


\subsection{Results}
The results for the best LLM, o1-preview, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:task4}, with results for other LLMs and baselines in Appendix~\ref{appendix:task4}. When controlling for dietary preference, age, gender, and race, we estimate that the \opreview+IQP approach reduces emissions by 79\% while maintaining patron satisfaction with their set of choices ($p$=1.37e-18). We obtain similar results when removing vegan and vegetarian participants (Appendix~\ref{appendix:task4}). We observe a small (5\%) reduction in the likelihood of recommending the restaurant to a friend, and a small increase in animal usage (3.5\%), but these were not statistically significant. The original, baseline, and generated menus are shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:menus}. We also evaluated the accuracy of the LLM's predicted preference ratings, in the same pairwise ranking fashion as the sensory profile and recipe preference prediction tasks, with the best LLM, \claude, achieving 73\% accuracy (Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results}). This increases to 85\% in the highest quartile of the preference gap (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:menu-preference-rating-q4}). We note that, for the menu design task, LLM predictions were based on the recipe title alone (not including the full description), which could explain the discrepancy between item-level prediction performance and menu-level performance for \opreview. When \opreview's descriptions were replaced with a simple list of ingredients (in one of our ablations), its accuracy was 70\%, and 84\% in the highest quartile of ground truth preference gaps (Appendix Table~\ref{tab:menu-preference-rating-q4}).
%\textcolor{red}{TODO: could translate to pairwise ranking accuracy to match Tasks 3 and 4, perhaps could add a line to Table 2. Also mention that percentage of plant based and LLM generated choices goes up a lot under o1-preview+IQP.}.

\section{Discussion}
%taken together
Our results identify both strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in the domain of sustainable food. One actionable finding is that, as determined by expert food scientists, o1-preview appears to be useful, even superior to fellow expert human food scientists, in generating ideas for revision of sustainable protein products in response to sensory panel feedback. Our evaluation suggests that the benefits may be driven by increased specificity in particular, relative to the human food scientists (Figure~\ref{fig:task2}). LLMs display a weakness in the menu design task, where they are instructed to satisfy multiple constraints. They generate fully plant-based menus, which we find to significantly reduce satisfaction. We remedy this by integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization techniques. Our approach achieves a 79\% emissions reduction while maintaining patron satisfaction (Figure~\ref{fig:task4}). Our work also contributes to the literature on reasoning in LLM-based systems (further discussed in Appendix~\ref{sec:extended-related-work}), providing an approach for solving a broad class of optimization problems that cannot be easily specified mathematically, e.g. those involving human preferences. Future work can apply this framework to other domains such as education and health. 

%, which may be of independent interest in other settings involving optimization problems that are not fully specified mathematically (e.g. involving human preferences)

We evaluated LLMs on three types of preference prediction. The first is sensory profile prediction, in which we compared LLM predictions to evaluations from an actual taste tasting. The second is the \url{Food.com} recipe rating task, where we compared LLM predictions to online recipe ratings. The third is recipe rating in the context of the menu design experiment, where the LLMâ€™s recipe-level predictions are compared against the order frequency for the recipes that were selected for the final menu. For the holistic measures of overall satisfaction and purchase intent in the sensory profile prediction task, no LLMs outperform a random baseline, though some do on specific dimensions such as greasiness or saltiness. For online recipe rating, three of six LLMs outperform a random baseline. We note that all evaluated LLMs outperform a random baseline in context of the menu design experiment, where no actual tasting occurs and the orders are purely based on the text of the recipe (Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results}). Additionally, we studied how performance varies with the magnitude of the ground truth preference gap. When restricting the evaluated recipe pairs to be in the top quartile of preference gaps, LLM performance improves, with the best LLMs achieving 81\%, 86\%, and 85\% accuracy respectively in the three prediction tasks (Appendix Tables~\ref{tab:menu-preference-rating-q4},\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results-q4},\ref{tab:task3a}). Thus, our analysis suggests that LLMs can be useful for coarse-grained preference prediction tasks, but that further work is needed for fine-grained prediction, particularly for the mapping from recipes or product formulations to actual taste.
Additionally, consistent with past research on LLMs' modeling of minority preferences~\cite{santurkar2023whose}, our results showed that LLMs model human preferences related to plant-based food less accurately. Thus, regular human feedback, e.g. taste testings, from diverse populations remains critical. 
Overall, these results suggest that LLMs can be useful in experimental design, generation of sustainable recipes (as evaluated in the menu design task), and coarse-grained preference prediction. 
%given ingredient constraints

%Our analysis identifies both strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in the domain of sustainable food. One actionable finding is that, as determined by expert food scientists, o1-preview appears to be useful, even superior to fellow expert human food scientists, in generating ideas for revision of plant-based meat products in response to sensory panel feedback. While o1-preview on its own does not perform well on our menu design task, combining o1-preview with combinatorial optimization techniques is able to reduce average emissions of food orders by 79\% while maintaining patron satisfaction. Our approach of integrating LLMs with optimization methods, integrating LLMs' capabilities in flexible generation and coarse-grained modeling of human preferences (between text-based descriptions of food) with optimization to meet constraints and balance multiple objectives, may be of independent interest in other domains. \textcolor{red}{Long sentence. TODO: maybe say more here. Can generalize, and we will improve. Also reorder discussion to be same order as paper.}

%LLMs displayed weaker performance for prediction tasks involving the mapping from a description of food to actual sensory properties or satisfaction, though still outperformed random baselines, and their performance improved for coarse-grained prediction specifically. Additionally, consistent with past research on LLMs' modeling of minority preferences~\cite{santurkar2023whose}, our results showed that LLMs model human preferences related to plant-based food less accurately. Taken together, these results suggest that, while LLMs may be useful in generating plausible and detailed suggestions to improve a plant-based product, or generating plant-based recipes that sound appealing, regular human feedback, e.g. taste testings, remains critical. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Two actionable takeaways. Actionable finding is that o1-preview is immediately useful in alternative protein development. While o1-preview on its own does not perform well on our menu design task, combining o1-preview with combinatorial optimization techniques is able to reduce average emissions of food orders by 81\% while maintaining both patron satisfaction and animal welfare. Actionable for menu designers; we make our code for menu optimization publicly available. 
%\item Generation vs. prediction tasks. An apparent contradiction, that LLMs can generate but not predict? Hypothesize that LLMs know what sounds good to humans (as evidenced by an X\% reduction in satisfaction and Y\% increase in emissions when o1-preview's descriptions are removed, though these differences were not statistically significant). Additionally, trained on food science papers, etc. and can brainstorm experimental designs given sensory panel feedback. However, lack a molecular level understanding of how ingredients interact to produce sensory properties. Takeaway: can assist in generation tasks but regular human taste testing or other feedback will remain critical.
%\item Minority preferences. 
%\item Dual use. 
%\item Climate impact of LLMs. 
%\end{itemize}

%We note several limitations to be addressed in future work. 
\noindent \textbf{Limitations.} We did not do significant prompt engineering, and leave this as an area for future work.
In the sustainable protein tasks, we did not have access to the full product formulation, only ingredients and nutritional information. However, we consider this a positive, that users do not necessarily have to provide sensitive intellectual property to receive useful outputs from LLMs.
In our menu design task, we did not provide incentives to make a realistic choice, such as delivering the meals to participants. Additionally, we did not study dimensions of food choice such as food waste and portion size.
A stronger baseline for this task would have been a human chef given the same menu and constraints, though we note that our ``Vegetarian" baseline is based on the top vegetarian meals on online delivery apps.
Future work could establish an expert human (food scientist or chef) baseline for the preference prediction tasks.
In the experimental design task, implementing the suggestions and running a second sensory panel to determine whether the suggestions improve the product is an area for future work.

%\subsection{Call to Action} We see this paper as an initial step in establishing AI for sustainable food as an interdisciplinary research area. We believe that researchers can play an important role in the development of sustainable foods, as individual alternative protein companies are generally not incentivized to share data or other IP.
%The scope of our paper is broad by design, including topics pertaining to both food science - the development of novel sustainable foods - and computational social science - promoting the consumption of existing sustainable foods. Future work can delve into each of these areas in greater depth and obtain a more fine-grained understanding of LLM strengths and weaknesses, as well as potentially build upon LLMs to design models specialized to these domains. 
%Our take-aways on what should be done more TODO.

\section*{Impact Statement}
% ethical aspects and future 
%societal consequence
Our paper is directly motivated by broader societal impacts, specifically in sustainability and public health. Our task definitions and results could spur progress in both development of novel sustainable foods and greater adoption of existing sustainable foods.
The potential benefits of a sustainable protein transition are significant. For example, a recent life cycle assessment found that, relative to a beef burger patty, the production of a plant-based burger patty made with soy protein is associated with 98\%, 87\%, and 99\% lower GHG emissions, land use, and air pollution respectively~\cite{saerens2021life}, with similar estimates for other types of sustainable protein~\cite{gfiEnvironmentalImpacts}. Additionally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a societal transition from animal-based food (ABF) to plant-based food (PBF) by 2050 would reduce land-based GHG emissions by two-thirds relative to the business-as-usual case \cite{ipcc2019}. 

In the menu design task, we consider ethical aspects such as the trade-offs among patron satisfaction, sustainability, and animal welfare, and show that our approach can improve or maintain all dimensions. Designing menus to shift the distribution of patron choices may raise questions of respect for individual autonomy. We thus use three different metrics of patron satisfaction, and show that all are maintained with the revised menu (Appendix Figures~\ref{fig:task4-satisfaction},\ref{fig:task4-all-visit},\ref{fig:task4-all-recommend}). 

We also note that current sustainable proteins are sometimes considered ``ultra-processed" and therefore unhealthy~\cite{nytimesFakeMeat}. We view this as a challenge for the next generation of sustainable proteins that AI could potentially help with, via jointly optimizing for satisfaction, nutrition, climate impacts, cost, and other relevant factors. 
Use of LLMs for developing unhealthy or less sustainable foods is also a concern. We acknowledge that such work is likely ongoing, and we study here how LLMs can also be useful for applications that benefit society. 

Lastly, the benefits of LLM-supported development of sustainable food should be interpreted jointly with the environmental impacts of LLMs themselves (such as energy and water use). While pre-training in particular requires significant resources~\cite{van2021sustainable}, we note that work to reduce the climate impacts of LLMs is ongoing~\cite{patterson2021carbon,li2024sprout}. Future research can continue to explore ways to leverage pre-trained models for applications that contribute to positive environmental outcomes.

%(such as lowering food systems' GHG emissions) 
%Moreover, the use of LLMs for optimizing unhealthy or unsustainable food is also a concern. Although LLMs can be used for various goals, research at the intersection of AI and food should prioritize applications that are grounded in practitioners' real-world needs and challenges, such as the identified difficulties in overcoming taste concerns or accurately modeling patron preferences when developing sustainable food. Future work could thus explore the roles and needs of key food practitioners involved in various stages of the food system, including but not limited to: food production (i.e., farmers), preparation (i.e., chefs), distribution (i.e., grocery store managers), and safety (i.e., food inspectors). 

%Finally, dual use of LLMs for developing less sustainable foods (e.g. animal-based) is also a concern. We acknowledge that such work is likely ongoing in industry and we aim to encourage researchers at the intersection of AI and food to prioritize applications that align with sustainability, public health, and ethical considerations. %\textcolor{red}{Althoguh AI could be used for all sorts of other food science, it is particularly impactful for helath and sustainability where optimizing for user preferences is particularly difficult.

\section{Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:llm-accuracy}}\label{sec:proof-prop-1}
The problem we would like to solve is:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x} \quad & f(x) := \sum_{i=1}^N p(u_i)x_i + \lambda d(x)\\
& \sum_{i=1}^N x_i = K  \\
& x_i \in \{0,1\}\:\forall i \in [1, ..., N]
\end{aligned}\label{eq:ideal-prob}
\end{equation}

However, we do not have access to the true scores $p(u_i)$, e.g. actual satisfaction of a specified population with a recipe. Instead, we use an LLM to produce the estimates $\hat{p}(u_i)$, and solve:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x} \quad & \hat{f}(x) := \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{p}(u_i)x_i + \lambda d(x)\\
& \sum_{i=1}^N x_i = K  \\
& x_i \in \{0,1\}\:\forall i \in [1, ..., N]
\end{aligned}\label{eq:actual-prob}
\end{equation}

Let $x^{\ast}$ be the optimal solution of (\ref{eq:ideal-prob}), and let $\hat{x}^{\ast}$ be the optimal solution of (\ref{eq:actual-prob}).

\begin{proposition}
Let $p(u_i), \hat{p}(u_i) \in [0,1]$, and $d(x) \in [0,D]$. If $|\hat{p}(u_i) - p(u_i)| \leq \epsilon$ for all $u_i \in U$, then $|f(\hat{x}^{\ast}) - f(x^{\ast})| \leq 2K\epsilon + 2\lambda D$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
First, note that $\forall x, |f(x) - \hat{f}(x)| \leq K\epsilon + \lambda D$.
Then, combining this with the optimality of $x^{\ast}$ and $\hat{x}^{\ast}$, $f(\hat{x}^{\ast}) \geq \hat{f}(\hat{x}^{\ast}) - (K\epsilon + \lambda D) \geq \hat{f}(x^{\ast}) - (K\epsilon + \lambda D) \geq f(x^{\ast}) - 2K\epsilon - 2\lambda D$.
\end{proof}

\section{Extended Related Work}\label{sec:extended-related-work}
\paragraph{Large Language Models and Reasoning.} Our work broadly pertains to the integration of LLMs with other tools for reasoning tasks. \citet{pmlr-v235-ahmaditeshnizi24a} develop an agent called OptiMUS for formulating and solving (mixed integer) linear programming problems from their natural language descriptions. Their goal is to expand access to solvers to individuals who lack the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems. \citet{ye2024satlm} propose SatLM, which combines LLMs with SAT solvers to solve problems in arithmetic reasoning, logical reasoning, and symbolic reasoning. \citet{pan-etal-2023-logic} propose Logic-LM, which integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical reasoning. Relative to these works, our setting is fundamentally different, where the underlying optimization problem is not fully specified due to involving subjective human preferences or other components that are difficult to formalize mathematically. We are specifically motivated by the food domain, in which human satisfaction must be considered (alongside other factors such as nutrition, cost, emissions, etc.), but is difficult to write down mathematically. Similar problems arise in settings such as education (e.g. curriculum design) and health (e.g. fitness regimen design). Our framework is also applicable to settings where it may take considerable effort to formally specify the optimization problem, e.g. computing climate impacts as well as cost, nutrition, etc. for each food item, but an LLM may be able to generate sufficiently accurate estimates. We also note past work in the natural language processing literature on combining integer programming with machine learning, e.g.~\citet{denis2007joint}, which used integer linear programming for coference resolution.
\paragraph{Large Language Models for Climate, Sustainability, and Food.}
\citet{pmlr-v235-bulian24a} propose an evaluation framework for LLMs in the domain of climate information.~\citet{morio2023an} create a benchmark dataset for assessing corporate climate policy engagement and evaluate several language models. 
\citet{huang2024foodpuzzle} introduce the FoodPuzzle dataset and create an LLM-based agent for flavor profile prediction. They define two tasks: molecular food prediction, in which the goal is to predict food sources based on their molecular composition, and molecular profile completion, in which the goal is to identify the missing molecules needed to complete the molecular profile of a given food item. Within our paper, the most closely related task is sensory profile prediction.
Our work differs in that we evaluate LLMs on their ability to predict dimensions otherwise evaluated by a human sensory panel, such as overall satisfaction, purchase intent, meatiness, etc. prevalent in the current practice of product development in food science. Sensory panels are essential but also very expensive and time consuming to both run and analyze. %Our task definitions are grounded in the current practice of product development in food science, in which sensory panels are essential but also very expensive and time consuming to both run and analyze. 
Additionally, our evaluation specifically focuses on sustainable protein rather than general food science. Finally,~\citet{huang2024foodpuzzle} develop an agent based on in-context learning and retrieval augmented generation, whereas we evaluate LLMs on our sustainable protein tasks via zero-shot prompting, as well as integration with combinatorial optimization.  
%\textcolor{red}{add FlavorPuzzle.}
\paragraph{Artifical Intelligence for Climate, Sustainability, and Food.} 
Previous work has studied climate- and environment- related applications of artificial intelligence~\cite{tuia2022perspectives,chapman2024biodiversity,madadkhani2024tackling,kaack2022aligning}. Within the food domain, previous work has explored how AI can reduce energy use in plant factories to support sustainable food production~\cite{decardi2024artificial}. \citet{st2024mechanical} demonstrated that a combination of mechanical testing and ML can describe food texture in a similar manner to human taste testers.
%an approach combining a three-dimensional mechanical technique and AI can mimic our sensory experience, which can be leveraged to improve plant-based meats.
%Climate- and environment-related applications of artificial intelligence have received attention within the ML communities

\section{Supplementary Information on Datasets}
\subsection{NECTAR Dataset}\label{app:nectar}
The NECTAR dataset was collected over the period of June to August 2023 in Precision Research's Chicago research center. It is only available to academic researchers to reduce harm to the reputations of companies whose products performed poorly in the taste testing. Additional information can be found at \url{https://www.nectar.org/taste}.
It consists of 5,516 sensory evaluations of 47 products, and will continue to grow in size over the coming years. Each sensory evaluation consists of 21 dimensions, shown in Table~\ref{tab:sensory-dims}. %Participants were recruited via .
The products were prepared in a test kitchen according to manufacturers' instructions.
Plant-based product selection criteria were based on popularity, availability (i.e. distributed in-market at the time of the test), and
similarity to analog animal offerings (i.e. veggie burgers made from whole plants were not included, whereas plant-based burgers
aiming to mimic the eating experience of animal-based burgers were included).
All tasting was blind and monadic (one product at a time), and the panel was untrained.

\subsection{Experimental Design}\label{sec:additional-methods-exp-design}
The 30 sustainable protein products used in this task consisted of six products from each of the five categories. Further information on the food scientists is in Table~\ref{tab:food-scientist-properties}.
The prompt for Phase 1 is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:llm-prompt-phase-1}, and %, and the expert human food scientists received the same instructions except with the first line (``You are an expert plant-based meat food scientist.") removed. 
our standardization prompt is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:llm-prompt-standardization}. 
%The former three are on a 10-point scale, and the latter is in hours. 
Precise definitions of the dimensions of evaluation in Phase 2 are in Section~\ref{sec:eval-dims-alt-protein-design}. In Phase 1, 15 food scientists participated, each evaluating 2 products. In Phase 2, again 15 food scientists participated, each evaluating 2 products (with one human and one LLM response per product), with an overlap of 10 food scientists between Phase 1 and Phase 2.

\subsection{Menu Design}\label{sec:appendix-methods-menu-design}
%Recipe rating step was based on the title of the recipe. 
The original menu we use is from \citet{banerjee2023sustainable}, who chose the items from Deliveroo's and Just Eat's top 100 items ordered in the United Kingdom in 2019. They also adjusted the items following pilot surveys. The menu includes 19 non-vegetarian and 17 vegetarian or vegan items. The original paper says 18 non-vegetarian and 18 vegetarian or vegan options, but a dish called ``Panchetta Carbonara'' was included in the vegetarian section. For some items, the original menu included a ``(v)'' parenthetical indicating that a vegan option is available. We removed these parentheticals for simplicity in survey design and computing GHG emissions. Following~\citet{banerjee2023sustainable}, GHG emissions were estimated based on the main ingredient of the dish. Data from~\citet{poore2018reducing} were used to compute emissions. For animal welfare, data from Faunalytics, a leading animal welfare organization, on number of animals killed per kilogram of various meats were used ~\cite{faunalyticsImpactReplacing}. Two meats in the original menu, lamb and duck, were not contained in the Faunalytics data, and instead were imputed using the value for turkey, an animal of roughly similar size. Table~\ref{tab:menu-design-sample-sizes} shows the sample sizes per arm in the Prolific experiments.

\subsection{Experimental Design}\label{app:results-experimental-design}
Figures~\ref{fig:o1-preview-output} and~\ref{fig:o1-preview-output-2} show an example output from \opreview.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=lightgray, colframe=gray, coltitle=black, title=Example Output]
1. Appearance Enhancement

   Many participants found the appearance unappetizing, describing it as``looks like a dog treat,"``raw," or ``fake."

   - Experiment: Test natural coloring agents to achieve a more authentic bacon look. Incorporate beet juice or paprika extract to enhance redness and use coconut oil for marbling effects.\\
   - Variables: Vary concentrations of coloring agents and adjust cooking times and temperatures to achieve desired caramelization.\\
   - Metrics: Conduct sensory evaluations focusing on appearance, measuring scores against the current mean of 2.47.

2. Texture Improvement

   Issues with a mushy center and inconsistent crispiness were noted.

   - Experiment: Adjust the protein blend ratios and incorporate texturizers like methylcellulose to enhance firmness and coherence.\\
   - Variables: Test different ratios of soy and wheat proteins; vary levels of konjac powder and vegetable gums.\\
   - Metrics: Use texture profile analysis to measure hardness and chewiness; collect sensory feedback on texture aiming to improve the mean from 3.43 towards 4 (neutral).

3. Flavor Enhancement

   Participants desired more smokiness and found the taste bland.

   - Experiment: Increase natural smoke flavoring and seasoning levels to enhance meatiness and smokiness.\\
   - Variables: Experiment with different types and concentrations of smoke extracts (e.g., hickory, applewood) and adjust salt and sugar levels.\\
   - Metrics: Sensory evaluations on flavor and smokiness, targeting improvements from means of 3.58 and 2.43 towards 4.

4. Reduce Greasiness

   Some found the product too greasy.

   - Experiment: Reduce sunflower oil content or replace it with a less greasy alternative like canola oil.\\
   - Variables: Vary oil types and quantities.\\
   - Metrics: Measure perceived greasiness in sensory tests, aiming to adjust the mean from 2.53 to 3 (moderately greasy).

\end{tcolorbox}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=lightgray, colframe=gray, coltitle=black, title=Example Output]
1. Improve Texture and Crispiness.
Issue: The product is perceived as too soft and lacking crispiness (Mean crispiness rating: 5.86; ideal is 4).\\
Changes:\\
- Adjust ingredient composition by incorporating crisping agents like rice flour or modifying the ratio of wheat gluten to reduce chewiness.\\
- Modify the process by slicing the product thinner and adjusting cooking temperatures and times to achieve a crisper texture.\\
Experiment:\\
- Design a factorial experiment testing different levels of rice flour (e.g., 1\%, 2\%, 3\%) and cooking temperatures (e.g., 350Â°F, 375Â°F, 400Â°F).\\
- Measure the crispiness using texture analysis and conduct sensory evaluations.\\
2. Enhance Flavor Profile. Issue: Flavor is disliked, with complaints of excessive saltiness and artificial taste (Mean flavor rating: 2.22; saltiness rating skewed towards too salty).
Changes:\\
- Reduce salt content by gradually decreasing salt levels by 10-20\%.\\
- Increase umami and smokiness by adding natural umami enhancers like mushroom extract or increasing natural smoke flavors.\\
- Balance sweetness by introducing a small amount of natural sweeteners like maple syrup to mimic bacon's sweet-salty balance.
Experiment:\\
- Create a series of formulations with varying salt levels (e.g., full, -10\%, -20\%) and added sweeteners.\\
- Conduct sensory tests focusing on flavor liking and saltiness perception.\\
3. Improve Appearance. Issue: Appearance is inconsistent; some find it artificial (Mixed feedback on color; Mean color rating: 4.42).\\
Changes:\\
- Introduce marbling by using natural colorants to create a marbled fat appearance, mimicking real bacon.\\
- Adjust color by modifying the hue using oleoresin paprika for red tones and annatto for lighter shades.\\
Experiment:\\
- Develop prototypes with different marbling techniques and colorant levels.\\
- Perform visual assessments with consumers to rate appearance authenticity.\\
4. Increase Greasiness. Issue: Product is not perceived as greasy enough (Mean greasiness rating: 1.39; ideal is 3).\\
Changes:\\
- Incorporate plant-based fats by increasing the amount of oils like coconut or sunflower oil.\\
- Use fat release technology by employing oil encapsulation that melts during cooking to simulate bacon fat.\\
Experiment:\\
- Test formulations with varying fat levels (e.g., 2\%, 4\%, 6\% additional oil).
- Evaluate greasiness through sensory panels and measure perceived oiliness.

The 25th and 50th percentile of the preference gap were both 1 (the minimum gap needed for inclusion in the analysis in Table~\ref{tab:sensory-profile-prediction-results}), so we did not test those quartiles. Accuracies statistically significant according to chi-squared test are in bold. \gptthree\:did not produce a valid output for this task and thus was not tested. We note that LLM predictions were based on the recipe title alone (not including the full description), which could explain the discrepancy between item-level prediction performance and menu-level performance for \opreview. When its descriptions were replaced with a simple list of ingredients (in one of the ablations), \opreview's accuracy in this quartile was 84\% ($p$=2.40e-20).}
