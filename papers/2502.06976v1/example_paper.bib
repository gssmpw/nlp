abstract = {Recent technological advances in hardware design of the robotic platforms enabled the implementation of various control modalities for improved interactions with humans and unstructured environments. An important application area for the integration of robots with such advanced interaction capabilities is human---robot collaboration. This aspect represents high socio-economic impacts and maintains the sense of purpose of the involved people, as the robots do not completely replace the humans from the work process. The research community's recent surge of interest in this area has been devoted to the implementation of various methodologies to achieve intuitive and seamless human---robot-environment interactions by incorporating the collaborative partners' superior capabilities, e.g. human's cognitive and robot's physical power generation capacity. In fact, the main purpose of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art on intermediate human---robot interfaces (bi-directional), robot control modalities, system stability, benchmarking and relevant use cases, and to extend views on the required future developments in the realm of human---robot collaboration.},

abstract = {It is well understood that, through cooperation, multiple agents can achieve tasks that are unachievable by a single agent. However, there are no formal characterizations of situations where cooperation is required to achieve a goal, thus warranting the application of multiple agents. In this paper, we provide such a formal characterization for multi-agent planning problems with sequential action execution. We first show that determining whether there is required cooperation (RC) is in general intractable even in this limited setting. As a result, we start our analysis with a subset of more restrictive problems where agents are homogeneous. For such problems, we identify two conditions that can cause RC. We establish that when none of these conditions hold, the problem is single-agent solvable; otherwise, we provide upper bounds on the minimum number of agents required. For the remaining problems with heterogeneous agents, we further divide them into two subsets. For one of the subsets, we propose the concept of transformer agent to reduce the number of agents to be considered which is used to improve planning performance. We implemented a planner using our theoretical results and compared it with one of the best IPC CoDMAP planners in the centralized track. Results show that our planner provides significantly improved performance on IPC CoDMAP domains.},

abstract = {Metrics for human-robot teaming should extend to teams consisting of multiple human and robotic agents, and to teams working in complex, dynamic work domains. This work proposes that to comprehensively analyze and evaluate multi-human, multi-robot teams, traditional HRI metrics of performance, and efficiency must be expanded upon to incorporate metrics of teamwork. We develop five distinct metrics to capture both ecological and cognitive aspects of teamwork found to be important in human-automation interaction, inspired by research in the cognitive systems engineering (CSE) community. We demonstrate the application of these metrics in a spacecraft maintenance case study comparing multiple human-robot team architectures. The case study demonstrates that the teamwork metrics capture aspects of human-robot interaction (HRI) not apparent when using only traditional performance and efficiency metrics. The article concludes that the proposed teamwork metrics are complementary to existing metrics in HRI and should be included in the evaluation of human-robot teams.},

abstract = {Abstract We propose a Systems Modeling Language (SysML) extension, referred to as the “Human-Agent Teaming Modeling Language,” and a companion method, referred to as “Human-Agent Teaming Design Method,” which are useful in the design and specification of teams comprised of humans and artificial agents which interact within a system. The language and method support the analysis and design of human-agent teams through a three-step process. First, an existing system is analyzed to understand the goals to be achieved as well as the roles and the responsibilities necessary to support goal attainment. Simultaneously, a team of humans and artificial agents are synthesized wherein each entity has capabilities useful in fulfilling the responsibilities. Second, responsibilities are allocated to agents by matching agent capabilities to responsibilities. Finally, the design is vetted through the application of an extension to an existing method referred to as Interdependence Analysis. This step includes the specification of teaming behaviors between humans and artificial agents to improve system robustness. We posit that the proposed language and method can be useful in specifying requirements for artificial agents, human knowledge, and procedure requirements, as well as components of critical interaction between multiple humans and artificial agents comprising a human-agent team.},

abstract = {Coactive Design is a new approach to address the increasingly sophisticated roles that people and robots play as the use of robots expands into new, complex domains. The approach is motivated by the desire for robots to perform less like teleoperated tools or independent automatons and more like interdependent teammates. In this article, we describe what it means to be interdependent, why this is important, and the design implications that follow from this perspective. We argue for a human-robot system model that supports interdependence through careful attention to requirements for observability, predictability, and directability. We present a Coactive Design method and show how it can be a useful approach for developers trying to understand how to translate high-level teamwork concepts into reusable control algorithms, interface elements, and behaviors that enable robots to fulfill their envisioned role as teammates. As an example of the coactive design approach, we present our results from the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge, a competition designed to spur development of advanced robots that can assist humans in recovering from natural and man-made disasters. Twenty-six teams from eight countries competed in three different tasks providing an excellent evaluation of the relative effectiveness of different approaches to human-machine system design.},
