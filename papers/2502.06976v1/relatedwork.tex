Previous works in human-agent teaming use task performance or episodic reward~\cite{fcp,hsp,mep,cole,zsceval,metric1} to evaluate the team's performance. \cite{metric3,metric6,metric7} emphasize the significance of designing different metrics for evaluation
such as collaborative fluency, robot and human idle time etc.~\cite{metric3} and subjective user studies to measure trust, engagement and fluency of the agents when paired with a human~\cite{metric3,metric4,metric5}.~\cite{int5} places interdependence at the center of their model for designing human-machine systems, making it the organizing principle around which the rest of the team's structure and behavior revolves.
~\cite{int1} emphasizes that an effective integration of AI into human teams depends the ability of AI agents to collaborate with humans by managing interdependencies.
