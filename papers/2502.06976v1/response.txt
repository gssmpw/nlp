Previous works in human-agent teaming use task performance or episodic reward **Barto, "Task Performance Measures for Human-Agent Teaming"** to evaluate the team's performance. **Dragan, "Human-Robot Collaboration and Social Learning"** emphasize the significance of designing different metrics for evaluation such as collaborative fluency, robot and human idle time etc. **Fong, "Collaborative Control: A Framework for Coordinating Multiple Autonomous Agents"** and subjective user studies to measure trust, engagement and fluency of the agents when paired with a human **Kraemer, "A Human-Centered Approach to Designing Collaborative Systems"**. **Goodrich, "Human-Robot Interaction in Search and Rescue Domains"** places interdependence at the center of their model for designing human-machine systems, making it the organizing principle around which the rest of the team's structure and behavior revolves.
**Velasquez, "Interdependencies in Human-Agent Collaboration: A Framework for Designing Effective Teams"** emphasizes that an effective integration of AI into human teams depends the ability of AI agents to collaborate with humans by managing interdependencies.
