\section*{Ethics statement}

Our professional translator annotators were sourced by a translation agency. They were given sufficient time to complete the task and paid fairly. 

The annotators worked on the news data from WMT2023 \citep{freitag-etal-2023-results} that should not contain offensive content. The annotation task did not ask for personally identifiable information.
