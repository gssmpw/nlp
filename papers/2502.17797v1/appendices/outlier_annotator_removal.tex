\section{Identifying and Addressing Outlier Annotators}\label{appendix:outlier_annotator}

One annotator is excluded from the \ZhEn~annotation results due to significant deviations in annotation behavior compared to their peers, which could skew the results and compromise the reliability. This decision was based on two key observations. 

First, this annotator identified an exceptionally high number of errors compared to their peers. Given the mean and the standard deviation of the error counts in \tableref{tab:mean_std_error_cnt}, the outlier annotator's \textit{z}-score for \ZhEn~\sxsmqm~is 2.28, placing them more than two standard deviations above the mean. In contrast, all other annotators, regardless of whether they contributed to \ZhEn~or \EnDe, remain within two standard deviations of the mean.

Second, visualizing the segment scores contributed by each annotator using violin plots revealed that the outlier annotator from \ZhEn~was the only one with a distinctly unimodal distribution in \ZhEn~\sxsmqm, as illustrated in \figureref{fig:violin}. This is stark contrast to the more varied distributions observed among other annotators. %This characteristic persisted regardless of whether the scores were \textit{z}-normalized or not, further highlighting a stark deviation from the more varied distributions observed among other annotators. %NOTE FROM PARKER: If I understand correctly, Z-normalization is guaranteed to not affect the multi-/uni-modality of a distribution, so no need to mention it here.

Based on the two key observations of the outlier annotator's behavior in \sxsmqm, we opted to exclude their annotated data from the analyses. After removing the segments annotated by the outlier annotator, there are 16 documents with 220 segments in \ZhEn~with an average token count of 31.45 per segment.
