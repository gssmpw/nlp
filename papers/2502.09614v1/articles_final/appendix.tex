\subsection{Data Preprocessing} \label{sec:supp_method_dta_preprocess}


% \todo{kinematics retargeting}

\noindent\textbf{Kinematic retargeting. } 
We curate kinematic robot-object interaction data from human references by retargeting robot hand manipulation sequences from human hand trajectories. For instance, given a human hand-object interaction trajectory describing the human hand pose sequences represented in MANO and the object pose sequences $(\mathbf{H}^{\text{human}}), \mathbf{O}$ as well as the description of the articulated robot hand, we retarget $\mathbf{H}^{\text{human}}$ to acquire the robot hand trajectory $\mathbf{H}$. We manually define correspondences between the robot hand mesh and the MNAO hand mesh. After that, the sequence of the robot hand DoF positions is optimized so that the resulting robot hand mesh sequence is close to the human hand sequence. Formally, let $\mathbf{K}^{\text{human}}$ and $\mathbf{K}$ denote the human hand keypoint sequence and the robot hand keypoint sequence respectively, the optimization objective is:
\begin{align}
    \text{minimize} \Vert \mathbf{K} - \mathbf{K}^{\text{human}} \Vert.  \label{eq_appendix_opt_retargeting}
\end{align}
We use PyTorch\_Kinematics~\citep{Zhong_PyTorch_Kinematics_2024} to calculate the forward kinematics. Specifically, given the robot hand per-joint DoF position $\mathbf{\theta}_n$ at the timestep $n$, we calculate $\mathbf{h}_n$ and $\mathbf{k}_n$ as follows:
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{h}_n &= \text{Forward\_Kinematics}(\mathbf{\theta}_n), \\
    \mathbf{k}_n &= \text{KeyPoints}(\text{Forward\_Kinematics}(\mathbf{\theta}_n)),
\end{align}
where $\text{Forward\_Kinematics}(\cdot)$ computes the forward kinematics using the function provided in PyTorch\_Kinematics, $\text{KeyPoints}(\cdot)$ reads out keypoints from the converted articulated mesh. 
\textcolor{myblue}{
We use a second-order optimizer, \textit{i.e.,} L-BFGS implemented in PyTorch, to solve the optimization problem~\ref{eq_appendix_opt_retargeting}.

\subsection{Tracking Controller Training} \label{sec:supp_method_tracking_controller_train}




\noindent\textbf{Controlling a floating-base articulated hand.} The articulated hand is represented in the reduced coordinate $\mathbf{\theta}^{\text{finger}}$. We additionally add three translation joints and three revolute joints to control the global position and orientation of the hand, resulting in $\mathbf{\theta} = (\mathbf{\theta})^{\text{trans}}, \mathbf{\theta}^{\text{rot}}, \mathbf{\theta}^{\text{rot}})$. For the Allegro hand and the LEAP hand that we use in our experiments, $\mathbf{\theta}^{\text{finger}}$  is a 16-dimensional vector. Therefore, $\mathbf{\theta}$ is a 22-dimensional vector. 



\noindent\textbf{Observations.} 
The observation at each timestep $n$ encodes the current hand and object state, the next goal state, baseline trajectory, actions, and the object geometry: 
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{o}_n = \{ \mathbf{s}_n, \dot{\mathbf{s}}_n,  \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{n+1}, \mathbf{s}^b_n, \mathbf{a}_n, \text{feat}_{\text{obj}}, \text{aux}_n \}. \label{eq_obs}
\end{align}
where $\text{aux}_n$ is the auxiliary features, computed as follows:
\begin{align}
    \text{aux}_n = \{ \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{n+1}, \mathbf{f}_n, \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{n+1} \ominus {\mathbf{s}}_n,    \}, \label{eq:observations_aux}
\end{align}
where $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{n+1}\ominus {\mathbf{s}}_n$  calculates the difference between two states, including the hand state difference and the object state difference, $\mathbf{f}_n$ indicates the hand finger positions in the world space.

\noindent\textbf{Reward.} Our reward for manipulating tracking encourages the transited hand state and the object state to be close to their corresponding reference states and the hand-object affinity: 
\begin{align}
    r = w_{o, p} r_{o, p} + w_{o, q} r_{o, q} + w_{\text{wrist}} r_{\text{wrist}} + w_{\text{finger}} r_{\text{finger}} + w_{\text{affinity}} r_{\text{affinity}}, \label{eq_rew}
\end{align}
where $r_{o,p},r_{o, q},r_{\text{wrist}},r_{\text{finger}}$ are rewards for tracking object position, object orientation, hand wrist, hand fingers, $w_{o, p},  w_{o, q}, w_{\text{wrist}}, w_{\text{finger}},  w_{\text{affinity}}$ are their weights. 
 $r_{o,p},r_{o, q},r_{\text{wrist}},r_{\text{finger}}$ are computed as follows:
\begin{align}
    r_{o,p} &= 0.9 - \Vert \mathbf{p}_n^o - \hat{\mathbf{p}}_n^o \Vert_2, \\
    r_{o,q} &= \text{np.pi} - \text{Diff\_Angle}(\mathbf{q}_n^o - \hat{\mathbf{q}}_n^o )), \\
    r_{\text{wrist}} &= -(w_{\text{trans}} \Vert \mathbf{s}_n^h[:3] - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_n^h[:3] \Vert_1 + w_{\text{ornt}} \Vert \mathbf{s}_n^h[3:6] - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_n^h[3:6] \Vert_1 \\
    r_{\text{finger}} &= -w_{\text{finger}} \Vert \mathbf{s}_n^h[6:] - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_n^h[6:] \Vert_1 
    % \label{eq:rew_obj} \\
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{p}^o_n$ and $\mathbf{q}_n^o$ denote the position and the orientation, represented in quaternion, of the current object, $\mathbf{s}_n^h$ denotes the current hand state. In addition to these rewards, we would add an additional bonus reward $1$ if the object is accurately tracked, \emph{i.e.,} with the rotation error kept in $5$-degree and the translation error kept in $5$-cm. 
\textcolor{myblue}{Table~\ref{tb_method_reward_weights} summarizes weights of different reward components we use in our experiments. }



\noindent\textbf{Pre-processing object features.} We train PonintNet-based auto-encoder on all objects from the two datasets we considered, namely GRAB and TACO. After that, we use the latent embedding of each object as its latent feature feeding into the observation of the tracking controller. The object feature dimension is 256 in our experiments.

% \todo{how to set the iteration K}



% Our reward for manipulating tracking comprises three components: the hand reward $r_{h}$, the object reward $r_o$, and the hand-object affinity reward $r_d$. The object reward encourages the transited object position and the orientation close to their kinematic references: $r_o = w_p r_{o,p} + w_q r_{o,q}$. 
% The object reward includes both position and orientation rewards, defined as: 
% \begin{align}
%     r_o = w_p(0.9 - \Vert \mathbf{s}_n^p - \hat{\mathbf{o}}_n^p \Vert_2 ) + w_q(\text{np.pi} - \text{Diff\_Angle}(\mathbf{o}_n^q - \hat{\mathbf{o}}_n^q )), \label{eq:rew_obj}
% \end{align}
% where $w_p$ and $w_q$ are the weights for position and orientation rewards, respectively, and $\text{Diff\_Angle}(\cdot, \cdot)$  computes the rotation angle difference between two quaternions. The hand reward is calculated as the negative weighted sum of the current hand joint positions and the reference positions:
% \begin{align}
%     r_h = -(w_{\text{trans}} \Vert \mathbf{h}_n[:3] - \hat{\mathbf{h}}_n[:3] \Vert_1 + w_{\text{ornt}} \Vert \mathbf{h}_n[3:6] - \hat{\mathbf{h}}_n[3:6] \Vert_1 + w_{\text{finger}} \Vert \mathbf{h}_n[6:] - \hat{\mathbf{h}}_n[6:] \Vert_1  ), \label{eq:rew_hand}

\noindent\textbf{Mining effective homotopy optimization paths.} The maximum number of iterations $K$ is set to $3$ in our method to balance between the time cost and the effectiveness. 

We need to identify neighbors for each tracking task so that we can avoid iterating over all tasks and reduce the time cost. We use the cross-kinematic trajectory similarity to filter neighboring tasks. We pre-select $K_{\text{nei}}=$10 neighbouring tasks for each tracking task. 
% Given all manipulation trajectories from the training dataset $\mathcal{S}$, the tracking curricula mining wants to find valid curricula from them. A curriculum ($B\rightarrow A$) is regarded as valid if we can solve the tracking problem of trajectory $A$ better by initializing its basic trajectory as the successfully tracked action trajectory of $B$. To reduce the time consumption, we propose to first identify a potential neighbor set containing $K_{\text{nei}}$ trajectories for each trajectory via cross-trajectory similarities. After that, during each searching iteration, for each task $A$, we only try to test trajectories in its neighborhood set to see whether they can form a valid curriculum in that iteration. Such a strategy reduces the time complexity to $N_{\text{iter}} K_{\text{nei}} \vert \mathcal{S} \vert$, where $N_{\text{iter}}$ is the number of the searching iterations. 

% We simply calculate the per-frame average hand DoF position differences and the

% The structural task relational space wants to quantify the cross-task relations for each two different tasks in the expanded task set. One can imagine a most ideal way that is trying to test each pair of two manipulation trajectories $(A, B)$ to test whether one task, for instance, task $B$ can benefit from task $A$. However, such a strategy is too expensive with the time complexity $\vert \mathcal{S}\vert^2$. If we wish not to be restricted to the first-order cross-task relations only and also want to explore the high-order relations, for instance, the current task $C$ can benefit from the optimization result of task $B$ with the initialization of task $A$, the brute-force searching would cost $K\vert \mathcal{S}\vert^2$. Therefore, we adopt a heuristic-guided searching strategy to reduce the time consumption to an affordable amount. 
% we first construct an expanded task set by augmenting each single task $(\mathbf{H}_A, \mathbf{O}_A, m_A)$ into $(\mathbf{H}_C, \mathbf{O}_A, m_A)$ and $(\mathbf{H}_A, \mathbf{O}_A, m_C)$. 

% Specifically, we first identify potential neighbors for each task via trajectory similarities and object geometry similarities. Having restricted the number of potential neighbors to a reasonable value, \emph{i.e.,} $K_{\text{nei}}$, we only conduct the affinity test between each potential neighbor. With this strategy, we can reduce the time consumption to $K K_{\text{nei}} \vert \mathcal{S}\vert$. By tuning $K$ and $K_{\text{nei}}$, we can balance the accuracy and the efficiency of the task relation space construction process. Please refer to the Supp. For more details. 
% Besides, it may overlook the high-order task relations, where the current task $C$ can benefit from the optimization result of task $B$ with the initialization of task $A$.

\subsection{Additional Explanations} \label{sec:supp_method_additional_details}

% \noindent\textbf{Additional explanations.} 
In the reward design, we do not include the velocity-related terms since it is impossible for us to get accurate velocities from kinematic references. One can imagine calculating the finite differences between adjacent two frames as the velocities. However, it may not be accurate. Therefore, we do not use them to avoid unnecessary noise.

\noindent\textbf{Training the tracking controller on two datasets.} In the main experiments, the training data and the test data come from the same dataset. We adopt such a setting considering the large cross-dataset trajectory differences. Specifically, GRAB mainly contains manipulation trajectories with daily objects, while TACO mainly covers functional tool-using trajectories. However, jointly using the trajectories from such two datasets to train the model can potentially offer us a stronger controller considering the increased labeled data coverage. Therefore, we additionally conduct this experiment where we train a single model using trajectories provided by the two datasets and test the performance on their test sets respectively. Results are summarized in Table~\ref{tb_exp_additional_jointly_trained_model}, which can still demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

One may wonder whether it is possible to label all the training dataset trajectories and train the tracking controller using those demonstrations.

We therefore manage to label each trajectory in the training dataset of the GRAB dataset by running the per-trajectory tracking experiments in parallel in 16 GPUs using two machines.

The performance can still not reach our original method where we only try to optimize high-quality demonstrations for part of the data (see Table~\ref{tb_exp_main} for details). We suppose it is the quality difference between the two labeled datasets that causes the discrepancy. This further validates our assumption that both the quantity and the quality of the labeled dataset matter to train a good tracking controller.

\noindent\textbf{Further generalization ability evaluations on TACO dataset.}
We further evaluate the model's generalization ability across various test sets within the TACO dataset. As shown in Table~\ref{tb_exp_taco_generalization_test}, the controller performs well in the category-level generalization setting (S1), where object categories are known but manipulation trajectories and object geometries are novel. Performance on S2, involving novel interaction triplets, is satisfactory, demonstrating the controller's capacity to handle new manipulation sequences. However, results from S3 reveal challenges when dealing with new object categories and unseen interaction triplets. For instance, generalizing from interactions with shovels and spoons to using bowls for holding objects is particularly difficult. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_res_robustness_newobj}, despite unfamiliar objects and interactions, we successfully lift the knife and mimic the motion, though execution is imperfect, highlighting areas for improvement and adaptability in challenging scenarios.

\noindent\textbf{Additional results.} We present additional qualitatively results in Figure~\ref{fig_additional_res} to further demonstrate the capability of our method.

\noindent\textbf{Success thresholds.} We define three levels of success rates. The first level of success is defined as reaching the object, finding a good grasp pose, and exhibiting the potential movements to lift the object up, \emph{i.e.,} one side of the object is successfully lifted up from the table. The second level of success is defined as finding a way to manage to lift the whole object up from the table. The third level of success is lifting the object up, followed by keeping tracking the object's trajectory for more than 100 timesteps. 

\noindent\textbf{More results.} For direct tracking results transferring setting, we present the quantitative success rates evaluated on our method and the best-performed baseline in Table~\ref{tb_supp_real_world_results_open_loop} (for the dataset GRAB) and Table~\ref{tb_supp_real_world_results_open_loop_taco} (for the dataset TACO). 
As observed in the table, the tracking results achieved by our method can be well transferred to the real-world robot, helping us achieve obviously better results than the baseline methods. It validates the real-world applicability of our tracking results. 

Please refer to the main text (Sec.~\ref{sec:exp}) for the quantitative comparisons between the transferred controllers. 
We include more qualitative results in Figure~\ref{fig_additional_real_res} to demonstrate the real-world application value of our method.

\noindent\textbf{Generalization experiments on the homotopy path generator.}
To further understand the generalization ability of the homotopy generator, we conduct the following tests: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item (a) Train the path generator via homotopy paths mined from GRAB's training set and evaluate it on the first test set that contains 50 tracking tasks uniformly randomly selected from remaining tracking tasks in GRAB's training set that are not observed by the homotopy generator. 
    \item (b) Evaluate the path generator trained in (a) on the second test set that contains 50 tracking tasks uniformly randomly selected from the test tracking tasks of GRAB's test set. 
    \item (c) Evaluate the path generator trained in (a) on 50 tracking tasks uniformly randomly selected from the test tracking tasks of TACO's first-level test set. 
    \item (d) Train the path generator via homotopy paths mined from both GRAB's and TACO's training set and evaluate it on the test set used in (c). 
\end{itemize}
For each tracking task, if the tracking results obtained by optimizing through the optimization path are better than the original tracking results produced by RL-based per-trajectory tracking, we regard the generated homotopy optimization path as an effective one. Otherwise, we regard it as ineffective. We summarize the ratio of the effective homotopy optimization paths in Table~\ref{tb_exp_homotopy_generalization}.

In summary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (a) the homotopy path generator can perform relatively well in the in-distribution test setting;
    \item (b) the performance would decrease slightly as the manipulation patterns shift a bit (please refer to section 4.1 for the difference between GRAB's training split and the test split); 
    \item (c) the path generator would struggle to generalize to relatively out-of-distribution tracking tasks involving brand new objects with quite novel manipulation patterns; 
    \item (d) Increasing the training data coverage for the homotopy path generator would let it get obviously better.

\noindent\textbf{Datasets.} Our dexterous robot hand-object manipulation dataset is created by retargeting two public human-object datasets, namely GRAB~\cite{taheri2020grab}, containing single-hand interactions with daily objects, and TACO~\cite{liu2024taco}, featured by functional tool using interactions. We retarget the full GRAB dataset and the fully released TACO dataset, obtaining 1269 and 2316 robot hand manipulation sequences respectively. 
% robot hand manipulation sequences and 2316 sequences
% obtaining 1269 manipulation sequences in total, and the full released TACO data contains 2316 sequences in total. 
% For TACO dataset, to balance the time consumption and the final data amount, we randomly select 1800 sequences from 2316 sequences in total for retargeting.
For GRAB, we use sequences of the \texttt{subject s1}, with  197 sequences in total, as the test dataset.  The training dataset is constructed by remaining sequences from other subjects. 
For the TACO dataset, we create one training set with four distinct test sets with different generalization levels for a detailed evaluation of the model's generalization performance.
Specifically, the whole dataset is split into 1) a training dataset, containing 1565 trajectories, 2) test set S0 where both the tool object geometries and the interaction triplets are seen during training containing 207 trajectories in total, 3) test set S1 where the tool geometry is novel but the interaction triplets are seen during training with 139 trajectories, 3) test set S2 with novel interaction triplets but seen object categories and geometries, containing 120 trajectories in total, and 4) test set S3 with 285 trajectories where both the object category and interaction triplets are new to the training dataset. 
Figure~\ref{fig_seen_obj_cat} and Figure~\ref{fig_unseen_obj_cat} draw the examples of unseen objects from seen categories and the objects from new categories respectively. 
The original data presented in TACO often contains noisy initial frames where the hand penetrates through the table or the object. Such noise, though seems subtle, would affect the initial dynamics, however. For instance, if the hand initially penetrates through the table, a large force would be applied to the hand at the beginning, which would severely affect the simulation in subsequent steps. Moreover, if the hand initially penetrates through the object, the object would be bounced away at the start of the simulation. To get rid of such phenomena, we make small modifications to the original sequences. Specifically, we interpolate the \texttt{phone pass} sequence of the subject \texttt{s2} from the GRAB dataset with such TACO sequences as the final modified sequence. Specifically, we take hand poses from the initial 60 frames of the GRAB sequence. We then linearly interpolate the hand pose in the 60th frame of the GRAB sequence with the hand pose in the 60th frame of the TACO sequence. For details, please refer to code in the supplementary material (refer ``README.md'' for instructions).

% \noindent\textbf{Training and evaluating settings.} The general policy training is composed of three stages as we detailed in the method section. In each general tracking policy training stage, we re-train the model with different labeled datasets without transferring weights from the previously trained model. It is because we observe that weight transferring would make the model even harder to train, other than accelerating the training process. We leverage PPO~\citep{Schulman2017ProximalPO} implemented in {rl\_games}~\citep{rlgames2021} as our RL algorithm. We use the widely appreciated Isaac Gym~\citep{makoviychuk2021isaac} as the simulated physical environment. For both the single trajectory specialist tracking policy training and the general tracking policy optimization, we use 8192 parallel environments to train RL. For articulated dexterous hands, the position gain and the damping coefficient are set to 20 and 1 respectively for each finger joint. During the evaluation phase, we rollout the policy 1000 times (using 1000 parallel execution environments) and average their metrics as the evaluation result of the current trajectory. More details such as the simulation environment setting are deferred to Appendix~\ref{sec:supp_exp_details}. 



\noindent\textbf{Training and evaluation settings.} 
For both GRAB and TACO, in the first stage, we first sample 100 trajectories from the training dataset. We train their per-trajectory trackers to obtain their action-labeled data to construct our first version of the labeled dataset. After that, the first tracking controller is trained and evaluated on all trajectories. We then additionally sample 100 trajectories from the remaining trajectories using the weights positively proportional to the tracking object position error. These sampled trajectories and those sampled in the first stage then form our second version of the dataset to label. We leverage both per-trajectory tracker optimization and the tracking prior from the first version of the trained tracking controller to label the data aiming to get high-quality labeled trajectories. After that, we search tracking curricula from such 200 trajectories and train a tracking curriculum scheduler using the mined curricula. We then construct the second version of the action-labeled dataset using the final best-optimized trajectories. We then re-train the tracking controller and evaluate its performance on each trajectory. In the third stage, we sample additionally 200 trajectories from the remaining not selected trajectories. We then label them using the joint power of per-trajectory tracking optimization, tracking prior from the tracking controller, and the curriculum scheduled by the curriculum scheduler. After that, our third version is constructed using best-optimized labeled trajectories. We then re-train the tracking controller using this version of the labeled dataset. When training the tracking controller, we set a threshold in the reward, \emph{i.e.,} 50. Only trajectories with a reward above the threshold is used to provide supervision. 
% sim settings
Both the simulation and the policy run at 60Hz. The hand's gravity is ignored in the simulation. 
Please refer to the code in the supplementary materials for detailed settings. 
We train all models in a Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS with eight NVIDIA A10 cards and CUDA version 12.5. All the models are trained in a single card without multi-gpu parallelization.

\noindent\textbf{Real world experiment setup.} 
We use the Franka arm and LEAP hand to conduct real-world evaluations (Figure~\ref{fig_real_world_setup}). When transferring the state-based policy, we use FoundationPose~\cite{Wen2023FoundationPoseU6} to estimate object poses. We use finite difference to estimate both the hand joint velocities as well as the object linear and angular velocities. Considering the gap between the control strategy we use in the simulator and the control of the Franka arm and the LEAP hand, we devise a strategy to mitigate the discrepancy between these two control methods. Specifically, instead of directly applying the control signal to the LEAP hand and the Franka arm, we set up a simulator with physical and control-related parameters same as our simulation settings during training. Then, in each timestep, we first apply the control commands to the simulated LEAP hand. We then simulate the hand. After that, we read the simulated state out from the simulator. We then calculate the positional target signal that should be applied to the real LEAP hand using the current obtained state from the simulator and the current state of the real LEAP hand. The calculated positional target signal is then directly fed to the real LEAP hand controller. In our observation, once the real hand has been commanded, it can almost reach exactly the same position in the command. Thereby, in practice, we directly use the state obtained from the simulator as the positional target command fed to the real LEAP controller. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this control strategy.

\noindent\textbf{Time consumption and time complexity.} Table~\ref{tb_exp_timeconsumption} summarizes the total time consumption of different methods on the TACO dataset. Directly training PPO without any supervision is the most efficient approach while the performance lagged behind due to no proper guidance. Solving the per-trajectory tracking problem for providing high-quality data for training the general tracking controller would additionally increase the time consumption due to the requirement in optimizing per-trajectory trackers. Since we only select a subset from the whole training dataset, the time consumption is still affordable. Improving the per-trajectory trackers via mining tracing curricula would introduce additional time costs. Since the number of trajectories we consider for learning the curriculum scheduler is still controlled to a relatively small value. The final time cost is still relatively affordable. Experiments are conducted on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine with eight A10 GPU cards. For per-trajectory tracker optimization, we train eight trackers in parallel at one time. 

The overall time complexity of the  training process is $\mathcal{O}(\vert \mathcal{S}\vert + KK_{\text{nei}}\vert \mathcal{S}\vert)$. $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the training dataset. 
% Exact curriculum learning for acquiring high-quality per-trajectory trackers, though as we observe in Table~\ref{tb_exp_main}, is an effective strategy, which also aligns with conclusions in previous approaches, is extremely time-consuming. For 400 trajectories that we finally selected to optimize to produce an action-labeled dataset, searching the exact curriculum costs about 13 days to complete. However, our method requires only slightly more time than the version without tracking prior or curriculum scheduling (Ours w/ sup.). However, we can achieve a much higher success rate than this version, taking advantage of the increased diversity and the quality of action-labeled data.

\noindent\textbf{``Robustness'', ``Generalization Ability'', and ``Adaptivity''.} 
We try to give computational definitions of some crucial characteristics of the neural tracking controller. Please note that there is no standard formal computational definitions of such concepts, to our best knowledge. The definition and the quantification we present here is only from our perspective. 
}
%%%%%%%


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{myblue}{
    To quantify  the ``generalization ability'', we need to first quantify 1) the distribution gap between two trajectory distributions, so that we can define the levels of generalization, 2) the generalization ability from the training distribution to the test distribution via the gap between the model performance:
    }
    
    \textcolor{myblue}{Denote $\mathcal{E}$ as the distribution of the tracking task of the training set, and $\mathcal{D}$ as the test distribution, we define their  gap as follows: 
    \begin{equation}
        d(\mathcal{D};\mathcal{E}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{T}\sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \min_{\mathbf{T_{train} \sim \mathcal{E}}} \left( \text{Tracking\_Task\_Diff} (\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{T_{train}}) \right) \right],
    \end{equation}
    where $\text{Tracking\_Task\_Diff}(\cdot,\cdot)$ measures the differnece between two manipulation trajectory tracking problem. 
    For a trajectory tracking task described by the kinematic hand state sequence $\{ \mathbf{s}_n^h \}_{n=0}^N$, the kinematic object pose sequence $\{ \mathbf{p}^o_n,  \mathbf{q}^o_n \}_{n=0}^N$, and the object geometry $\text{PC}$, \emph{e.g.,} represented as the point cloud, we calculate the trajectory tracking task difference between two tracking tasks, \textit{i.e.,} $\mathbf{T}_A = \{ \{ \mathbf{s}^{h,A}_n \}, \{ \mathbf{p}^{o,A}_n,  \mathbf{q}^{o,A}_n \}, \text{PC}^{A} \}$ and $\mathbf{T}_B = \{ \{ \mathbf{s}^{h,B}_n \}, \{ \mathbf{p}^{o,G}_n,  \mathbf{q}^{o,G}_n \}, \text{PC}^{B} \}$, as a weighted sum of the hand trajectory difference, object pose sequence difference and the object geometry difference: 
    \begin{align}
        \text{Tracking\_Task\_Diff}(\mathbf{T}_A, \mathbf{T}_B) = \frac{1}{N+1} \sum_{n=0}^{N} &( w^{h}_{diff} \Vert \mathbf{s}_{n}^{h,A} - \mathbf{s}_{n}^{h,B} \Vert + w_{diff}^{o,p} \Vert \mathbf{p}^{o,A}_n - \mathbf{p}^{o,B}_n  \Vert \\ &+ w_{diff}^{o,q} \Vert \mathbf{q}^{o,A}_n - \mathbf{q}^{o,B}_n  \Vert ) \\ &+ w_{diff}^{pc}\text{Chamfer-Distance}(\text{PC}^A, \text{PC}^B),
    \end{align}
    where $w_{diff}^h=0.1, w_{diff}^{o,p} =1, w_{diff}^{o,q} =0.3, w_{diff}^{pc}=0.5$. 
    % $\text{Tracking\_Task\_Diff}(\mathbf{T}_A, \mathbf{T}_B) = \frac{1}{N+1} \sum_{n=0}^{N} ( w^{h}_{diff} \Vert \mathbf{s}_{n}^{h,A} - \mathbf{s}_{n}^{h,B} \Vert + w_{diff}^{o,p} \Vert \mathbf{p}^{o,A}_n - \mathbf{p}^{o,B}_n  \Vert + w_{diff}^{o,q} \Vert \mathbf{q}^{o,A}_n - \mathbf{q}^{o,B}_n  \Vert ) $
    For a tracking policy $\pi$, define its performance on tracking tasks from the distribution $\mathcal{E}$ via the expectation of tracking errors: 
    \begin{equation}
        L_{\mathcal{E}}(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{T}\sim \mathcal{E}} \left[ \text{Tracking\_Error}_{\pi}(\mathbf{T}) \right],
    \end{equation}
    where $\text{Tracking\_Error}_{\pi}(\cdot)$ evaluates the tracking error of the tracking policy $\pi$ on a trajectory tracking problem. It is a weighted sum of the difference between the tracking result and the reference trajectory of the robot hand and that of the object:
    \begin{equation}
        \text{Tracking\_Error}_{\pi}(\mathbf{T}) = w_{err}^{o,p} T_{err} + w_{err}^{o,q} R_{err} + w_{err}^{h,wrist} E_{wrist} + w_{err}^{h,finger} E_{finger},
    \end{equation}
    where $w_{err}^{h,wrist}=0.1, w_{err}^{h,finger} =0.1, w_{err}^{o,p}=1.0, w_{err}^{o,q}=0.3$.  
    }
    
    \textcolor{myblue}{Therefore, the genralization ability of the policy $\pi$ trained to solve the trajectories from trianing distribution $\mathcal{E}$ to the test distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is measured as: 
    \begin{equation}
        % s_g = \frac{L_{\mathcal{E}}(\pi)}{\min(L_{\mathcal{D}}(\pi), \epsilon)},
        s_g = \frac{d(\mathcal{D};\mathcal{E})}{\min(L_{\mathcal{D}}(\pi), \epsilon)},
    \end{equation}
    where $\epsilon$ is a small value to avoid numerical issue. The score $s_{g}$ increases as the train-test distribution gap increases or the tracking error on the test distribution decreases. 
    }

    \textcolor{myblue}{Using the above quantification w.r.t. the tracking task distribution gap and the generalization ability score, we summarize the generalization ability score of different kinds of models achieved on the GRAB dataset in Table~\ref{tb_supp_generlazation_score}. }

    
    \item \textcolor{myblue}{To quantify the ``robustness'', since it is quite difficult to analyze the dynamic function with a neural controller, we measure the robustness by the performance discrepancy between the tracking policy's performance on the tracking tasks with relatively high-quality kinematic trajectories to those with disturbed kinematic references.}
    
        \textcolor{myblue}{To measure the ``quality'' of kinematic manipulation trajectories, we introduce three trends of quantities: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Smoothness: it calculates the difference between state finite differentiations :	
                    \begin{equation}
                        t_s(\mathbf{T}) := \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \frac{1}{\Delta t}\left( \frac{\mathbf{w_s}\cdot( \mathbf{s}_{i+1} - \mathbf{s}_i)}{\Delta t} - \frac{ \mathbf{w}_s \cdot (\mathbf{s}_i-\mathbf{s}_{i-1})}{\Delta t} \right),
                    \end{equation}
                    where $\mathbf{w}_s$ is the weight vector of each state DoF, $\Delta t$ is the time between two neighbouring frames.
            \item Consistency: it calculates the hand object motion consistency:
                \begin{equation}
                    t_c(\mathbf{T}) := \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\Vert \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^o-\mathbf{p}_{i-1}^o}{\Delta t}-\frac{\mathbf{p}_i^h - \mathbf{p}_{i-1}^h}{\Delta t} \right\Vert,
                \end{equation}
                where $\mathbf{p}_i^o$ is the object position at frame $i$ while $\mathbf{p}_i^h$ is the hand wrist position at the frame $i$. 
            \item Penetrations: it calculates the penetration between hand and object across all frames:
                \begin{equation}
                    t_p(\mathbf{T}) := \frac{1}{N+1} \sum_{i=0}^N \text{{Pene\_Depth}}(\mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{P}^o),	
                \end{equation}
                where $\mathbf{P}^o$ represents the object point cloud, $\text{Pene\_Depth}$ calculates the maximum penetration depth between hand and the object. 
        \end{itemize}
      ``Quality'' of kinematic manipulation references can be grounded using such three measurements. Combining the above quantities, define the overall ``quality'' of the test distribution $\mathcal{L}$ as:
      \begin{equation}
          s_{quality}(\mathcal{L}) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{T}\sim \mathbf{L}} \left[\frac{t_s(\mathbf{T}) + t_c(\mathbf{T}) + t_p(\mathbf{T})}{3}\right].
      \end{equation}
      }

        \textcolor{myblue}{The ``robustness'' can be measured by the performance gap of the model on tracking tasks with ``high-quality'' references and those with ``perturbed'' thus ``low-quality'' tracking tasks. Denote the ``high-qualtiy'' tracking task distribution as $\mathcal{H}$ while those with low quality as $\mathcal{L}$. Thus we can quantify the ``robustness'' as:
        \begin{equation}
            s_r(\pi) := \frac{s_{quality}(\mathcal{L})}{\min(L_{\mathcal{L}}(\pi), \epsilon)}.
        \end{equation}
        As the quality of the trajectory distribution gets worse and the tracking error decreases, the ``robustness score'' would increase. 
        }

        \textcolor{myblue}{
        To evaluate this, we construct a disturbed test set by adding random noise to the hand trajectory and the object position trajectory to test the trajectories of the GRAB dataset. After that, we test the performance of our method and the best-performed baseline, PPO (w/o sup., tracking rew.). 
        We summarize the results in Table~\ref{tb_supp_robustness_score}. 
        }
        % the blue % 

        \item \textcolor{myblue}{
        We mainly focus on the real-world adaptivity to evaluate the ``adaptivity'' of the tracking controller. Since it is hard to quantitatively measure the discrepancy between the real-world dynamics and that in the simulator, we use the model's performance gap as the metric to directly evaluate the adaptivity. We use real-world per-trajectory average success rate to measure the ``adaptivity''. For our real-world test on trajectories from the GRAB dataset, we summarize the result in Table~\ref{tb_supp_adaptiviity_score}.

\textcolor{myblue}{\noindent\textbf{Computational interpretation of ``hard-to-track''.}
The most direct quantification is defining a score related to the tracking method's performance. For the tracking method $\mathcal{M}$ and the trajectory $\mathbf{T}$, define $\pi$ is the best tracking policy that we can optimize for the trajectory $\mathbf{T}$ (\textit{i.e.,} $\pi = \mathcal{M}(\mathbf{T})$. Given the tracking error $\text{Tracking\_Error}_{\pi}(\mathbf{T})$, the ``hard-to-track'' score could be defined as: $s_{ht}=\frac{1}{\min(\text{Tracking\_Error}_{\pi}(\mathbf{T}), \epsilon)}$, where $\epsilon$ is a small value to avoid numerical issue. }

\textcolor{myblue}{
Besides, we can use some statistics of the hand and object kinematic trajectories to quantify the ``hard-to-track'' characteristic. Here we introduce three types of statistics: 1) object movement smoohtness $s^o_{smooth}$: it quantifies the motion smoothness by calculating the per-frame average object accelerations, \textit{i.e.,} $s_{smooth}^o=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\Vert \frac{1}{\Delta t} (\frac{\mathbf{p}^o_{i+1}-\mathbf{p}^o_{i}}{\Delta t} - \frac{\mathbf{p}_{i}^o-\mathbf{p}_{i-1}^o}{\Delta t} )\Vert$, 2) hand-object contact shifting velocity $v_{contact}$: it quantifies the per-frame velocity of the contact map change, \textit{i.e.,} $v_{contact}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Vert \frac{\mathbf{c}_{i} - \mathbf{c}_{i-1}}{N_p\Delta t} \Vert $, where $\mathbf{c}_i\in \{ 0,1 \}^{N_p}$ is the binary contact map which encodes the contact flag between sampled points from the hand surface and the object, $N_p$ is the number of points sampled from the hand, 3) object shape score $s_{shape}$: it is the z-axis extent of the object's bounding box to quantify the shape of the object: $s_{shape} = \frac{1}{\min(\text{extent}_z, \epsilon)}$, where $\text{extent}\in \mathbb{R}^3$ is the extent of the bounding box of the object. We can jointly use these three trends of scores to quantify the ``hard-to-track'' characteristic. As $s_{smooth}^o$ increases, $v_{contact}$ increases, and $s_{shape}$ increases, the trajectory would get more ``difficult'', thus ``hard'' to train a policy to track it. 
As shown in Table~\ref{tb_supp_traj_difficulty}, the test trajectories in GRAB are more ``difficult'' than those in TACO w.r.t. the trajectory smoothness, while test trajectories in TACO are more difficult than those in GRAB regarding the contact velocity and the shape difficulty.

\noindent\textbf{Additional details.} For tracking error metrics, we report the medium value of per-trajectory result in the test set, under the consideration that the average value may be affected by outliers.
