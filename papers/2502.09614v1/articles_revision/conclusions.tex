Currently, searching for good homotopy optimization paths to improve demonstrations is a little bit time-consuming. A meaningful future research direction is approximately finding beneficial homotopy optimization in a time-efficient way, therefore accelerating the homotopy generator's training.

% The main limitation of our approach lies in the efficiency of acquiring high-quality action-labeled data. Currently, searching for good tracking curricula for training the curriculum scheduler is the most time-consuming part of our method. How to improve the efficiency such as using approximate curricula for training the scheduler is an interesting future research direction. 


% To address the difficulties in acquiring abundant and high-quality data 
% universal tracking controller for dexterous robot hand manipulation. By combining reinforcement learning with high-quality action-labeled data, we unleash the possibility of using RL to train a tracking controller for solving difficult manipulation problems. To address the ``chicken-and-egg'' problem by 1) training the controller using both RL and action-labeled datasets, and 2) optimizing for high-quality action-labeled data effectively in an acceptable time-budget, we design an interactive approach. 
% Leveraging the joint power of a learned tracking curriculum and data guidance, we can effectively improve the quality of the labeled dataset. We then progressively improve the capability of the tracking controller by curating data with higher quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, evidencing it as a promising foundation for future developments in universal tracking control.

% The process of curating this data is resource-intensive, requiring significant time and effort to generate diverse and accurate labels that effectively guide the training of the tracking controller. While our method achieves notable performance improvements, the dependence on large amounts of labeled data could hinder scalability, particularly when expanding to more complex tasks or environments. Future work could explore strategies to reduce the reliance on labeled data, such as incorporating self-supervised learning or more efficient data-generation techniques, to enhance both the practicality and scalability of the approach.
