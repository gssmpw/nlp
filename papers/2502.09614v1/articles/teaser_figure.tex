 % \eric{The figure font size is still much smaller than the caption font size. Please adjust and increase the font size. Also, I think for kinematic references, maybe it is better to show the original human motion? The red circles are highlighting something invisible... We should reduce the number of figures to increase the size of each figure. Please make sure the figure is still visible when printed out using A4 paper.}

Our neural controller can adeptly generalize to track novel manipulation trajectories with unseen objects, involving difficult interactions with thin objects (\emph{Fig. (a)}), intricate tool-using with intriguing re-orientations (\emph{Fig. (b)}),  exhibits high robustness towards large kinematics noise, and is valuable in real-world applications (\emph{Fig. (c)}). Figures in \textcolor{orange}{orange rectangles} with \textcolor{orange}{orange background} illustrate kinematic references.
