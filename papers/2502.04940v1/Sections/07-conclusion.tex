\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have analyzed a corpus of data artworks and conducted interviews with data artists to understand the design features and practical perspectives of artistic data visualization, as well as to draw its implications for the visualization community. In brief, our findings indicate that artistic data visualization has inherited many characteristics from the field of art, which gives it distinct features in design concepts, methods, and processes compared to visualizations centered around analytics. These characteristics can, on one hand, deepen our understanding of how artists are pushing the boundaries of visualization applications. On the other hand, the inspiring thoughts and practices of data artists can also bring new perspectives and opportunities for future visualization research.
