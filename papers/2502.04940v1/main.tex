%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{Standing at the intersection of science and art, artistic data visualization has gained popularity in recent years and emerged as a significant domain. Despite more than a decade since the field's conceptualization, a noticeable gap remains in research concerning the design features of artistic data visualizations, the aesthetic goals they pursue, and their potential to inspire our community. To address these gaps, we analyzed \ncorpus data artworks to understand their design paradigms and intents, and construct a design taxonomy to characterize their design techniques (\eg sensation, interaction, narrative, physicality). We also conducted in-depth interviews with twelve data artists to explore their practical perspectives, such as their understanding of artistic data visualization and the challenges they encounter. In brief, we found that artistic data visualization is deeply rooted in art discourse, with its own distinctive characteristics in both inner pursuits and outer presentations. Based on our research, we outline seven prospective paths for future work.}
