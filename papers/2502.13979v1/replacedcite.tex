% \subsection{Financial Risk Management}
% Since the 1950s, the backbone of financial risk management has been statistical and regression analysis methods, which laid a robust groundwork for the quantitative analysis and systematic handling of risk____. However, the global financial crisis in 2008 highlighted the inadequacies of these traditional models under extreme market conditions, especially their inability to adequately address the complex interconnections within the financial system____.

% In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning and deep learning technologies, the field of financial risk management has encountered new opportunities for growth. 

Recent studies have utilized machine learning and deep learning technologies to capture and analyze complex data patterns, offering new perspectives and methods for risk assessment and management. 
% For example, the application of neural network technology to detect financial fraud, or the combination of deep reinforcement learning and graph network technologies to reduce the contagion risk in banking systems, demonstrates the potential and value of these new technologies in financial risk management.

% Risk-Rate____, 
% Know-GNN____, MAGNN____,  DGA-GNN____)
% is utilized to analyze trading data within financial networks, identifying unusual transactions and financial risks.
For example, TRACER____, iConReg____, SCRPF____, RisQNet____
utilize graphs to depict the loan-guarantee relationships among small and medium-sized enterprises in the networked loan market, and construct effective deep graph neural networks to identify and curb the propagation of financial defaults.


In this paper, acknowledging the dynamic propagation of financial risks across spatial and temporal dimensions, and their evolving patterns, we introduce a novel and effective dynamic graph learning model designed for the recognition and analysis of financial risks.

% Early methods in financial risk recognition relied heavily on historical data and statistical models____. Techniques such as the value-at-risk ____ and expected shortfall____ were widely adopted for market risk assessment. Credit risk was evaluated through credit ratings____ and credit scoring models____. However, these traditional approaches often lacked the ability to capture the dynamic and interconnected nature of financial risks.

% \subsection{Causal Inference in Anomaly Detection}
% Causal inference has gained significant attention for revealing deep causal mechanisms within data, beyond mere correlations. It is extensively applied to enhance fairness, interpretability, and understanding of complex behaviors in anomaly detection tasks____.

% deep learning____.
% 
% For instance, the DECA method____ uses causal mechanisms to simulate and infer unprecedented combinations of attributes and objects, improving its prediction performance in zero-shot learning tasks. MCR multimodal causal reasoning framework____ leverages causal relationships to enhance the understanding of associations between video content and text queries, significantly improving the quality of video question answering. 

% Meanwhile, recent studies have increasingly adopted causal inference techniques to tackle anomaly detection challenges____. For example, Liu et al.____ employed causal decomposition to extract pivotal features and identify complex anomalies, while Lin et al.____ leveraged causal graphs and interventions to analyze and address pseudo-label generation issues, markedly enhancing detection accuracy. Carvalho et al.____ improved model adaptability to anomaly detection through invariant representation learning. However, research in this domain is still limited, primarily focusing on improving the models' generalization performance and detection capabilities, rather than exploring and quantifying the causal characteristics underlying the anomalies. Our study innovatively applies causal analysis to inductively summarize these anomalous behavioral patterns, offering robust support for developing effective preventative strategies.
