% THIS PAPER IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDENT PAPER AWARD. 
We extend the Coupon Collector's Problem (CCP) and present a novel generalized model, referred as the \ekecd problem, where one is interested in recovering a bipartite graph with a perfect matching, which represents the coupons and their matching labels. We show two extra-extensions to this variation: the heterogeneous sample size case (\efmecd) and the partly recovering case.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The Coupon Collector's Problem (\eccp)~\cite{intro_probability, Survey_ccp} is a probabilistic model used
for modeling in a variety of fields~\cite{ccp_survery_engineering_problems_and_computational_methods}, including statistical sampling~\cite{CCP_with_unknown_population_size_statisticsMotivated, CCP_quality_control_statistics}, algorithmic theory~\cite{Adler_Oren_Ross_2003, nonUniformCCP_application_cs_broadcast}, and network theory, where it models processes such as data collection, hashing algorithms~\cite{Adler_Oren_Ross_2003}, and even in molecular biology applications~\cite{Adler_Ahn_Karp_Ross_2005, sampling, bioCCP, CRISPR/CAS_combinatorical_design,Volf2023.11.15.567131}.
It has recently been used in the study of combinatorial coding for data storage in DNA
~\cite{goldman2013towards, anavy2019data, Sokolovskii_2024, Inbal1_ShortmersMethod, Inbal2_Coverage}.
Originally framed in terms of collecting distinct coupons from uniform and independent samples,
the \eccp studies the distribution of the number of samples required to collect all distinct coupons..
Traditionally, the \eccp involves $n$ distinct equiprobable coupons, 
and in each sample a single coupon is collected with repetitions.
In this case, the expected number of samples necessary for sampling each coupon at least once is
$n\cdot H_n\approx n\cdot \log n$, where $H_n$ is the $n$-th harmonic number.

Variants of the \eccp have emerged to model complex real-world systems.
One such variant\cite{nonUniformCCP_application_cs_broadcast} is where each coupon~$i$ has its own sampling probability $p_i$.
Another variant is the case where only $r$ distinct coupons are required~\cite{berthet2017vonschellingformulageneralized_partial_nonuniform, random_allocation_problems_FLAJOLET1992207,  leon2023ccp_partial_rth-moments, monsellato2016_partialRecovery_probabilitiesGeneratingFunctions}, instead of all the $n$ coupons.  
This problem is known as the \emph{partial \eccp} and was explored in several contexts, particularly for optimizing the collection process or estimating probabilities for subsets of the coupons.
For that variant, the expected number of samples is known to be~\cite{random_allocation_problems_FLAJOLET1992207}: \(n \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{r-1}{\frac{1}{n-i}}=n \cdot (H_n-H_ {n-r})\).
Partial recovery is also related to RAM implementations of data storage in DNA~\cite{gruica2024geometry, gruica2024combinatorial, bar2024cover}.
%This expression can be derived similarly to the equations in the classic CCP, but stopping with RV for the number of coupons between the acquisition of the $(l-1)^{th}$ and the $l ^ {th}$ coupons.

Another generalization of this problem is the \eccp with group drawings~\cite{betken2022_CCP_group_drawings_limits,ccp_groupdrawings_markov, stadje_group_drawings}.
This generalization considers scenarios where, instead of collecting individual coupons, in each sample,
one collects random subsets of coupons.
The size of each sample could be a constant $k$ or a random variable (RV) $K$. 
%such that $P(K \!=\! k) = p_k$, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i} = 1$ and $\forall i.~p_i\in[0,1]$
One is interested in characterizing the distribution of the number of subsets needed until each coupon was drawn in at least one of these samples.
We call these models \ccpg{K}{} or \ccpg{k}{}, depending on whether the sample size is distributed by a RV or is fixed.

Stadje~\cite{stadje_group_drawings} and Adler and Ross~\cite{Adler_Ross_2001} provide a comprehensive analysis of the \eccpg distribution,
offering bounds on the expected number of samples required to collect all coupons and efficient simulation procedures.
Stadje's work also explores applications to reliability problems, studying the case where items are sampled in fixed-size samples.
Adler and Ross studied the case
where the number of items drawn in each sample is a RV.
% , adding another layer of complexity to the problem

The \eccpg is equivalent to another problem in which the goal is to recover a graph representing matching between coupons and their labels, rather than simply collecting all coupons.
The reduction is visualized in
%\autoref{fig:example_graph_reduction} and 
\autoref{fig:graph_reduction}.
Let $\Egraph = (\Coupons \,\cup\, \Labels,\, \Edges)$ be a bipartite graph with $2n$ vertices and a perfect matching. 
The vertices $C$ and $L$ represent coupons and labels.
Each sample is a set of edges between coupons and their corresponding labels. 
The goal is to recover the set $\Edges$, i.e., to identify the labels of all coupons. 
This reduced problem is equivalent to the \eccpg, as knowing the label of a coupon is equivalent to sampling it.  
It is important to keep in mind that the \eccpg is equivalent to this setup only in the case where the set of labels (i.e., the set $\Labels$) is unknown beforehand.

Following the graph setup, we define a novel sampling model, 
referred to as the \emph{Labeled Coupon Collector Problem},
in which we consider sampling sets with missing information. 
When a set of coupons is collected, its set of associated labels is also revealed, but \emph{without} the matching between coupons and labels.
% More precisely, each coupon is assumed to have a unique label. 
The goal is to collect all coupons and recover their labels.
Note that the goal can be defined in two ways:
if the graph's vertices are known beforehand,
the last edge can be inferred,
making it equivalent to partial recovery, 
where only \( n-1 \) out of \( n \) coupons need to be collected.
Conversely,
if the vertices are not known beforehand,
the last edge cannot be inferred and must also be sampled.

In this work, we make several contributions to the study of the Labeled Coupon Collector Problem, including .
In \autoref{sec:definitions_problemStatement},
we introduce several novel extensions,
including the random sample size setting
and the partial recovery setting, which is further divided into specific recovery, targeting a predetermined subset of coupons, and non-specific recovery, where any subset of a given size suffices.
In \autoref{sec:partial_recovery},
we focus on the partial recovery extension,
studying its behavior in depth and examining the differences between specific and non-specific recovery scenarios.
In \autoref{sec:complete_recovery},
we analyze the random sample size variant,
demonstrating that the sampling process can be modeled as a Markov chain,
allowing us to calculate recovery probabilities and expected sample counts.
Across these sections, we highlight key relations between the different models.

\section{Definitions and Problem Statements}
\label{sec:definitions_problemStatement}
Consider a generalization of the graph presented in \autoref{fig:graph_reduction},
where instead of sampling the edges,
one only gets a set of coupons and a set of their corresponding labels,  
\emph{without knowing the matching between coupons and labels}. Formally, for an integer $n$, we let $G(n) = (C\cup L, E)$ be a bipartite graph
with $2n$ vertices and a perfect matching.
The vertices $C$ and $L$ represent the coupons and the labels.
Using this graph, we define two sampling models, namely the \ekecd and its extension the \efmecd.

\begin{definition}
\textbf{The $k$-Labeled Coupon Collector Problem (\ekecd)}. 
Given a graph $G(n)$ and an integer $k$, 
the \ekecd model considers the setup where each sample consists of a pair of subsets
$s\triangleq (s(C), s(L))$,
each of size $k$,
such that $s(C) \subset C, s(L) \subset L$,
and the sub-graph of $G(n)$ that corresponds to the nodes $s(C)\cup s(L)$ is a perfect matching.
Under this setup, the goal is to recover $E$, i.e., to match each coupon with its corresponding label.
\end{definition}

We are interested in the distribution of the number of samples needed for such a recovery.
We note that, under the graph bijection, the \ekecd differs from the \ccpg{k}{}
as instead of sampling the edges directly, we only obtain partial information about those edges.    
Similar to previous related works~\cite{ccp_groupdrawings_markov, Survey_ccp}, we show that the \ekecd can be approached using a Markov chain model.
However, as mentioned earlier,
in the \ekecd, the samples provide less information.
Specifically, each sample contains two subsets: one of $k$ coupons and another of $k$ labels, which guide the collection process but do not reveal the exact edges.

For the $\kecd{2}{}$ model we define a useful undirected graph, $H = (C, S)$, where the edges $S$ are the pairs of coupons that were sampled together, ignoring the labels.

Next, we define the Mixed Labeled Coupon Collector Problem, 
denoted as \efmecd, as an extension of the \ekecd setup,
in which a non-constant sample size is considered.
\begin{definition}
    \textbf{The Mixed Labeled Coupon Collector Problem (\efmecd)}. 
    Given a graph $G(n)$ and a RV $K$, defined by a dictionary of sample sizes and probabilities, $K \triangleq \{1:p_1,\dots,n:p_n\}$,
    wherein $P(K = k) = p_k$, $\sum_{i=1}^{n}{p_i} = 1$ and $\forall i :p_i\in[0,1]$. 
    The \efmecd model addresses a similar setup to the \ekecd setup
    but with sample sizes distributed according to $K$ instead of the constant $k$.
    \end{definition}


The \efmecd is similar to the \eccpg 
as the sample size is not necessary one.
When dealing with the special case where $P(K=1) = p$ and $P(K=2) = 1-p$, for $p\in[0,1]$, we denote the RV $K$ as $K(p) \triangleq  \{1:p,2:1-p\}$.

Given a model $M$, e.g. $M=\fmecd{K(p)}{}{n}$, we define \T{M}{r} to be the number of samples
needed to determine the labels of $r$ coupons in the model $M$. $\T{M}{n}$ is referred to as \emph{complete recovery}.
Similarly, \ST{M}{r} denotes the number of samples
needed to determine the labels of a \emph{specific} set of $r$ coupons in the model $M$ and note that from symmetry it has the value for all sets of the same size.
Note that $\T{M}{n}=\ST{M}{n}$, and therefore we only 
consider the differences when discussing partial recovery, that is, the case where $r < n$.
\Min{M}{r} is defined as the minimal value that the RV \T{M}{r} can attain.
For all notations above we assume a total of $n$ coupons.
Moreover, if the model can be inferred from the context,
or if the relevant statement holds for every model,
we may omit $M$, i.e., \T{}{r}.

\begin{example}
\label{example_defintions}
    Consider $M = \fmecd{K(p)}{}{5}$ with $n=5$ coupons \( C = \{A, B, C, D, E\} \) and their labels' matching $\{A:1,B:2,C:3,D:4,E:5\}$.
    We sample with probability $p$ each of the five coupons and its label, 
    and in the complementary event we sample $2$ coupons,
    w.l.o.g. $\{A,B\}$ and their labels $\{1,2\}$,
    without knowing whether the matching is $\{A:1,B:2\}$ or $\{A:2,B:1\}$.
    $\T{M}{5}$ will be the number of samples until recovery of the full matching, 
    meanwhile, $\T{M}{1}$ is  for recovery of any one coupon and its matching label
    and $\ST{M}{1}$ is for recovery of a specific (w.l.o.g. $\{A:1$\}) coupon and its label.
\end{example}

We now present our problem statements.

Inspired by existing extensions of the \eccp problem, we are also
interested in scenarios where we wish to know the labels of only a subset of the coupons.
This leads us to define the following, representing partial recovery questions:

\begin{problem}[Partial Coverage in the \ekecd]
\label{Problem:Partial Coverage}
Consider $M = \ekecd$ wherein $k\in[n]$.
We wish to solve the following problems for any integer $0 < r < n$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Arbitrary subset:} 
    Find $\Min{M}{r}$
    and $\E[\T{M}{r}]$.
    \item \textbf{Specific subset:} 
    Find $\E[\ST{M}{r}]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

In the \ccpg{k}{}, determining all coupon labels requires at least $\lceil {\frac{n}{k}} \rceil$ samples, however, in the \ekecd, when acquiring a coupon does not guarantee knowing its label, $n$ samples may not suffice. Moreover, usually the best-case scenario is not occurring; therefore, we are interested in the distribution.

\begin{problem}[Complete Recovery in the \efmecd]
\label{Problem:complete_recovery}
    Let $K$ be a RV and $M = \fmecd{K}{}{}$,
    we wish to solve the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Minimal number of samples}\label{Problem:Minimal number:(k1,k2)-MECD} 
    Find $\Min{M}{n}$. 
    \item \textbf{$\T{M}{n}$ Distribution:} \label{Problem:Expected number}
    Find $\E[\T{M}{n}]$ and for any $t \in \N$, find $P(\T{M}{n}>t)$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

This paper mainly addresses the \efmecd variant in the context of the ``complete recovery'' problem and the \ekecd variant in the context of the ``partial recovery'' problem.

\section{Discussion}
\note{do we want to say anything on "no convex solution" :
The expected number of samples for recovery in the \fmecd{K}{}{} 
is not simply a convex combination of the \kecd{k}{} models from them it complex.
Therefore}
The representation of \fmecd{K}{}{} as a Markov chain has strong impact on the use of this model,
as it shows equivalence between the \efmecd model and a known model with well-known algorithms.
It paves the way for exact calculation
of expected number of samples for recovery and other values of interest
in any \efmecd model 
once we extend the Markov approach for \kecd{k}{} for $k > 2 $.

Future directions include examining the conjectures stated in this paper, as well as further extending the model.
In particular, it may be interesting to consider a set of labels for each coupon
and to investigate the sampling complexity of collecting subsets of these labels.
