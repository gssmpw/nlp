\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper, we present EOR, a novel framework that addresses transparency and interpretability challenges in OR. We introduce the concept of ``Decision Information'' through what-if analysis and use bipartite graphs to quantify changes in OR models. By leveraging LLM capabilities, our framework enhances the modeling process and generates actionable, comprehensible explanations. Furthermore, we establish the first industrial benchmark for evaluating explanation quality in OR. In the future, we aim to develop more accurate modeling methods to improve the accuracy while exploring effective automated evaluation techniques for explanations.
