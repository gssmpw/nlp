\subsection{LLMs for OR}
% LLMs for OR is promising; -> list some methods -> now these methods are all fouces on modeling not explanation -> our methods difference.
LLMs show great promise for OR, offering innovative approaches to optimize and automate modeling processes \citep{xiao2023chain, ahmaditeshnizi2024optimus, tang2024orlm, zhang2024solving,huang2024large,mostajabdaveh2024optimization}. Although LLMs have shown potential in various OR tasks, their application has primarily focused on automating modeling processes and enhancing computational efficiency. In contrast, our approach distinguishes itself by using LLMs to provide detailed, context-aware explanations of OR solutions, addressing the gap in explainability.

\subsection{Explanations for OR}

Explanation in OR is essential for clarity and transparency, helping various stakeholders understand complex decision-making processes. Despite its significance, there is a notable lack of research, with only a few related works, such as \citep{thuy2024explainability,erwig2024explanations,de2024explainable} and OptiGuide \citep{li2023large}, which only focus on the easy what-if analysis. Our approach focuses on more complex what-if analysis, seeking a broad range of methods that can uniformly quantify constraint changes or parameter changes (sensitivity analysis). We leverage LLMs to embed detailed, context-aware explanations directly within OR solutions, filling this gap.
% Using LLMs, we aim to make OR solutions more accessible, understandable, and applicable to a broader audience, thereby enhancing decision-making quality and user trust.
The comparison between EOR and OptiGuide is shown in Table \ref{tab:comprasion}. More details about the differences between the concepts are discussed in Appendix \ref{appendix:concepts}.
