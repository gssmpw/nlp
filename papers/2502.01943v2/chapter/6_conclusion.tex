\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, to address the imbalanced responsiveness to data with varying hardness, we propose \textbf{Da}ta- and \textbf{M}odel-\textbf{a}ware Direct Preference Optimization (DAMA) to adaptively adjust the model's learning behavior from two aspects: (1) a data-aware strategy is proposed to dynamically adapt by incorporating the data hardness; and (2) a model-aware strategy is introduced to adaptively adjust by integrating the model's real-time responsiveness. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks from distinct aspects demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

\noindent \textbf{Limitation and Future Work.} Our focus is on MLLMs handling images and text; future work should explore scalability to broader applications, including video and audio processing, as well as commercial multi-modal large language models, to fully demonstrate its practical impact.
