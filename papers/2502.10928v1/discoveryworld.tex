DiscoveryWorld \citep{jansen2024discoveryworld}
is a large-scale agentic environment suite that tests the abilities of an agent to perform the scientific method. Each environment has a terminal goal, for example, we study "Reactor Lab" where the agent must tune the frequency of quantum crystals to activate a reactor. To succeed, the agent must formulate and test hypotheses by using available tools, literature, and its own memory. DiscoveryWorld is notably difficult for frontier models like GPT4o, and even take human experts hundreds of in-game steps to complete a task \citep{jansen2024discoveryworld}. Hence, DiscoveryWorld offers a testbed to examine the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of R1. Building on the Words-in-Context experiment, we want to know if a similar phenomena of expert specialization can be found for the reasoning patterns that we observe within DeepSeek-R1's chain of thought.
