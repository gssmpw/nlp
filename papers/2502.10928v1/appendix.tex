\section{Statistical Tests}

\subsection{Words-in-Context}\label{apd:stats_wic}

To statistically test the difference between the ``Same'' and ``Different'' sentence pairs, we conduct a two-sampled t-test on the null hypothesis that the distribution of average overlap for the two conditions is equal. The p-values are reported in table~(\ref{tab:t-test}).

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|cc}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Model} & $t$ & $p$ \\
  \midrule
  DeepSeek-R1 & 12.1 & $<0.0001$ \\
  Mistral-8x22B & 11.1 & $<0.0001$ \\
  Mistral-8x7B & 7.82 & $<0.0001$ \\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Two-sample t-test on null of no difference between ``Same'' and ``Different'' conditions.}
\label{tab:t-test}
\end{table}

\subsection{Random Baseline}\label{apd:stats_formula}

The baseline number of overlapping experts of we expect to select at random in a given MoE layer can be formalized as follows.
Given independent two draws of $k$ items from $N$ elements (without replacement), the expected number of overlapping items between the two draws can be calculated according to the following formula:

$$
    \mathbb{E}[\text{overlap}] = \frac{k^2}{N}
$$

\begin{proof}
The first draw of $k$ items is at random. For the first item in the second draw, the probability of selecting the same item is $\frac{k}{N}$.

Using the linearity of expectation, the expected total overlap is $\sum_i^k\frac{k}{N}=k\cdot\frac{k}{N}=\frac{k^2}{N}$.
\end{proof}


\subsection{SAE token analysis} \label{apd:more_sae_tables}
\input{tables/mega_tables}

In tables~(\ref{tab:sae_wait}, \ref{tab:sae_hypothesis}, \ref{tab:sae_uuid}, \ref{tab:sae_plan}, \ref{tab:sae_approach}, \ref{tab:sae_work}, \ref{tab:sae_consider}, \ref{tab:sae_bet}, \ref{tab:sae_so}), we show top experts by leveraging SAE activations on a selection of hand chosen interesting tokens. We find striking consistency across expert selection when using the SAE to find semantically similar concepts.

\section{DiscoveryWorld Environment Details}
\label{app:discodetails}
DiscoveryWorld features 8 tasks centered on different scientific fields. We choose to evaluate R1 on the "Reactor Lab" environment, where the stated goal is to: ``discover a relationship (linear or quadratic) between a physical crystal property (like temperature or density) and its resonance frequency through regression, and use this to tune and activate a reactor.''

In Figure (\ref{fig:dw_reactor_pic}), we show the Reactor Lab environment, where the agent has access the crystals and microscope in its inventory. The pixel-based visual observation itself it not used by R1 directly, but the prompt (see below) contains a structured description of the environment.

We show an example prompt and chain of thought output by R1 in the Reactor Lab environment below.
