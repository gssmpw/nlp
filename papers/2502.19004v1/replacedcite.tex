\subsection{Resource Allocation in Metaverse System}
The work in ____ investigated resource allocation strategies within an AR-enabled vehicular edge Metaverse, focusing on maximizing the Metaverse operator's reward by jointly optimizing the CPU frequency and transmit power of AR vehicles, the sizes of computation models, and the distribution of computational resources on the Metaverse server.
  The investigation in ____ proposed an adaptive edge resource allocation method based on Soft Actor-Critic with GCN (SAC-GCN), which defines the multiuser Metaverse environment as a graph with each agent represented by a node. The study in ____ introduced a hierarchical game-theoretic-based coded distributed computing (CDC) framework to provide collaborative computing and Metaverse services for the vehicular Metaverse, where idle resources of vehicles can be allocated to handle intensive computation tasks. In the same study, the authors develop a coalition game to select reliable and resource-rich vehicles based on the reputation values calculated through the subjective logical model; a Stackelberg-based incentive mechanism to motivate a coalition of vehicles to participate in rendering tasks. 
  The authors of ____ presented Human Centric (UC) resource allocation, considering joint communication and computational resources as well as VR video resolutions. The authors addressed the non-convex system cost problem, which includes Energy Consumption (EC) and delay, and solved it using the fractional programming technique. The work in ____ proposed a Joint Resource Allocation and Metaverse Service (JRAMS) selection strategy that dynamically allocates communication and computation resources to Metaverse services with high QoE. This study proposed \textit{meta-distance} -- i.e., a novel metric for measuring virtual distance in the Metaverse that considers both service latency and social distance among users. JRAMS consists of two steps: i) a one-to-many matching game with externalities to match base stations and Metaverse users using Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) subchannel allocations, and ii) a coalition formation game to solve the Metaverse service selection problem. 
 \subsection{Vehicular Twin Migration}
In addressing Metaverse service interruption due to the movement of vehicles and the limited-service coverage of RSUs, some studies present VT migration solutions, where RSUs contribute resources to host VTs and facilitate efficient VT migration. Since a single RSU is insufficient for supporting large-scale VTs migration. The authors of ____ proposed a coalition game approach framework for reliable VT migration in vehicular Metaverses. The coalition game among RSUs is formulated based on the reputation value of RSUs computed through the subjective logic model. 
The RSUs in the coalition game collectively provide bandwidth resources for reliable and large-scale VTs migration, while serving several VTs migrations at the same time.
 The authors of ____ presented a blockchain-assisted game approach for VT migration in vehicular Metaverse to maintain continuous service and offer immersive experiences for VMUs as vehicles move. In this framework, the reputation value of RSUs is calculated based on their interaction freshness with VMUs, and the coalition of RSUs is formed based on their reputation value to share bandwidth resources. To provide immersive Metaverse services and efficiently migrate the VTs,  the coalition with the maximum utility is chosen, and a Stackelberg model is adopted to handle the interaction between the RSUs' coalition and VMUs, motivating VMU's active participation. This aims to provide seamless VT migration and enhance Metaverse services for VMUs. 
 
 To address the problems with the VT migration process due to insufficient bandwidth resources from RSUs for timely migration, the study in ____ presented a Stackelberg-based incentive mechanism for vehicular Metaverse and proposed a MADRL algorithm, Multi-Agent LSTM-based Proximal Policy Optimization (MALPPO). The RSU that provides the Metaverse service and the RSU that requests the Metaverse interact through this incentive game.  The MALPPO algorithm facilitates learning the \textit{Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE)} without requiring private information from others, relying solely on past experiences. The work in____ presented an avatar task migration approach based on MADRL to address the limited resources available on vehicles and the high mobility of vehicles, where the avatar task is migrated to the nearest RSU or UAV for execution, leading to reduced communication overhead and task processing latency.  The authors utilized the MAPPO algorithm to optimize the avatar migration optimization problem. 
 
 To improve the convergence of MAPPO due to dimensionality and nonstationary problems in sharing parameters, the work in ____ applied a Transformer-based MAPPO approach via sequential decision-making models, and a smart contract with blockchain is utilized to ensure trustworthiness in the computation resource-sharing transactions.  To address the challenges of making avatar migration decisions due to vehicle mobility, dynamic workload of RSUs, and RSU heterogeneity, the authors in ____ proposed a MADRL-based dynamic avatar task migration framework based on real-time trajectory prediction. Specifically, they proposed a model to predict the future trajectories of vehicles based on their historical data, which could be useful for forecasting the available resources and workload of RSUs. The avatar task migration problem is formulated as a long-term mixed-integer programming problem, which is then transformed into a partially observable MDP, and multiple DRL agents with hybrid continuous and discrete actions are used to address the formulated optimization problem.

We present a comparison and summary of the most relevant existing works with our proposed framework in TABLE \ref{tab.1}. As tabulated, the studies in ____ focused on allocating computation and communication resources to enhance the immersive Metaverse experience and resource utilization efficiency in a variety of Metaverse services application scenarios. Furthermore, the works in ____ investigated avatar tasks and VT migration in a variety of application contexts to provide reliable and efficient Metaverse services. However, the mentioned works considered neither a multi-tier resource allocation nor a VT migration in vehicular Metaverse. Aiming to close this knowledge gap and advance the field meaningfully, we propose a joint resource allocation and VT migration framework that can dynamically allocate resources and relocate the VTs across different layers of the multi-tier vehicular Metaverse so as to optimize performance, reliability, and resource utilization. The proposed framework can dynamically allocate resources and relocate the VTs across different layers of the multi-tier vehicular network to optimize performance, reliability, and resource utilization. \newline 
We now proceed to detail our system model.
