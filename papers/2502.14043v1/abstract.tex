\begin{abstract}
Most reinforcement learning algorithms with regret guarantees rely on a critical assumption: that all errors are recoverable. Recent work by Plaut et al.~discarded this assumption and presented algorithms that avoid \emph{catastrophe} (i.e., irreparable errors) by asking for help. However, they provided only safety guarantees and did not consider reward maximization. We prove that any algorithm that avoids catastrophe in their setting also guarantees high reward (i.e., sublinear regret) in any Markov Decision Process (MDP), including MDPs with irreversible costs. This constitutes the first no-regret guarantee for general MDPs. More broadly, our result may be the first formal proof that it is possible for an agent to obtain high reward while becoming self-sufficient in an unknown, unbounded, and high-stakes environment without causing catastrophe or requiring resets.
