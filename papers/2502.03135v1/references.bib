abstract = {AQUA is an underwater hexapod robot that uses its paddles to propel itself and control its orientation. To aid in the vehicle development, a simulation was needed to predict the motion of the robot based on its paddle oscillations. The most difficult aspect of this simulation was the characterization of the forces generated by the paddles oscillating in the water. In this work, a model predicting the forces produced by an oscillating rigid paddle was developed and validated experimentally. Tests were performed on an experimental setup, which was designed and built to measure the forces and torques produced by a paddle oscillating in a water tank. Also, the forces produced by a flexible fin were determined experimentally and were compared to those generated by the rigid paddle. Finally, a simulation of the AQUA robot was developed, based on the validated rigid paddle model.}

abstract="Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.",

 abstract={Dynamic time warping is a popular technique for comparing time series, providing both a distance measure that is insensitive to local compression and stretches and the warping which optimally deforms one of the two input series onto the other. A variety of algorithms and constraints have been discussed in the literature. The &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;dtw&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; package provides an unification of them; it allows R users to compute time series alignments mixing freely a variety of continuity constraints, restriction windows, endpoints, local distance definitions, and so on. The package also provides functions for visualizing alignments and constraints using several classic diagram types.},
