\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We propose IGD, a diffusion framework for mixed-mode data sampling. We theoretically establish the exactness of this framework and empirically validate its effectiveness across multiple tasks through extensive experiments. Future work can explore other choices for samplers such as Flow Matching/Rectified Flow. In layout generation and molecule generation, specialized architectures and losses could be incorporated to further improve performance.
