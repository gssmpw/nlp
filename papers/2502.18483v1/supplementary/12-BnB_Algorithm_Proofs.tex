\begin{proof}[\normalfont\bfseries Proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:upper-lower-bound}]
    Notice that according to Lemma~\ref{lemma:closed-form-representations-of-the-value-function}, we have $V^L(\bm b) = V^{\pi_k}(\bm b)$ for $\pi_k = \left( k \right)_{t=1}^{\infty}$, where $k = \argmax_{k' \in K} \sum_{m \in M} \bm{b}(m) \cdot \frac{\bm{P}(k, m)}{1 - \bm{P}(k, m)}$ . Therefore, as $V^\star(\bm b) = V^{\pi^\star(b)}(\bm b)$ and  $\pi^\star(b)$ is optimal for $\bm b$ we have that $V^L(\bm b)$ is indeed a lower bound.

    As for the upper bound, notice that we can bound from above the value of $V^\star(\bm b)$ when using Lemma~\ref{lemma:closed-form-representations-of-the-value-function}.

    \[
        V^\star(\bm{b}) = \sum_{m \in M} \bm{b}(m) \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \prod_{j=1}^{t} \bm{P}(\pi^\star_j, m) \leq \sum_{m \in M} \bm{b}(m) \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \prod_{j=1}^{t} \left( \max_{k} \bm{P}(k, m) \right) = \sum_{m \in M} \bm{b}(m) \cdot \max_{k} \frac{\bm{P}(k, m)}{1 - \bm{P}(k, m)} = V^{U}(\bm{b}).
    \]

\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[\normalfont\bfseries Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:bb-algorithm-bounded-error}]
    First of all, notice that after at most $H(\varepsilon) = \left\lceil \log_{p_{\max}} \frac{\varepsilon (1 - p_{\max})}{p_{\max}} \right\rceil$ steps in the belief walk, for every prefix $\Pi$ of length $H$ it holds that $\ovv_{\Pi} - \unv_{\Pi} \leq \varepsilon$, because:
    \begin{align*}
        \ovv - \unv &= \sum_{t=1}^{H} \prod_{i=1}^{t} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_i) + \prod_{i=1}^{H} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{i}) \cdot V^{U}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{H+1}) - \sum_{t=1}^{H} \prod_{i=1}^{t} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_i) - \prod_{i=1}^{H} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{i}) \cdot V^{L}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{H+1}) \\
        &= \prod_{i=1}^{H} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{i}) \cdot V^{U}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{H+1}) - \prod_{i=1}^{H} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{i}) \cdot V^{L}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{H+1}) \\
        &\leq \prod_{i=1}^{H} p_{\pi_i}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{i}) \cdot V^{U}(\bm{b}^{\pi, \bm{q}}_{H+1}) \\
        &\leq p_{\max}^H \cdot \frac{p_{\max}}{1-p_{\max}} \leq \varepsilon.
    \end{align*}

    Furthermore, notice every time the algorithm enters Line~\ref{bnbalg:branching} with a prefix $\Pi$ it holds that $\unv_{\Pi} \leq \tilde V$, as $\tilde V$ was updated earlier. Therefore, starting from depth $H+1$, no prefix will satisfy the condition and the algorithm will terminate.
    
    Assume in contradiction that Algorithm~\ref{bb-algorithm} returns a value $\tilde V$ such that $V^{\star}(\bm{q}) - \tilde V > \varepsilon$.

    Notice that the returned value of $\tilde V$ is the largest value that this variable has ever achieved during the run of the algorithm. Denote the last prefix of $\pi^\star$ that was pruned in the Bounding part of the algorithm as $\Pi'$, and the value of $\tilde V$ that bounded it as $V'$. It holds that $\ovv_{\Pi'} < V' + \varepsilon$, as $\Pi'$ was bounded. Because we have $V' \leq \tilde V$, it holds that $V^{\star}(\bm{q}) \leq \overline{V_{\Pi'}} < \tilde V + \varepsilon$, which contradicts the assumption.
        
\end{proof}

% \begin{proof}
%     From Lemma~\ref{optimal-prefix-is-never-bounded} we know that we will never bound a prefix of the optimal policy. This implies that before the termination of the algorithm it will enter line (6) with a prefix of the optimal policy such that $\tilde{V}^{U}(\Pi) - \tilde{V}^{L}(\Pi) \leq \varepsilon$, and therefore $V$ will be updated to at least $\tilde{V}^{L}(\Pi)$, which $\varepsilon$ close to the optimal value. Therefore the returned policy must also be at least as beneficial, which concludes the proof.
