This work presents several contributions to the study of causal inference under network interference: a distribution-preserving network bootstrap approach that enables resampling from networked populations with unobserved interaction patterns, a counterfactual cross-validation framework to validate estimation methods, and a benchmark toolbox containing six experimental environments. Our empirical results suggest the framework can be effective across diverse settings, showing promising performance compared to existing approaches when handling complex temporal patterns and unobserved network structures. Future work exploring advanced machine learning architectures and incorporating domain-specific knowledge may further enhance the framework's practical utility while maintaining its theoretical properties.
