\subsection{3D Object Representation Learning}
Traditional methods render a three-dimensional object into two dimensions as an image or a set of images with different views **Qi, "PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation"**. These methods involve significant information loss and cannot truly represent 3D objects. Some recent works **Wang, "Learning Local Structure with Pairwise Spatial Context for Object Detection"** utilize spatial point cloud to depict objects. PointNet **Qi, "PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation"** introduced a deep learning framework for directly processing point clouds, significantly advancing object classification and segmentation tasks. This was further expanded by **Zhou, "PointGrid: Unifying Multiresolution Architectures via Nested Point Clouds"** through PointGrid, which combines point clouds with voxel grids to enhance geometric understanding. Voxel grid representation offers a volumetric approach to 3D shape analysis. **Li, "PolyGNN: Polyhedral Graph Neural Networks for 3D Building Reconstruction"** develop PolyGNN to reconstruct 3D building models using polyhedral decomposition from point cloud. **Wu, "3D ShapeNets: A Deep Representation for Volumetric Shape Modeling"** developed 3D ShapeNets, a method that leverages convolutional neural networks on voxel grids to perform 3D shape recognition, providing a robust framework for capturing complex shapes. **Tatarchenko, "Octree-based CNN for Real-Time Segmentation of 3D Scenes"** introduced the Octree-based CNN, which improves efficiency by using octree structures for adaptive resolution in 3D space. These discrete methods fail to leverage the structural information like edges inherently by points or grids, making them less compatible with structured data.

Mesh representation focuses on using triangles or quads to model 3D objects. **Boscaini, "Spectral Networks for 3D Shape Recognition"** proposed spectral networks to operate on meshes. **Monti, "Convolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Automatic Differentiation"** extended this concept by introducing convolutional networks for structured data, enhancing the analysis of mesh topology. Further advancements by **Litany, "Deep Globally Superview Pooling Networks for 3D Point Clouds"** and **Wang, "Learning Local Structure with Pairwise Spatial Context for Object Detection"** applied localized filtering and mixture model CNNs to learn geometric features on meshes. **Kalogerakis, "Pano2Mesh: Towards High-Quality Panoramic-to-Mesh Conversion for 3D Scene Understanding"** proposes a GNN-based approach to learn geodesic embeddings for polyhedral faces. While these methods have significantly advanced the processing of 3D object, they face limitations due to their computational intensity with high-resolution models and their struggles with irregular geometries, inherent to the mesh format. Directly modeling objects with polyhedra is a promising method to address these issues.

\subsection{Polyhedral Representation Learning}
Recent advancements in the field of polyhedral geometry representation learning have been significant. Traditional feature engineering approaches **Kalogerakis, "Learning Category-Specific Shape Representations for 3D Objects and Scenes"** transform polygonal shapes into predefined shape descriptors. GNNs are utilized to improve the handling of spatial relationships and structural complexities ____ . However, these descriptors oversimplify the data, failing to capture the complete spectrum of shape information.  Polygon shape encoding methods **Wang, "Learning Local Structure with Pairwise Spatial Context for Object Detection"** , have demonstrated their effectiveness in shape classification and retrieval tasks. While beneficial for certain types of analysis, these methods do not fully meet the needs of polyhedral representation learning that requires capturing complex topological relationships between polygonal geometries. PolygonGNN **Kalogerakis, "PolygonGNN: Polygons-to-Graphs for 3D Scene Understanding"** is the first GNN-based method that captures both multi-polygon relationships and individual polygon shape information.
