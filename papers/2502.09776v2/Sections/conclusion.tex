\section{Conclusion}
%\todo{Change -- Engagement with DMH tools has conventionally focused on relatively superficial adjustments to intervention content, timing, and algorithms. Our research diverges by examining the influence of individuals' social contexts on their level of engagement. } 
\revision{Factors stemming from one's social context can play a critical role in shaping psychological wellbeing. Prior studies have noted that these factors may also impact the extent to which individuals engage with DMH tools. In our study, we explore how an individual's social context affects their engagement with a text messaging program for managing depression and anxiety symptoms.} Through interviewing participants at two time points during the eight-week program, we discovered that people experienced various SEDs ranging from personal obligations and professional duties to unexpected health concerns. Subsequent design workshops involving 25 participants generated practical solutions for addressing these SEDs. These include introducing structured approaches to goal-setting, reframing the concept of disengagement, and leveraging external resources. Our findings prompt new viewpoints into how engagement should be understood and managed, providing actionable recommendations for the design of future DMH tools.
