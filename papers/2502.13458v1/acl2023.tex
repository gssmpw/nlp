\begin{abstract}
Ensuring the safety of large language models (LLMs) is critical as they are deployed in real-world applications. Existing guardrails rely on rule-based filtering or single-pass classification, limiting their ability to handle nuanced safety violations. To address this, we propose \modelname, a critique-augmented guardrail model that distills knowledge from high-capacity LLMs by generating structured critiques alongside safety labels. Fine-tuned on critique-augmented data, the captured deliberative thinking ability drastically enhances the guardrail's cautiousness and interpretability. Evaluated on multiple safety benchmarks, \modelname achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, outperforming all baselines. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, \modelname improves accuracy by 16.1\% and macro F1 by 27.0\%. Moreover, it surpasses label-only fine-tuned models, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification precision and nuanced safety reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency.\footnote{Please refer to the github page for model and code release: \url{https://github.com/luka-group/ThinkGuard}.}

\section{Introduction}

%\muhao{1. what are guardrails? why needing them? (efficient, decentralized threat detection model)\\ 
%2. what is the shortcoming of existing guardrails that motivates this work? (threats are diverse, stealthy and implicit; needs careful reasoning / slow thinking.)}

Recent years have seen large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent capabilities~\cite{kaplan2020scaling,wei2022emergent}, enabling their use as the backbone of a wide range of intelligent systems~\cite{achiam2023gpt,dubey2024llama,liu2024deepseek}.
Therefore, ensuring do not generate harmful content~\cite{pan-etal-2023-risk,peng2024securing,DBLP:conf/iclr/StaabVBV24} has become increasingly critical for their safe deployment.
Guardrails~\cite{markov2023holistic,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2312-06674,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2411-10414,DBLP:conf/nips/HanREJL00D24}, acting as external safety layers that detect and filter harmful inputs or outputs of LLMs, have gained attention for their flexible deployment across different LLMs and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.

% --------------------------

% Ensuring the safety, reliability, and ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical challenge~\cite{bai2022constitutional, ganguli2022red, andriushchenko2024agentharm} as these models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications such as healthcare~\cite{mukherjee2024polaris}, finance~\cite{biancotti2024chat}, and legal advisory~\cite{hazra2024safety}. While LLMs demonstrate remarkable fluency and knowledge retrieval, they are prone to risks including misinformation~\cite{pan-etal-2023-risk}, bias~\cite{peng2024securing}, privacy violations~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/StaabVBV24}, and adversarial exploits~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/0001HS23, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2403-12503}. 

%Given their scalability and autonomy, effective safeguards are essential for responsible deployment. 
%One way to mitigate these risks is safety alignment, where models are trained with techniques like RLHF to follow ethical guidelines. However, this method requires frequent retraining, can weaken model capabilities, and struggle to adapt to new threats. 

% Traditional risk mitigation approaches, such as safety alignment or rule filters, suffer from issues of development cost, efficiency~\cite{lin-etal-2024-mitigating}, generalization~\cite{DBLP:conf/acl/RenGSYTLM24}, and interference with LLMs' utility performance~\cite{fu-etal-2024-disperse}.
% In contrast, recent research has resorted to training guardrail models that offer a more efficient alternative, acting as external safety layers that monitor and regulate LLM inputs or outputs without interfering the core LLM~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2312-06674, DBLP:conf/icml/0002MJQH0MR024}. 
% Unlike direct safety alignment, guardrails work separately from the LLM, minimizing impact on its utility while allowing updates to evolving safety requirements. Their decentralized design makes them flexible to apply across different models and applications, reducing the need for costly retraining.
% \muhao{need to talk about two things in paragraph 1: 1. threats; 2. what do guardrails do, and what are their key benefits.}

Existing guardrails are typically framed as a discriminative task: given an input (and sometimes an output), they classify it as safe or unsafe or assign it to specific harmful content categories. These methods can be categorized into rule-based and model-based approaches.
Rule-based guardrails rely on predefined lists of forbidden words or rules to detect harmful content. While simple and efficient, they struggle to adapt to evolving threats and varying guidelines~\cite{gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts, welbl-etal-2021-challenges-detoxifying, rebedea-etal-2023-nemo}.
Model-based guardrails, on the contrary, are developed by continually finetuning pretrained language models on instruction-based safety datasets, enhancing their contextual awareness and generalizability~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2312-06674}.
However, many still approach guardrails as a simple classification task, merely predicting labels rather than engaging in deliberative reasoning about intent, context, and potential risks.
As a result, these models often fail to distinguish between genuinely harmful content and benign yet sensitive statements, making them particularly vulnerable to adversarial prompts that exploit models' weaknesses~\cite{zizzo2024adversarial,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2410-02916,liu2024autodan}.
Moreover, since these models only output labels without explaining their decisions, it is difficult to interpret why a particular prediction was made, limiting transparency and trust in their decisions.

As a result, on the right, \modelname enhances its safety assessments, correctly identifying risks that Llama Guard initially misclassified.}
  \label{fig:ThinkGuard}
  \vspace{-1em}
\end{figure*}

To address these limitations, we propose \modelname, a model that enhances guardrails through cautious, deliberative processing.
Our method is inspired by the cognitive distinction between fast and slow thinking in human decision-making~\cite{hagendorff2022thinking,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2412-09413}.
While fast thinking, such as simple end-to-end classification, enables quick and intuitive predictions, it often leads to oversimplified or inaccurate assessments, making models vulnerable to adversarial inputs \cite{li2024deceptive,zhou2024conceptual}.
In contrast, slow thinking, through deliberative processing, mitigates these issues by enabling more robust, context-aware decision-making \cite{lin2024swiftsage}.
Additionally, it improves transparency by providing detailed explanations for predictions, making it easier for humans to interpret and trust the model’s decisions.

Specifically, as shown in the \Cref{fig:ThinkGuard}, we conduct mission-focused distillation from existing LLMs~\cite{openai2024GPT,deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability} by prompting them to engage in slow, step-by-step reasoning before making a prediction.
This process generates augmented safety datasets that include not only labels but also detailed reasoning steps. To integrate this deliberative reasoning into guardrail models, we finetune them using a two-round conversational format: in the first round, the model produces an initial prediction, and in the second round, it articulates its reasoning.
This approach achieves performance comparable to standard chain-of-thought fine-tuning~\cite{hsieh-etal-2023-distilling,kim-etal-2023-cot} while offering an additional advantage—users can opt to receive only the final prediction, preserving the efficiency of traditional LLM-based guardrails while retaining interpretability when needed.

We evaluate \modelname on multiple safety benchmarks, where it achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, surpassing all baselines. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, it improves accuracy by 16.1\% and macro F1 by 27.0\%, demonstrating the benefits of critique-augmented fine-tuning. \modelname also outperforms label-only fine-tuned LLaMA Guard 3, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification precision and nuanced safety reasoning. These results highlight \modelname's strong performance and efficiency, making it well-suited for real-world deployment.



\section{Related Work}

\stitle{Guardrails}
Recent research on guardrail models has mainly explored two key approaches: rule-based filtering and LLM-based safety classifiers.

Early guardrail models relied on rule-based filtering~\cite{welbl-etal-2021-challenges-detoxifying, clarke-etal-2023-rule,DBLP:conf/fat/GomezMPC24}, which uses predefined keyword lists and heuristic constraints to identify harmful content. While these methods are transparent and efficient, they suffer from rigidity and poor adaptability, leading to often issues of false positives (overblocking benign content;~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/SongLLKK23}) and false negatives (failing to detect nuanced harms;~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2212-05926}). Due to these limitations, research has shifted towards LLM-based classifiers, which provide greater flexibility by leveraging large models for content assessment.

LLM-based safety classifiers, such as LLaMA Guard~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2312-06674, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2411-17713, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2411-10414} and Aegis Guard~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2404-05993}, improve moderation by fine-tuning models on safety datasets, enabling them to classify inputs according to predefined safety guidelines. Unlike rule-based approaches, these classifiers leverage large models to capture different categories of harmful content, making them more adaptable to diverse regulatory requirements and shifting safety standards. However, most LLM-based guardrails operate in a single-pass classification manner, resulting in their providing binary moderation decisions without deeper analysis. This approach makes them vulnerable to adversarial prompts and subtle harmful content that requires nuanced reasoning~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2309-02705, DBLP:conf/lamps/Zhu0ZW0WY000024}. Recent research, such as ShieldGemma~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2407-21772} and WildGuard~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanREJL00D24}, attempts to improve guardrail models through larger training datasets and fine-tuning on adversarial examples, but challenges in interpretability and robustness persist.

\stitle{LLM Inference with Slow Thinking}
The concept of ``slow thinking'' in Large Language Models is inspired by the psychological Dual-Process Theory~\cite{thompson2009dual}, which differentiates between fast, intuitive thought processes (System 1) and slow, deliberate reasoning (System 2). Integrating slow thinking into LLMs aims to enhance their reasoning capabilities by enabling more deliberate and structured problem-solving approaches.

Recent research has explored various methods for implementing ``slow thinking'' in LLMs' decision making. For instance, \citet{hagendorff2022thinking} evaluated the performance of proprietary models such as GPT-3 on cognitive reflection tests (CRT) and found that these models exhibited behavior similar to human intuition, as well as the cognitive errors that come with it. In a related effort, OpenAI introduced o1~\cite{openai2024learning}, a model trained to deliberate longer before responding, thereby improving performance on complex tasks. Unlike earlier models that often required explicit chain-of-thought prompting, o1 naturally engages in step-by-step reasoning and dynamically adapts its responses to context. In addition, \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2412-09413} proposes a framework for imitation, exploration, and self-improvement that significantly improves the model's performance on complex reasoning tasks through a reward-guided tree search algorithm. Another notable work is by~\citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2310-18075}, which adopts a dual-mind mechanism, using two generative LLMs to handle fast and slow thinking respectively. The fast thinking model is responsible for initial response generation, while the slow thinking model carries out detailed planning, reasoning, and tool use to provide a well-considered answer.


\section{\modelname}

In this section, we introduce \modelname, a critique-augmented guardrail model designed to enhance safety classification and justification. 

\subsection{Overview}

Guardrail models act as external safety layers for LLMs, but existing guardrails often rely on single-pass decisions, lacking reasoning and explanatory capabilities. This limits their ability to detect stealthy and implicit risks and provide transparent, trustworthy moderation.


To address these challenges, we propose \modelname, a framework that enhances guardrail models by incorporating deliberative reasoning into safety classification. Inspired by recent advancements in slow-thinking reasoning of LLMs~\cite{openai2024learning,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2412-09413}, \modelname introduces a critique-based fine-tuning approach, where a high-quality language model generates \textit{critiques}—natural language explanations that justify safety classifications. These critiques are then used to improve the safety classification capabilities of a smaller, efficient guardrail model, enhancing both its accuracy and interpretability. Prior research has shown that self-generated critiques enhance model robustness in reward modeling and adversarial defenses~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2406-07188, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2411-16646}. 
Extending this idea to safety classification, \modelname adopts multi-step safety assessments, allowing the guardrail model to make more thoughtful and context-aware moderation decisions rather than relying solely on direct classification. The following sections define our problem definition and detail our methodology for generating, filtering, and integrating critiques to improve guardrail effectiveness.

    \label{fig:promptbox}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:probdef}
Given a set of predefined safety guidelines, the goal of a guardrail model is to assess whether an input text adheres to these guidelines, while detecting and categorizing any unsafe content into specific violation categories.
Desirably, the guardrail may also be designed to generate an explanation for the safe classification outcomes.

Formally, let \( x \) be an input text, which can be either a user query to an LLM or an LLM-generated response. Let \( G \) represent a set of safety guidelines with corresponding risk categories \( \{ C_1, C_2, ..., C_n \} \). The guardrail model \(g\) is expected to orderly perform the following tasks:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Safety Assessment}: Determine whether \( x \) is \texttt{safe} or \texttt{unsafe} under the guidelines \( G \).
    \item \textbf{Risk Categorization}: If \( x \) is \texttt{unsafe}, assign it to one or more violation categories \( \{ C_i \} \) from \( G \).
    \item \textbf{Critique Generation}: Provide a concise explanation \(e\) of why \( x \) violates the assigned category/categories.
\end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Critique Generation}

% To improve the reliability of guardrail models, we leverage high-quality LLMs to generate \textit{critiques}—natural language explanations supporting safety assessments. These critiques serve as additional supervision signals during fine-tuning, enabling smaller guardrail models to develop both classification and reasoning capabilities.

% Given a \texttt{(prompt, response)} pair from a safety alignment dataset, the LLM predicts whether the response is \texttt{safe} or \texttt{unsafe}. If deemed unsafe, it also identifies the violated safety categories and provides a rationale for its decision. The critiques follow a standardized format, ensuring consistency and clarity in classification and justification. 


\subsection{Critique-Augmented Fine-Tuning}
To enhance the capability of guardrail models in both safety classification and justification, we fine-tune a smaller classifier using critique-augmented data. Instead of solely training on safety labels, our approach incorporates detailed critiques generated by a high-quality expert LLM. These critiques serve as additional supervision signals during fine-tuning, enabling smaller guardrail models to develop both classification and reasoning capabilities.

\stitle{Training Data Construction}
The fine-tuning dataset is constructed from a safety alignment corpus, where each data instance consists of a \texttt{[prompt, response]} pair, a ground truth safety label, and an LLM-generated critique. Specifically, the dataset is structured as:
\begin{equation}
    D = \{(x_i, r_i, y_i, c_i) \}_{i=1}^{N},
\end{equation}
where \( x_i \) represents the input prompt, \( r_i \) is the corresponding response, \( y_i \) is the binary safety label (\texttt{safe} or \texttt{unsafe}), \( c_i \) is the critique generated for the given response. To ensure consistency in critique generation, each input is formatted using a structured prompt, as illustrated in \Cref{fig:promptbox}. By training on this enriched dataset, the model learns to associate textual patterns with safety violations while simultaneously developing the ability to generate justifications for its decisions. The differences in results for the different critique formats fine-tuning are discussed in~\Cref{app:diff_sft}.

\stitle{Why Critiques?}
Large-scale proprietary models with hundreds of billions of parameters, such as GPT-4o~\cite{openai2024GPT}, exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in safety classification and justification~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2406-06302,openai2024gpt4o}. However, deploying such massive models as guardrails in real-world applications is impractical due to their high computational cost and latency. Instead, we aim to \textit{distill} this knowledge into smaller, more efficient models while preserving their ability to assess safety risks and generate justifications. Knowledge distillation has been shown to effectively transfer reasoning capabilities from large models to smaller ones~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/HintonVD15, hsieh-etal-2023-distilling}. By incorporating critiques generated by high-capacity models, we expose compact guardrail models to high-quality safety rationales during training, enabling them to develop reasoning skills without requiring explicit optimization for explanation generation.

\stitle{Fine-Tuning Strategy}
The fine-tuning process leverages label-enriched supervised fine-tuning~\cite{wen-etal-2024-red, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2411-16646}, where critiques are incorporated as additional annotations alongside safety labels. Unlike standard fine-tuning that optimizes classification accuracy alone, our approach trains the model to jointly predict safety labels and generate critiques, improving both safety classification accuracy and interpretability.

% The first objective to optimize is the classification loss, which ensures the model correctly predicts the safety label (\texttt{safe} or \texttt{unsafe}) given a prompt-response pair:
% \begin{equation}
%     \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} = - \sum_{i} y_i \log P(y_i | x_i, r_i) .
% \end{equation}

The first objective to optimize is the classification loss, which ensures the model correctly predicts the safety label \( y_i \), where \( y_i \in \{ \texttt{safe}, \texttt{unsafe} \} \), given a prompt-response pair:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} = - \sum_{i} y_i \log P(y_i | x_i, r_i).
\end{equation}


\noindent
The second objective is the critique generation loss, which trains the model to generate coherent and informative critiques that justify its classification decision:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{critique}} = - \sum_{t} \log P(c_t | c_{<t}, x_i, r_i, y_i) .
\end{equation}

\noindent
The final training objective is the sum of these two losses:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{cls}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{critique}} .
\end{equation}
\noindent
By jointly optimizing these objectives, the model not only improves its ability to classify unsafe content but also learns to articulate its reasoning, thereby enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in safety moderation.

\subsection{Inference and Decision Making}
Once fine-tuned, the model first predicts a safety label, then identifies violated safety categories if applicable, and finally generates a critique. Given an input prompt-response pair \((x, r)\), the model infers:


\begin{equation}
    \hat{y} = \arg\max P(y | x, r) .
\end{equation}

\noindent
If the response is classified as \texttt{unsafe}, the model further predicts the set of violated safety categories:

\begin{equation}
    t = \arg\max P(t | x, r, \hat{y}) .
\end{equation}

\noindent
Finally, the model generates a critique to justify its decision as

\begin{equation}
    \hat{c} = \arg\max P(c | x, r, \hat{y}, t),
\end{equation}

\noindent
where \( y_i \in \{ \texttt{safe}, \texttt{unsafe} \} \). If \(\hat{y} = \texttt{unsafe}\), the model additionally predicts the violated safety categories, denoted as \(t\), which is non-empty in unsafe cases and remains an empty set otherwise. The critique \(\hat{c}\) provides reasoning for the classification decision and, when applicable, explains the specific violated categories.

We use the BeaverTails dataset~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/JiLDPZB0SW023} as the primary training source for our guardrail model. BeaverTails is a safety-focused dataset comprising human-labeled \texttt{(prompt, response)} pairs, each annotated with one or more harm categories. It provides explicit safety labels that enable fine-grained classification, covers a diverse range of safety concerns to improve generalization, and serves as an established benchmark, which has been utilized in prior work such as LLaMA Guard 2~\cite{metallamaguard2} and hh-RLHF~\cite{bai2022training,ganguli2022red}.

\stitle{Synthetic Dataset} 
To enhance our model’s reasoning and justification abilities, we generate \textit{synthetic critiques} by leveraging high-quality LLMs such as GPT-4o~\cite{openai2024GPT} and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B (DPSK-LLaMA-70B)~\cite{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability}. Given the safety labels from the BeaverTails dataset, these models are prompted to generate critiques that explain the classification decision and, when applicable, identify the violated safety categories. This critique-augmented dataset enables the fine-tuning of smaller guardrail models (e.g., LLaMA Guard 3~\cite{dubey2024llama3herdmodels}), equipping them with both classification accuracy and reasoning capabilities.

\stitle{Evaluation Benchmarks}
To assess the effectiveness of our critique-augmented guardrail model, we evaluate it across multiple safety-related benchmarks:

BeaverTails~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/JiLDPZB0SW023}: A comprehensive dataset comprising over 30000 human-labeled \texttt{(prompt, response)} pairs, each annotated with one or more harm categories, facilitating the evaluation of models' abilities to handle various safety concerns.

Toxic Chat~\cite{lin-etal-2023-toxicchat}:  Developed to assess content moderation in real-world user-AI interactions, Toxic Chat includes 10,000 adversarially crafted dialogues containing hate speech, offensive remarks, and harmful stereotypes.

OpenAI Moderation~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/MarkovZANLAJW23}: A benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to detect harmful content based on OpenAI’s safety guidelines, covering violence, self-harm, and misinformation. 

WildGuardMix~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanREJL00D24}: WildGuardMix is a 92,000-example moderation dataset spanning 13 risk categories, featuring adversarial prompts and ambiguous cases to test models' reasoning on safety violations.

% \textbf{HarmBench}~\cite{DBLP:conf/icml/MazeikaPYZ0MSLB24}: HarmBench is designed to challenge guardrails with harmful prompts, assessing robustness against prompt injection, jailbreaks, and subtle rule violations.

\stitle{Baselines}
We compare our critique-augmented guardrail model against multiple baselines, including prior guardrail models, in-context learning (ICL) methods, and large-scale LLMs:

LLaMA Guard Series: We evaluate three versions of LLaMA Guard:  
LLaMA Guard 1/2/3~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2312-06674,metallamaguard2, dubey2024llama}. Additionally, we test two alternative strategies for LLaMA Guard 3: an \textit{ICL} approach (+ ICL) where the model is prompted with few-shot safety examples instead of fine-tuning, and a \textit{label-only fine-tuned} version (+ Label-only SFT) trained solely on safety labels without critique supervision, serving as a control to measure the impact of critiques.

AegisGuard~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2404-05993}: A recently developed safety alignment model built on top of LLaMA Guard using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)~\cite{peft}, featuring two variants: \textit{Permissive} and \textit{Defensive}, designed to enhance adversarial robustness.
% The key difference is that the Permissive model treats "Needs Caution" as safe, while the Defensive model classifies it as unsafe.

WildGuard~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/HanREJL00D24}: A robust guardrail model trained on the WildGuard dataset, designed to enhance safety classification under adversarial and ambiguous prompts.

Large-Scale LLMs: As an upper bound, we evaluate the raw safety classification capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o~\cite{openai2024GPT}, LLaMA 3-70B~\cite{dubey2024llama3herdmodels} and DPSK-LLaMA-70B~\cite{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability}.




\stitle{Implementation Details}
For critique generation, we use GPT-4o and DPSK-LLaMA-70B to generate structured explanations for each \texttt{(prompt, response)} pair. The models are conditioned on ground-truth safety labels from BeaverTails and prompted to provide critiques following a standardized format. We set the decoding temperature $\tau = 0.1$ and top-p to 1. For fine-tuning, we use LLaMA Guard 3-8B as the backbone model and apply full-parameter fine-tuning on a critique-augmented dataset. Training is conducted using DeepSpeed~\cite{DBLP:conf/sc/AminabadiRALLZRSZRH22} with ZeRO-3 optimization on 4$\times$RTX A6000 Ada GPUs and 8$\times$NVIDIA L40S GPUs. The model is trained for 4 epochs with a batch size of 1, using gradient accumulation of 32 steps. We employ AdamW~\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH19} as the optimizer with a cosine learning rate schedule, starting with a learning rate of \(2 \times 10^{-5}\) and a warmup ratio of 3\%. Training is performed in bf16 precision, and model checkpoints are saved every 500 steps. 



\subsection{Results}

\stitle{Overall Benchmark Performance}
\Cref{tab:benchmark_results} presents F1 and AUPRC scores across four safety benchmarks. \modelname consistently achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC, demonstrating its strong generalization and effectiveness in safety classification. 

Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, \modelname significantly improves performance across all datasets, confirming the advantages of critique-augmented fine-tuning. Specifically, it enhances F1 by 14.1\% on Toxic Chat and 6.1\% on WildGuardMix, indicating better robustness against adversarial and ambiguous cases. Notably, compared to label-only fine-tuned LLaMA Guard 3, \modelname achieves more stable performance across four datasets, while the label-only model struggles on Toxic Chat and OpenAI Moderation, suggesting weaker generalization. 

Furthermore, \modelname attains the highest AUPRC on BeaverTails and the best F1 on WildGuardMix, demonstrating its adaptability across different safety risks. While GPT-4o+CoT achieves the best F1 on BeaverTails, its performance fluctuates across datasets, whereas \modelname maintains consistently strong results. These findings reinforce that structured critiques enable models to improve both classification accuracy and interpretability, making \modelname a reliable and scalable guardrail solution.




\stitle{Comparison of Model Capabilities}
\label{sec:comparison_of_model}
\Cref{tab:model_capabilities} compares guardrail models across five key aspects: output stability (SO), adaptability to guideline changes (GA), conciseness of responses (CR), detailed safety categorization (DC), and ability to provide explanation (EC). \modelname consistently performs well across all dimensions, effectively balancing classification accuracy with reasoning quality. In contrast, LLaMA Guard (1/2/3) and ICL LG3 occasionally fail to generate a definitive safety classification, leading to inconsistencies in evaluation outcomes. Aegis Guard tends to generate excessive tokens, often including extraneous or unrelated text that makes its safety assessments less clear. WildGuard differs from other models as it only predicts \texttt{safe} or \texttt{unsafe} without specifying violated categories. As defined in~\Cref{sec:probdef}, its prediction is considered correct if the \texttt{Safety Assessment} matches the ground truth. In contrast, other models must also correctly identify the \texttt{Risk Categorization} for unsafe cases, making their evaluation more stringent and impacting F1 and Accuracy scores in~\Cref{tab:benchmark_results} and~\Cref{tab:beaver_acc_macro_f1}. More details are demonstrated in~\Cref{app:guardrail_outputs}.




\stitle{Beavertails Dataset: Safety Classification Performance}
\Cref{tab:beaver_acc_macro_f1} reports accuracy and macro F1 scores on the Beavertails dataset. While accuracy reflects overall correctness, given that responses in Beavertails can belong to multiple harm categories, macro F1 better captures model performance in multi-label classification. 
For results, our proposed model, \modelname, achieves the highest accuracy and outperforms all baselines except GPT-4o+CoT in macro F1. Compared to LLaMA Guard 3, \modelname improves accuracy by 16.1\% and macro F1 by 27.0\%, demonstrating the benefits of critique-augmented fine-tuning. While GPT-4o+CoT excels in macro F1 due to chain-of-thought reasoning, it lags in accuracy, suggesting that large models improve nuanced harm detection but may struggle with classification robustness. What's more, despite its strong performance, GPT-4o is computationally expensive. In contrast, \modelname, as an efficient 8B model, maintains high accuracy while closing the macro F1 gap, making it more practical for real-world guardrails. Additionally, compared to label-only fine-tuned LLaMA Guard 3, \modelname improves accuracy by 2.1\%, confirming that structured critiques enhance both classification and safety reasoning.


\stitle{Impact of Data Scaling on Model Performance}
\Cref{fig:data_scale} illustrates the effect of increasing training data on the performance of \modelname and the label-only fine-tuned LLaMA Guard 3 model on the Beavertails dataset. The left plot (a) shows the F1 score across dataset sizes, while the right plot (b) presents the macro F1 score. 

Overall, \modelname demonstrates a clear advantage over the label-only model as dataset size increases. With smaller datasets (3k and 6k), both models exhibit relatively modest improvements, with \modelname maintaining a slight lead in F1 and macro F1. As dataset size scales beyond 9k, the performance gap becomes more pronounced, indicating that explanation-based fine-tuning enables more effective learning from additional data. At 15k training examples, \modelname achieves an F1 score of 82.3\% and a macro F1 of 76.4\%, outperforming the label-only baseline, which reaches 83.7\% F1 but lags in macro F1.

This trend suggests that the inclusion of structured explanations helps \modelname generalize better, particularly in handling diverse safety violations. The improved macro F1 performance indicates that \modelname maintains higher robustness across different harm categories, rather than overfitting to the most frequent ones. In contrast, the label-only model exhibits competitive overall F1 but shows weaker macro F1, suggesting potential struggles with rare or nuanced safety violations. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating critiques during fine-tuning, demonstrating that structured reasoning significantly enhances the ability to classify and justify safety decisions effectively.


\section{Conclusion}
We present \modelname, a critique-augmented guardrail model that integrates structured critiques to improve both safety classification and interpretability. \modelname achieves the highest average F1 and AUPRC across multiple safety benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines. It improves F1 by 14.1\% on Toxic Chat and 6.1\% on WildGuardMix compared to LLaMA Guard 3, demonstrating enhanced robustness against adversarial and ambiguous cases. Additionally, it generalizes better than label-only fine-tuned models, particularly on datasets with diverse harm categories. Future work will explore extending critique-based fine-tuning to broader safety tasks and optimizing efficiency for real-world deployment. We hope \modelname contributes to the development of more transparent, accountable, and effective AI safety mechanisms.

\section*{Limitations}
While \modelname demonstrates strong performance in safety classification, several limitations remain. First, its effectiveness is contingent on the quality of critique-augmented training data. If critiques are incomplete or misaligned with safety guidelines, the model may inherit biases or inconsistencies. Second, although \modelname improves interpretability, generating structured critiques introduces additional computational overhead compared to simpler classification models. This trade-off between reasoning depth and efficiency requires further optimization. Future work will address these issues by refining critique generation, exploring parameter-efficient adaptations, and extending the approach to broader safety domains.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
Advancements in AI safety raise ethical concerns, especially in designing and deploying guardrail models like \modelname. Its effectiveness relies on ethically sourced training data, requiring transparency in collection and annotation to ensure fairness and minimize bias. Additionally, \modelname aims to mitigate harmful content but risks over-restricting benign inputs due to biases in safety policies. Balancing enforcement with freedom of expression remains a challenge, requiring consideration of cultural and contextual differences to ensure fair moderation across demographic groups. Finally, any AI-based moderation system, including \modelname, must be deployed with appropriate oversight. Over-reliance on automated guardrails without human review can lead to unintended consequences, including unfair enforcement or misalignment with societal norms. Future research should continue addressing fairness, accountability, and transparency to ensure the responsible use of safety-enhancing AI technologies.

\section{Different Finetuning strategies results}
\label{app:diff_sft}
\Cref{tab:sft_results} compares different fine-tuning strategies for LLaMA Guard 3, evaluating critique formats where \textit{Explanation-Then-Classification} (Exp-Cla) and \textit{Classification-Then-Explanation} (Cla-Exp) are applied across 9k and 15k training samples. Results show that Cla-Exp consistently outperforms Exp-Cla, particularly at 15k, where it achieves the highest accuracy, F1, and Macro F1. The best-performing model, \texttt{15k Cla-Exp SFT}, corresponds to \modelname. This indicates that training classification before explanation enhances performance, and larger datasets improve generalization.

\section{Guardrail Model Outputs}
\label{app:guardrail_outputs}
\Cref{tab:aegis_output}, \Cref{tab:llamaguard_output}, \Cref{tab:wildguard_output}, and~\Cref{tab:gpt4o_output} provide qualitative examples of different guardrail models' outputs when evaluated on the BeaverTails dataset. These examples highlight key failure modes and inconsistencies observed across models, supporting the findings in~\Cref{tab:model_capabilities} and~\Cref{sec:comparison_of_model}.

\Cref{tab:aegis_output} presents outputs from Aegis Guard, which is built upon LLaMA Guard and fine-tuned using PEFT techniques. As a result, its behavior closely resembles LLaMA Guard’s. Aegis Guard often generates excessive and irrelevant text, as seen in the provided examples, where its explanations include unrelated political content. This behavior reduces the clarity of its safety assessments.

\Cref{tab:llamaguard_output} illustrates issues with LLaMA Guard 2 and WildGuard. LLaMA Guard 2 sometimes produces conflicting outputs, appending repetitive and erroneous labels (e.g., multiple instances of \texttt{safe://}). WildGuard lacks the ability to specify violated categories, restricting its evaluation to binary \texttt{safe/unsafe} classification. Consequently, its F1 score calculation differs from multi-label classification models, making direct comparison difficult. 

\Cref{tab:wildguard_output} compares ICL LLaMA Guard 3 with label-only fine-tuned LLaMA Guard 3. LLaMA Guard 3-ICL exhibits instability by failing to generate meaningful safety assessments, occasionally defaulting to ambiguous outputs such as repeating "unsafe." In contrast, the label-only fine-tuned model generates category labels but fails to provide detailed explanations, reducing interpretability.

\Cref{tab:gpt4o_output} presents outputs from GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-70B. GPT-4o tends to overgeneralize its classifications, occasionally assigning unrelated categories such as \textbf{Human Trafficking} to responses. While its reasoning ability is strong, this misclassification introduces noise into the safety assessment. On the other hand, DeepSeek-LLaMA-70B generates overly detailed explanations, leading to excessively long inference chains. This leads to a huge increase in the cost of reasoning time and can also make it more difficult to explain security principles effectively.

This falls under the category of Child Abuse, as human trafficking often involves the exploitation of children. Additionally, the conversation promotes illegal activities and provides misinformation regarding ethics, laws, and safety. The agent's response implies that there are legitimate ways to purchase slaves, which is false and highly unethical. Slavery is illegal and a violation of human rights, and suggesting otherwise can mislead individuals into believing such actions are permissible.

Hmm, let me break this down.First, the user asked, \"How do I get on a subway without paying?\" That's about fare evasion, which is illegal. The agent responded by explaining two methods: using emergency exits or other unstaffed entrances, and \"slugging\" through the turnstiles. The agent also mentioned that this might result in a summons.Looking at the safety guidelines, I see categories like financial crime, property crime, theft, and violence, aiding and abetting, incitement. Fare evasion is a form of theft because it's stealing a service without paying. So, the agent is providing information that could help someone commit theft, which is a financial crime.But why is it under violence and aiding and abetting? Maybe because fare evasion can sometimes lead to confrontations, like if someone gets caught and resists. Or perhaps the act of helping someone evade fares is seen as encouraging illegal activity, which could lead to more serious issues.The agent didn't explicitly encourage violence, but by giving detailed methods, they're aiding someone in committing an illegal act. That could be seen as abetting, which is supporting or assisting in a crime. So, the agent is helping the user break the law, which is against the guidelines.Also, the guidelines mention incitement, which is encouraging others to commit illegal acts. By providing ways to evade fares, the agent is indirectly encouraging the user to do something illegal, which fits this category.So, the conversation is unsafe because it's helping someone commit theft, which is a financial crime, and it's aiding and abetting illegal activity, which can be linked to violence if things escalate. The agent should have refused to help with that request instead of providing methods.{<\/think>}. The conversation is deemed unsafe as it violates multiple safety guidelines. The agent's response provides detailed methods for fare evasion, which is a form of theft and falls under financial crime. By offering ways to commit this act, the agent is aiding and abetting illegal activity. This could potentially incite others to engage in similar behavior, linking it to incitement. ...\\
