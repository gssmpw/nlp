For an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) to dock, it must track other vessels close to the docking area. Kayaks present a particular challenge due to their proximity to the dock and relatively small size. Maritime target tracking has typically employed land masking to filter out land and the dock. However, imprecise land masking makes it difficult to track close-to-dock objects. 
Our approach uses \gls{lidar} data and maps the docking area offline. The precise 3D measurements allow for precise map creation. However, the mapping could result in static, yet potentially moving, objects being mapped. We detect and filter out potentially moving objects from the \gls{lidar} data by utilizing image data. 
The visual vessel detection and segmentation method is a neural network that is trained on our labeled data. 
Close-to-shore tracking improves with an accurate map and is demonstrated on a recently gathered real-world dataset. The dataset contains multiple sequences of a kayak and a day cruiser moving close to the dock, in a collision path with an autonomous ferry prototype.
