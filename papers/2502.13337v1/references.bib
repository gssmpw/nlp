  abstract   = {Interactive proofs of theorems often require auxiliary helper lemmas
                to prove the desired theorem. Existing approaches for automatically synthesizing
                helper lemmas fall into two broad categories. Some approaches are goal-directed,
                producing lemmas specifically to help a user make progress from a given proof
                state, but they have limited expressiveness in terms of the lemmas that can be
                produced. Other approaches are highly expressive, able to generate arbitrary
                lemmas from a given grammar, but they are completely undirected and hence not
                amenable to interactive usage. In this paper, we develop an approach to lemma
                synthesis that is both goal-directed and expressive. The key novelty is a
                technique for reducing lemma synthesis to a data-driven program synthesis problem,
                whereby examples for synthesis are generated from the current proof state. We also
                describe a technique to systematically introduce new variables for lemma
                synthesis, as well as techniques for filtering and ranking candidate lemmas for
                presentation to the user. We implement these ideas in a tool called lfind, which
                can be run as a Coq tactic. In an evaluation on four benchmark suites, lfind
                produces useful lemmas in 68% of the cases where a human prover used a lemma to
                %make progress. In these cases lfind synthesizes a lemma that either enables a
                %fully automated proof of the original goal or that matches the human-provided

                However, because verification proof scripts often share structure, it is possible
                to learn from existing proof scripts to fully automate some formal verification.
                The goal of this paper is to improve proof script synthesis and enable fully
                automating more verification. Interactive theorem provers, such as the Coq proof
                assistant, allow programmers to write partial proof scripts, observe the semantics
                of the proof state thus far, and then attempt more progress. Knowing the proof
                state semantics is a significant aid. Recent research has shown that the proof
                state can help predict the next step. In this paper, we present TacTok, the first
                technique that attempts to fully automate proof script synthesis by modeling proof
                scripts using both the partial proof script written thus far and the semantics of
                the proof state. Thus, TacTok more completely models the information the
                programmer has access to when writing proof scripts manually. We evaluate TacTok
                on a benchmark of 26 software projects in Coq, consisting of over 10 thousand
                theorems. We compare our approach to five tools. Two prior techniques, CoqHammer,
                the state-of-the-art proof synthesis technique, and ASTactic, a proof script
                synthesis technique that models proof state. And three new proof script synthesis
                technique we create ourselves, SeqOnly, which models only the partial proof script
                and the initial theorem being proven, and WeightedRandom and WeightedGreedy, which
                use metaheuristic search biased by frequencies of proof tactics in existing,
                successful proof scripts. We find that TacTok outperforms WeightedRandom and
                WeightedGreedy, and is complementary to CoqHammer and ASTactic: for 24 out of the
                26 projects, TacTok can synthesize proof scripts for some theorems the prior tools
                cannot. Together with TacTok, 11.5% more theorems can be proven automatically than
                %by CoqHammer alone, and 20.0% than by ASTactic alone. Compared to a combination
                %%of
                %%CoqHammer and ASTactic, TacTok can prove an additional 3.6% more theorems,
                %%%proving

  abstract  = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

However, EipE questions aren't widely used in introductory programming courses in part because of the large grading effort required. In this paper, we present our experience of using peer grading for EipE questions in a large-enrollment introductory programming course, where students were asked to categorize other students' responses. We developed a novel Bayesian algorithm for performing calibrated peer grading on categorical data, and we used a heuristic grade assignment method based on the Bayesian estimates. The peer-grading exercises served both as a way to coach students on what is expected from EipE questions and as a way to alleviate the grading load for the course staff. Based on four rounds of peer-grading activities, we found that students are generally capable of categorizing responses to EiPE questions and that our proposed Bayesian method is more robust than unweighted voting.},

In this paper, we study the problem of automatically grading the kinds of open response mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third, we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster. As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions, which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational platforms.},

The task of ASAG can be tackled with several approaches and they can be broadly categorized into the traditional approaches based on handcrafted features and the Deep Learning based approaches. Researchers are applying Deep Learning Approaches for the past five years to address this problem owing to the increasing popularity of this area. The paper aims to summarize various existing deep learning approaches researchers followed to address this problem and to investigate whether Deep Learning based techniques are outperforming traditional approaches from the selected 38 papers.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract   = {Automated short answer grading (ASAG) has gained attention in education as a means to scale educational tasks to the growing number of students. Recent progress in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning has largely influenced the field of ASAG, of which we survey the recent research advancements. We complement previous surveys by providing a comprehensive analysis of recently published methods that deploy deep learning approaches. In particular, we focus our analysis on the transition from hand engineered features to representation learning approaches, which learn representative features for the task at hand automatically from large corpora of data. We structure our analysis of deep learning methods along three categories: word embeddings, sequential models, and attention-based methods. Deep learning impacted ASAG differently than other fields of NLP, as we noticed that the learned representations alone do not contribute to achieve the best results, but they rather show to work in a complementary way with hand-engineered features. The best performance are indeed achieved by methods that combine the carefully hand-engineered features with the power of the semantic descriptions provided by the latest models, like transformers architectures. We identify challenges and provide an outlook on research direction that can be addressed in the future},

Sentences that share semantic and syntactic properties are thus mapped to similar vector representations. We next introduce a simple vocabulary expansion method to encode words that were not seen as part of training, allowing us to expand our vocabulary to a million words. After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets. The end result is an off-the-shelf encoder that can produce highly generic sentence representations that are robust and perform well in practice. We will make our encoder publicly available.},

  abstract   = {Since the introduction of the original BERT (i.e., BASE BERT), researchers have developed various customized BERT models with improved performance for specific domains and tasks by exploiting the benefits of transfer learning. Due to the nature of mathematical texts, which often use domain specific vocabulary along with equations and math symbols, we posit that the development of a new BERT model for mathematics would be useful for many mathematical downstream tasks. In this resource paper, we introduce our multi-institutional effort (i.e., two learning platforms and three academic institutions in the US) toward this need: MathBERT, a model created by pre-training the BASE BERT model on a large mathematical corpus ranging from pre-kindergarten (pre-k), to high-school, to college graduate level mathematical content. In addition, we select three general NLP tasks that are often used in mathematics education: prediction of knowledge component, auto-grading open-ended Q\&A, and knowledge tracing, to demonstrate the superiority of MathBERT over BASE BERT. Our experiments show that MathBERT outperforms prior best methods by 1.2-22\% and BASE BERT by 2-8\% on these tasks. In addition, we build a mathematics specific vocabulary 'mathVocab' to train with MathBERT. We discover that MathBERT pre-trained with 'mathVocab' outperforms MathBERT trained with the BASE BERT vocabulary (i.e., 'origVocab'). MathBERT is currently being adopted at the participated leaning platforms: Stride, Inc, a commercial educational resource provider, and ASSISTments.org, a free online educational platform. We release MathBERT for public usage at: https://github.com/tbs17/MathBERT.},

A consistent analysis over diverse student populations in high schools, colleges, and universities is obtained if a rough measure of the average effectiveness of a course in promoting conceptual understanding is taken to be the average normalized gain ãgã. The latter is defined as the ratio of the actual average gain (\%ãpostãâ\%ãpreã) to the maximum possible average gain (100â\%ãpreã). Fourteen âtraditionalâ (T) courses (N=2084) which made little or no use of interactive-engagement (IE) methods achieved an average gain ãgãT-ave=0.23Â±0.04â(stdâdev). In sharp contrast, 48 courses (N=4458) which made substantial use of IE methods achieved an average gain ãgãIE-ave=0.48Â±0.14â(stdâdev), almost two standard deviations of ãgãIE-ave above that of the traditional courses. Results for 30 (N=3259) of the above 62 courses on the problem-solving Mechanics Baseline test of HestenesâWells imply that IE strategies enhance problem-solving ability. The conceptual and problem-solving test results strongly suggest that the classroom use of IE methods can increase mechanics-course effectiveness well beyond that obtained in traditional practice.},

  title      = {Evaluating novel pedagogy in higher education: a case study of
                e-proofs},
  shorttitle = {Evaluating novel pedagogy in higher education},
  abstract   = {This thesis is a single case study of the introduction and
                evaluation of new resources and new technologies in higher education; in which
                e-Proof was chosen as a single case. E-proofs are a multimedia representation of
                proofs, were created by Alcock (2009), and aimed to help undergraduates to read
                proofs for better proof comprehension. My thesis aimed to investigate whether
                the impact of reading such technology-based resource, e-Proofs, on
                undergraduates proof comprehension was better compared to reading written
                textbook proofs and if so, then why (or why not). To evaluate the effectiveness
                of e-Proofs, I used both qualitative and quantitative methods. First I measured
                undergraduates satisfaction, which is a most common research practice in
                evaluation studies, by using self-reporting methods such as web-based survey and
                interviews. A web-based survey and focus-group interviews showed that
                undergraduates liked to have e-Proofs and they believed that e-Proofs had
                positive impact on their proof comprehension. However, their positive views on
                e-Proofs did not evidence the educational impact of e-Proofs. I conducted an
                interview with Alcock for better understanding of her intentions of creating
                e-Proof and her expectations from it. Next, I conducted the first experiment
                which compared the impact of reading an e-Proof with a written textbook proof on
                undergraduates proof comprehension. Their comprehension was measured with an
                open-ended comprehension test twice immediately after reading the proof and
                after two weeks. I found that the immediate impact of reading an e-Proof and a
                textbook proof were essentially the same, however the long term impact of
                reading an e-Proof was worse than reading a textbook proof (for both high and
                low achieving undergraduates). This leads to the second experiment in which I
                investigated how undergraduates read e-Proofs and textbook proofs. In the second
                experiment, participants eye-movements were recorded while read- ing proofs, to
                explore their reading comprehension processes. This eye-tracking experiment
                showed that undergraduates had a sense of understanding of how to read a proof
                without any additional help. Rather, additional help allowed them to take a back
                seat and to devote less cognitive effort than they would otherwise. Moreover,
                e-Proofs altered undergraduates reading behaviours in a way which can harm
                learning. In sum, this thesis contributes knowledge into the area of reading and
                compre- hending proofs at undergraduate level and presents a methodology for
                evaluation studies of new pedagogical tools.},

  abstract   = {Being unaware of the assumptions underlying a deductive argument is
                widespread among learners and is a major stumbling block to their understanding
                of proof. Thus, the basic idea of the present paper is that at some points in
                the course of secondary education there should be classroom-based interventions
                addressing this difï¬culty and making the axiomatic organization of mathematics a
                theme. Students should be made aware that there are axioms in mathematics, what
                their role is and how mathematicians come to agree about which axioms should be
                accepted. An axiom which is not yet accepted is simply a hypothesis. A
                hypothesis is evaluated by deductively drawing consequences and by investigating
                whether these consequences agree with experience or should be accepted for other
                reasons. The teaching intervention discussed in this paper exempliï¬es this idea
                by way of the example of ancient attempts at modelling the path of the sun, the
                socalled ââanomaly of the sunââ. It is investigated to what extent the teaching
                intervention fostered studentsâ understanding of the conditionality of
                mathematical/astronomical statements, that is, of the fact that the truth of
                these statements is dependent on the initial hypotheses.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

Based on a set of questions deployed on a computer-based exam, we find that our implementation has an accuracy of 87â89\%, which is similar in performance to course teaching assistants trained to perform this task and compares favorably to automatic short answer grading algorithms developed for other domains. In addition, we briefly characterize the kinds of answers that the current autograder fails to score correctly and the kinds of errors made by students.},

A successful autoformalization system could advance the fields of formal verification, program synthesis, and artificial intelligence.

We make the surprising observation that LLMs can correctly translate a significant portion (\$25.3{\textbackslash}\%\$) of mathematical competition problems perfectly to formal specifications in Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate the usefulness of this process by improving a previously introduced neural theorem prover via training on these autoformalized theorems. Our methodology results in a new state-of-the-art result on the MiniF2F theorem proving benchmark, improving the proof rate from \$29.6{\textbackslash}\%\$ to \$35.2{\textbackslash}\%\$.},

  abstract = { This article reviews the corpus of research on feedback, with a focus on formative feedbackâdefined as information communicated to the learner that is intended to modify his or her thinking or behavior to improve learning. According to researchers, formative feedback should be nonevaluative, supportive, timely, and specific. Formative feedback is usually presented as information to a learner in response to some action on the learnerâs part. It comes in a variety of types (e.g., verification of response accuracy, explanation of the correct answer, hints, worked examples) and can be administered at various times during the learning process (e.g., immediately following an answer, after some time has elapsed). Finally, several variables have been shown to interact with formative feedbackâs success at promoting learning (e.g., individual characteristics of the learner and aspects of the task). All of these issues are discussed. This review concludes with guidelines for generating formative feedback. }

From 40 studies, 70 effect sizes were computed, which ranged from -0.78 to 2.29. A mixed model was used for the data analysis. The results show that elaborated feedback (EF; e.g., providing an explanation) produced larger effect sizes (0.49) than feedback regarding the correctness of the answer (KR; 0.05) or providing the correct answer (KCR; 0.32). EF was particularly more effective than KR and KCR for higher order learning outcomes. Effect sizes were positively affected by EF feedback, and larger effect sizes were found for mathematics compared with social sciences, science, and languages. Effect sizes were negatively affected by delayed feedback timing and by primary and high school. Although the results suggested that immediate feedback was more effective for lower order learning than delayed feedback and vice versa, no significant interaction was found.},

  abstract   = {Emerging research suggests that people trust algorithmic decisions less than human decisions. However, different populations, particularly in marginalized communities, may have different levels of trust in human decision-makers. Do people who mistrust human decision-makers perceive human decisions to be more trustworthy and fairer than algorithmic decisions? Or do they trust algorithmic decisions as much as or more than human decisions? We examine the role of mistrust in human systems in peopleâs perceptions of algorithmic decisions. We focus on healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI), group-based medical mistrust, and Black people in the United States. We conducted a between-subjects online experiment to examine peopleâs perceptions of skin cancer screening decisions made by an AI versus a human physician depending on their medical mistrust, and we conducted interviews to understand how to cultivate trust in healthcare AI. Our findings highlight that research around human experiences of AI should consider critical differences in social groups.},

  abstract   = {Algorithms increasingly make managerial decisions that people used to make. Perceptions of algorithms, regardless of the algorithms' actual performance, can significantly influence their adoption, yet we do not fully understand how people perceive decisions made by algorithms as compared with decisions made by humans. To explore perceptions of algorithmic management, we conducted an online experiment using four managerial decisions that required either mechanical or human skills. We manipulated the decision-maker (algorithmic or human), and measured perceived fairness, trust, and emotional response. With the mechanical tasks, algorithmic and human-made decisions were perceived as equally fair and trustworthy and evoked similar emotions; however, human managers' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to the manager's authority, whereas algorithms' fairness and trustworthiness were attributed to their perceived efficiency and objectivity. Human decisions evoked some positive emotion due to the possibility of social recognition, whereas algorithmic decisions generated a more mixed response â algorithms were seen as helpful tools but also possible tracking mechanisms. With the human tasks, algorithmic decisions were perceived as less fair and trustworthy and evoked more negative emotion than human decisions. Algorithms' perceived lack of intuition and subjective judgment capabilities contributed to the lower fairness and trustworthiness judgments. Positive emotion from human decisions was attributed to social recognition, while negative emotion from algorithmic decisions was attributed to the dehumanizing experience of being evaluated by machines. This work reveals people's lay concepts of algorithmic versus human decisions in a management context and suggests that task characteristics matter in understanding people's experiences with algorithmic technologies.},

  abstract = {Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a taskâs perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithmsâ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.},

  abstract   = {With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing the explainability of complex machine learning models. However, the explanations generated by an XAI may lead to cognitive biases among human users. To address this problem, this study aims to investigate how to mitigate usersâ cognitive biases based on their individual characteristics. In the literature review, we found two factors that can be helpful in remedying biases: 1) debiasing strategies that have been reported to potentially reduce biases in usersâ decision-making via additional information or change in information delivery, and 2) explanation modality types. To examine these factorsâ effects, we conducted an experiment with a 4 (debiasing strategy) Ã 3 (explanation type) between-subject design. In the experiment, participants were exposed to an explainable interface that provides an AIâs outcomes with explanatory information, and their behavioral and attitudinal responses were collected. Specifically, we statistically examined the effects of textual and visual explanations on usersâ trust and confirmation bias toward AI systems, considering the moderating effects of debiasing methods and watching time. The results demonstrated that textual explanations lead to higher trust in XAI systems compared to visual explanations. Moreover, we found that textual explanations are particularly beneficial for quick decision-makers to evaluate the outputs of AI systems. Next, the results indicated that the cognitive bias can be effectively mitigated by providing users with a priori information. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for designing AI-based decision support systems that can generate more trustworthy and equitable explanations.},

  abstract  = {Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, the other can use different passages per token. We fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state-of-the-art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we find that RAG models generate more specific, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline.},

  abstract  = {Errors in AI grading and feedback often have an intractable set of causes and are, by their nature, difficult to completely avoid. Since inaccurate feedback potentially harms learning, there is a need for designs and workflows that mitigate these harms. To better understand the mechanisms by which erroneous AI feedback impacts studentsâ learning, we conducted surveys and interviews that recorded studentsâ interactions with a short-answer AI autograder for âExplain in Plain Englishâ code reading problems. Using causal modeling, we inferred the learning impacts of wrong answers marked as right (false positives, FPs) and right answers marked as wrong (false negatives, FNs). We further explored explanations for the learning impacts, including errors influencing participantsâ engagement with feedback and assessments of their answersâ correctness, and participantsâ prior performance in the class. FPs harmed learning in large part due to participantsâ failures to detect the errors. This was due to participants not paying attention to the feedback after being marked as right, and an apparent bias against admitting oneâs answer was wrong once marked right. On the other hand, FNs harmed learning only for survey participants, suggesting that intervieweesâ greater behavioral and cognitive engagement protected them from learning harms. Based on these findings, we propose ways to help learners detect FPs and encourage deeper reflection on FNs to mitigate the learning harms of AI errors.},

This paper presents studentsâ perceptions surrounding a â¼ 90\% accurate automated short-answer grader that determined homework and exam credit in a college-level computer science course. Using surveys and interviews, we investigated studentsâ knowledge about the autograder and their attitudes. We observed that misalignment between folk theories about how the autograder worked and how it actually worked could lead to suboptimal answer construction strategies. Students overestimated the autograderâs probability of marking correct answers as wrong, and estimates of this probability were associated with dissatisfaction and perceptions of unfairness. Many participants expressed a need for additional instruction on how to cater to the autograder. From these findings, we propose guidelines for incorporating imperfect short answer autograders into classroom in a manner that is considerate of studentsâ needs.},

  abstract  = {Learning experience designers consistently balance the trade-off between open and close-ended activities. The growth and scalability of Computer Based Learning Platforms (CBLPs) have only magnified the importance of these design trade-offs. CBLPs often utilize close-ended activities (i.e. Multiple-Choice Questions [MCQs]) due to feasibility constraints associated with the use of open-ended activities. MCQs offer certain affordances, such as immediate grading and the use of distractors, setting them apart from open-ended activities. Our current study examines the effectiveness of Fill-In problems as an alternative to MCQs for middle school mathematics. We report on a randomized study conducted from 2017 to 2022, with a total of 6,768 students from middle schools across the US. We observe that, on average, Fill-In problems lead to better post-test performance than MCQs; albeit deeper explorations indicate differences between the two design paradigms to be more nuanced. We find evidence that students with higher math knowledge benefit more from Fill-In problems than those with lower math knowledge.},

  abstract = {The reliability and validity of professionally written multiple-choice exams have been extensively studied for exams such as the SAT, graduate record examination, and the force concept inventory. Much of the success of these multiple-choice exams is attributed to the careful construction of each question, as well as each response. In this study, the reliability and validity of scores from multiple-choice exams written for and administered in the large introductory physics courses at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign were investigated. The reliability of exam scores over the course of a semester results in approximately a 3\% uncertainty in studentsâ total semester exam score. This semester test score uncertainty yields an uncertainty in the studentsâ assigned letter grade that is less than 13 of a letter grade. To study the validity of exam scores, a subset of students were ranked independently based on their multiple-choice score, graded explanations, and student interviews. The ranking of these students based on their multiple-choice score was found to be consistent with the ranking assigned by physics instructors based on the studentsâ written explanations (r{\textgreater}0.94 at the 95\% confidence level) and oral interviews (r=0.94+0.06â0.09).},

  abstract  = {Automated scoring of open-ended student responses has the potential to significantly reduce human grader effort. Recent advances in automated scoring often leverage textual representations based on pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT as input to scoring models. Most existing approaches train a separate model for each item/question, which is suitable for scenarios such as essay scoring where items can be quite different from one another. However, these approaches have two limitations: 1) they fail to leverage item linkage for scenarios such as reading comprehension where multiple items may share a reading passage; 2) they are not scalable since storing one model per item becomes difficult when models have a large number of parameters. In this paper, we report our (grand prize-winning) solution to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) automated scoring challenge for reading comprehension. Our approach, in-context BERT fine-tuning, produces a single shared scoring model for all items with a carefully-designed input structure to provide contextual information on each item. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via local evaluations using the training dataset provided by the challenge. We also discuss the biases, common error types, and limitations of our approach.},

  abstract  = {Automated Short Answer Grading (ASAG) has been an active area of machine-learning research for over a decade. It promises to let educators grade and give feedback on free-form responses in large-enrollment courses in spite of limited availability of human graders. Over the years, carefully trained models have achieved increasingly higher levels of performance. More recently, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) emerged as a commodity, and an intriguing question is how a general-purpose tool without additional training compares to specialized models. We studied the performance of GPT-4 on the standard benchmark 2-way and 3-way datasets SciEntsBank and Beetle, where in addition to the standard task of grading the alignment of the student answer with a reference answer, we also investigated withholding the reference answer. We found that overall, the performance of the pre-trained general-purpose GPT-4 LLM is comparable to hand-engineered models, but worse than pre-trained LLMs that had specialized training.},

  abstract  = {Short-answer based questions have been used widely due to their effectiveness in assessing whether the desired learning outcomes have been attained by students. However, due to their open-ended nature, many different answers could be considered entirely or partially correct for the same question. In the context of computer science and software engineering courses where the enrolment has been increasing recently, manual grading of short-answer questions is a time-consuming and tedious process for instructors. In software engineering courses, assessments concern not just coding but many other aspects of software development such as system analysis, architecture design, software processes and operation methodologies such as Agile and DevOps. However, existing work in automatic grading/scoring of text-based answers in computing courses have been focusing more on coding-oriented questions. In this work, we consider the problem of autograding a broader range of short answers in software engineering courses. We propose an automated grading system incorporating both text embedding and completion approaches based on recently introduced pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5/4. We design and implement a web-based system so that students and instructors can easily leverage autograding for learning and teaching. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of our automated grading approaches. We use a popular public dataset in the computing education domain and a new software engineering dataset of our own. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and provide useful insights for further research in this area of AI-enabled education.},

The aim of this study is therefore to review the research on formative use of rubrics, in order to investigate if, and how, rubrics have an impact on student learning. In total, 21 studies about rubrics were analyzed through content analysis. Sample, subject/task, design, procedure, and findings, were compared among the different studies in relation to effects on student performance and selfregulation. Findings indicate that rubrics may have the potential to influence students learning positively, but also that there are several different ways for the use of rubrics to mediate improved performance and self-regulation. There are a number of factors identified that may moderate the effects of using rubrics formatively, as well as factors that need further investigation.},

  abstract  = {The manual grading of short answers presents challenges in education due to time constraints, especially with larger student populations, and suffers from subjectivity and bias, leading to inconsistencies. Larger student populations increase the time needed for individual assessment, leading to potential delays and subjectivity introduces biases, resulting in inconsistent evaluations. Moreover, as student numbers rise, the imbalance in teacher-to-student ratios affects grading quality, impacting fairness and effectiveness in educational assessments. Automated grading systems have emerged as a solution to address these issues. These grading systems mainly prioritize appearance, emphasizing grammar and format. However, they struggle to accurately assess content quality, often missing contextual relevance. This problem can potentially be resolved by employing highly trained domain-specific models. However, a drawback arises as these models are limited to evaluating answers only within predefined domains. While these specialized models excel in assessing responses within their designated fields, their utility is restricted when evaluating answers outside of these predefined domains. This limitation poses a challenge in achieving broader applicability for assessing answers outside the specific areas the models were trained for. This study proposes a rubric-based method paired with Large Language Models (LLMs) to introduce objectivity, ensuring fairness and reliability in evaluations while achieving generalizability. Rubric provides a clear and customizable marking schema for assessing short answers across various domains. By using predetermined marking criteria and conditions, the grading process becomes more objective and transparent. The proposed method efficiently evaluates short answers in various domains using Large Language Models (LLMs), based on these established criteria, reducing subjective biases. This research aims to revolutionize education by creating a robust automated short answer scoring system that comprehensively evaluates contents across domains and addresses teacher-to-student ratio issues.},

Unfortunately, this is currently the kind of feedback given by Automatic Short Answer Grading (ASAG) systems. One of the reasons for this is a lack of content-focused elaborated feedback datasets. To encourage research on explainable and understandable feedback systems, we present the Short Answer Feedback dataset (SAF). Similar to other ASAG datasets, SAF contains learner responses and reference answers to German and English questions. However, instead of only assigning a label or score to the learners' answers, SAF also contains elaborated feedback explaining the given score. Thus, SAF enables supervised training of models that grade answers and explain where and why mistakes were made. This paper discusses the need for enhanced feedback models in real-world pedagogical scenarios, describes the dataset annotation process, gives a comprehensive analysis of SAF, and provides T5-based baselines for future comparison.},

  abstract = {Assessing writing in large classes for formal or informal learners presents a significant challenge. Consequently, most large classes, particularly in science, rely on objective assessment tools such as multiple-choice quizzes, which have a single correct answer. The rapid development of AI has introduced the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate student writing. An experiment was conducted using GPT-4 to determine if machine learning methods based on LLMs can match or exceed the reliability of instructor grading in evaluating short writing assignments on topics in astronomy. The audience consisted of adult learners in three massive open online courses (MOOCs) offered through Coursera. One course was on astronomy, the second was on astrobiology, and the third was on the history and philosophy of astronomy. The results should also be applicable to non-science majors in university settings, where the content and modes of evaluation are similar. The data comprised answers from 120 students to 12 questions across the three courses. GPT-4 was provided with total grades, model answers, and rubrics from an instructor for all three courses. In addition to evaluating how reliably the LLM reproduced instructor grades, the LLM was also tasked with generating its own rubrics. Overall, the LLM was more reliable than peer grading, both in aggregate and by individual student, and approximately matched instructor grades for all three online courses. The implication is that LLMs may soon be used for automated, reliable, and scalable grading of student science writing.},

  abstract   = {The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm has emerged as a critical approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, despite their widespread adoption and success, CoT methods often exhibit instability due to their inability to consistently ensure the quality of generated reasoning paths, leading to sub-optimal reasoning performance. To address this challenge, we propose the {\textbackslash}textbf\{Strategic Chain-of-Thought\} (SCoT), a novel methodology designed to refine LLM performance by integrating strategic knowledge prior to generating intermediate reasoning steps. SCoT employs a two-stage approach within a single prompt: first eliciting an effective problem-solving strategy, which is then used to guide the generation of high-quality CoT paths and final answers. Our experiments across eight challenging reasoning datasets demonstrate significant improvements, including a 21.05{\textbackslash}\% increase on the GSM8K dataset and 24.13{\textbackslash}\% on the Tracking{\textbackslash}\_Objects dataset, respectively, using the Llama3-8b model. Additionally, we extend the SCoT framework to develop a few-shot method with automatically matched demonstrations, yielding even stronger results. These findings underscore the efficacy of SCoT, highlighting its potential to substantially enhance LLM performance in complex reasoning tasks.},

Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.},

However, open-ended questions are tedious to grade and subject to personal bias. Therefore, there have been efforts to speed up the grading process through automation. Short Answer Grading (SAG) systems aim to automatically score students' answers in examinations. Despite growth in SAG methods and capabilities, there exists no comprehensive short-answer grading benchmark across different subjects, grading scales, and distributions. Thus, it is hard to assess the capabilities of current automated grading methods in terms of their generalizability. In this preliminary work, we introduce the combined ASAG2024 benchmark to facilitate the comparison of automated grading systems. Combining seven commonly used short-answer grading datasets in a common structure and grading scale. For our benchmark, we evaluate a set of recent SAG methods, revealing that while LLM-based approaches reach new high scores, they still are far from reaching human performance. This opens up avenues for future research on human-machine SAG systems.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in the field of deep learning for natural language processing made it possible to use novel deep learning architectures, such as the Transformer, for increasingly complex natural language processing tasks. Combined with novel unsupervised pre-training tasks such as masked language modeling, sentence ordering or next sentence prediction, those natural language processing models became even more accurate. In this work, we experiment with fine-tuning different pre-trained Transformer based architectures. We train the newest and most powerful, according to the glue benchmark, transformers on the SemEval-2013 dataset. We also explore the impact of transfer learning a model fine-tuned on the MNLI dataset to the SemEval-2013 dataset on generalization and performance. We report upÂ to 13\% absolute improvement in macro-average-F1 over state-of-the-art results. We show that models trained with knowledge distillation are feasible for use in short answer grading. Furthermore, we compare multilingual models on a machine-translated version of the SemEval-2013 dataset.},

  abstract  = {RAGMan is an LLM-powered tutoring system that can support a variety of course-specific and homework-specific AI tutors. RAGMan leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as strict instructions, to ensure the alignment of the AI tutors' responses. By using RAGMan's AI tutors, students receive assistance with their specific homework assignments without directly obtaining solutions, while also having the ability to ask general programming-related questions. RAGMan was deployed as an optional resource in an introductory programming course with an enrollment of 455 students. It was configured as a set of five homework-specific AI tutors. This paper describes the interactions the students had with the AI tutors, the students' feedback, and a comparative grade analysis. Overall, about half of the students engaged with the AI tutors, and the vast majority of the interactions were legitimate homework questions. When students posed questions within the intended scope, the AI tutors delivered accurate responses 98\% of the time. Among the students who used AI tutors, 78\% reported that the tutors helped their learning. Beyond AI tutors' ability to provide valuable suggestions, students reported appreciating them for fostering a safe learning environment free from judgment.},

  abstract  = {The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.},

  abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.}

We found that GPT-4, with basic few-shot prompting performed well (Kappa, 0.70) and, importantly, very close to human-level performance (0.75). This research builds on prior findings that GPT-4 could reliably score short answer reading comprehension questions at a performance-level very close to that of expert human raters. The proximity to human-level performance, across a variety of subjects and grade levels suggests that LLMs could be a valuable tool for supporting low-stakes formative assessment tasks in K-12 education and has important implications for real-world education delivery.},

abstract = {The ability of students to ''Explain in Plain English'' (EiPE) the purpose of code is a critical skill for students in introductory programming courses to develop. EiPE questions serve as both a mechanism for students to develop and demonstrate code comprehension skills. However, evaluating this skill has been challenging as manual grading is time consuming and not easily automated. The process of constructing a prompt for the purposes of code generation for a Large Language Model, such OpenAI's GPT-4, bears a striking resemblance to constructing EiPE responses. In this paper, we explore the potential of using test cases run on code generated by GPT-4 from students' EiPE responses as a grading mechanism for EiPE questions. We applied this proposed grading method to a corpus of EiPE responses collected from past exams, then measured agreement between the results of this grading method and human graders. Overall, we find moderate agreement between the human raters and the results of the unit tests run on the generated code. This appears to be attributable to GPT-4's code generation being more lenient than human graders on low-level descriptions of code.},

abstract = {Reading, understanding and explaining code have traditionally been important skills for novices learning programming. As large language models (LLMs) become prevalent, these foundational skills are more important than ever given the increasing need to understand and evaluate model-generated code. Brand new skills are also needed, such as the ability to formulate clear prompts that can elicit intended code from an LLM. Thus, there is great interest in integrating pedagogical approaches for the development of both traditional coding competencies and the novel skills required to interact with LLMs. One effective way to develop and assess code comprehension ability is with "Explain in plain English'' (EiPE) questions, where students succinctly explain the purpose of a fragment of code. However, grading EiPE questions has always been difficult given the subjective nature of evaluating written explanations and this has stifled their uptake. In this paper, we explore a natural synergy between EiPE questions and code-generating LLMs to overcome this limitation. We propose using an LLM to generate code based on students' responses to EiPE questions -- not only enabling EiPE responses to be assessed automatically, but helping students develop essential code comprehension and prompt crafting skills in parallel. We investigate this idea in an introductory programming course and report student success in creating effective prompts for solving EiPE questions. We also examine student perceptions of this activity and how it influences their views on the use of LLMs for aiding and assessing learning.},
