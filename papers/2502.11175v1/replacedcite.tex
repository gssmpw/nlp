\subsection{Multilingual RAG}
Researchers explore challenges in mRAG such as problem of cross-lingual dense passage retrieval for low-resource languages____ and research various techniques to address key challenges in mRAG, such as enhancing the performance of language models in low-resource languages____, resolving low-resource scenarios____, and adapting language models for multilingual reasoning tasks____. Benchmarks like \textsc{MMTEB}____ enable systematic evaluation of multilingual retrieval.

Earlier mRAG systems frequently focus on high-resource languages (e.g., English), but a growing body of research aims to make advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology accessible across a wide spectrum of linguistic contexts. Proposed solutions include code-mixed prompts for in-context learning____ and self-distillation from resource-rich to low-resource languages____.

\subsection{Language Preference in mRAG}
Despite significant progress, language preference—a systematic tendency to favor certain languages—remains a critical issue in mRAG systems. This preference arises from imbalances in training data, tokenization mismatches, script differences, and uneven resource availability____. Studies show that high-resource languages (e.g., English) often overshadow relevant content in lower-resource languages during retrieval____, leading to suboptimal evidence retrieval____ and causing inconsistencies or hallucinations in outputs____. These disparities also raise broader fairness concerns in multilingual NLP, as pre-trained models exhibit group fairness issues across languages____.


Researchers propose several methods to counteract language preferences, including language-preference-based re-ranking____, evaluate knowledge consistency across languages____, and specialized datasets designed to detect such imbalances____. However, these approaches often focus on a single mRAG stage or overlook the actual ranking of retrieved documents____. We introduce a metric that quantifies language preference in retrieval via ranking differences and propose a simple framework to mitigate these preferences across the entire mRAG pipeline.
