\section{Strategies for Robust Confidence Estimation}
\label{appendix confidence}
To enhance the robustness of \textit{confidence estimation}, we employ three strategies \citep{confidence} that mitigate overconfidence and improve the reliability of confidence scores:

\paragraph{Top-K Prompting Strategy.} One effective approach to reducing overconfidence in LLMs is recognizing the existence of multiple plausible answers. To incorporate this principle, we modify the prompt to explicitly request the generation of the top 3 distinct error types along with their respective confidence scores. By enforcing diversity among the generated error types, this strategy encourages a more calibrated confidence estimation by considering multiple reasonable interpretations.

\paragraph{Self-random Sampling Strategy.} Analyzing the variation among multiple responses to the same input can further aid in confidence calibration. This strategy leverages the inherent randomness of LLMs by issuing the same prompt multiple times, thereby introducing controlled variability in the responses. To ensure sufficient diversity in the generated results, we set the temperature to 0.7 across all model configurations.

\paragraph{Average-Confidence (Avg-Conf) Aggregation Strategy.} Once multiple responses are generated, an aggregation mechanism is necessary to effectively capture and utilize the observed variability. We adopt the Avg-Conf aggregation strategy, which computes the final confidence distribution by averaging the confidence scores across multiple samples. This approach enables a more robust estimation of confidence levels by accounting for response fluctuations.

By integrating these strategies, we enable LLMs to articulate confidence scores more precisely, leading to improved robustness and trustworthiness in decision-making. For more details, please refer to \citet{confidence}.

\section{Dataset and Annotation Details}
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
\label{appendix extract single}
The original dataset contains numerous sentences with $n \ (n>1)$ grammatical errors. If such sentences are directly input into the model for error classification, it introduces ambiguity—making it unclear which error the model should focus on. This uncertainty can negatively impact prediction consistency. To mitigate this issue, we preprocess the dataset by isolating individual grammatical errors. Specifically, for each sentence containing $n$ errors, we generate $n$ separate instances using the edit extraction toolkit ERRANT~\cite{errant} and CLEME \cite{ye-etal-2023-cleme,ye2024cleme2}, each retaining only one grammatical error while correcting the others. This ensures that each model input is unambiguous, leading to more reliable classification results.

\subsection{Annotation Approach}
\label{appendix annotation}
In this process, we strictly adhered to the standards and best practices outlined in \citet{annotation_one} to ensure that LLM-based annotations are reliable, reproducible, and ethical. First, we utilize the LLM for pre-annotation to reduce the manual workload and improve annotation efficiency. LLM-generated annotations are then reviewed by the authors through an annotation refinement process, where prompts are iteratively refined and optimized to ensure that the LLM fully understands the task requirements.  Following the first review, two professional linguists conducted a second round of evaluation. Given the first-round labels, they re-evaluated the data. If discrepancies arose between the linguists and the initial annotation, they engaged in discussions with the authors to finalize the label. This multi-step annotation workflow ensured the reliability and consistency of our dataset.

\subsection{Dataset Details}
\label{appendix dataset_statistics}
Our dataset consists of 487 samples, each containing a single edit. Each sample is annotated with four labels corresponding to different error classification taxonomies: POL73, TUC74, BRY17, and FEI23. The original dataset does not contain any sensitive personal data, and all data has been anonymized to ensure privacy. Table \ref{tab dataset_statistics} provides an overview of the dataset statistics.

\section{Model Details}
\label{appendix models}
In this study, we employed multiple large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the rationality of different error classification taxonomies in error analysis: \textbf{Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct} \citep{llama3modelcard}, \textbf{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2} \citep{mistral7b}, \textbf{Claude-3-Haiku} \citep{claude3}, and \textbf{ChatGPT-4o} \citep{chatgpt4o}. These models were selected for their advanced text comprehension and classification capabilities, particularly in handling complex linguistic structures. Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 were deployed on a local server equipped with an A800 GPU for inference, while Claude-3-Haiku and ChatGPT-4o were accessed via API calls.

\section{Taxonomy-Specific Issues Affecting Rationality Metrics}  
\label{appendix main}  
This appendix provides a detailed analysis of taxonomy-specific issues that impact the rationality metrics assessed in our study.  

POL73 contains categories such as \textit{indefinite article incorrect} and \textit{determiners}, which often capture the same errors, leading to overlapping classifications. Similarly, \textit{inappropriate words but correct word class} and \textit{general semantic confusion} lack clear differentiation, reducing mutual exclusivity. TUC74 introduces ambiguous categories, such as \textit{simple predicate missing: be} vs. \textit{be missing}, and \textit{surrogate subject missing: there/it} vs. \textit{omission of surrogate subject}, creating annotation inconsistencies. FEI23, by structuring categories based on cognitive levels, ensures high exclusivity by clearly defining error boundaries and reducing ambiguity.  

POL73 includes categories like \textit{new creations} but lacks fundamental categories such as \textit{punctuation error} and \textit{orthography error}, slightly reducing its coverage. TUC74 performs worse in coverage as it omits not only \textit{punctuation error} and \textit{orthography error} but also \textit{spelling error}. This forces annotators to rely excessively on the \textit{other} category, significantly lowering its coverage score. BRY17, by defining error types based on both part-of-speech and token-level operations, ensures a broader representation of errors, leading to the highest coverage among all taxonomies.  

TUC74 demonstrates extreme specificity by defining five separate categories for errors related to temporal conjunctions, such as \textit{misplacement of while}. This level of granularity results in sparsely populated error categories, skewing distributional balance. POL73 takes the opposite approach, overgeneralizing error types. The category \textit{inappropriate words and incorrect word class} encompasses a wide range of unrelated grammatical issues, resulting in an overly broad classification that reduces distinction between different error types. FEI23 adopts a hierarchical classification strategy at three levels—\textit{single-word level}, \textit{inter-word level}, and \textit{discourse level}—ensuring balanced categorization without excessive fragmentation or aggregation.  

POL73 and TUC74 include overly technical or abstract error categories, such as \textit{phonetic similarity within English} and \textit{misuse of end-of-the-road predicates}, making them difficult to interpret and apply consistently. BRY17 and FEI23, by contrast, use straightforward category labels with simple lexical definitions, improving both human annotation efficiency and model interpretability. Their classification schemes facilitate direct mapping to computational models, reducing the complexity of automated grammar error detection.  

These taxonomy-specific issues highlight the challenges in designing effective error classification taxonomies and their impact on the rationality metrics assessed in our study.  

\section{Ablation Study on Category Fusion}
\label{appendix ablation study}
To examine the impact of classification granularity on four metrics, we conduct an ablation study by merging specific error categories. The specific taxonomy structures before and after fusion are detailed in the Appendix \ref{appendix ablation}. To ensure control for variability in model predictions, all results in this study are only derived from ChatGPT-4o. The experimental results are shown in Table \ref{table ablation}.

Our findings indicate that the fusion of error categories leads to a consistent increase in Coverage across all classification taxonomies. This is expected, as the newly formed parent category inherently encompasses a broader scope than its individual subcategories. By expanding the definition of error categories, previously unclassified errors are now incorporated into the taxonomy, leading to a higher coverage score.

Conversely, Balance decreases across all taxonomies after category fusion. This decline can be attributed to the inherent structure of the original taxonomies: error categories with broad definitions already contained a substantial number of samples prior to fusion. Merging smaller categories into these broader ones exacerbates the data imbalance, further skewing the error distribution. As a result, the overall balance of the taxonomy deteriorates.

The impact on Exclusivity varies depending on the specific taxonomy and the relationships between merged categories. For instance, in BRY17, the pre-fusion taxonomy contained overlapping error categories such as \textit{particle} and \textit{preposition}. By merging these, the overlap is eliminated, leading to an increase in exclusivity. However, in FEI23, pre-fusion error types such as \textit{contraction error}, \textit{spelling error}, and \textit{orthography error} were mutually exclusive and did not overlap with other categories. After merging them into the broader \textit{single-word level error}, overlaps emerged with other categories like \textit{pronoun error}, resulting in a decrease in exclusivity.

Similarly, Usability is influenced by classification granularity, as broader error categories reduce the model's ability to distinguish fine-grained errors. Merging categories weakens decision boundaries, increasing intra-category variability and making classification more ambiguous. While higher Exclusivity can enhance usability by reducing overlaps, it is not the sole factor—when fusion introduces ambiguity, usability declines due to the model's reduced classification accuracy. Our results confirm that category fusion affects usability by altering decision boundaries and classification effectiveness.

Our ablation study on category fusion demonstrates that increasing classification granularity leads to higher Coverage by broadening error definitions, but decreases Balance due to exacerbated data imbalance. The effect on Exclusivity depends on pre-fusion category overlap, improving when redundant categories are merged but declining when new overlaps emerge. The impact on Usability varies depending on how category fusion reshapes classification boundaries—some fusions improve clarity, while others introduce ambiguity that weakens classification effectiveness. Our findings highlight an important challenge in error taxonomy design: both excessive simplification and over-fragmentation can negatively impact classification taxonomies. Constructing an effective taxonomy is highly complex and cannot be achieved solely through empirical intuition, underscoring the importance of rigorous evaluation metrics in assessing classification taxonomies.
