\section*{Limitations}
One key limitation of this study is Exclusivity and Usability rely on large language models (LLMs) for computation. While our experimental results demonstrate the reasonableness of these metrics, LLMs inherently introduce biases that may lead to preferences for certain error classification frameworks over others. Future work could explore model-agnostic approaches to mitigate such biases.

Another limitation stems from the dataset scope. Our analysis is based on the W\&I+LOCNESS dataset, which, while widely used, may not fully capture the diversity of learner error patterns across different proficiency levels, native languages, and writing contexts. Extending our evaluation to more diverse datasets could improve the generalizability of our findings.
