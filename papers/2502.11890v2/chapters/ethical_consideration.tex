\section*{Ethics Statement}

We conduct our experiments using the publicly available W\&I+LOCNESS dataset, which does not contain sensitive data. All models used are also publicly available, and we have properly cited their sources. The datasets and models are utilized in accordance with their intended purposes.
For human agreement evaluation, we employed three postgraduate students specializing in foreign linguistics and applied linguistics as part-time annotators. Each annotator completed the entire annotation process within approximately 20 working hours and was compensated at a rate of \$50 per hour.
