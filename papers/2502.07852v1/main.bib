abstract = {Multi-agent collaborative perception has received increasing attention recently as an emerging application in driving scenarios. Despite advancements in previous approaches, challenges remain due to redundant communication patterns and vulnerable collaboration processes. To address these issues, we propose What2comm, an end-to-end collaborative perception framework to achieve a trade-off between perception performance and communication bandwidth. Our novelties lie in three aspects. First, we design an efficient communication mechanism based on feature decoupling to transmit exclusive and common feature maps among heterogeneous agents to provide perceptually holistic messages. Secondly, a spatio-temporal collaboration module is introduced to integrate complementary information from collaborators and temporal ego cues, leading to a robust collaboration procedure against transmission delay and localization errors. Ultimately, we propose a common-aware fusion strategy to refine final representations with informative common features. Comprehensive experiments in real-world and simulated scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of What2comm.},

abstract = {Employing Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication to enhance perception performance in self-driving technology has attracted considerable attention recently; however, the absence of a suitable open dataset for benchmarking algorithms has made it difficult to develop and assess cooperative perception technologies. To this end, we present the first large-scale open simulated dataset for Vehicle-to-Vehicle perception. It contains over 70 interesting scenes, 11,464 frames, and 232,913 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes, collected from 8 towns in CARLA and a digital town of Culver City, Los Angeles. We then construct a comprehensive benchmark with a total of 16 implemented models to evaluate several information fusion strategies (i.e. early, late, and intermediate fusion) with state-of-the-art LiDAR detection algorithms. Moreover, we propose a new Attentive Intermediate Fusion pipeline to aggregate information from multiple connected vehicles. Our experiments show that the proposed pipeline can be easily integrated with existing 3D LiDAR detectors and achieve outstanding performance even with large compression rates. To encourage more researchers to investigate Vehicle-to-Vehicle perception, we will release the dataset, benchmark methods, and all related codes in https://mobility-lab.seas.ucla.edu/opv2v/.},
