\section{Conclusion}
Humor is a highly valued human skill - with the power to teach, to entertain, and to connect. Humor is complex because generating it requires understanding human social, cultural, and emotional experiences.
In this paper, we study whether giving LLMs human-like skills for humor generation can improve its abilities to write effective humor. Since humor is often about finding relatable connections between people, we focus on generating humor for one group and type of humor: Gen Z Instagram caption humor. We run 3 studies showing that LLMs with humor skills are rated as more funny than LLMs alone, and as funny as the top-rated human-written captions. This points to a future where LLMs can potentially write with similar social skills as people to produce emotional reactions and human bonding.
