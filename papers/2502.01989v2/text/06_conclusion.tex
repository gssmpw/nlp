% \textbf{Summary}

% \textbf{Future work}
In this work, we have introduced \emph{\underline{T}est-time \underline{S}calable M\underline{C}TS-\underline{en}hanced \underline{D}iffusion Model} (T-SCEND), a novel framework that enhances the scalability of diffusion models in testing to tackle more complex tasks than in training. We demonstrate that na\"ive scaling of existing diffusion models yields marginal performance gains. To address this, we introduce two auxiliary training loss, $\l_\text{LRNCL}$ and $\l_\text{KL}$, to improve \emph{performance-energy consistency} and reduce \emph{adversarial sampling} while integrating hybrid Monte Carlo Tree Search (hMCTS) denoising to fully exploit the model's scalability in inference. We have conducted extensive experiments on Maze and Sudoku to validate the efficacy of our method and believe that T-SCEND offers a robust solution for test-time scaling, unlocking the notable potential of diffusion models. We discuss limitations and future work in Appendix \ref{app:limit_future}.
