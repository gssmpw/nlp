\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
\myifconf{This paper presents a safe hybrid control framework for car-like robots, ensuring robustness, global path convergence, and path invariance. It switches between a locally path-invariant controller and a globally convergent pure pursuit controller within a robust uniting control framework. Using motion planning, it avoids obstacles beyond a tight neighborhood. Simulations demonstrate global path invariance and safety. We have conducted experiments validating the hybrid control framework on the OSOYOO Robot Car and are currently implementing the CBF-based path-invariant controller.}{This paper proposes a safe hybrid control framework for car-like robots that guarantees robustness, global convergence to the given path, and path-invariance properties. 
% The existing controllers for AVs only guarantee path invariance when starting within a tight neighborhood of the reference path and can not avoid obstacles. 
The proposed hybrid controller switches between a locally path-invariant controller and a globally finite-time convergent pure pursuit controller following a robust uniting control framework. 
% When the car is initially outside of the neighborhood of the reference path, a collision-free auxiliary trajectory is generated connecting the initial position with the reference path and the pure pursuit controller controls the vehicle into the neighborhood in finite time. Then the local path-invariant controller takes over to ensure the robustness, stability, and path-invariance. 
By employing motion planning technology, the proposed hybrid control scheme is able to avoid collision with obstacles outside the tight neighborhood at the same time. \pn{The main result showcases the global path-invariance of the proposed hybrid control framework, thereby ensuring its safety.} Those results are demonstrated both by simulation and experiments.}
% This paper proposed a hybrid controller that makes a large class of desired paths invariant and attractive. These findings were demonstrated on a small car-like robot and gave evidence to the previous claim. 

% There are many exciting ways the work in this paper can be expanded. Implementing the Extended Kalman Filter mentioned in Section \ref{sec:results}  would improve the hybrid controller by providing smoother controls and decreasing steady-state oscillations. An interesting situation is when the unsafe set overlaps the desired path. Currently, the hybrid controller would not be able to deal with this situation. Finally, an exciting next step for this project would be implementing this algorithm on a car that estimates its state through onboard sensors rather than Optitrack. This would allow for testing in more exciting and practical environments.
