Following \cite{San2021}, a hybrid system $\mathcal{H}$ with inputs is modeled as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{H}: \left\{              
\begin{aligned}               
\dot{z} & = F(z, u)     &(z, u)\in C\\                
z^{+} & =  G(z, u)      &(z, u)\in D\\                
\end{aligned}   \right. 
\label{model:generalhybridsystem}
\end{equation}
where $z\in \reals^{n}$ is the state, $u\in \reals^{m}$ is the input, $C\subset \reals^{n}\times\reals^{m}$ is the flow set, $F: \reals^{n}\times\reals^{m} \to \reals^{n}$ is the flow map, $D\subset \reals^{n}\times\reals^{m}$ is the jump set, and $G:\reals^{n}\times\reals^{m} \to \reals^{n}$ is the jump map, respectively. The continuous evolution of $x$ is captured by the flow map $F$. The discrete evolution of $x$ is captured by the jump map $G$. The flow set $C$ collects the points where the state can evolve continuously. The jump set $D$ collects the points where jumps can occur.

% \begin{definition}[robust stability~\cite{San2021}]
% \label{def:robust-stability}
% Given a hybrid closed-loop system $\mc{H}$, a nonempty closed set $\mc{A}\subset \ms{M}$ and an open set $\mc{U}\subset \ms{M}$ such that $\mc{A} \subset \mc{U}$, the set $\mc{A}$ is said to be robustly stable for $\mc{H}$ on $\mc{U}$ if for every proper indicator function $\varpi$ of $\mc{A}$ on $\mc{U}$, every function $\beta \in \mc{KL}$ such that 
% \[
% \varpi(x(t,j)) \leq \beta(\varpi(x(0,0)), t+j)\quad \forall (t,j)\in\dom x 
% \]
% for the solutions to $\mc{H}$ from $\mc{U}$, and every continuous function 
% $\rho^{*}:\ms{M} \to \Real_{\geq 0}$ that is positive on $\mc{U} \setminus \mc{A}$, the following holds: for each compact set $K \subset \mc{U}$ and each $\epsilon >0$, there exists $\delta^{*} >0$ such that for each solution {$x_{\rho}$} the perturbed system $\mc{H}_{\rho}$ with $\rho = \delta^{*}\rho^{*}$, starting from $x_{\rho}(0,0) \in K$ satisfies 
% $$
% \varpi(x_{\rho}(t,j)) \leq \beta(\varpi(x_{\rho}(0,0)), t+j)+ \epsilon \quad   \forall (t,j)\in\dom x_{\rho}.
