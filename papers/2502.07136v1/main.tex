\begin{abstract}
% In this work, we design a hybrid control scheme to navigate an unmanned ground vehicle to the given path starting from everywhere in the output space while ensuring path invariance. In the context of this paper, the path-invariance property guarantees that once the vehicle reaches the path, it remains on that path precisely and indefinitely. To achieve this, we develop a locally path-invariant controller that guarantees path invariance when initiated within the neighborhood of the path. To complement this, a pure pursuit controller is employed for navigation from arbitrary starting points within the output space to the aforementioned neighborhood. 
% These two controllers are integrated within a unified hybrid framework, facilitating convergence from any location in the output space to the target path, with guaranteed path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. The hybrid controller's effectiveness is rigorously demonstrated through practical experiments on the OSOYOO Robot Car.

% In this work, we introduce a hybrid control scheme for an unmanned ground vehicle, ensuring global path invariance. In the context of this paper, global path invariance property guarantees that, from any starting point in the output space, once the vehicle reaches the path, it precisely and indefinitely stays on that path. We develop a locally path-invariant controller for maintaining path following within the path's neighborhood, supplemented by a pure pursuit controller for navigation from arbitrary starting points to the neighborhood. These controllers are seamlessly integrated into a unified hybrid framework, ensuring convergence from any output space location to the desired path, while guaranteeing path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Experimental validation is conducted on the OSOYOO Robot Car, affirming the hybrid controller's effectiveness.

% This work proposes a hybrid framework for car-like robots with obstacle avoidance, global convergence, and safety, where safety is defined as path invariance—once the robot reaches the path, it never leaves. Given an a \textit{priori} obstacle-free feasible path with surrounding obstacles, the goal is to avoid obstacles, reach the path, and stay on it. The problem is addressed in two stages. Firstly, a ``tight'' obstacle-free neighborhood is defined along the path, with a local controller ensuring convergence and path invariance. Control barrier functions are used to steer the system away from singularities where the local controller is undefined. Secondly, a hybrid control framework integrates this local controller with any global tracking controller from the literature (without path invariance guarantees) to ensure global convergence. This framework guarantees path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Detailed simulations \myifconf{affirm}{and experimental validation on the OSOYOO Robot Car affirm} the scheme’s effectiveness.
This work proposes a hybrid framework for car-like robots with obstacle avoidance, global convergence, and safety, where safety is interpreted as path invariance, namely, once the robot converges to the path, it never leaves the path. Given \textit{a priori}  obstacle-free feasible path where obstacles can be around the path, the task is to avoid obstacles while reaching the path and then staying on the path without leaving it. The problem is solved in two stages. Firstly, we define a ``tight'' obstacle-free neighborhood along the path and design a local controller to ensure convergence to the path and path invariance. The control barrier function technology is involved in the control design to steer the system away from its singularity points, where the local path invariant controller is not defined. Secondly, we design a \mynne{hybrid control} framework that integrates this local path-invariant controller with any global tracking controller from the existing literature without path invariance guarantee, ensuring convergence from any position to the desired path, namely, global convergence. This framework guarantees path invariance and robustness to sensor noise. Detailed simulation results\myifconf{ affirm}{ and experimental validation on the OSOYOO Robot Car affirm} the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
