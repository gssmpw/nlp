\section{conclusions}

In this paper, we propose the Context-Aware Interest Network (CAIN) to incorporate context information from adjacent items in lifelong sequential modeling (LSM). The proposed CAIN is the first model in the field to integrate the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) \cite{bai2018empirical}, achieving efficient and fast context extraction throughout the lifelong sequence. Building on this framework, we introduce the Multi-Scope Interest Aggregator (MSIA) module, which contains multiple stacked TCN layers and their corresponding attention modules to extract and combine context-aware interest representations across various context scopes. Additionally, we propose the Personalized Extractor Generation (PEG) module to generate convolution filters for individual users, replacing the global filters in the TCN layers to achieve more user-specific responses. 

We conducted experiments on both public and industrial datasets. The results demonstrate that CAIN outperforms previous LSM methods on both datasets. Furthermore, we conducted online A/B testing, where CAIN significantly outperformed the initial baseline. CAIN now serves as the new baseline on our platform. For future work, we aim to explore ways to combine more context extractors and include context information to enhance the representation of candidate items as well.
