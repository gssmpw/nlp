% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
