\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented UniDB, a unified diffusion bridge framework based on stochastic optimal control principles, offering a novel perspective on diffusion bridges. Through this framework, we unify and extend existing diffusion bridge models with Doob's $h$-transform like DDBMs and GOUB. Moreover, we demonstrate that the diffusion bridge with Doob's $h$-transform can be viewed as a specific case within UniDB when the terminal penalty coefficient approaches infinity. This insight helps elucidate why Doob's $h$-transform may lead to suboptimal image restoration, often resulting in blurred or distorted details. By simply adjusting this terminal penalty coefficient, UniDB achieves a marked improvement in image quality with minimal code modifications. Our experimental results underscore UniDB’s superiority and versatility across various image processing tasks, particularly in enhancing image details for more realistic outputs. Despite these advantages, UniDB, like other standard diffusion bridge models, faces the challenge of computationally intensive sampling processes, especially with high-resolution images or complex restoration tasks. Future work will focus on developing strategies to accelerate the sampling process, enhancing UniDB’s practicality, particularly for real-time applications.
