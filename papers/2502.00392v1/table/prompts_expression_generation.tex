You are supplied with three sentences that \textbf{caption} the image, along with additional data about specific attributes of objects within the image. This can include information about \textbf{categories, colors, and precise coordinates}. Such coordinates, represented as floating-point numbers that range from 0 to 1, are shared as center points, denoted as (x, y), identifying the center x and y. When coordinate x tends to 0, the object nears the left side of the image, shifting towards the right as coordinate x approaches 1. When coordinate y tends to 0, the object nears the top of the image, shifting towards the bottom as coordinate y approaches 1. \\
            
Your task is to classify the provided objects based on various characteristics, while also substantiating your classification. This classification should be thoroughly justified, with criteria including but not limited to relationships or relative locations of objects.\\

To refer to a specific object, use the provided coordinates directly. Base your classification justifications on direct observations from the image, avoiding any hypothesizing or assumptions.\var{"""}\}\\
