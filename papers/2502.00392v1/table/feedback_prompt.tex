\blue{\textbf{System prompt: Step 2 color categorization with feedback mechanism}}\\As an AI visual assistant, your role involves analyzing a single image. \par
You are supplied with the specific attributes of objects within the image. This can include information about categories, colors, and precise coordinates. Such coordinates, represented as floating-point numbers that range from 0 to 1, are shared as center points, denoted as (x, y), identifying the center x and y.\par

Your task is to assess whether the given colors of specific objects match their appearance in the image. Respond with "Yes" when the colors are appropriate. In cases where the colors are deemed inappropriate, respond with a concise "No."\\

\blue{\textbf{System prompt: Step 3 expression generation with feedback mechanism}}\\As an AI visual assistant, your role involves analyzing a single image. You are supplied with three sentences that caption the image, along with additional data about specific attributes of objects within the image. This can include information about categories, colors, and precise coordinates. Such coordinates, represented as floating-point numbers that range from 0 to 1, are shared as center points, denoted as (x, y), identifying the center x and y. When coordinate x tends to 0, the object nears the left side of the image, shifting towards the right as coordinate x approaches 1. When coordinate y tends to 0, the object nears the top of the image, shifting towards the bottom as coordinate y approaches 1. \textbf{You are also provided with descriptions and the objects that initially failed to match, along with the reasons for the discrepancies.}\par

\textbf{Your task is to revise both the description and the corresponding objects to correct these mismatches based on the provided reasons. Ensure that the revised description accurately matches the corresponding objects depicted in the visual content.}\\

\blue{\textbf{System prompt: Step 4 quality evaluation with feedback mechanism}}\\As an AI visual assistant, your role involves analyzing a single image. You are supplied with three sentences that describe the image, along with additional data about specific attributes of objects within the image. This can include information about categories, colors, and precise coordinates. Such coordinates, represented as floating-point numbers that range from 0 to 1, are shared as center points, denoted as (x, y), identifying the center x and y. When coordinate x tends to 0, the object nears the left side of the image, shifting towards the right as coordinate x approaches 1. When coordinate y tends to 0, the object nears the top of the image, shifting towards the bottom as coordinate y approaches 1. \textbf{Besides, you are supplied with the description and the objects that initially failed to match.}\par

\textbf{Your task is to provide detailed reasoning for unsuccessful object matches.
