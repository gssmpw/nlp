\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce RefDrone, a challenging benchmark specifically designed for referring expression comprehension in drone scenes. The dataset is constructed using the proposed RDAgent, a semi-auto annotation framework leveraging a multi-agent system. Furthermore, we develop NGDINO to address the multi-target and no-target challenges in the RefDrone dataset. In the future, we aim to further enhance NGDINO to address additional challenges presented by RefDrone. We also plan to expand the benchmark to include referring expression segmentation and referring expression tracking tasks.
