\section{Conclusion}
State-of-the-art compressed swap schemes to manage limited main memory capacity on mobile devices lead to prolonged application relaunch latency and high CPU usage. To address this problem, we introduced a new compressed swap scheme for mobile devices, called \proposal.
\proposal leverages different compression chunk sizes based on the hotness level of the data, while also performing speculative decompression based on data locality characteristics to improve the performance of compressed swap schemes.
We implement and evaluate \proposal on a real commercial smartphone with a cutting-edge Android operating system. Our experimental evaluation results show that \proposal surpasses the state-of-the-art swap scheme in both application relaunch latency and CPU usage.
