\begin{abstract}
Multi-view object tracking (MVOT) offers promising solutions to challenges such as occlusion and target loss, which are common in traditional single-view tracking. However, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive multi-view datasets and effective cross-view integration methods. To overcome these limitations, we compiled a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew object \textbf{Track}ing (MVTrack) dataset of 234K high-quality annotated frames featuring 27 distinct objects across various scenes. In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT method, \textbf{M}ulti-View \textbf{I}ntegration \textbf{Tracker} (MITracker), to efficiently integrate multi-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can track any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints. The key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come from two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature volume and compresses it into a birdâ€™s eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating inter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that leverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the tracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the MVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code and the new dataset will be available at \href{https://mii-laboratory.github.io/MITracker/}{mii-laboratory.github.io/MITracker}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we address key challenges such as occlusion and target loss in MVOT by making two significant contributions: (1) MVTrack, a comprehensive dataset with 234K high-quality annotations across diverse scenes and object categories, and (2) MITracker, a novel visual tracking method that effectively integrates multi-view object features. MITracker achieves SOTA results on MVTrack and GMTD datasets, demonstrating its ability to provide stable and reliable tracking across different viewpoints and video durations. Our contributions lay the foundation for future advancements in MVOT, enabling the development of more robust and accurate tracking systems for real-world scenarios.
