\section{Conclusion}
In this survey, we provide a systematic review of efficient diffusion models, an important area of research aimed at democratizing diffusion models.
%
We start with motivating the necessity for efficient diffusion models. Guided by a taxonomy, we review efficient techniques for diffusion models from algorithm-level and system-level perspectives respectively.
%
Furthermore, we review diffusion models frameworks with specific optimizations and features crucial for efficient diffusion models.
%
We believe that efficiency will play an increasingly important role in diffusion models and diffusion models-oriented systems. 
%
We hope this survey could enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started in this field and act as a catalyst to inspire new research on efficient diffusion models.
