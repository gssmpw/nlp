\caption{Representative samples from the one multiclass classification dataset used in this study, ElecDev. Three randomly selected instances per class are shown to illustrate the characteristic patterns and variability between classes. If datasets had labels not starting from 0, they were remapped to start from 0 (ranging from 0 to $C-1$), preserving the existing order.}\label{fig:samples_multiclass}
