\begin{abstract}
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics.
However, the domain of physics reasoning %, foundational to the natural sciences,
presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMsâ€™ abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation.
To fill this gap, we introduce {\benchmark}, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate \textbf{U}nder\textbf{G}raduate-level \textbf{Physics} (\textbf{\benchmark}) reasoning with LLMs.
{\benchmark} includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage.
Additionally, we develop a \textbf{M}odel-\textbf{A}ssistant \textbf{R}ule-based \textbf{J}udgment (\textbf{{\judge}}) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation.
%To better understand the skill sets required for solving different physics problems, we categorize them into four distinct difficulty levels based on the abilities necessary to solve them.
Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8\% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities.
We hope {\benchmark}, along with {\judge}, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning.
Codes and data are available at \href{https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/UGPhysics}{this link}.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper introduces an undergraduate-level physics benchmark aimed at advancing AI capabilities in physics problem-solving. 
Future directions include incorporating problems with images to enable multi-modal evaluation or more language to facilitate multi-lingual assessment.
