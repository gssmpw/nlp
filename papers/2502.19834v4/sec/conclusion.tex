\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a novel MMC challenge and introduce a training-free MMC pipeline called `Knowledge Bridger' based on LMM. Our findings demonstrate that LMM can autonomously mine knowledge across modalities and leverage this structured knowledge to enhance the accuracy of missing modality generation and ranking. Furthermore, experimental results indicate that as the model's parameter scale increases, our method shows improved knowledge extraction capabilities.
