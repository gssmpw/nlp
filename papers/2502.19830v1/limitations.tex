\section*{Limitations}
While our approach advances the understanding and application of self-consistency, several limitations remain:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item Task Scope: Experiments focus on mathematical reasoning tasks, thus generalization to broader domains (e.g., open-ended generation or multi-step decision-making) requires further validation.
    \item Optimal Temperature: The specific value of the optimal temperature when the sample size approaches infinity, and how it varies with factors such as the model and dataset, remains unexplored.
    \item  Decoding Strategy Interactions: The interplay between temperature modulation and other decoding techniques (e.g., top-k or top-p sampling) remains unexplored, potentially affecting broader applicability.
\end{itemize}
