\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}
\begin{comment}
We introduce HALO, a framework that enhances LLM inference efficiency through timing-aware and weight-sensitive quantization. HALO strategically selects and quantizes weights to reduce power consumption and critical path delays, leveraging circuit-level insights. This enables efficient dynamic frequency or voltage scaling while maintaining compatibility with existing hardware architectures. HALO offers a flexible, hardware-aware approach for power-efficient neural network acceleration, supporting scalable and sustainable LLM deployments across diverse platforms.
