\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}

This section compares the presented survey with other works discussing network intrusion detection datasets. While data-specific NID surveys (this paper) are rare, general NID surveys often include datasets as well. Naturally, they typically lack detailed discussion on data-specific topics yet still provide a relevant reference point for many readers. We thus compare our work to those focused explicitly on NID data and five general surveys with data-related sections, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:related_work_comparison}. Based on the related work analysis, we conclude that our paper:

The closest study to ours, and its inspiration in many aspects, is the work by Ring et al.____. Considered one of the first surveys on NID data, it formalized data properties, compared existing datasets, and provided data-related recommendations. However, since it was published in 2019, it does not include newer datasets. Our study builds on this work by refining some established properties (e.g., removing the data balance property, as NID data are naturally imbalanced) and incorporating newly released datasets. We also introduce sections on data limitations and trends to address recent findings and emphasize data quality, aiming to provide a holistic view of NID data.

The work of Kenyon et al.____ also overlaps with our paper, as it looks at NID data from different perspectives. The paper discusses various data properties and limitations, compares 34 datasets, and closes with recommendations for NID datasets. In contrast, our study covers more datasets with detailed properties in an SLR-based approach, as well as discusses dataset popularity to better aid in selecting suitable data.

Although Hindy et al.____ cover aspects similar to this paper, they primarily focus on the network threat landscape and its relation to 21 NID datasets (until 2018). The study further discusses NIDS algorithms' and datasets' popularity, threat taxonomy, IDS limitations, and recommendations for future research. In contrast, our study includes more datasets, compares them by their properties rather than by attacks, and provides a more detailed discussion of NID data-related aspects.

Yang et al.____ conducted an SLR on the NID domain as a whole, highlighting popular ML-based methods and datasets for benchmarking. Although not explicitly data-focused, the study presents the largest published dataset list at the time (52), compares them, and analyzes their popularity, with KDD\textquotesingle99 and NSL-KDD coming as the most popular. In contrast, our SLR specifically focuses on the data, listing more datasets and elaborating on data-specific topics absent in Yang et al.'s work.

As mentioned in Section~\ref{ssec:meth_scope}, our survey focuses on network intrusion datasets regardless of the environment, with the key condition being that the data must be captured from the network. Therefore, we exclude IDS datasets where most of the data originates from non-network sources like end-host devices or sensors, as typical for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Internet of Things (IoT) datasets. Although relevant for environment-specific intrusion detection, we consider such datasets out-of-scope. For this reason, we recommend exploring other, more specialized surveys for data in specific areas. For instance, Conti et al.____ and Koay et al.____ review ICS testbeds and datasets, whereas IoT-specific datasets are covered by Keersmaeker et al.____ and Kaur et al.____.
