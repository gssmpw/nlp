    \caption{\textbf{Both wave-biased and standard local recurrent models learn traveling wave dynamics to integrate spatial information.} Visualization of a subset  of the LSTM and NWM hidden state evolution after training (top) for a given image (left). We see waves propagate over the timesteps throughout the shape. On the bottom we plot the associated pixel-wise learned linear projection of the hidden state time-dynamics and observe individual shapes appear to pop out in different learned dimensions. }
