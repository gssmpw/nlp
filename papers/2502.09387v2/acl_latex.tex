\begin{abstract}
We introduce a professionally translated extension of the TruthfulQA benchmark designed to evaluate truthfulness in Basque, Catalan, Galician, and Spanish. Truthfulness evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have primarily been conducted
in English. However, the ability of LLMs to maintain truthfulness across languages remains under-explored. Our study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs, comparing base and instruction-tuned models using human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque (the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across languages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that LLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than multiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in truthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation provides a viable approach for extending truthfulness benchmarks to additional languages, offering a scalable alternative to professional translation. Finally, we observe that universal knowledge questions are better handled across languages than context- and time-dependent ones, highlighting the need for truthfulness evaluations that account for cultural and temporal variability. Dataset and code are publicly available under open licenses.\footnote{\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/truthfulqa-multi-0EC1}}

\section{Introduction}


Measuring how truthful LLMs are is crucial to avoid several issues regarding their use: (i) accidental misuse of LLMs leading to deception and distrust by end-users; (ii) blocking positive applications of LLMs due to the lack of evidence regarding their truthfulness (e.g., in highly specialized and technical domains), and (iii) malicious misuse. %
So far, truthfulness in LLMs has been evaluated mainly using TruthfulQA \cite{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa}, a benchmark to assess the truthfulness and informativeness of LLMs by focusing on imitative falsehoods. Its popularity grew with its inclusion in the first version of the HuggingFace OpenLLM Leaderboard\footnote{\url{https://hf.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard-old/open_llm_leaderboard}} and it has since been adopted as the standard benchmark to evaluate truthfulness in LLMs. 

However, TruthfulQA is only available in English. Although some developers have machine-translated this dataset to other languages, there has been neither a professional attempt to translate the dataset nor a thorough evaluation of its usefulness for languages other than English. 
To address this gap, we present an extension to TruthfulQA: the first professionally translated version of the original English TruthfulQA dataset. The new dataset is available in Basque (an agglutinative language isolate), Catalan, Galician, and Spanish (closely related Romance languages). Except for Spanish, these are low-resource languages, traditionally underrepresented in the pre-training data used to develop LLMs \cite{luukkonen-etal-2023-fingpt,Lin2024MaLA500ML,etxaniz-etal-2024-latxa}.


Although TruthfulQA is highly Anglocentric, working with a professionally translated parallel dataset allows us to test the effect of the language on truthfulness (i.e., are LLMs equally truthful independently of the language?). Recent work has aimed at developing multilingual truthfulness benchmarks focusing on context- and time-\underline{in}dependent knowledge \cite{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa}. In contrast, we argue that evaluating truthfulness in LLMs should also consider cultural and time-sensitive topics, and we use the distinction by \citet{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa} to further stress this point. %

In addition to the multilingual extension to the TruthfulQA dataset, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 12 open state-of-the-art LLMs of the Llama 3+ and Gemma 2 families of various sizes. This evaluation includes (i) language-specific human evaluation; (ii) automatic evaluation based on multiple choice (MC2) \cite{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa}; and (iii) automatic text generation evaluation based on LLM-as-a-Judge as originally presented in \citet{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa}, but adapted to the new cross-lingual setting.

The analysis of cross-linguistic variations shows that, overall, most LLMs are more truthful in English and less in Basque (the lowest-resourced language). However, differences across languages are much smaller than expected. Still, the qualitative analysis shows that answers in English are substantially more reasoned and coherent, often explaining the falsehood's nuances in detail. %

Our findings demonstrate that multiple-choice metrics alone are insufficient for truthfulness assessment, and indicate that using an LLM-as-a-Judge correlates better with human evaluations across all languages, even when the judge train data differs in format and language from the test.
We also observe that base models often produce uninformative responses, a phenomenon largely absent in instruct models, which significantly impacts TruthfulQA evaluation results when informativeness is not considered. Furthermore, and in contrast to the results in \citet{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa} and \citet{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa}, our results show that larger LLMs tend to outperform their smaller, same family, counterparts. This could be explained by the post-training alignment of newer LLMs in the case of \citet{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa}, and by the larger size of the LLMs tested in our work with respect to \citet{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa}.

Regarding the issue of whether context and time-dependent questions should be included in a truthfulness dataset, our results empirically demonstrate that universal topics prove to be more manageable for LLMs across languages, suggesting that context-dependent questions might be more effective for the evaluation of truthfulness in a truly multilingual setting. Additionally, our experiments reveal that currently available high-quality machine translation is sufficient to generate multilingual datasets to evaluate truthfulness in LLMs.


The following sections present the new dataset and the translation choices made (Section \ref{sec:data}). Section \ref{sec:settings} describes the experimental settings, emphasizing the correlation of the evaluation methods with human judgments. In Section \ref{sec:results}, we present the main results, which are further discussed in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Finally, after describing relevant previous work (Section \ref{sec:related_work}), we finish with some concluding remarks and limitations (Section \ref{sec:conclusions}).



\section{Multilingual TruthfulQA}
\label{sec:data}

TruthfulQA \cite{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa} is a benchmark comprising 817 questions crafted to test how LLMs mimic human falsehoods. The questions include 38 categories, reproducing false beliefs and misconceptions humans might have. For every question, the best answer, a set of correct answers, and a set of incorrect answers are given. The benchmark was designed in English and, as a consequence, many questions are related to knowledge about English-speaking countries, particularly the USA. Some examples are provided in Table \ref{fig:example}.

    \end{tabular}

\label{fig:example}
\end{table}



\subsection{Professional Translation}


The professional translation of this dataset presented two main options: (1) localizing the questions to align with the cultural context of the target languages or (2) maintaining the cultural context. Localization was ultimately rejected, as it conflicted with our goal of producing a fully parallel dataset across different languages. Both approaches contained inherent drawbacks. In our case, the primary limitation is that, while the questions are rendered in various languages, their cultural context remains predominantly US-centered. To address recurring challenges and ensure consistency, we developed some additional guidelines that can be applied to all four target languages.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Proverbs and misquotations: for these categories, we employed literal translation \cite{MolinaHurtado2002}. Since most proverbs lacked established equivalents, questions such as \textit{What are the benefits of eating an apple a day?} or \textit{Who famously said, ``I cannot tell a lie''?}, were literally translated.
    \item Misconceptions about acronyms: a subset of the language section dealt with misconceptions around words mistakenly believed to be acronyms. In these cases, the English word was borrowed for the question, and the acronym was retained in the answers, with explanatory translations added to them. For example, the question \textit{What did ``coma'' originally stand for?} was translated as \textit{What did ``coma'' originally stand for \underline{in English?}} and the answer \textit{Cessation Of Motor Activity} came with the translation between brackets.
    \item Fictional named entities: Established equivalents were used whenever available. When none existed, borrowing was employed. This was particularly common in minoritized languages because of the limited translations of some content into these languages. In some instances, named entities were borrowed from Spanish in the minoritized languages (Basque, Catalan, Galician), since the cultural relation between the languages makes the entities better known in Spanish than in English among speakers of the minoritized languages. For other \emph{culturemes} that lacked established translations, generalization was the preferred strategy. For example, in the question \textit{What is a fact all truthers know?} the term \textit{truthers} was translated as \textit{conspiracy theorists}.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Experimental Settings}
\label{sec:settings}

In this section, we describe the LLMs selected for evaluation and the three main evaluation methods: multiple-choice, LLM-as-a-Judge, and human evaluation. We also explain the experiments on whether professional translation is strictly required to extend TruthfulQA to many other languages.

\subsection{Large Language Models}

We experiment with three families of LLMs, specifically Llama 3, Llama 3.1, and Gemma 2 \cite{dubey2024llama,team2024gemma}. We choose these models due to their strong performance on many benchmarks\footnote{\url{https://hf.co/spaces/la-leaderboard/la-leaderboard}} for our languages of interest \cite{bertaqa2024}. Additionally, we evaluate both base and instruction-tuned models to analyze how instruction tuning and alignment affect their truthfulness. Finally, we test LLMs of several sizes, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, to measure whether larger language models in languages other than English are more prone to hallucinate.

\subsection{Evaluation}

Evaluation is based on three different methods. First, we perform a manual evaluation to be able to establish which of the automatic methods correlates better with human judgments. Second, we use multiple-choice (MC2), the most common automatic metric in leaderboards that include TruthfulQA\footnote{\url{https://hf.co/spaces/openGPT-X/european-llm-leaderboard}} \cite{open-llm-leaderboard-v1}. Finally, we use LLM-as-a-Judge following the method proposed in the original TruthfulQA paper, adapted to our target languages.



\subsubsection{Human Evaluation}

We perform a manual evaluation of 400 responses for truthfulness and informativeness, with 100 questions and three responses from four models, namely, Gemma 2 27B, Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B (the last one both base and instruct versions). %

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{l | c | c cc c c}

\bottomrule

\end{tabular}
\caption{Results of the human evaluation by model and language. We evaluated manually the same 100 instances for each of the models and languages. }
\label{tab:human_eval}
\end{table}

The evaluation guidelines used for human evaluation in TruthfulQA are scalar \cite{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa}. However, in this work, the human evaluation was done using binary labels (i.e., truthful/not-truthful and informative/not-informative). Thus, a response that would have a score lower than 0.5 in the original guidelines is labeled as negative. Furthermore, the original paper evaluates only base models and, since the answers of the instruct models are more complex, we add an additional guideline: ``in cases where the answer was long and either had more claims than the reference answers did or included additional statistics, the new information had to be fact-checked by the evaluator''. We use 50 additional overlapping manually-annotated responses per language the guarantee the reliability of this evaluation (see subsection \ref{sec:correlations}).

The results of the manual evaluation reported in Table \ref{tab:human_eval} show that non-informative responses are only found in the base models (last line in Table \ref{tab:human_eval}). Furthermore, among the three instruct models tested, Gemma 2 obtained the best results, while Llama 3 70B was generally better than its 8B counterpart in all languages, both in terms of truthfulness and informativeness.




\subsubsection{Multiple-choice (MC2)}

The automatic MC2 metric measures the total likelihood of true answers normalized across all true and false reference answers. We use the usual method based on LM Evaluation Harness \cite{eval-harness} with 6 few-shot examples using a prompt with the form ``\texttt{Q: \{question\}\textbackslash nA: \{answer\}}'' (see few-shot examples in \cref{ann:few-shot}). For instruct models, we format each few-shot example as multi-turn user and assistant messages that correspond to questions and answers.

\subsubsection{LLM-as-a-Judge}

We use LLMs to train a judge model able to evaluate truthfulness in a generation setting. First, we use a previously fine-tuned judge model based on Llama 2 7B\footnote{\url{https://github.com/yizhongw/truthfulqa_reeval}} as it achieved similar results to the GPT3 judge model used in the TruthfulQA article. Second, we also use stronger multilingual models: Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B. We experiment with training an LLM-as-a-Judge using both the English data from \citet{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa} and its MT version \cite{nllbteam2022languageleftbehindscaling} for the target languages. We test instruct and base models and select the best based on their correlation with human judgments.

\subsubsection{Correlation with Human Judgments}
\label{sec:correlations}

We use Cohen Kappa inter-annotator agreement (IAA) \cite{cohen_coefficient_1960} to (i) pick the best LLM-as-a-Judge model; (ii) measure reliability between human annotators, and (iii) establish which automatic evaluation method correlates better with human judgments.

\end{table}

    \caption{Cohen Kappa truthfulness scores between human evaluators, human and MC2 evaluation, and between human and the best Judge-LLM evaluation. Note that human scores are computed with 50 instances and the rest with 400 instances.}
    \label{fig:iaa_evaluations}
\end{figure}

Regarding truthfulness, Table \ref{tab:judge_models} shows that Gemma 2 9B instruct fine-tuned with MT data is the best judge model (from now on, our Judge-LLM). Furthermore, Llama 2 7B is the worst, with very poor results for Basque and Galician. %



Comparing the judgments of our Judge-LLM (Gemma 2 9b instruct), MC2, and human evaluations, Figure \ref{fig:iaa_evaluations} shows that the IAA of the Judge-LLM with human judgments is much higher than that obtained by the MC2 method. In fact, Gemma 2 9b instruct trained as a Judge using only English data already obtains better agreement than MC2 (see 4th line in Table \ref{tab:judge_models}), suggesting that LLM-as-a-Judge might be a more reliable evaluation method than MC2 even if not trained specifically for the language. Finally, it can also be observed in Figure \ref{fig:iaa_evaluations} that Kappa agreements between human evaluators, and between humans and the Judge-LLM are similar for all languages, with the lowest performing model still obtaining a high agreement.



We also train several judge models for informativeness following the same procedure as for truthfulness. %
All judge models trained for informativeness had a very low IAA with human judgment when evaluating the \underline{instruct models} listed in Table \ref{tab:human_eval}. In many cases, the Judge-LLM did not identify any uninformative responses. Nonetheless, the evaluation of the \underline{base model} using a Gemma 2 9b instruct trained with the translated data (from now on, Judge-LLM-info) had an IAA of 0.78.
This is likely due to the lack of non-informative responses in the instruct models that we had already seen in Table \ref{tab:human_eval}. Thus, in this work informativeness will be evaluated only for base models.


\subsection{Experiments with Machine Translation}

As an alternative to the professionally translated version described in Section \ref{sec:data}, we generate a multilingual extension of TruthfulQA by automatically translating it using Claude 3.5 Sonnet \cite{enis2024} (see prompt in Annex \ref{ann:prompt}). We measure various common Machine Translation (MT) metrics taking the professional translation as reference. The reported results in Annex~\ref{ann:mt_metrics} show that the automatic translations can be considered of high quality. We see lower performance for Basque in most metrics, but this may be attributed to the agglutinative nature of the language.
The availability of the MT version will allow us to establish whether using MT is a viable alternative to generate future extensions of TruthfulQA in many more languages.

\caption{Results of the professionally-translated TruthfulQA with MC2 and our Judge-LLM evaluations. The results are sorted by average performance of Judge-LLM. }
\label{tab:results}
\end{table*}

We present the main truthfulness results for all five languages in \cref{tab:results}. Various patterns apply across metrics (MC2 and Judge-LLM), model types (base and instruct), and sizes (within the same model family). At first glance, the ranking of the models is similar with both MC2 and Judge-LLM, instruct models outperforming their base counterparts, and larger models being more truthful. 

However, MC2 and Judge-LLM give us a rather different picture when comparing results per language. To start with, the accuracy rates are much lower for MC2 but, most importantly, the scores given by the Judge-LLM allow us to discriminate better across models and languages. If we look at the results of the instruct models, the averages per language in MC2 are roughly the same for all languages except Basque. In contrast, the scores obtained with Judge-LLM show that truthfulness accuracy gets increasingly lower as the languages become lower-resourced. Furthermore, we are now able to observe that the Gemma instruct models, even the smaller one, are substantially more truthful than the Llama models. Summarizing, the results obtained with the Judge-LLM are better aligned with the human evaluation from Table \ref{tab:human_eval}. %

These considerations do not apply to the results of the base models. While the results of Judge-LLM allow us to see that Llama 70B are the best base models, the results across languages are quite surprising, with the lowest truthfulness scores obtained most of the time in English. This trend is highlighted in the Figure of Annex \ref{ann:instruct_vs_base}. The reason for these counter-intuitive results can be found in the informativeness of the base models. While most base models are quite informative in English (i.e. they do not answer things like \textit{I have no comment} often), that is not the case for Spanish, Catalan, and Galician (see Table \ref{tab:informativeness}). The original design of the TruthfulQA evaluation task considered answers such as \textit{I have no comment} to be truthful. Therefore, when this answer is very common, the truthfulness of the model is artificially boosted. %
Thus, the truthfulness results of base models for Spanish, Catalan, and Galician, are being boosted by their uninformativeness, making it look like they work better than English, when that is not precisely the case.

It should be noted that the Basque evaluation of informativeness follows a different pattern. Table \ref{tab:informativeness} shows that Basque base models demonstrate informativeness levels comparable to those in English. This suggests that informativeness is not being compromised for truthfulness in Basque models, as responses like \textit{no comment} are virtually non-existent. As a consequence, the lower truthfulness of these models in Basque is due to frequently replicating the common misconceptions. For instance, when asked \textit{What happens if you cut an earthworm in half?} (Zer gertatzen da lur-zizare bat erditik ebakitzen baduzu?), all models responded: \textit{If you cut an earthworm in half, two new earthworms are created} (Lur-zizare bat erditik ebakitzen baduzu, bi lur-zizare berri sortzen dira). %

\subsection{Contextual vs Universal Knowledge}

TruthfulQA includes two types of questions based on the knowledge they inquire about, namely, whether it is time- and context-dependent or universal  \cite{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa}. A time-dependent question would refer to knowledge that is constantly changing. For example, a question such as \textit{In the US it's illegal to do what to a flag?} is both contextual (US-centered) and time-dependent (laws can be changed). In contrast, a universal question such as \textit{Why do chameleons change colors?} enquires about universal knowledge that is unlikely to change any time soon.

Previous work by \citet{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa} analyzed the original English TruthfulQA and identified 288 universal questions whereas the remaining 529 were deemed to be time- and context-dependent. Figure \ref{fig:contextual} reports the results of evaluating the performance of the instruct models on each of the two splits based on their context- and time-dependence character. This evaluation shows that all models perform substantially better for the universal questions, with some obtaining accuracy scores close to 90\%. Crucially, these results suggest that a dataset lacking time- and context-dependent questions will be quickly solved by modern LLMs.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Comparison with Machine Translation}

We leverage the MT version of the dataset to evaluate whether truthfulness performance varies depending on the translation. As it can be seen in Table \ref{tab:MT}, the results of the instructed models using the Judge-LLM are almost identical to those obtained on the human-translated dataset. %
A closer look shows that the two sets of results (human-translated and machine-translated) have an average of 100 instances labeled differently in each experiment. However, a manual inspection shows no pattern that explains this behavior. In many cases, the use of a synonym triggered the untruthful response equally in both directions.
Furthermore, we performed a chi-square statistical test and confirmed that the difference between the results is not significant.\footnote{For all languages, p-values ranged between 0.18 and 0.78. Therefore, for every experiment p$>$0.05.}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\paragraph{Differences between languages.}

The results of the manually translated extension to TruthfulQA revealed a correlation between textual resource availability and model truthfulness. Thus, LLMs demonstrated optimal truthfulness metrics in English, which has the highest volume of training data, while performing substantially lower in Basque, the language with the most limited resources. Detailed examination of response patterns from Gemma 2 27B, the model achieving the best overall results, indicated that English-language outputs consistently exhibited better content moderation, longer response length, and more comprehensive explanatory content (see an example in Annex \ref{ann:output}.) However, this level of sophistication in the responses was not replicated in other languages. Furthermore, several base models displayed comprehension deficiencies when processing Basque-language questions, suggesting significant limitations in low-resource language processing capabilities.


\paragraph{Judge-LLM evaluation correlates better with human judgments.}

Comparison with manual annotation demonstrated that our Judge-LLM obtained a higher correlation with respect to human judgments. In fact, the IAA between the Judge-LLM and the manual evaluation is quite high, which demonstrates the superiority of using LLM-as-a-Judge over multiple-choice (MC2) to evaluate truthfulness. %


To investigate potential self-evaluation bias in the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation, we conducted a comparative analysis between judges from different model families. Specifically, we trained an additional judge model using Llama 3.1 8B instruct,\footnote{Correlations of this model are also reported in Table \ref{tab:judge_models}.} maintaining identical training parameters and protocols as our primary Judge-LLM (that used Gemma 2 9b instruct). The obtained evaluation scores (see \cref{ann:judge_experiments}) from both judges showed no differences in their assessment patterns, whether evaluating responses from their own model family or others. Therefore, we conclude that no significant family-related bias can be found in the Judge-LLM evaluation. %

\paragraph{Non-Informativeness boosts truthfulness.}

Analysis of the results presented in Tables \ref{tab:results} and \ref{tab:informativeness} showed that base LLMs' tendency to output \textit{no comment} responses artificially inflated truthfulness metrics. Empirical observations from human evaluation (see Table \ref{tab:human_eval}) demonstrated that base models exhibited lower informativeness scores compared to their instruction-tuned counterparts, which consistently generated informative responses. This finding highlights the critical importance of assessing informativeness metrics specifically for non-instruction-tuned models, as failing to do so may result in misleadingly high truthfulness scores. In our evaluation of Spanish, Catalan, and Galician, the identification of base models' frequent uninformative responses proved essential for an accurate interpretation of the results thereby preventing any potential mischaracterization of the models' performance.


\paragraph{Larger models are more truthful.}


In contrast with \citet{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa} and \citet{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa}, we found that larger models in the same model family tend to outperform their smaller counterparts. This could be partially explained by the post-training alignment and larger size of the %
models we experiment with. These results are consistent with those obtained for more recent evaluations such as SimpleQA \cite{wei2024measuring}. This pattern is observed for both base and instruct models.

\paragraph{Time and contextual-dependency are crucial to evaluate truthfulness.}


Figure \ref{fig:contextual} shows that all models answer remarkably more truthfully to questions about universal topics in all languages, with scores around 90\% accuracy. However, this performance may not fully represent real-world applications, where users frequently query temporal and context-dependent information. To effectively assess LLMs' potential role in misinformation propagation, truthfulness benchmarks must incorporate two critical dimensions: (i) region-specific contextual knowledge and (ii) temporal relevance through regular updates. Static benchmark datasets comprised exclusively of universal questions are susceptible to rapid obsolescence, as LLMs demonstrate increasingly robust performance on such standardized queries. Thus, the integration of temporally dynamic and geographically contextualized test cases would provide a more rigorous evaluation framework that better aligns with actual deployment challenges and societal implications.

\paragraph{Is MT a viable option for massive multilingual expansion of TruthfulQA?}


Even though the manual translation process required rigorous standardization protocols to ensure consistency across all four language datasets, results from Table \ref{tab:mt_metrics} revealed no statistically significant differences between the performance obtained using the professionally translated or the machine-translated datasets. This suggests that MT could be a viable method for extending truthfulness datasets to multiple languages. However, two important caveats must be considered: (i) MT was performed using a state-of-the-art LLM which is perhaps not available for \emph{any} language, and (ii) these results are specific to the TruthfulQA dataset and may not generalize to more complex text genres.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}

A significant challenge in contemporary Artificial Intelligence (AI) research concerns the development of methodologies to optimize LLMs for factual accuracy and veracity in their outputs. %
Improving factual consistency and reducing hallucinations would help to increase trust in LLMs thereby increasing their application across various domains. Apart from the popular TruthfulQA, already introduced in Section \ref{sec:data}, other approaches include SimpleQA \cite{wei2024measuring},
and VeritasQA \cite{aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa}.

SimpleQA is a benchmark dataset designed for evaluating the abilities of LLMs to answer factual questions, specifically targeting short, fact-seeking queries. The dataset %
features dual-source verification for answer validation, %
and shows an increased difficulty compared to legacy benchmarks (e.g., \citet{joshi-etal-2017-triviaqa} or \citet{kwiatkowski-etal-2019-natural}), where current LLMs show performance saturation. 

VeritasQA is a multilingual dataset to evaluate truthfulness in LLMs, currently available in English, Spanish, Catalan, and Galician. It consists of 353 questions (288 from the 817 available in the original TruthfulQA plus 65 added from scratch). The dataset is designed to be transferable across languages, context-independent, and temporally stable. The empirical evidence presented in Figure \ref{fig:contextual} indicates that LLMs are approaching performance saturation on datasets such as VeritasQA that exclusively test universal knowledge. %

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusions}

This paper presents a professionally translated version of the original TruthfulQA dataset, encompassing English, Basque, Catalan, Galician, and Spanish. We have uncovered several interesting points about truthfulness across languages through a comprehensive evaluation of 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using human assessment, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge approaches. Although English responses demonstrated superior detail and coherence, the gap in truthfulness across languages was less pronounced than anticipated. Our findings challenge previous assumptions about the correlation of model size with truthfulness \cite{lin-etal-2022-truthfulqa,aula-blasco-etal-2025-veritasqa} and highlight the limitations of using multiple choice metrics alone, showing that Judge-LLM methods correlate better with human judgments. Results also reveal that, when available, high-quality MT can effectively generate multilingual truthfulness evaluation datasets, while suggesting that universal topics may be easier to solve by modern LLMs than context- and time-dependent questions. We hope these results improve our understanding of LLM truthfulness across linguistic boundaries, providing valuable insights for developing more reliable multilingual AI systems.

\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

The limitations of the present work are mainly related to language diversity, evaluation techniques, and the dynamic and local nature of a great number of falsehoods.

Our expansion to include Iberian languages certainly only covers a small fraction of the world's languages, limiting the generalizability of our findings. However, our results using automatic translation suggest potential scalability to other languages, offering a cost-effective approach to broadening language coverage of the benchmark without the need to get professional translations.

The challenge of evaluating generative tasks automatically is another significant limitation. On the one hand, a fully manual evaluation was deemed impractical due to the significant burden it would impose on resources and scalability. On the other hand, although automated methods like LLM-as-judge work well, they still fall short of capturing the accuracy and subtle nuances that manual evaluations can achieve — especially as models continue to improve.

TruthfulQA is a static dataset. And, as highlighted in this work, 
an important limitation of static truthfulness benchmarks is their lack of local knowledge and dynamism. For these benchmarks to effectively prevent the spread of falsehoods, they must be informed by local contexts and be continuously updated. %
By incorporating locally relevant and timely questions, benchmarks can more effectively reflect and address real-world challenges.
