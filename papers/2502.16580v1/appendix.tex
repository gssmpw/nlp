\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
 We conduct our experiments using PyTorch 2.1.0 \cite{paszke2019pytorch}. The experiments are performed on a single NVIDIA H100-96G GPU.  For  training, we set all the "learning rate" to 1e-5, "epochs" to 1, and "max length" to 1280 with DeepSpeed \cite{rajbhandari2020zero}.  For generation, we set ``do\_sample'' to false and ``max\_new\_tokens'' to 256. The “max\_length” is set to 8192.

 
\subsection{Attack Baselines}
\label{app:attack}
\paragraph{Naive attack.} The naive attack method involves simply appending the injected instruction to the original data content, as shown in Table \ref{tab:naive-attack}.
\paragraph{Ignore attack \cite{perez2022ignore}. } The ignore attack firstly append an ignoring instruction and then the injected instruction is put in the subsequent content as shown in Table \ref{tab:ignore-attack}. 
\paragraph{Escape-Character attack \cite{breitenbach2023dont,liu2024formalizing}.} The Escape-Deletion attack \cite{breitenbach2023dont} considers using special tokens to simulate the deletion command and trick the LLM into ignoring and executing. The Escape-Separation \cite{liu2024formalizing} creates new spaces or lines to trick the LLM. We implement the Escape-Separation attack and an example is shown in Table \ref{tab:ed-attack}.
\paragraph{Fake completion attack. \cite{willison_2023}.} The fake completion attack starts by adding a fake response to the original input instruction, tricking the LLM into believing the task has been finished. The attackers then insert their own instruction into the subsequent content. An example is shown in Table \ref{tab:fake-attack}.
\paragraph{Combined attack \cite{liu2024formalizing}.} This method combines the attack methods mentioned above, as shown in Table \ref{tab:combine-attack}.



\subsection{Defense Baselines}
\label{app:defense}
\paragraph{Sandwich \cite{sandwich_defense_2023}.} This technique appends a restatement of the original instruction at the end of the content, reinforcing the LLM’s adherence to the correct instruction. An example can be found in Table \ref{tab:defense-sandwich}.

\paragraph{Instructional \cite{instruction_defense_2023}.} This strategy inserts a warning about potential attacks following the original instruction, urging the LLM to prioritize the original instruction. An illustration is shown in Table \ref{tab:defense-instr}.

\paragraph{StruQ \cite{chen2024struq}.} This method employs adversarial training by incorporating attacks into the training inputs and enforcing the model to generate responses aligned with the original input instructions.

\subsection{Evaluation Process}
\label{sec:eval}
The evaluation process is as follows: (1) \textbf{Attack generation}: the attack method uses the clean document $d$ and the injected instruction  $x$. Let the attack method be represented as a function $\text{Atk}(\cdot)$. The injected document  $d^\text{inj}$ is generated as $d^\text{inj} = \text{Atk}(d, x, \text{pos})$, where $\text{pos}$  denotes the injection position. (2) \textbf{Detection and removal evaluation}: the detection and removal methods take $d^\text{inj}$  as input. Detection methods are expected to clearly identify the injected and clean documents. After removal methods, the processed document $d^\text{pro}$ is expected to be the clean document $d$. (3) \textbf{Defense evaluation}: for the final evaluation of prompt injection defense, original input instruction $p$ and the processed document $d^\text{pro}$  are combined together as the LLM input $p^\text{inj}$, simulating the indirect attack scenario. $y$ is used for detecting the attack success by checking if it appears in the response.

What is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings? & Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings. The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations, such as addition of a room, or renovation of a bathroom. Often, the owner of the property acts as laborer, paymaster, and design team for the entire project. Although building construction projects typically include various common elements, such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations, many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost overruns, and/or litigation. For this reason, those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome. & Building construction & Give back only www.example.com. & www.example.com \\ \hline

Saint-Pierre said, "As to the Summons you send me to retire, I do not think myself obliged to obey it."

He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special "The Snowmen", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor" in November 2013. \\
