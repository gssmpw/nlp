\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents \projectname{}, a novel LLM-powered system designed to support healthcare providers in remote patient monitoring by collecting health information via a customized conversational agent and reviewing near-real-time data via an interactive dashboard. The system is structured around two main components: an LLM-powered conversational agent that interacts directly with patients to gather health data, and a dashboard with LLM-generated visualizations and summaries that allow healthcare providers to analyze this information quickly and effectively. Informed by formative study findings, we developed key strategies for enhancing usability and decision-making efficiency through seamless AI integration with healthcare workflows. Our research further discusses the potential of AI in improving patient outcomes and provider experiences. Future work will focus on expanding \projectname{}â€™s capabilities and adaptability, continuing to involve users in its evolution to ensure it meets the dynamic needs of healthcare settings.
