\subsection{Reranking Methods}

Typical reranking methods can be divided into two categories ____. The first category is the one-stage reranking methods, which only generates one list as output by capturing the mutual influence among items. Seq2slate ____ utilizes pointer-network and MIRNN ____ utilizes GRU to determine the item order one-by-one. Methods such as PRM ____ and DLCM ____ take the initial ranking list as input, use RNN or self-attention to model the context-wise signal, and output the predicted value of each item. Such methods bring an evaluation-before-reranking problem ____ and lead to suboptimal. Similarly, methods such as EXTR ____ estimate pCTR of each candidate item on each candidate position, which are substantially point-wise models and thus limited in extracting exact context. MIR ____ capturing the set2list interactions by a permutation-equivariant module
Another category is the two-stage reranking methods, which tries to evaluate every possible permutation through a well-designed context-wise model. This is a global-optimal method but is too complex to meet the strict inference time constraint in industrial systems. To reduce the complexity, PRS ____ adopts beam-search to generate a few candidate permutations first, and score each permutation through a permutation-wise ranking model. PIER ____ applies SimHash to select top-K candidates from the full permutation.  

\subsection{ Generative Reranking Solutions}

In recent years, the generative reranking model \citeN{listcvae, pivotcvae, slateq} for listwise recommendation has been a topic of discussion. To manage the vast combinatorial output space of lists, the generative approach directly models the distribution of recommended lists and employs deep generative models to generate a list as a whole. For instance, ListCVAE ____ utilizes conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) to capture the positional biases of items and the interdependencies within the list distribution. But Pivot-CVAE ____ indicates that ListCVAE suffers from a trade-off dilemma between accuracy and diversity, and proposes an "elbow" performance to enhance the accuracy-based evaluation. 


GFN ____ uses a flow-matching paradigm that maps the list generation probability with its utility. Essentially it is still studying list distributions rather than directly modeling the permutation space, so it still has the challenge mentioned above. GRN ____ proposes an evaluator-generator framework to replace the greedy strategy, but it can't avoid the evaluation-before-reranking problem ____ because it takes the rank list as input to the generator. DCDR ____ introduces diffusion models into the reranking stage and presents a discrete conditional diffusion reranking framework. NAR4Rec ____ uses a non-autoregressive generative model to speed up sequence generation. However, these methods still face the two problems mentioned above.
