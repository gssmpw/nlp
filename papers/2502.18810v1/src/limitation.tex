\section*{Limitations and Ethical Considerations}

\noindent\textbf{Limitations.} The primary limitation of our work is that it extends only the dataset provided by MUSE and employs DeepSeek-v3 for question generation. 
To mitigate this generalization risk, we have released our code and the generated audit suite, allowing researchers to utilize our framework to create additional audit datasets and evaluate their quality. Meanwhile, this is also our future work to extend our framework to other benchmarks.

\noindent\textbf{Ethical Considerations.} Machine unlearning can be employed to mitigate risks associated with LLMs in terms of privacy, security, bias, and copyright. Our work is dedicated to providing a comprehensive evaluation framework to help researchers better understand the unlearning effectiveness of LLMs, which we believe will have a positive impact on society.
