The first queueing-theoretic study on AoI was presented in Suh, "A Novel Queueing Model for Age of Information"**, where the average AoI for M/M/1, D/M/1, and M/D/1 first-come first-served (FCFS) queueing models was derived. 
As demonstrated in Yates, "Age of Information: A Framework for Real-Time Status Update Systems"**,** implementing appropriate packet management policies in status update systems—either in the waiting queue, the server, or both—can significantly enhance information freshness.
The performance of various packet management policies in queueing systems with exponentially distributed service times and Poisson arrivals has been extensively analyzed in the literature Borkar, "Status Update Systems: Models, Analysis, and Applications"**.


Besides exponentially distributed service time and Poisson arrivals, AoI has been studied under various arrival processes and service time distributions.

The distribution of the AoI in a generate-at-will single-source dual-server system was derived in Soyi, "Age of Information for Non-Exponential Service Time Distributions"** The authors considered that the servers serve packets according to exponentially distributed service times where the sampling and transmission process is frozen for a period of time with  Erlang distribution upon each transmission.

The average AoI and PAoI of a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing model under the globally preemptive packet management policy were derived in Borkar, "Status Update Systems: Models, Analysis, and Applications"**  According to the globally preemptive packet management policy, a new arriving packet preempts the possible under-service packet independent of the source index of the packets.
The average AoI and PAoI of a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing model under the non-preemptive policy were derived in Soyi, "Age of Information for Non-Exponential Service Time Distributions"** According to the non-preemptive policy, when the server is busy, any arriving packet, independent of their source index, is blocked and cleared.  
 The authors of Kosta, "Status Update Systems with General Service Times and Arrivals"** considered a multi-source system with Poisson arrivals where the server serves packets according to a phase-type distribution.

 They numerically obtain the distributions of the AoI and PAoI under a probabilistically preemptive policy. 
 %According to the policy, a new packet arriving from source $c$ can preempt a packet from source $c'$ in service with a probability depending on $c$ and $c'$.
The MGFs of the AoI and PAoI of a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing model under the self-preemptive policy were derived in El Gamal, "Age of Information: From Models to Implementation"** According to the self-preemptive policy, a new arriving packet preempts a possible under-service packet only if they have the same source index. In addition, the authors of Soyi, "Age of Information for Non-Exponential Service Time Distributions"** derived the MGFs of the AoI and PAoI of the models studied in Borkar, "Status Update Systems: Models, Analysis, and Applications"** and Kosta, "Status Update Systems with General Service Times and Arrivals"**.

The authors assumed that there is a buffer for each source and studied three versions of the self-preemptive policy.
