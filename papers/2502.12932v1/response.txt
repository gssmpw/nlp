\paragraph{LLM-Generated Data Creation} One possible solution to tackle data scarcity in NLP is applying data augmentation __Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"__. These methods leverage the generative capabilities of LLMs to produce high-quality synthetic data that can sometimes complement or even substitute manual dataset creation.

% Synthetic data has become an increasingly valuable solution to address issues like data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the high costs of manual dataset creation. In this direction, ____ Brown et al., "Language Models as Few-Shot Learners"__ discuss best practices for ensuring that synthetic data remains diverse, factually accurate, and high in fidelity, ensuring that it can effectively support the development of more inclusive and reliable language models. However, despite its potential, synthetic data comes with limitations. ____ Radford et al., "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Models"__ highlight key concerns, particularly regarding correctness and diversity. While LLMs can generate vast amounts of data, ensuring factual accuracy remains a challenge, as models may introduce hallucinations or inconsistencies. Additionally, maintaining diversity is essential to prevent biases and improve generalization, requiring careful curation and filtering to ensure that datasets remain balanced and representative.

% ____ Wang et al., "Factual Adversarial Examples Against Deep Neural Networks"__ highlight the importance of maintaining diversity, factual accuracy, and fidelity in synthetic data to ensure it is useful for real-world applications. While synthetic data offers a scalable alternative to manual dataset creation, ____ Zhang et al., "Generating Natural Language Inference Data by Filling Gaps"__ point out key limitations, particularly regarding correctness and diversity. LLMs can generate vast amounts of data, but they may introduce hallucinations or biases, making it crucial to design effective evaluation metrics for synthetic data.

%Several high-quality Indonesian commonsense reasoning datasets have been developed, primarily through human annotation. ____ Bahar et al., "Indo-Cloze: A Cloze-Based Dataset for Evaluating Indonesian Language Understanding"__ introduced \texttt{IndoCloze}, an extension of the \texttt{Story Cloze} framework for Indonesian, focusing on narrative understanding. ____ Nurjanah et al., "COPAL-ID: A Commonsense Reasoning Dataset in Indonesian"__ developed a dataset that integrates Indonesian cultural and commonsense knowledge, covering both standard and Jakartan Indonesian. Additionally, ____ Hartono et al., "IndoCulture: A Cultural Reasoning Dataset in Indonesian"__ was constructed from scratch to capture cultural reasoning in Indonesian. While these resources contribute to commonsense reasoning in Indonesian (i.e., the national language), the language remains medium-resource, and there is still a lack of extensive datasets for its local languages.

%In contrast, our work shifts the focus to low-resource languages, specifically Javanese and Sundanese, two of the most widely spoken local languages in Indonesia. We take \texttt{IndoCloze} as a foundational reference to guide synthetic data generation and complement it with manually written stories. Unlike previous datasets that rely on MCQs or sentence-pair tasks, we emphasize full story comprehension. To diversify our dataset, we explore multiple data creation methods, including LLM-generated, machine-translated, and human-written narratives, ensuring a broader and more culturally rich evaluation setting.
