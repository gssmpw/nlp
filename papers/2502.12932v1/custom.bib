However, only a very small number of the over 7000 languages of the world are represented in the rapidly evolving language technologies and applications. In this paper we look at the relation between the types of languages, resources, and their representation in NLP conferences to understand the trajectory that different languages have followed over time. Our quantitative investigation underlines the disparity between languages, especially in terms of their resources, and calls into question the {\textquotedblleft}language agnostic{\textquotedblright} status of current models and systems. Through this paper, we attempt to convince the ACL community to prioritise the resolution of the predicaments highlighted here, so that no language is left behind."

    abstract = "Question Answering (QA) datasets have been instrumental in developing and evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. However, such datasets are scarce for languages other than English due to the cost and difficulties of collection and manual annotation. This means that producing novel models and measuring the performance of multilingual LLMs in low-resource languages is challenging. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{S}yn\textbf{DAR}in, a method for generating and validating QA datasets for low-resoucre languages. We utilize parallel content mining to obtain \textit{human-curated} paragraphs between English and the target language. We use the English data as context to \textit{generate} synthetic multiple-choice (MC) question-answer pairs, which are automatically translated and further validated for quality. Combining these with their designated non-English \textit{human-curated} paragraphs form the final QA dataset. The method allows to maintain content quality, reduces the likelihood of factual errors, and circumvents the need for costly annotation. To test the method, we created a QA dataset with 1.2K samples for the Armenian language. The human evaluation shows that 98{\%} of the generated English data maintains quality and diversity in the question types and topics, while the translation validation pipeline can filter out {\textasciitilde}70{\%} of data with poor quality. We use the dataset to benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs, showing their inability to achieve human accuracy with some model performances closer to random chance. This shows that the generated dataset is non-trivial and can be used to evaluate reasoning capabilities in low-resource language."

Like other low-resource languages, the only alternative is to fine-tune existing multilingual models. In this paper, we pre-trained three monolingual Transformer-based language models on Sundanese data. When evaluated on a downstream text classification task, we found that most of our monolingual models outperformed larger multilingual models despite the smaller overall pre-training data. In the subsequent analyses, our models benefited strongly from the Sundanese pre-training corpus size and do not exhibit socially biased behavior. We released our models for other researchers and practitioners to use.},

In this paper, we introduce IndoCulture, aimed at understanding the influence of geographical factors on language model reasoning ability, with a specific emphasis on the diverse cultures found within eleven Indonesian provinces. In contrast to prior work that has relied on templates (Yin et al., 2022) and online scrapping (Fung et al., 2024), we create IndoCulture by asking local people to manually develop a cultural context and plausible options, across a set of predefined topics. Evaluation of 27 language models reveals several insights: (1) the open-weight Llama{--}3 is competitive with GPT{--}4, while other open-weight models struggle, with accuracies below 50{\%}; (2) there is a general pattern of models generally performing better for some provinces, such as Bali and West Java, and less well for others; and (3) the inclusion of location context enhances performance, especially for larger models like GPT{--}4, emphasizing the significance of geographical context in commonsense reasoning.1"
