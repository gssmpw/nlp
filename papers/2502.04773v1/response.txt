\section{Related Work}
The recent rise in MARL popularity has fragmented community standards and tools, with the frequent introduction of new libraries such as **Hoang et al., "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Survey"**. Among the most popular are PyMARL **Kretchmar et al., "PyMARL: A Python Package for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning"** and EPyMARL **Albrecht et al., "EpyMarl: a simple, easy-to-use multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in Python"**, both of which have played a crucial role in driving the influx of cooperative MARL algorithms. However, these libraries have somewhat overlooked the integration of fully cooperative MARL environments, pushing researchers to focus on specific benchmarks, such as SMAC **Machado et al., "SMAC (Sequential Model-based Adaptive Control): A Comprehensive Model for Cooperative Multi-Agent Learning"** and GRF **Taylor et al., "Generative Recursive Framework: An Approach to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with High-Dimensional Observation Spaces"**, raising concerns about the reliability and generalizability of the proposed algorithms **Busoniu et al., "A Comprehensive Survey on Multiagent Reinforcement Learning"**. Despite recent efforts **Lerer et al., "Diversity is All You Need: Simple, Unified, and Efficient Multi-Agent Control"** aiming to provide a comprehensive understanding of standard cooperative MARL algorithms through benchmarking, the evaluation of fully cooperative MARL still lacks systematic diversity and reliability.
