        First, I would like to thank Professor Simon J. Godsill for his support and guidance throughout this project. I have appreciated our invaluable discussions at regular supervisions, where often he would set me back on track whenever obstacles were encountered. Second, a grateful acknowledgment to Professor Carl Rasmussen for one supervision where he offered his expertise on Gaussian Processes.\\

        It goes without saying that I am indebted to my mother and father, who have provided the love and support that has got me here. Of course, a special thanks to my two sisters for being my best friends. \\

        The course of this year has certainly been challenging at times, and I'd like to say thanks to all my dear friends who have encouraged me all the way. Lastly, a big thank you to Patrick, whose unending care and support has especially helped throughout the course of this project.
