\section{Conclusion}

Learned data structures have been shown to have strong empirical performance and have the potential to be widely used in systems.  There is a need to develop an algorithmic foundation on how to leverage predictions to speed up worst-case data structures.  

In this paper, we build on this recent line of work, and provide new algorithmic techniques to solve the fundamental problem of
single-source shortest paths in incremental graphs.  As our main result, we design an ideal (consistent, robust, and smooth) algorithm for this problem.  
Our algorithm is optimal (up to log factors) with perfect predictions and circumvents the high worst-case update cost of state-of-the-art solutions even under reasonably accurate predictions.
