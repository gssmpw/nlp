    abstract = {This book describes warehouse-scale computers (WSCs), the computing platforms that power cloud computing and all the great web services we use every day. It discusses how these new systems treat the datacenter itself as one massive computer designed at warehouse scale, with hardware and software working in concert to deliver good levels of internet service performance. The book details the architecture of WSCs and covers the main factors influencing their design, operation, and cost structure, and the characteristics of their software base. Each chapter contains multiple real-world examples, including detailed case studies and previously unpublished details of the infrastructure used to power Google's online services. Targeted at the architects and programmers of today's WSCs, this book provides a great foundation for those looking to innovate in this fascinating and important area, but the material will also be broadly interesting to those who just want to understand the infrastructure powering the internet. The third edition reflects four years of advancements since the previous edition and nearly doubles the number of pictures and figures. New topics range from additional workloads like video streaming, machine learning, and public cloud to specialized silicon accelerators, storage and network building blocks, and a revised discussion of data center power and cooling, and uptime. Further discussions of emerging trends and opportunities ensure that this revised edition will remain an essential resource for educators and professionals working on the next generation of WSCs.}

    abstract = {Key-value stores are a vital component in many scale-out enterprises, including social networks, online retail, and risk analysis. Accordingly, they are receiving increased attention from the research community in an effort to improve their performance, scalability, reliability, cost, and power consumption. To be effective, such efforts require a detailed understanding of realistic key-value workloads. And yet little is known about these workloads outside of the companies that operate them. This paper aims to address this gap.To this end, we have collected detailed traces from Facebook's Memcached deployment, arguably the world's largest. The traces capture over 284 billion requests from five different Memcached use cases over several days. We analyze the workloads from multiple angles, including: request composition, size, and rate; cache efficacy; temporal patterns; and application use cases. We also propose a simple model of the most representative trace to enable the generation of more realistic synthetic workloads by the community.Our analysis details many characteristics of the caching workload. It also reveals a number of surprises: a GET/SET ratio of 30:1 that is higher than assumed in the literature; some applications of Memcached behave more like persistent storage than a cache; strong locality metrics, such as keys accessed many millions of times a day, do not always suffice for a high hit rate; and there is still room for efficiency and hit rate improvements in Memcached's implementation. Toward the last point, we make several suggestions that address the exposed deficiencies.},

    abstract = {Storage systems in data centers are an important component of large-scale online services. They typically perform replicated transactional operations for high data availability and integrity. Today, however, such operations suffer from high tail latency even with recent kernel bypass and storage optimizations, and thus affect the predictability of end-to-end performance of these services. We observe that the root cause of the problem is the involvement of the CPU, a precious commodity in multi-tenant settings, in the critical path of replicated transactions. In this paper, we present HyperLoop, a new framework that removes CPU from the critical path of replicated transactions in storage systems by offloading them to commodity RDMA NICs, with non-volatile memory as the storage medium. To achieve this, we develop new and general NIC offloading primitives that can perform memory operations on all nodes in a replication group while guaranteeing ACID properties without CPU involvement. We demonstrate that popular storage applications can be easily optimized using our primitives. Our evaluation results with microbenchmarks and application benchmarks show that HyperLoop can reduce 99th percentile latency ≈ 800X with close to 0% CPU consumption on replicas.},

    abstract = {Memory scaling is in jeopardy as charge storage and sensing mechanisms become less reliable for prevalent memory technologies, such as DRAM. In contrast, phase change memory (PCM) storage relies on scalable current and thermal mechanisms. To exploit PCM's scalability as a DRAM alternative, PCM must be architected to address relatively long latencies, high energy writes, and finite endurance.We propose, crafted from a fundamental understanding of PCM technology parameters, area-neutral architectural enhancements that address these limitations and make PCM competitive with DRAM. A baseline PCM system is 1.6x slower and requires 2.2x more energy than a DRAM system. Buffer reorganizations reduce this delay and energy gap to 1.2x and 1.0x, using narrow rows to mitigate write energy and multiple rows to improve locality and write coalescing. Partial writes enhance memory endurance, providing 5.6 years of lifetime. Process scaling will further reduce PCM energy costs and improve endurance.},

    abstract = {The simplest strategy to guarantee good quality of service (QoS) for a latency-sensitive workload with sub-millisecond latency in a shared cluster environment is to never run other workloads concurrently with it on the same server. Unfortunately, this inevitably leads to low server utilization, reducing both the capability and cost effectiveness of the cluster.In this paper, we analyze the challenges of maintaining high QoS for low-latency workloads when sharing servers with other workloads. We show that workload co-location leads to QoS violations due to increases in queuing delay, scheduling delay, and thread load imbalance. We present techniques that address these vulnerabilities, ranging from provisioning the latency-critical service in an interference aware manner, to replacing the Linux CFS scheduler with a scheduler that provides good latency guarantees and fairness for co-located workloads. Ultimately, we demonstrate that some latency-critical workloads can be aggressively co-located with other workloads, achieve good QoS, and that such co-location can improve a datacenter's effective throughput per TCO-$ by up to 52\%.},

    abstract = {Emerging fast, persistent memories will enable systems that combine conventional DRAM with large amounts of non-volatile main memory (NVMM) and provide huge increases in storage performance. Fully realizing this potential requires fundamental changes in how system software manages, protects, and provides access to data that resides in NVMM. We address these needs by describing an NVMM-optimized file system called NOVA-Fortis that is both fast and resilient in the face of corruption due to media errors and software bugs. We identify and propose solutions for the unique challenges in adding fault tolerance to an NVMM file system, adapt state-of-the-art reliability techniques to an NVMM file system, and quantify the performance and storage overheads of these techniques. We find that NOVA-Fortis' reliability features consume 14.8\% of the storage for redundancy and reduce application-level performance by between 2\% and 38\% compared to the same file system with the features removed. NOVA-Fortis outperforms DAX-aware file systems without reliability features by 1.5x on average. It outperforms reliable, block-based file systems running on NVMM by 3x on average.},

abstract = {RAMCloud is a DRAM-based storage system that provides inexpensive durability and availability by recovering quickly after crashes, rather than storing replicas in DRAM. RAMCloud scatters backup data across hundreds or thousands of disks, and it harnesses hundreds of servers in parallel to reconstruct lost data. The system uses a log-structured approach for all its data, in DRAM as well as on disk: this provides high performance both during normal operation and during recovery. RAMCloud employs randomized techniques to manage the system in a scalable and decentralized fashion. In a 60-node cluster, RAMCloud recovers 35 GB of data from a failed server in 1.6 seconds. Our measurements suggest that the approach will scale to recover larger memory sizes (64 GB or more) in less time with larger clusters.},

abstract = {We present a general scheme for virtualizing main memory error-correction mechanisms, which map redundant information needed to correct errors into the memory namespace itself. We rely on this basic idea, which increases flexibility to increase error protection capabilities, improve power efficiency, and reduce system cost; with only small performance overheads. We augment the virtual memory system architecture to detach the physical mapping of data from the physical mapping of its associated ECC information. We then use this mechanism to develop two-tiered error protection techniques that separate the process of detecting errors from the rare need to also correct errors, and thus save energy. We describe how to provide strong chipkill and double-chip kill protection using existing DRAM and packaging technology. We show how to maintain access granularity and redundancy overheads, even when using \texttimes{}8 DRAM chips. We also evaluate error correction for systems that do not use ECC DIMMs. Overall, analysis of demanding SPEC CPU 2006 and PARSEC benchmarks indicates that performance overhead is only 1% with ECC DIMMs and less than 10% using standard Non-ECC DIMM configurations, that DRAM power savings can be as high as 27%, and that the system energy-delay product is improved by 12% on average.},

Memory pooling promises to improve DRAM utilization and thereby reduce costs. However, pooling is challenging under cloud performance requirements. This paper proposes Pond, the first memory pooling system that both meets cloud performance goals and significantly reduces DRAM cost. Pond builds on the Compute Express Link (CXL) standard for load/store access to pool memory and two key insights. First, our analysis of cloud production traces shows that pooling across 8-16 sockets is enough to achieve most of the benefits. This enables a small-pool design with low access latency. Second, it is possible to create machine learning models that can accurately predict how much local and pool memory to allocate to a virtual machine (VM) to resemble same-NUMA-node memory performance. Our evaluation with 158 workloads shows that Pond reduces DRAM costs by 7\% with performance within 1-5\% of same-NUMA-node VM allocations.},

    abstract = {The efficiency of distributed shared memory (DSM) has been greatly improved by recent hardware technologies. But, the difficulty of distributed memory management can still be a major obstacle to the democratization of DSM, especially when a partial failure of the participating clients (e.g., due to crashed processes or machines) should be tolerated.In this paper, we present CXL-SHM, an automatic distributed memory management system based on reference counting. The reference count maintenance in CXL-SHM is implemented with a special era-based non-blocking algorithm. Thus, there are no blocking synchronization, memory leak, double free, and wild pointer problems, even if some participating clients unexpectedly fail without freeing their possessed memory references. We evaluated our system on real CXL hardware with both micro-benchmarks and end-to-end applications, which demonstrate the efficiency of CXL-SHM and the simplicity/flexibility of using CXL-SHM to build efficient distributed applications.},
