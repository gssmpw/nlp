\section{Replication-Aware Memory-error Protection}
\label{sec:shepherd}

We propose \emph{\textbf{R}eplication-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{M}emory-error \textbf{P}rotection} (\ramp), a framework for designing and tuning computing systems employing memory replication with memory protection to tolerate memory errors.
% to efficiently tolerate memory errors due to random bit cell errors 
% in disaggregated memory.
% We focus on random bit cell errors, as we expect these to represent the majority of memory errors because of the high RBER of high-density NVM.

% replication => gives choices to repair
% checksum => improves detection strength/ability
% so we can weaken the hardware protection or vice versa.

\subsection{System Model}
% \ramp targets a memory system that combines memory replication with memory protection (ECC) to tolerate memory errors, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:ramp-architecture} presents an abstract system model of computing systems that employ memory replication together with memory protection.
This model captures a variety of systems, ranging from conventional NUMA systems~\cite{patil:dve:isca:2021} to emerging disaggregated memory architectures~\cite{lee:hydra:fast:2022, zhou:carbink:osdi:2022, tsai:dpm:atc:2020, shan:legoos:osdi:2018}.
In this model, compute nodes provide processing power, while memory nodes offer memory capacity and implement memory protection (e.g., ECC) for their memory. 
Although memory nodes are shown as separate from compute nodes in this abstract model, the actual implementation may integrate them, as seen in NUMA systems, where a NUMA node consists of both processors and direct-attached memory~\cite{patil:dve:isca:2021}. Compute nodes interact with memory nodes through a replication engine (RE), which implements the replication logic and coordinates data replication across multiple memory nodes.
