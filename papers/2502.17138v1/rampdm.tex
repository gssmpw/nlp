We design \rampdm, a resilient disaggregated memory system following the \ramp model.
\rampdm builds on Hydra~\cite{lee:hydra:fast:2022}, a state-of-the-art resilience mechanism for disaggregated memory systems that employs rack-level memory replication to tolerate memory-node failures. 
\rampdm extends Hydra with cross-layer memory resilience mechanisms, enabling it to tune memory protection strength, storage overhead, and performance.

\subsection{Putting it all together}

Applications define their required level of resilience, which is communicated to the Resilience Manager. The Resilience Manager, in turn, ensures the appropriate redundancy is in place to meet these resilience requirements.
Applications access remote memory through virtual memory. 
When an application attempts to access a virtual memory address that is not backed by a physical page in local memory, a page fault occurs. This triggers remote paging to retrieve the corresponding page from remote memory over the network using one-sided RDMA operations. 
The memory controller of the remote memory node processing the RDMA request uses the page protection information to identify which protection technique to use for any given memory access.
If a memory access triggers a DUE, the memory node propagates it back to the Resilience Manager as an RDMA error, which is then handled by the Resilience Manager using other remote replicas.
