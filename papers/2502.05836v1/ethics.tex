\section*{Ethics Statement}
This research was conducted with a strong commitment to ethical standards. The \texttt{LegalSeg} dataset comprises publicly available Indian legal judgments, ensuring no private or sensitive data was included. Anonymization was applied where necessary, and all data was collected in compliance with legal and privacy regulations.

In the process of annotating the dataset, law students from various institutions were involved. These annotators were treated with fairness and respect, and they were appropriately compensated for their contributions. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before their involvement in the project. While the students provided essential support in developing the dataset, they are not listed as co-authors of this manuscript to maintain the academic integrity of the publication. Instead, their valuable contributions are acknowledged separately.

The models developed are designed to support, not replace, legal professionals. We advocate for their responsible use, emphasizing the need for human oversight when applied in real-world legal contexts. This research adheres to ethical guidelines in authorship, data handling, and participant involvement, ensuring that all contributions are treated with fairness and respect.
