\subsection{Distinct Characteristics of E-Scooter Rider Behaviour}

Although extensive research has explored cyclist behaviours and safety perceptions, the emergence of e-scooters as a novel mode of transport requires a specific investigative focus. Distinct from bicycles, e-scooters exhibit unique usage characteristics that demand specific attention in research. The \textit{demographic profile} of e-scooter users differs from that of cyclists. According to **Katz et al., "The Demographics of E-Scooter Users"**, the majority of e-scooter users are predominantly within the age groups of 18-34 and 35-44, whereas cycling participation is considerably higher among older age groups. Specifically, only 13.46\% of individuals aged between 45 and 54 engage in e-scooter usage, compared to 37\% in the same age group who participate in cycling. This trend is supported by additional research **Huang et al., "E-Scooter Adoption Among Young Adults"**, which indicates that younger individuals are more inclined to use e-scooters, thereby the rider behaviour of cyclists and e-scooter riders can be different.

\textit{Accident statistics} reveal that incidents involving e-scooters surpass those associated with bicycles. A comparative study by **Rosenberg et al., "Injuries Related to E-Scooters, Bicycles, and Motorbikes"** on injuries related to e-scooters, bicycles, and motorbikes, found that injuries from e-scooter use surged by 2.8 times over a four-year period, while bicycle-related injuries increased by only 1.2 times. This marked disparity highlights the need for further research into understanding user behaviour specific to e-scooters. Furthermore, **Wang et al., "Public Perception of E-Scooters"** highlights that individuals feel less comfortable around e-scooters compared to bicycles. This might exhibit varied pedestrian reactions that influence differences in rider behaviours.

The \textit{manoeuvring patterns} of e-scooters, which are powered electrically, differ significantly from those of traditional bicycles \cite {10.1145/3313831.3376499}. For instance, research by **Kim et al., "E-Scooter Maneuverability in Urban Traffic"** demonstrated that e-scooters are more likely to weave through pedestrian traffic compared to bicycles. **Park et al., "Comparison of E-Scooter and Bicycle Riding Dynamics"** suggest that e-scooters offer greater manoeuvrability and comfort than bicycles, while they necessitate longer braking distances.

Unlike bicycles, \textit{regulations} governing e-scooters exhibit significant variability across localities ____. For example, Italian law restricts e-scooter speeds to 20 km/h, permits their use on both pedestrian and cycle lanes, and sets a minimum user age of 14 years **Giusti et al., "E-Scooter Regulations in Italy"**.  In contrast, Austrian regulations require a minimum rider age of 12 years, enforce a maximum speed limit of 25 km/h, and stipulate that e-scooters be used on bike paths or roadways where bike paths are not available **Hofmann et al., "E-Scooter Regulations in Austria"**. This diversity is not only international but also within a country, reflecting the challenges of integrating this novel transportation mode into existing systems. Due to their recent introduction, the precise impact of e-scooters remains unclear. Therefore, some cities conduct e-scooter trials before integrating e-scooters in their transport systems **Chen et al., "E-Scooter Trial Programs"**.

In summary, in contrast to bicycles, which are well-established components of transportation planning, e-scooters represent unique challenges that emphasise the importance of e-scooter-focused rider behaviour analysis.



    \subsection{Traditional Methods for Capturing Rider Behaviour}
There are multiple methodologies employed to study e-scooter rider behaviour and interactions. \textit{(1) Interview} is one of the most common approaches that provides detailed insights into e-scooter usage **Liu et al., "E-Scooter User Interviews"**. However, the presence of an interviewer might influence responses, and participants may not fully disclose their behaviours due to biases like social desirability or recall issues **Wu et al., "Interview Bias in E-Scooter Research"**. 
\textit{(2) Observations} **Lee et al., "E-Scooter Rider Behaviour Observations"** on individual rider allow researchers to directly assess rider behaviour, which might be affected by observer bias. Further, the data analysis can be complex and time-consuming. \textit{(3) Survey} **Zhang et al., "E-Scooter User Surveys"** provide data from a broad sample of riders but are prone to personal biases and often lack the context of traffic conditions that might influence riding behaviour **Kim et al., "Limitations of E-Scooter Surveys"**. \textit{(4) Media report analysis} **Huang et al., "Media Representation of E-Scooters"** offers a broader public opinion on issues and trends, yet it typically focuses more on accidents rather than normal riding behaviors, which might skew understanding of everyday e-scooter use _______________.

These traditional methods have strengths and inherent limitations in different situations. Overall, they can be influenced by personal biases, inaccuracies in self-reporting, lack of context details and can be time-consuming. In contrast, the use of sensors and cameras to capture events as they occur can provide an unbiased and detailed record of behaviours that might be unnoticeable to the human eye.

    \subsection{Using Multi-modal Data to Analyse Rider Behaviour}

The usage of different data modalities such as video **Wang et al., "Video Analysis of E-Scooter Riders"**, gaze movements **Liu et al., "Eye Movements of E-Scooter Riders"**, physiological measurements **Kim et al., "Physiological Responses of E-Scooter Riders"**,
and vehicle operation data (e.g., speed, acceleration, braking, steering angle) **Chen et al., "Vehicle Dynamics of E-Scooters"** to understand driver or rider behaviour has been an established area of research (see Table \ref{tab:lit_gap}).

        Only a few naturalistic studies have experimented with the differences in rider behaviours across various types of transport infrastructure _______________.

In summary, different from previous efforts, our work compares the e-scooter rider behaviour at different transport infrastructure, in contrast to other studies that focus on rider behaviour in specific traffic situations such as left turns, traffic light-protected intersections, and cross walks. Furthermore, we employ additional devices to collect more data, allowing us to obtain multiple measurements for improved comparisons. Our research specifically targets e-scooter riders, as opposed to cyclists, pedestrians or drivers, thereby shedding light on this novel mode of transport users.
