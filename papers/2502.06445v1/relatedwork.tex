Several open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) frameworks have been proposed, each tailored to meet different performance and usability requirements.\\ 

\subsection{Traditional Approach}
\noindent RapidOCR \cite{RapidOCR2021} stands out as a high-performance OCR framework that uses ONNXRuntime, OpenVINO, and PaddlePaddle \cite{paddleocr2023} to provide fast inference across platforms, including servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. It supports multilingual OCR tasks and provides pre-trained models, making it ideal for real-time applications that require high throughput.

\noindent EasyOCR \cite{EasyOCR2024} is another lightweight OCR toolkit that employs a two-stage approach: text detection using the CRAFT algorithm (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection) \cite{baek2019character}, followed by text recognition using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) \cite{graves2012connectionist} decoder.
