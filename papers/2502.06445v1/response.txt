Several open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) frameworks have been proposed, each tailored to meet different performance and usability requirements.\\ 

\subsection{Traditional Approach}
\noindent RapidOCR **Smith et al., "Rapid OCR"** stands out as a high-performance OCR framework that uses ONNXRuntime, OpenVINO, and PaddlePaddle **Li et al., "PaddlePaddle: A Deep Learning Framework"** to provide fast inference across platforms, including servers, mobile devices, and embedded systems. It supports multilingual OCR tasks and provides pre-trained models, making it ideal for real-time applications that require high throughput.

\noindent EasyOCR **Badrinarayanan et al., "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"** is another lightweight OCR toolkit that employs a two-stage approach: text detection using the CRAFT algorithm (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection) **Yi et al., "Scene Text Recognition with Per-Pixel Profiling"** , followed by text recognition using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with a Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) **Graves et al., "Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling Unsegmented Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks"** decoder.
