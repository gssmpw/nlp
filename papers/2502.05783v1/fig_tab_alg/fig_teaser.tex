\caption{\projectname empowers users to easily define personal actions that they want to receive just-in-time intervention (JITI) from a smartwatch. The user journey is as follows: (1) Users determine one or more custom target actions. (2) They follow the instructions on the smartwatch to collect a small set of samples with the accelerometer sensor. (3) \projectname{} applies multiple data augmentation and data synthesis techniques to expand the training dataset, (4) \projectname{} adapts a pre-trained model through fine-tuning and personal customization. (5) \projectname{} leverages the custom model to provide a JITI system for real-time action recognition and intervention delivery.}
