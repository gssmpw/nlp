\caption{Model Performance of Recognizing Each Action with 1, 5, or 10 Shots. For consistency, each action was added alone (\ie binary classification model). The ``(User Num)'' indicates how many users did this action. The five pre-determined actions (Lip Tearing, Nail Biting, Face Scratching, Eye Rubbing, and Leg Shaking) have the total number of participants (26), and other self-defined actions are more scattered.}
