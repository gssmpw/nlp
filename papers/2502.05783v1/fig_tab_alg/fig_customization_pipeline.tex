\caption{Three-stage Few-shot Pipeline for Model Customization.
(A) Stage 1: We adopted A pre-trained SSL model for human activity recognition that takes 30 Hz tri-axis accelerometer data streams.
(B) Stage 2: We finetuned the pre-trained model on two human activity recognition datasets with more fine-grained gestures, together with additional negative data collected by us.
(C) Stage 3: Given the data sequence of a few samples of the new target action, we designed a series of data augmentation and synthesis techniques to enable robust modeling training for customization.
