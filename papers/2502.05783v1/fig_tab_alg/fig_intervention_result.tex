\caption{(a) Relative Duration of target action every 10 minutes in intervention and post-intervention stages (compared to the pre-intervention stage). A number lower than 1.0 means that an individual performed fewer target actions after intervention.
(b) Average Relative Duration of target action over time. The dashed lines fit the last 10 minutes of the pre-intervention stage and the rest of the session.
