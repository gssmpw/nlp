\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this study, we introduced \projectname, a smartwatch-based intervention system that empowers users to define and reduce their own personal and idiosyncratic undesirable actions.
\projectname employs a three-stage, few-shot learning pipeline to recognize newly defined actions with only a small number of samples.
Through an extensive evaluation of the model's offline performance and an intervention study, our findings demonstrate that \projectname achieves robust and data-efficient action recognition but also significantly decreases usersâ€™ undesirable actions compared to a rule-based baseline.
Our findings underscore the potential of personalized, AI-driven JITIs for individuals seeking to mitigate personal habits and behaviors.
We envision that our work offers a versatile foundation for creating broader, user-defined intervention systems that leverage advanced AI solutions to accommodate an ever-growing spectrum of personal needs.
