	abstract = {Many multimedia applications can benefit from techniques for adapting existing classifiers to data with different distributions. One example is cross-domain video concept detection which aims to adapt concept classifiers across various video domains. In this paper, we explore two key problems for classifier adaptation: (1) how to transform existing classifier(s) into an effective classifier for a new dataset that only has a limited number of labeled examples, and (2) how to select the best existing classifier(s) for adaptation. For the first problem, we propose Adaptive Support Vector Machines (A-SVMs) as a general method to adapt one or more existing classifiers of any type to the new dataset. It aims to learn the "delta function" between the original and adapted classifier using an objective function similar to SVMs. For the second problem, we estimate the performance of each existing classifier on the sparsely-labeled new dataset by analyzing its score distribution and other meta features, and select the classifiers with the best estimated performance. The proposed method outperforms several baseline and competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency in cross-domain concept detection in the TRECVID corpus.

	doi = {10.1145/1401890.1401928},
	abstract = {The effectiveness of knowledge transfer using classification algorithms depends on the difference between the distribution that generates the training examples and the one from which test examples are to be drawn. The task can be especially difficult when the training examples are from one or several domains different from the test domain. In this paper, we propose a locally weighted ensemble framework to combine multiple models for transfer learning, where the weights are dynamically assigned according to a model's predictive power on each test example. It can integrate the advantages of various learning algorithms and the labeled information from multiple training domains into one unified classification model, which can then be applied on a different domain. Importantly, different from many previously proposed methods, none of the base learning method is required to be specifically designed for transfer learning. We show the optimality of a locally weighted ensemble framework as a general approach to combine multiple models for domain transfer. We then propose an implementation of the local weight assignments by mapping the structures of a model onto the structures of the test domain, and then weighting each model locally according to its consistency with the neighborhood structure around the test example. Experimental results on text classification, spam filtering and intrusion detection data sets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy gained by the framework. On a transfer learning task of newsgroup message categorization, the proposed locally weighted ensemble framework achieves 97\% accuracy when the best single model predicts correctly only on 73\% of the test examples. In summary, the improvement in accuracy is over 10\% and up to 30\% across different problems. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

	doi = {10.1145/1273496.1273521},
	abstract = {Traditional machine learning makes a basic assumption: the training and test data should be under the same distribution. However, in many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund \& Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has increasingly been applied to classification of schizophrenia in neuroimaging research. However, direct replication studies and studies seeking to investigate generalizability are scarce. To address these issues, we assessed within-site and between-site generalizability of a machine learning classification framework which achieved excellent performance in a previous study using two independent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets collected from different sites and scanners. We established within-site generalizability of the classification framework in the main data set using cross-validation. Then, we trained a model in the main data set and investigated between-site generalization in the validated data set using external validation. Finally, recognizing the poor between-site generalization performance, we updated the unsupervised algorithm to investigate if transfer learning using additional unlabeled data were able to improve between-site classification performance. Cross-validation showed that the published classification procedure achieved an accuracy of 0.73 using majority voting across all selected components. External validation found a classification accuracy of 0.55 (not significant) and 0.70 (significant) using the direct and transfer learning procedures, respectively. The failure of direct generalization from one site to another demonstrates the limitation of within-site cross-validation and points toward the need to incorporate efforts to facilitate application of machine learning across multiple data sets. The improvement in performance with transfer learning highlights the importance of taking into account the properties of data when constructing predictive models across samples and sites. Our findings suggest that machine learning classification result based on a single study should be interpreted cautiously.},

	abstract = {A review of published work in clinical natural language processing (NLP) may suggest that the negation detection task has been ''solved.'' This work proposes that an optimizable solution does not equal a generalizable solution. We introduce a new machine learning-based Polarity Module for detecting negation in clinical text, and extensively compare its performance across domains. Using four manually annotated corpora of clinical text, we show that negation detection performance suffers when there is no in-domain development (for manual methods) or training data (for machine learning-based methods). Various factors (e.g., annotation guidelines, named entity characteristics, the amount of data, and lexical and syntactic context) play a role in making generalizability difficult, but none completely explains the phenomenon. Furthermore, generalizability remains challenging because it is unclear whether to use a single source for accurate data, combine all sources into a single model, or apply domain adaptation methods. The most reliable means to improve negation detection is to manually annotate in-domain training data (or, perhaps, manually modify rules); this is a strategy for optimizing performance, rather than generalizing it. These results suggest a direction for future work in domain-adaptive and task-adaptive methods for clinical NLP. Copyright:},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) aims at recognizing activities by training models on the large quantity of sensor data. Since it is time-consuming and expensive to acquire abundant labeled data, transfer learning becomes necessary for HAR by transferring knowledge from existing domains. However, there are two challenges existing in cross-dataset activity recognition. The first challenge is source domain selection. Given a target task and several available source domains, it is difficult to determine how to select the most similar source domain to the target domain such that negative transfer can be avoided. The second one is accurately activity transfer. After source domain selection, how to achieve accurate knowledge transfer between the selected source and the target domain remains another challenge. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Transfer Learning (ASTTL) approach to tackle both of the above two challenges in cross-dataset HAR. ASTTL learns the spatial features in transfer learning by adaptively evaluating the relative importance between the marginal and conditional probability distributions. Besides, it captures the temporal features via incremental manifold learning. Therefore, ASTTL can learn the adaptive spatial-temporal features for cross-dataset HAR and can be used for both source domain selection and accurate activity transfer. We evaluate the performance of ASTTL through extensive experiments on 4 public HAR datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness. Furthermore, based on ASTTL, we design and implement an adaptive cross-dataset HAR system called Client-Cloud Collaborative Adaptive Activity Recognition System (3C2ARS) to perform HAR in the real environment. By collecting activities in the smartphone and transferring knowledge in the cloud server, ASTTL can significantly improve the performance of source domain selection and accurate activity transfer.},

	abstract = {Precise and efficient automated identification of Gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases can help doctors treat more patients and improve the rate of disease detection and identification. Currently, automatic analysis of diseases in the GI tract is a hot topic in both computer science and medical-related journals. Nevertheless, the evaluation of such an automatic analysis is often incomplete or simply wrong. Algorithms are often only tested on small and biased datasets, and cross-dataset evaluations are rarely performed. A clear understanding of evaluation metrics and machine learning models with cross datasets is crucial to bring research in the field to a new quality level. Towards this goal, we present comprehensive evaluations of five distinct machine learning models using Global Features and Deep Neural Networks that can classify 16 different key types of GI tract conditions, including pathological findings, anatomical landmarks, polyp removal conditions, and normal findings from images captured by common GI tract examination instruments. In our evaluation, we introduce performance hexagons using six performance metrics such as recall, precision, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient to demonstrate how to determine the real capabilities of models rather than evaluating them shallowly. Furthermore, we perform cross-dataset evaluations using different datasets for training and testing. With these cross-dataset evaluations, we demonstrate the challenge of actually building a generalizable model that could be used across different hospitals. Our experiments clearly show that more sophisticated performance metrics and evaluation methods need to be applied to get reliable models rather than depending on evaluations of the splits of the same dataset, i.e., the performance metrics should always be interpreted together rather than relying on a single metric.},

The transformation is learned in a supervised manner and can be applied to categories for which there are no labeled examples in the new domain. While we focus our evaluation on object recognition tasks, the transform-based adaptation technique we develop is general and could be applied to non-image data.

	abstract = {In real-world applications of visual recognition, many factors such as pose, illumination, or image quality can cause a significant mismatch between the source domain on which classifiers are trained and the target domain to which those classifiers are applied. As such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. Domain adaptation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. Existing approaches have concentrated on learning feature representations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are intrinsic to many vision datasets. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. Our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. Our approach is computationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross-validation or labeled data from either domain. We also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. For a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones. Empirical studies on standard datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach over competing methods. © 2012 IEEE.},

Our goal was to add to our broader understanding of smartphone usage by investigating if differences in mobile device usage occurred not only across our three datasets, but also in relation to prior work. We found differences in the top-10 apps in each dataset, in the durations and types of interactions as well as in micro-usage patterns. However, it proved very challenging to attribute such differences to a specific factor or set of factors: Was it the time frame in which the studies were executed? The recruitment procedure? The experimental method? Using our somewhat troubled analysis, we discuss the challenges and issues of conducting mobile research of this nature and reflect on caveats related to the replicability and generalizability of such work.},

	abstract = {Adversarial learning methods are a promising approach to training robust deep networks, and can generate complex samples across diverse domains. They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations, they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand, discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts, but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work, we ﬁrst outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably simpler than competing domainadversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results on standard domain adaptation tasks as well as a difﬁcult cross-modality object classiﬁcation task.},

While STTP can refer to many real-world problems, most existing studies focus on quite specific applications, such as the prediction of taxi demand, ridesharing order, traffic speed, and so on. This hinders the STTP research as the approaches designed for different applications are hardly comparable, and thus how an application-driven approach can be generalized to other scenarios is unclear. To fill in this gap, this paper makes three efforts: (i) we propose an analytic framework, called STAnalytic, to qualitatively investigate STTP approaches regarding their design considerations on various spatial and temporal factors, aiming to make different application-driven approaches comparable; (ii) we design a spatio-temporal meta-model, called STMeta, which can flexibly integrate generalizable temporal and spatial knowledge identified by STAnalytic, (iii) we build an extensively large-scale STTP benchmark platform including ten datasets with five scenarios to quantitatively measure the generalizability of STTP approaches. In particular, we implement STMeta with different deep learning techniques, and STMeta demonstrates better generalizability than state-of-the-art approaches by achieving lower prediction error on average across all the datasets.},

In particular, our model learns two sets of weights: (1) bias vectors associated with each individual dataset, and (2) visual world weights that are common to all datasets, which are learned by undoing the associated bias from each dataset. The visual world weights are expected to be our best possible approximation to the object model trained on an unbiased dataset, and thus tend to have good generalization ability. We demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our model by applying the learned weights to a novel, unseen dataset, and report superior results for both classiﬁcation and detection tasks compared to a classical SVM that does not account for the presence of bias. Overall, we ﬁnd that it is beneﬁcial to explicitly account for bias when combining multiple datasets.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning for deep neural networks is the process of first training a base network on a source dataset, and then transferring the learned features (the network’s weights) to a second network to be trained on a target dataset. This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network’s generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the models predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets.},

CROSSGRAD does not need an adaptation phase via labeled or unlabeled data, or domain features in the new domain. Most existing domain adaptation methods attempt to erase domain signals using techniques like domain adversarial training. In contrast, CROSSGRAD is free to use domain signals for predicting labels, if it can prevent overfitting on training domains. We conceptualize the task in a Bayesian setting, in which a sampling step is implemented as data augmentation, based on domain-guided perturbations of input instances. CROSSGRAD parallelly trains a label and a domain classifier on examples perturbed by loss gradients of each other's objectives. This enables us to directly perturb inputs, without separating and re-mixing domain signals while making various distributional assumptions. Empirical evaluation on three different applications where this setting is natural establishes that (1) domain-guided perturbation provides consistently better generalization to unseen domains, compared to generic instance perturbation methods, and that (2) data augmentation is a more stable and accurate method than domain adversarial training.},

In this work, we propose a learning to learn approach, where the auxiliary loss that helps generalisation is itself learned. Beyond conventional domain generalisation, we consider a more challenging setting of heterogeneous domain generalisation, where the unseen domains do not share label space with the seen ones, and the goal is to train a feature representation that is useful off-the-shelf for novel data and novel categories.

To be speciﬁc, we extend adversarial autoencoders by imposing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions among different domains, and matching the aligned distribution to an arbitrary prior distribution via adversarial feature learning. In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution.

A critical problem in domain generalization involves learning domaininvariant representations. Let X and Y denote the features and the labels, respectively. Under the assumption that the conditional distribution P (Y {\textbar}X) remains unchanged across domains, earlier approaches to domain generalization learned the invariant representation T (X) by minimizing the discrepancy of the marginal distribution P (T (X)). However, such an assumption of stable P (Y {\textbar}X) does not necessarily hold in practice. In addition, the representation learning function T (X) is usually constrained to a simple linear transformation or shallow networks. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose an end-to-end conditional invariant deep domain generalization approach by leveraging deep neural networks for domain-invariant representation learning. The domain-invariance property is guaranteed through a conditional invariant adversarial network that can learn domain-invariant representations w.r.t. the joint distribution P (T (X), Y ) if the target domain data are not severely class unbalanced.

In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. First, the raw timeseries data are transformed into two different yet correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest that training a linear classiﬁer on top of the features learned by our proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training.

	abstract = {An integrated framework for density-based cluster analysis, outlier detection, and data visualization is introduced in this article. The main module consists of an algorithm to compute hierarchical estimates of the level sets of a density, following Hartigan’s classic model of density-contour clusters and trees. Such an algorithm generalizes and improves existing density-based clustering techniques with respect to different aspects. It provides as a result a complete clustering hierarchy composed of all possible density-based clusters following the nonparametric model adopted, for an infinite range of density thresholds. The resulting hierarchy can be easily processed so as to provide multiple ways for data visualization and exploration. It can also be further postprocessed so that: (i) a normalized score of “outlierness” can be assigned to each data object, which unifies both the global and local perspectives of outliers into a single definition; and (ii) a “flat” (i.e., nonhierarchical) clustering solution composed of clusters extracted from local cuts through the cluster tree (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds) can be obtained, either in an unsupervised or in a semisupervised way. In the unsupervised scenario, the algorithm corresponding to this postprocessing module provides a global, optimal solution to the formal problem of maximizing the overall stability of the extracted clusters. If partially labeled objects or instance-level constraints are provided by the user, the algorithm can solve the problem by considering both constraints violations/satisfactions and cluster stability criteria. An asymptotic complexity analysis, both in terms of running time and memory space, is described. Experiments are reported that involve a variety of synthetic and real datasets, including comparisons with state-of-the-art, density-based clustering and (global and local) outlier detection methods.},

Some pioneering work proposes to simultaneously learn embedded features and perform clustering by explicitly deﬁning a clustering oriented loss. Though promising performance has been demonstrated in various applications, we observe that a vital ingredient has been overlooked by these work that the deﬁned clustering loss may corrupt feature space, which leads to non-representative meaningless features and this in turn hurts clustering performance. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Improved Deep Embedded Clustering (IDEC) algorithm to take care of data structure preservation. Speciﬁcally, we manipulate feature space to scatter data points using a clustering loss as guidance. To constrain the manipulation and maintain the local structure of data generating distribution, an under-complete autoencoder is applied. By integrating the clustering loss and autoencoder’s reconstruction loss, IDEC can jointly optimize cluster labels assignment and learn features that are suitable for clustering with local structure preservation. The resultant optimization problem can be effectively solved by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. Experiments on image and text datasets empirically validate the importance of local structure preservation and the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

Modern batch contrastive approaches subsume or signiﬁcantly outperform traditional contrastive losses such as triplet, max-margin and the N-pairs loss. In this work, we extend the self-supervised batch contrastive approach to the fully-supervised setting, allowing us to effectively leverage label information. Clusters of points belonging to the same class are pulled together in embedding space, while simultaneously pushing apart clusters of samples from different classes. We analyze two possible versions of the supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss, identifying the best-performing formulation of the loss. On ResNet-200, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 81.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, which is 0.8\% above the best number reported for this architecture. We show consistent outperformance over cross-entropy on other datasets and two ResNet variants. The loss shows beneﬁts for robustness to natural corruptions, and is more stable to hyperparameter settings such as optimizers and data augmentations. Our loss function is simple to implement and reference TensorFlow code is released at https://t.ly/supcon 1.},

This observation leads us to propose a novel deep convolutional neural network architecture inspired by Inception, where Inception modules have been replaced with depthwise separable convolutions. We show that this architecture, dubbed Xception, slightly outperforms Inception V3 on the ImageNet dataset (which Inception V3 was designed for), and signiﬁcantly outperforms Inception V3 on a larger image classiﬁcation dataset comprising 350 million images and 17,000 classes. Since the Xception architecture has the same number of parameters as Inception V3, the performance gains are not due to increased capacity but rather to a more efﬁcient use of model parameters.},

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classiﬁcation: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacriﬁcing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classiﬁcation, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and ﬁnish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

Because the directions in which we smooth the model are only “virtually” adversarial, we call our method virtual adversarial training (VAT). The computational cost of VAT is relatively low. For neural networks, the approximated gradient of virtual adversarial loss can be computed with no more than two pairs of forward-and back-propagations.

We use various CNN architectures to classify the soundtracks of a dataset of 70M training videos (5.24 million hours) with 30,871 video-level labels. We examine fully connected Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), AlexNet [1], VGG [2], Inception [3], and ResNet [4]. We investigate varying the size of both training set and label vocabulary, finding that analogs of the CNNs used in image classification do well on our audio classification task, and larger training and label sets help up to a point. A model using embeddings from these classifiers does much better than raw features on the Audio Set [5] Acoustic Event Detection (AED) classification task.},

	abstract = {This paper presents SimCLR: a simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations. We simplify recently proposed contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms without requiring specialized architectures or a memory bank. In order to understand what enables the contrastive prediction tasks to learn useful representations, we systematically study the major components of our framework. We show that (1) composition of data augmentations plays a critical role in defining effective predictive tasks, (2) introducing a learnable nonlinear transformation between the representation and the contrastive loss substantially improves the quality of the learned representations, and (3) contrastive learning benefits from larger batch sizes and more training steps compared to supervised learning. By combining these findings, we are able to considerably outperform previous methods for self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. A linear classifier trained on self-supervised representations learned by SimCLR achieves 76.5\% top-1 accuracy, which is a 7\% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art, matching the performance of a supervised ResNet-50. When fine-tuned on only 1\% of the labels, we achieve 85.8\% top-5 accuracy, outperforming AlexNet with 100X fewer labels.},

In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.},

In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We also ﬁnd that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.},

A prototypical example of this is the one-shot learning setting, in which we must correctly make predictions given only a single example of each new class. In this paper, we explore a method for learning siamese neural networks which employ a unique structure to naturally rank similarity between inputs. Once a network has been tuned, we can then capitalize on powerful discriminative features to generalize the predictive power of the network not just to new data, but to entirely new classes from unknown distributions. Using a convolutional architecture, we are able to achieve strong results which exceed those of other deep learning models with near state-of-the-art performance on one-shot classiﬁcation tasks.},

	doi = {10.1145/3359139},
	abstract = {Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01\% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76\% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21\% TPR, 66.71\% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window. We end by discussing how StressMon can expand CSCW research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown the potential of exploiting GPS data for passively inferring people's mental health conditions. However, feature extraction for characterizing human mobility remains a heuristic process that relies on the domain knowledge of the condition under consideration. Moreover, we do not have guarantees that these "hand-crafted" metrics are able to eï¿¿ectively capture mobility behavior of users. Indeed, informative emerging patterns in the data might not be characterized by them. This is also a complex and often time-consuming task, since it usually consists of a lengthy trial-and-error process. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using autoencoders for automatically extracting features from the raw input data. Through a series of experiments we show the eï¿¿ectiveness of autoencoder-based features for predicting depressive states of individuals compared to "hand-crafted" ones. Our results show that automatically extracted features lead to an improvement of the performance of the prediction models, while, at the same time, reducing the complexity of the feature design task. Moreover, through an extensive experimental performance analysis, we demonstrate the optimal conï¿¿guration of the key parameters at the basis of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have shown that human movement is predictable to a certain extent at different geographic scales. The existing prediction techniques exploit only the past history of the person taken into consideration as input of the predictors. In this paper, we show that by means of multivariate nonlinear time series prediction techniques it is possible to increase the forecasting accuracy by considering movements of friends, people, or more in general entities, with correlated mobility patterns (i.e., characterised by high mutual information) as inputs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed techniques on the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge and Cabspotting datasets. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We consider a worst-case formulation over data distributions that are near the source domain in the feature space. Only using training data from a single source distribution, we propose an iterative procedure that augments the dataset with examples from a fictitious target domain that is "hard" under the current model. We show that our iterative scheme is an adaptive data augmentation method where we append adversarial examples at each iteration. For softmax losses, we show that our method is a data-dependent regularization scheme that behaves differently from classical regularizers that regularize towards zero (e.g., ridge or lasso). On digit recognition and semantic segmentation tasks, our method learns models improve performance across a range of a priori unknown target domains.},

  abstract      = {We present {CROSSGRAD}, a method to use multi-domain training data to learn a classifier that generalizes to new domains. {CROSSGRAD} does not need an adaptation phase via labeled or unlabeled data, or domain features in the new domain. Most existing domain adaptation methods attempt to erase domain signals using techniques like domain adversarial training. In contrast, {CROSSGRAD} is free to use domain signals for predicting labels, if it can prevent overfitting on training domains. We conceptualize the task in a Bayesian setting, in which a sampling step is implemented as data augmentation, based on domain-guided perturbations of input instances. {CROSSGRAD} parallelly trains a label and a domain classifier on examples perturbed by loss gradients of each other's objectives. This enables us to directly perturb inputs, without separating and re-mixing domain signals while making various distributional assumptions. Empirical evaluation on three different applications where this setting is natural establishes that (1) domain-guided perturbation provides consistently better generalization to unseen domains, compared to generic instance perturbation methods, and that (2) data augmentation is a more stable and accurate method than domain adversarial training.},

We propose Domain-Invariant Component Analysis ({DICA}), a kernel-based optimization algorithm that learns an invariant transformation by minimizing the dissimilarity across domains, whilst preserving the functional relationship between input and output variables. A learning-theoretic analysis shows that reducing dissimilarity improves the expected generalization ability of classiﬁers on new domains, motivating the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that {DICA} successfully learns invariant features and improves classiﬁer performance in practice.},

  abstract = {A major assumption in many machine learning and data mining algorithms is that the training and future data must be in the same feature space and have the same distribution. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research. Index},

We propose a new {CNN} architecture which introduces an adaptation layer and an additional domain confusion loss, to learn a representation that is both semantically meaningful and domain invariant. We additionally show that a domain confusion metric can be used for model selection to determine the dimension of an adaptation layer and the best position for the layer in the {CNN} architecture.

People express their routines through actions that they perform in the particular situations that triggered those actions. An ability to model routines and understand the situations in which they are likely to occur could allow technology to help people improve their bad habits, inexpert behavior, and other suboptimal routines. However, existing routine models do not capture the causal relationships between situations and actions that describe routines. Our main contribution is the insight that byproducts of an existing activity prediction algorithm can be used to model those causal relationships in routines. We apply this algorithm on two example datasets, and show that the modeled routines are meaningful—that they are predictive of people's actions and that the modeled causal relationships provide insights about the routines that match findings from previous research. Our approach offers a generalizable solution to model and reason about routines.},

abstract = { The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the daily life of college students, impacting their social life, education, stress levels and overall mental well-being. We study and assess behavioral changes of N=180 undergraduate college students one year prior to the pandemic as a baseline and then during the first year of the pandemic using mobile phone sensing and behavioral inference. We observe that certain groups of students experience the pandemic very differently. Furthermore, we explore the association of self-reported COVID-19 concern with students’ behavior and mental health. We find that heightened COVID-19 concern is correlated with increased depression, anxiety and stress. We evaluate the performance of different deep learning models to classify student COVID-19 concerns with an AUROC and F1 score of 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. Our study spans a two-year period and provides a number of important insights into the life of college students during this period.},

It uses a semiformal notation, called QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria), to represent the design space around an artifact. The main constituents of QOC are Questions identifying key design issues, Options providing possible answers to the Questions, and Criteria for assessing and comparing the Options. Design Space Analysis also takes account of justifications for the design (and possible alternative designs) that reflect considerations such as consistency, models and analogies, and relevant data and theory. A Design Space Analysis does not produce a record of the design process but is instead a coproduct of design and has to be constructed alongside the artifact itself. Our work is motivated by the notion that a Design Space Analysis will repay the investment in its creation by supporting both the original process of design and subsequent work on redesign and reuse by (a) providing an explicit representation to aid reasoning about the design and about the consequences of changes to it and (b) serving as a vehicle for communication, for example, among members of the design team or among the original designers and later maintainers of a system. Our work to date emphasises the nature of the QOC representation over processes for creating it, so these claims serve as goals rather than objectives we have achieved. This article describes the elements of Design Space Analysis and illustrates them by reference to analyses of existing designs and to studies of the concepts and arguments used by designers during design discussions.},

	abstract = {Many multimedia applications can benefit from techniques for adapting existing classifiers to data with different distributions. One example is cross-domain video concept detection which aims to adapt concept classifiers across various video domains. In this paper, we explore two key problems for classifier adaptation: (1) how to transform existing classifier(s) into an effective classifier for a new dataset that only has a limited number of labeled examples, and (2) how to select the best existing classifier(s) for adaptation. For the first problem, we propose Adaptive Support Vector Machines (A-SVMs) as a general method to adapt one or more existing classifiers of any type to the new dataset. It aims to learn the "delta function" between the original and adapted classifier using an objective function similar to SVMs. For the second problem, we estimate the performance of each existing classifier on the sparsely-labeled new dataset by analyzing its score distribution and other meta features, and select the classifiers with the best estimated performance. The proposed method outperforms several baseline and competing methods in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency in cross-domain concept detection in the TRECVID corpus.

	doi = {10.1145/1401890.1401928},
	abstract = {The effectiveness of knowledge transfer using classification algorithms depends on the difference between the distribution that generates the training examples and the one from which test examples are to be drawn. The task can be especially difficult when the training examples are from one or several domains different from the test domain. In this paper, we propose a locally weighted ensemble framework to combine multiple models for transfer learning, where the weights are dynamically assigned according to a model's predictive power on each test example. It can integrate the advantages of various learning algorithms and the labeled information from multiple training domains into one unified classification model, which can then be applied on a different domain. Importantly, different from many previously proposed methods, none of the base learning method is required to be specifically designed for transfer learning. We show the optimality of a locally weighted ensemble framework as a general approach to combine multiple models for domain transfer. We then propose an implementation of the local weight assignments by mapping the structures of a model onto the structures of the test domain, and then weighting each model locally according to its consistency with the neighborhood structure around the test example. Experimental results on text classification, spam filtering and intrusion detection data sets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy gained by the framework. On a transfer learning task of newsgroup message categorization, the proposed locally weighted ensemble framework achieves 97\% accuracy when the best single model predicts correctly only on 73\% of the test examples. In summary, the improvement in accuracy is over 10\% and up to 30\% across different problems. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

	doi = {10.1145/1273496.1273521},
	abstract = {Traditional machine learning makes a basic assumption: the training and test data should be under the same distribution. However, in many cases, this identical-distribution assumption does not hold. The assumption might be violated when a task from one new domain comes, while there are only labeled data from a similar old domain. Labeling the new data can be costly and it would also be a waste to throw away all the old data. In this paper, we present a novel transfer learning framework called TrAdaBoost, which extends boosting-based learning algorithms (Freund \& Schapire, 1997). TrAdaBoost allows users to utilize a small amount of newly labeled data to leverage the old data to construct a high-quality classification model for the new data. We show that this method can allow us to learn an accurate model using only a tiny amount of new data and a large amount of old data, even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone. We show that TrAdaBoost allows knowledge to be effectively transferred from the old data to the new. The effectiveness of our algorithm is analyzed theoretically and empirically to show that our iterative algorithm can converge well to an accurate model.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has increasingly been applied to classification of schizophrenia in neuroimaging research. However, direct replication studies and studies seeking to investigate generalizability are scarce. To address these issues, we assessed within-site and between-site generalizability of a machine learning classification framework which achieved excellent performance in a previous study using two independent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets collected from different sites and scanners. We established within-site generalizability of the classification framework in the main data set using cross-validation. Then, we trained a model in the main data set and investigated between-site generalization in the validated data set using external validation. Finally, recognizing the poor between-site generalization performance, we updated the unsupervised algorithm to investigate if transfer learning using additional unlabeled data were able to improve between-site classification performance. Cross-validation showed that the published classification procedure achieved an accuracy of 0.73 using majority voting across all selected components. External validation found a classification accuracy of 0.55 (not significant) and 0.70 (significant) using the direct and transfer learning procedures, respectively. The failure of direct generalization from one site to another demonstrates the limitation of within-site cross-validation and points toward the need to incorporate efforts to facilitate application of machine learning across multiple data sets. The improvement in performance with transfer learning highlights the importance of taking into account the properties of data when constructing predictive models across samples and sites. Our findings suggest that machine learning classification result based on a single study should be interpreted cautiously.},

	abstract = {A review of published work in clinical natural language processing (NLP) may suggest that the negation detection task has been ''solved.'' This work proposes that an optimizable solution does not equal a generalizable solution. We introduce a new machine learning-based Polarity Module for detecting negation in clinical text, and extensively compare its performance across domains. Using four manually annotated corpora of clinical text, we show that negation detection performance suffers when there is no in-domain development (for manual methods) or training data (for machine learning-based methods). Various factors (e.g., annotation guidelines, named entity characteristics, the amount of data, and lexical and syntactic context) play a role in making generalizability difficult, but none completely explains the phenomenon. Furthermore, generalizability remains challenging because it is unclear whether to use a single source for accurate data, combine all sources into a single model, or apply domain adaptation methods. The most reliable means to improve negation detection is to manually annotate in-domain training data (or, perhaps, manually modify rules); this is a strategy for optimizing performance, rather than generalizing it. These results suggest a direction for future work in domain-adaptive and task-adaptive methods for clinical NLP. Copyright:},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) aims at recognizing activities by training models on the large quantity of sensor data. Since it is time-consuming and expensive to acquire abundant labeled data, transfer learning becomes necessary for HAR by transferring knowledge from existing domains. However, there are two challenges existing in cross-dataset activity recognition. The first challenge is source domain selection. Given a target task and several available source domains, it is difficult to determine how to select the most similar source domain to the target domain such that negative transfer can be avoided. The second one is accurately activity transfer. After source domain selection, how to achieve accurate knowledge transfer between the selected source and the target domain remains another challenge. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Transfer Learning (ASTTL) approach to tackle both of the above two challenges in cross-dataset HAR. ASTTL learns the spatial features in transfer learning by adaptively evaluating the relative importance between the marginal and conditional probability distributions. Besides, it captures the temporal features via incremental manifold learning. Therefore, ASTTL can learn the adaptive spatial-temporal features for cross-dataset HAR and can be used for both source domain selection and accurate activity transfer. We evaluate the performance of ASTTL through extensive experiments on 4 public HAR datasets, which demonstrates its effectiveness. Furthermore, based on ASTTL, we design and implement an adaptive cross-dataset HAR system called Client-Cloud Collaborative Adaptive Activity Recognition System (3C2ARS) to perform HAR in the real environment. By collecting activities in the smartphone and transferring knowledge in the cloud server, ASTTL can significantly improve the performance of source domain selection and accurate activity transfer.},

Currently, automatic analysis of diseases in the GI tract is a hot topic in both computer science and medical-related journals. Nevertheless, the evaluation of such an automatic analysis is often incomplete or simply wrong. Algorithms are often only tested on small and biased datasets, and cross-dataset evaluations are rarely performed. A clear understanding of evaluation metrics and machine learning models with cross datasets is crucial to bring research in the field to a new quality level. Towards this goal, we present comprehensive evaluations of five distinct machine learning models using Global Features and Deep Neural Networks that can classify 16 different key types of GI tract conditions, including pathological findings, anatomical landmarks, polyp removal conditions, and normal findings from images captured by common GI tract examination instruments. In our evaluation, we introduce performance hexagons using six performance metrics such as recall, precision, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient to demonstrate how to determine the real capabilities of models rather than evaluating them shallowly. Furthermore, we perform cross-dataset evaluations using different datasets for training and testing. With these cross-dataset evaluations, we demonstrate the challenge of actually building a generalizable model that could be used across different hospitals. Our experiments clearly show that more sophisticated performance metrics and evaluation methods need to be applied to get reliable models rather than depending on evaluations of the splits of the same dataset, i.e., the performance metrics should always be interpreted together rather than relying on a single metric.},

The transformation is learned in a supervised manner and can be applied to categories for which there are no labeled examples in the new domain. While we focus our evaluation on object recognition tasks, the transform-based adaptation technique we develop is general and could be applied to non-image data. Another contribution is a new multi-domain object database, freely available for download.

In this context, our method seeks a domain adaptation solution by learning a mapping function which aligns the source subspace with the target one. We show that the solution of the corresponding optimization problem can be obtained in a simple closed form, leading to an extremely fast algorithm. We use a theoretical result to tune the unique hyper parameter corresponding to the size of the subspaces.

	abstract = {In real-world applications of visual recognition, many factors such as pose, illumination, or image quality can cause a significant mismatch between the source domain on which classifiers are trained and the target domain to which those classifiers are applied. As such, the classifiers often perform poorly on the target domain. Domain adaptation techniques aim to correct the mismatch. Existing approaches have concentrated on learning feature representations that are invariant across domains, and they often do not directly exploit low-dimensional structures that are intrinsic to many vision datasets. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based method that takes advantage of such structures. Our geodesic flow kernel models domain shift by integrating an infinite number of subspaces that characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties from the source to the target domain. Our approach is computationally advantageous, automatically inferring important algorithmic parameters without requiring extensive cross-validation or labeled data from either domain. We also introduce a metric that reliably measures the adaptability between a pair of source and target domains. For a given target domain and several source domains, the metric can be used to automatically select the optimal source domain to adapt and avoid less desirable ones. Empirical studies on standard datasets demonstrate the advantages of our approach over competing methods. © 2012 IEEE.},

We found differences in the top-10 apps in each dataset, in the durations and types of interactions as well as in micro-usage patterns. However, it proved very challenging to attribute such differences to a specific factor or set of factors: Was it the time frame in which the studies were executed? The recruitment procedure? The experimental method? Using our somewhat troubled analysis, we discuss the challenges and issues of conducting mobile research of this nature and reflect on caveats related to the replicability and generalizability of such work.},

	abstract = {Adversarial learning methods are a promising approach to training robust deep networks, and can generate complex samples across diverse domains. They can also improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias: recent adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation reduce the difference between the training and test domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) show compelling visualizations, they are not optimal on discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. On the other hand, discriminative approaches can handle larger domain shifts, but impose tied weights on the model and do not exploit a GAN-based loss. In this work, we ﬁrst outline a novel generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and use this generalized view to better relate prior approaches. We then propose a previously unexplored instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling, untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably simpler than competing domainadversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results on standard domain adaptation tasks as well as a difﬁcult cross-modality object classiﬁcation task.},

While STTP can refer to many real-world problems, most existing studies focus on quite specific applications, such as the prediction of taxi demand, ridesharing order, traffic speed, and so on. This hinders the STTP research as the approaches designed for different applications are hardly comparable, and thus how an application-driven approach can be generalized to other scenarios is unclear. To fill in this gap, this paper makes three efforts: (i) we propose an analytic framework, called STAnalytic, to qualitatively investigate STTP approaches regarding their design considerations on various spatial and temporal factors, aiming to make different application-driven approaches comparable; (ii) we design a spatio-temporal meta-model, called STMeta, which can flexibly integrate generalizable temporal and spatial knowledge identified by STAnalytic, (iii) we build an extensively large-scale STTP benchmark platform including ten datasets with five scenarios to quantitatively measure the generalizability of STTP approaches. In particular, we implement STMeta with different deep learning techniques, and STMeta demonstrates better generalizability than state-of-the-art approaches by achieving lower prediction error on average across all the datasets.},

In particular, our model learns two sets of weights: (1) bias vectors associated with each individual dataset, and (2) visual world weights that are common to all datasets, which are learned by undoing the associated bias from each dataset. The visual world weights are expected to be our best possible approximation to the object model trained on an unbiased dataset, and thus tend to have good generalization ability. We demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our model by applying the learned weights to a novel, unseen dataset, and report superior results for both classiﬁcation and detection tasks compared to a classical SVM that does not account for the presence of bias. Overall, we ﬁnd that it is beneﬁcial to explicitly account for bias when combining multiple datasets.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning for deep neural networks is the process of first training a base network on a source dataset, and then transferring the learned features (the network’s weights) to a second network to be trained on a target dataset. This idea has been shown to improve deep neural network’s generalization capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also recently gained popularity in the Time Series Classification (TSC) community. However, unlike for image recognition problems, transfer learning techniques have not yet been investigated thoroughly for the TSC task. This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the UCR archive which is the largest publicly available TSC benchmark containing 85 datasets. For each dataset in the archive, we pre-trained a model and then fine-tuned it on the other datasets resulting in 7140 different deep neural networks. These experiments revealed that transfer learning can improve or degrade the models predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer. Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target dataset, we propose a new method relying on Dynamic Time Warping to measure inter-datasets similarities. We describe how our method can guide the transfer to choose the best source dataset leading to an improvement in accuracy on 71 out of 85 datasets.},

CROSSGRAD does not need an adaptation phase via labeled or unlabeled data, or domain features in the new domain. Most existing domain adaptation methods attempt to erase domain signals using techniques like domain adversarial training. In contrast, CROSSGRAD is free to use domain signals for predicting labels, if it can prevent overfitting on training domains. We conceptualize the task in a Bayesian setting, in which a sampling step is implemented as data augmentation, based on domain-guided perturbations of input instances. CROSSGRAD parallelly trains a label and a domain classifier on examples perturbed by loss gradients of each other's objectives. This enables us to directly perturb inputs, without separating and re-mixing domain signals while making various distributional assumptions. Empirical evaluation on three different applications where this setting is natural establishes that (1) domain-guided perturbation provides consistently better generalization to unseen domains, compared to generic instance perturbation methods, and that (2) data augmentation is a more stable and accurate method than domain adversarial training.},

In this work, we propose a learning to learn approach, where the auxiliary loss that helps generalisation is itself learned. Beyond conventional domain generalisation, we consider a more challenging setting of heterogeneous domain generalisation, where the unseen domains do not share label space with the seen ones, and the goal is to train a feature representation that is useful off-the-shelf for novel data and novel categories.

To be speciﬁc, we extend adversarial autoencoders by imposing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) measure to align the distributions among different domains, and matching the aligned distribution to an arbitrary prior distribution via adversarial feature learning. In this way, the learned feature representation is supposed to be universal to the seen source domains because of the MMD regularization, and is expected to generalize well on the target domain because of the introduction of the prior distribution. We proposed an algorithm to jointly train different components of our proposed framework.

	abstract = {Domain generalization aims to learn a classiﬁcation model from multiple source domains and generalize it to unseen target domains. A critical problem in domain generalization involves learning domaininvariant representations. Let X and Y denote the features and the labels, respectively. Under the assumption that the conditional distribution P (Y {\textbar}X) remains unchanged across domains, earlier approaches to domain generalization learned the invariant representation T (X) by minimizing the discrepancy of the marginal distribution P (T (X)). However, such an assumption of stable P (Y {\textbar}X) does not necessarily hold in practice. In addition, the representation learning function T (X) is usually constrained to a simple linear transformation or shallow networks. To address the above two drawbacks, we propose an end-to-end conditional invariant deep domain generalization approach by leveraging deep neural networks for domain-invariant representation learning. The domain-invariance property is guaranteed through a conditional invariant adversarial network that can learn domain-invariant representations w.r.t. the joint distribution P (T (X), Y ) if the target domain data are not severely class unbalanced. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Learning decent representations from unlabeled time-series data with temporal dynamics is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised Time-Series representation learning framework via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting (TS-TCC), to learn time-series representation from unlabeled data. First, the raw timeseries data are transformed into two different yet correlated views by using weak and strong augmentations. Second, we propose a novel temporal contrasting module to learn robust temporal representations by designing a tough cross-view prediction task. Last, to further learn discriminative representations, we propose a contextual contrasting module built upon the contexts from the temporal contrasting module. It attempts to maximize the similarity among different contexts of the same sample while minimizing similarity among contexts of different samples. Experiments have been carried out on three real-world time-series datasets. The results manifest that training a linear classiﬁer on top of the features learned by our proposed TS-TCC performs comparably with the supervised training. Additionally, our proposed TS-TCC shows high efﬁciency in few-labeled data and transfer learning scenarios. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TS-TCC.},

	abstract = {An integrated framework for density-based cluster analysis, outlier detection, and data visualization is introduced in this article. The main module consists of an algorithm to compute hierarchical estimates of the level sets of a density, following Hartigan’s classic model of density-contour clusters and trees. Such an algorithm generalizes and improves existing density-based clustering techniques with respect to different aspects. It provides as a result a complete clustering hierarchy composed of all possible density-based clusters following the nonparametric model adopted, for an infinite range of density thresholds. The resulting hierarchy can be easily processed so as to provide multiple ways for data visualization and exploration. It can also be further postprocessed so that: (i) a normalized score of “outlierness” can be assigned to each data object, which unifies both the global and local perspectives of outliers into a single definition; and (ii) a “flat” (i.e., nonhierarchical) clustering solution composed of clusters extracted from local cuts through the cluster tree (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds) can be obtained, either in an unsupervised or in a semisupervised way. In the unsupervised scenario, the algorithm corresponding to this postprocessing module provides a global, optimal solution to the formal problem of maximizing the overall stability of the extracted clusters. If partially labeled objects or instance-level constraints are provided by the user, the algorithm can solve the problem by considering both constraints violations/satisfactions and cluster stability criteria. An asymptotic complexity analysis, both in terms of running time and memory space, is described. Experiments are reported that involve a variety of synthetic and real datasets, including comparisons with state-of-the-art, density-based clustering and (global and local) outlier detection methods.},

	abstract = {Dual-process theories hold that there are two distinct processing modes available for many cognitive tasks: one (type 1) that is fast, automatic and non-conscious, and another (type 2) that is slow, controlled and conscious. Typically, cognitive biases are attributed to type 1 processes, which are held to be heuristic or associative, and logical responses to type 2 processes, which are characterised as rule-based or analytical. Dual-system theories go further and assign these two types of process to two separate reasoning systems, System 1 and System 2 – a view sometimes described as ‘the two minds hypothesis’. It is often claimed that System 2 is uniquely human and the source of our capacity for abstract and hypothetical thinking. This study is an introduction to dual-process and dual-system theories. It looks at some precursors, surveys key work in the fields of learning, reasoning, social cognition and decision making, and identifies some recent trends and philosophical applications.},

abstract = {Active and passive sensing technologies are providing powerful mechanisms to track, model, and understand a range of health behaviors and well-being states. Despite yielding rich, dense and high fidelity data, current sensing technologies often require highly engineered study designs and persistent participant compliance, making them difficult to scale to large populations and to data acquisition tasks spanning extended time periods. This paper situates social media as a new passive, unobtrusive sensing technology. We propose a semi-supervised machine learning framework to combine small samples of data gathered through active sensing, with large-scale social media data to infer mood instability (MI) in individuals. Starting from a theoretically-grounded measure of MI obtained from mobile ecological momentary assessments (EMAs), we show that our model is able to infer MI in a large population of Twitter users with 96\% accuracy and F-1 score. Additionally, we show that, our model predicts self-identifying Twitter users with bipolar and borderline personality disorder to exhibit twice the likelihood of high MI, compared to that in a suitable control. We discuss the implications and the potential for integrating complementary sensing capabilities to address complex research challenges in precision medicine.},
