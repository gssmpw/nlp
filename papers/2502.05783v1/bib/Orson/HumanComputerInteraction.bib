	abstract = {Context-aware applications are applications that implicitly take their context of use into account by adapting to changes in a user's activities and environments. No one has more intimate knowledge about these activities and environments than end-users themselves. Currently there is no support for end-users to build context-aware applications for these dynamic settings. To address this issue, we present a CAPpella, a programming by demonstration Context-Aware Prototyping environment intended for end-users. Users "program" their desired context-aware behavior (situation and associated action) in situ, without writing any code, by demonstrating it to a CAPpella and by annotating the relevant portions of the demonstration. Using a meeting and medicine-taking scenario, we illustrate how a user can demonstrate different behaviors to a CAPpella. We describe a CAPpella's underlying system to explain how it supports users in building behaviors and present a study of 14 end-users to illustrate its feasibility and usability.},

We study how humans sketch time series patterns — humans preserve visually salient perceptual features but often non-uniformly scale and locally distort a pattern — and we develop a novel matching algorithm that accounts for human sketching errors. Qetch enables the easy construction of complex and expressive queries with two key features: regular expressions over sketches and relative po-sitioning of sketches to query multiple time-aligned series. Through user studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Qetch's different interaction features. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Qetch's matching algorithm compared to popular algorithms on targeted, and exploratory query-by-sketch search tasks on a variety of data sets.},

Yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. By collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the Amazon Echo in participants’ homes—informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis—our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. Data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing ‘conversational’ interfaces.},

In our agile 3D sketching workflow with air scaffolding, in which hand motion and pen drawing complement each other, (a) the user makes unconstrained hand movements in the air to quickly generate rough shapes to be used as scaffolds, (b) uses the scaffolds as references and draws finer details with them (c) in an iterative and progressive manner to produce a high-fidelity 3D concept sketch of a steering wheel. ABSTRACT Hand motion and pen drawing can be intuitive and expressive inputs for professional digital 3D authoring. However, their inherent limitations have hampered wider adoption. 3D sketching using hand motion is rapid but rough, and 3D sketching using pen drawing is delicate but tedious. Our new 3D sketching workflow combines these two in a complementary manner. The user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3D shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3D sketching on a tablet device. Our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. Then, the user sketches 3D ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed. A user study shows that our progressive and iterative workflow enables more agile 3D sketching compared to ones using either hand motion or pen drawing alone.},

In many cases, they make up a majority of readily accessible indoor surface area, and yet they are static – their primary function is to be a wall, separating spaces and hiding infrastructure. We pre-sent Wall++, a low-cost sensing approach that allows walls to become a smart infrastructure. Instead of merely separat-ing spaces, walls can now enhance rooms with sensing and interactivity. Our wall treatment and sensing hardware can track users' touch and gestures, as well as estimate body pose if they are close. By capturing airborne electromagnet-ic noise, we can also detect what appliances are active and where they are located. Through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate Wall++ can enable robust room-scale interac-tive and context-aware applications.},

Although such gestures are appropriate for early investigations, they are not necessarily reflective of user behavior. We present an approach to designing tabletop gestures that relies on eliciting gestures from non-technical users by first portraying the effect of a gesture, and then asking users to perform its cause. In all, 1080 gestures from 20 participants were logged, analyzed, and paired with think-aloud data for 27 commands performed with 1 and 2 hands. Our findings indicate that users rarely care about the number of fingers they employ, that one hand is preferred to two, that desktop idioms strongly influence users' mental models, and that some commands elicit little gestural agreement, suggesting the need for on-screen widgets. We also present a complete user-defined gesture set, quantitative agreement scores, implications for surface technology, and a taxonomy of surface gestures. Our results will help designers create better gesture sets informed by user behavior.},

However, little is known about best-practices in motion gesture design for the mobile computing paradigm. To address this issue, we present the results of a guessability study that elicits end-user motion gestures to invoke commands on a smartphone device. We demonstrate that consensus exists among our participants on parameters of movement and on mappings of motion gestures onto commands. We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set. We highlight the implications of this work to the design of smartphone applications and hardware. Finally, we argue that our results influence best practices in design for all gestural interfaces.

Therefore, it is extremely important to conduct research to find successful antibacterial therapies. In this paper, we evaluated the in vitro bactericidal activity of flavonoids and aromatic geranyl derivatives isolated from the resinous exudate of species Heliotropium filifolium, H. sinuatum y H. huascoense. The results showed that the compounds Filifolinone, Naringenine and 3-O-methylgalangine cause different percentage of mortality of bacteria and therefore they are good candidates to continue its evaluation in vitro and in vivo.},

The visual and spatial cues of such body landmarks can help in localizing on-body interfaces, guide input on the body, and allow for easy recall of mappings. Our main contribution are SkinMarks, novel skin-worn I/O devices for precisely localized input and output on fine body landmarks. SkinMarks comprise skin electronics on tempo-rary rub-on tattoos. They conform to fine wrinkles and are compatible with strongly curved and elastic body locations. We identify five types of body landmarks and demonstrate novel interaction techniques that leverage SkinMarks’ unique touch, squeeze and bend sensing with integrated visual out-put. Finally, we detail on the conformality and evaluate sub-millimeter electrodes for touch sensing. Taken together, SkinMarks expands the on-body interaction space to more de-tailed, highly curved and challenging areas on the body.},

As for the operation of EarTouch, the shape deformation of the ear is measured by optical sensors. Deformation of the skin caused by touching the ear with the fingers is recognized by attaching optical sensors to the earphone and measuring the distance from the earphone to the skin inside the ear.

Such on-body interfaces offer new interac- tive possibilities, and the promise of access to computation, communication and information literally in the palm of our hands. The unique context of on-body interaction allows us to take advantage of extra dimensions of input our bodies naturally afford us. In this paper, we consider how the arms and hands can be used to enhance on-body interactions, which is typically finger input centric. To explore this op- portunity, we developed Armura, a novel interactive on- body system, supporting both input and graphical output. Using this platform as a vehicle for exploration, we proto- typed many applications and interactions. This helped to confirm chief use modalities, identify fruitful interaction approaches, and in general, better understand how interfaces operate on the body. We highlight the most compelling techniques we uncovered. Further, this paper is the first to consider and prototype how conventional interaction issues, such as cursor control and clutching, apply to the on-body domain. Finally, we bring to light several new and unique interaction techniques.},

We explore Hand-to-Face interaction to find suitable techniques for common mobile tasks. We evaluate this form of interaction with document navigation tasks and examine its social acceptability. In a first study, users identify the cheek and forehead as predominant areas for interaction and agree on gestures for tasks involving continuous input, such as document navigation. These results guide the design of several Hand-to-Face navigation techniques and reveal that gestures performed on the cheek are more efficient and less tiring than interactions directly on the HWD. Initial results on the social acceptability of Hand-to-Face input allow us to further refine our design choices, and reveal unforeseen results: Some gestures are considered culturally inappropriate and gender plays a role in selection of specific Hand-to-Face interactions. From our overall results, we provide a set of guidelines for developing effective Hand-to-Face interaction techniques.},

In this work, we describe a novel, real-time, sound-based activity recognition system. We start by taking an existing, state-of-the-art sound labeling model, which we then tune to classes of interest by drawing data from professional sound effect libraries traditionally used in the entertainment industry. These well-labeled and high-quality sounds are the perfect atomic unit for data augmentation, including amplitude, reverb, and mixing , allowing us to exponentially grow our tuning data in realistic ways. We quantify the performance of our approach across a range of environments and device categories and show that microphone-equipped computing devices already have the requisite capability to unlock real-time activity recognition comparable to human accuracy.},

Our system uses a Support Vector Machine to determine the gestures: pushing face up and down, left and right. We combined these 4 directional gestures for each cheek to extend 16 possible gestures. To evaluate the accuracy of the gesture detection, we conducted a user study. The results revealed that CheekInput achieved 80.45 \% recognition accuracy when gestures were made by touching both cheeks with both hands, and 74.58 \% when by touching both cheeks with one hand.},

We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of guidelines for human-AI interaction design.},

The framework comprises of an eye tracker and a foot-operated quasi-mouse that is wearable. The system evaluation shows that our gaze and foot interaction framework performs as good as a mouse (time and precision) in the majority of tasks. Furthermore, this dissertation work focuses on the goal of realizing gaze-assisted interaction as a primary interaction modality to substitute conventional mouse and keyboard-based interaction methods.

We compare a foot tapping technique for menu interaction with two more traditional situations: one where the user has the phone in hand, and one where the user must remove it from an inside pocket before interacting. Results show that over the course of the full study, all conditions allowed a high level of accuracy in selections. The visual and in pocket conditions were overall faster and more accurate. However, for short selections requiring four or less foot taps or button presses the foot tap condition was faster than the in pocket condition.},

This exploratory study presents a system capable of different kinds of interactions based on varying the temporal characteristics of the output, using the sound of human walking as the input. The system either provides a direct synthesis of a walking sound based on the detected amplitude envelope of the user's footstep sounds, or provides a continuous synthetic walking sound as a stimulus for the walking human, either with a fixed tempo or a tempo adapting to the human gait. In a pilot experiment, the different interaction modes are studied with respect to their effect on the walking tempo and the experience of the subjects. The results tentatively outline different user profiles in interacting with such a system. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

We studied pragmatic and hedonic aspects of the prototype during a pedestrian navigation task in a city center. We found that, despite the potential risk of overwhelming people with information, participants were able to keep track of their surroundings as they dealt with incoming notifications. Participants also positively valued the use of a discreet device to provide input for interactive glasses.

Secondly, we analyze how these negative effects can be compensated by increasing the text size and the size of the targets to select on the mobile phone. A comparative user study was conducted with 16 participants who performed target acquisition and reading tasks while standing and walking. The results show that whilst performance decreases, cognitive load increases significantly when reading and selecting targets when walking. Furthermore, the results show that the negative effect regarding target selection can be compensated by increasing the target size, but the text reading task did not yield better performance results for a larger text size due to the increased demand for scrolling. These results can be used to inform future designs of mobile user interfaces which might provide a dedicated walking mode. © 2010 ACM.},

In this work, we focus on a user-defined gesture that is designed by the end-users, not developers of this system. We first conduct a guessability study that asks people what is the appropriate gesture for a specific command to control the computing device. Then, we implement a gesture recognizer with a machine learning technique. To avoid unexpected gesture activations, we also collect foot plantar pressure patterns made during daily activities such as walking, as negative training data. Finally, we conclude with several applications to further illustrate the utility of FPB gestures.},

We asked 22 participants to input text under three mobility conditions (seated, slow walking, and normal walking) and three hand conditions (one-hand/portrait, two-hand/portrait, and two-hand/landscape). Results show that independently of hand condition, mobility significantly decreased input quality, leading to specific error patterns. Moreover, it was shown that target size can compensate the negative effect of walking, while two-hand interaction does not provide additional stability or input accuracy.

Extent refers to the size of an environment, whereas scale refers to whether people have to travel through an environment to see the detail necessary for navigation. Each participant was provided with full body-based information (walking through the virtual marketplaces in a large tracking hall or on an omnidirectional treadmill), just the translational component of body-based information (walking on a linear treadmill, but turning with a joystick), just the rotational component (physically turning but using a joystick to translate) or no body-based information (joysticks to translate and rotate). In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants' cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants' navigational performance. The experiments show that locomotion devices such as linear treadmills would bring substantial benefits to virtual environment applications where large spaces are navigated, and theories of human navigation need to reconsider the contribution made by body-based information, and distinguish between environmental scale and extent. © 2011 ACM 1073-0516/2011/06-ART10 \$10.00.},

In this work, we study the human capability associated with performing foot-based interactions which involve lifting and rotation of the foot when pivoting on the toe and heel. Building upon these results, we then developed a system to learn and recognize foot gestures using a single commodity mobile phone placed in the user's pocket or in a holster on their hip. Our system uses acceleration data recorded by a built-in accelerometer on the mobile device and a machine learning approach to recognizing gestures.

Following a taxonomy development method, this article provides three main contributions: First, we present a structured overview of interdisciplinary research on the role of humans in the machine learning pipeline. Second, we envision hybrid intelligence systems and conceptualize the relevant dimensions for system design for the first time. Finally, we offer useful guidance for system developers during the implementation of such applications.},

	abstract = {Despite growing awareness of the accessibility issues surrounding touch screen use by blind people, designers still face challenges when creating accessible touch screen interfaces. One major stumbling block is a lack of understanding about how blind people actually use touch screens. We conducted two user studies that compared how blind people and sighted people use touch screen gestures. First, we conducted a gesture elicitation study in which 10 blind and 10 sighted people invented gestures to perform common computing tasks on a tablet PC. We found that blind people have different gesture preferences than sighted people, including preferences for edge-based gestures and gestures that involve tapping virtual keys on a keyboard. Second, we conducted a performance study in which the same participants performed a set of reference gestures. We found significant differences in the speed, size, and shape of gestures performed by blind people versus those performed by sighted people. Our results suggest new design guidelines for accessible touch screen interfaces. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

	abstract = {We present McSig, a multimodal system for teaching blind children cursive handwriting so that they can create a personal signature. For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example, to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher's stylus gestures into three non-visual forms: (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen that mimics the teacher's stylus movement; and (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen. McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig's effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness ofMcSig-they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons, two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting. Furthermore, during this project, we have learnt valuable lessons about providing consistent feedback between different communications channels (by manual interactions, haptic device, pen correction) that will be of interest to others developing multimodal systems.

Therefore, we de-veloped a new Braille-based text input method named EdgeBraille, which allows entering Braille characters by swiping one finger along the edges of the touchscreen. The approach was compared with the current standard method of a talking keyboard, first in a short-term lab study (14 participants) and then during two weeks of daily training (7 participants). Overall EdgeBraille was perceived well by the users. In terms of user performance we found no significant differences between the two methods. Based on the evaluation results and the feedback of our participants, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of Braille-based methods in general and EdgeBraille in particular, as well as possibilities for improvements. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

This is enabled by describing the atomic interactive components of a device and capturing the semantics of interactions with the device. We propose a taxonomy of abstract sensing and actuation primitives and present a smartphone application that can act as a ubiquitous device controller. An evaluation of the mobile application in a laboratory setup, home environments, and an educational setting as well as the results of a user study highlight the accessibility of the proposed scheme for application developers and its suitability for controlling smart devices.},

However, there are few methods to organize and notate user-deﬁned gestures in a systematic approach. To resolve this, we propose a threedimensional (3D) Hand Gesture Taxonomy and Notation Method. We ﬁrst derived elements of a hand gesture by analyzing related studies and subsequently developed the 3D Hand Gesture Taxonomy based on the elements. Moreover, we devised a Notation Method based on a combination of the elements and also matched a code to each element for easy notation. Finally, we have veriﬁed the usefulness of the Notation Method by training participants to notate hand gestures and by asking another set of participants to recreate the notated gestures. In short, this research proposes a novel and systematic approach to notate hand gesture commands.},

We also discovered that the differences between gesture sets are mostly due to association errors (rather than gesture form errors), that participants prefer user-defined sets, and that they think user-defined gestures take less time to learn. Finally, we contribute a qualitative analysis of the tradeoffs involved in gesture type selection and share our data and a video corpus of 66 gestures for replicability and further analysis.},

To understand the end-user gesture creation process, we conducted a study where 20 participants were asked to: (1) exhaustively create new gestures for an openended use case; (2) exhaustively create new gestures for 12 specific use cases; (3) judge the saliency of different touchscreen gesture features. Our findings showed that even when asked to create novel gestures, participants tended to focus on the familiar. Misconceptions about the gesture recognizer’s abilities were also evident, and in some cases constrained the range of gestures that participants created. Finally, as a calibration point for future research, we used a simple gesture recognizer (\$N) to analyze recognition accuracy of the participants’ custom gesture sets: accuracy was 68–88\% on average, depending on the amount of training and the customization scenario. We conclude with implications for the design of a mixed-initiative approach to support custom gesture creation.},

Although the data extracted from IMU sensors are time-dependent, most existing HGR algorithms do not consider this characteristic, which results in the degradation of recognition performance. Because the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique considers the time-dependent characteristic of IMU sensor data, the recognition performance of DTW-based algorithms is better than that of others. However, the DTW technique requires a very complex learning algorithm, which makes it difﬁcult to support real-time learning. To solve this issue, the proposed HGR algorithm is based on a restricted column energy (RCE) neural network, which has a very simple learning scheme in which neurons are activated when necessary. By replacing the metric calculation of the RCE neural network with DTW distance, the proposed algorithm exhibits superior recognition performance for time-dependent sensor data while supporting real-time learning. Our veriﬁcation results on a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based test platform show that the proposed HGR algorithm can achieve a recognition accuracy of 98.6\% and supports real-time learning and recognition at an operating frequency of 150 MHz.},

Through a user study, we examine the impact of performing 8 distinct gestures (4 directional marks, and 4 free-form shapes) on the stability of the watch surface. Participants were able to perform directional marks using the wrist as a joystick at an average rate of half a second and free-form shapes at an average rate of approximately 1.5secs. The free-form shapes could be recognized by a \$1 gesture recognizer with an accuracy of 93.8\% and by three human inspectors with an accuracy of 85\%. From these results, we designed and implemented a proof-of-concept device by augmenting the watchband using an array of proximity sensors, which can be used to draw gestures with high quality.

	abstract = {Digits is a wrist-worn sensor that recovers the full 3D pose of the user’s hand. This enables a variety of freehand interactions on the move. The system targets mobile settings, and is speciﬁcally designed to be low-power and easily reproducible using only off-the-shelf hardware. The electronics are self-contained on the user’s wrist, but optically image the entirety of the user’s hand. This data is processed using a new pipeline that robustly samples key parts of the hand, such as the tips and lower regions of each ﬁnger. These sparse samples are fed into new kinematic models that leverage the biomechanical constraints of the hand to recover the 3D pose of the user’s hand. The proposed system works without the need for full instrumentation of the hand (for example using data gloves), additional sensors in the environment, or depth cameras which are currently prohibitive for mobile scenarios due to power and form-factor considerations. We demonstrate the utility of Digits for a variety of application scenarios, including 3D spatial interaction with mobile devices, eyes-free interaction on-the-move, and gaming. We conclude with a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our system, and discussion of strengths, limitations and future work.},

	abstract = {The automatic recognition of how people use their hands and fngers in natural settings – without instrumenting the fngers – can be useful for many mobile computing applications. To achieve such an interface, we propose a vision-based 3D hand pose estimation framework using a wrist-worn camera. The main challenge is the oblique angle of the wrist-worn camera, which makes the fngers scarcely visible. To address this, a special network that observes deformations on the back of the hand is required. We introduce DorsalNet, a two-stream convolutional neural network to regress fnger joint angles from spatio-temporal features of the dorsal hand region (the movement of bones, muscle, and tendons). This work is the frst vision-based real-time 3D hand pose estimator using visual features from the dorsal hand region. Our system achieves a mean joint-angle error of 8.81° for user-specifc models and 9.77° for a general model. Further evaluation shows that our system outperforms previous work with an average of 20\% higher accuracy in recognizing dynamic gestures, and achieves a 75\% accuracy of detecting 11 different grasp types. We also demonstrate 3 applications which employ our system as a control device, an input device, and a grasped object recognizer.},

Our approach employs a camera on the wrist, with a view of the opisthenar (back of the hand) area. We envisage such cameras being included in a wrist-worn device such as a smartwatch, ftness tracker or wristband. Indeed, selected off-the-shelf smartwatches now incorporate a built-in camera on the side for photography purposes. However, in this confguration, the fngers are occluded from the view of the camera. The oblique angle and placement of the camera make typical vision-based techniques diffcult to adopt. Our alternative approach observes small movements and changes in the shape, tendons, skin and bones on the opisthenar area. We train deep neural networks to recognize both hand poses and dynamic fnger tapping gestures. While this is a challenging confguration for sensing, we tested the recognition with a real-time user test and achieved a high recognition rate of 89.4\% (static poses) and 67.5\% (dynamic gestures). Our results further demonstrate that our approach can generalize across sessions and to new users. Namely, users can remove and replace the wrist-worn device while new users can employ a previously trained system, to a certain degree. We conclude by demonstrating three applications and suggest future avenues of work based on sensing the back of the hand.},

Their position on the wrist makes them ideal for capturing bio-acoustic signals. We developed a custom smartwatch kernel that boosts the sampling rate of a smartwatch’s existing accelerometer to 4 kHz. Using this new source of high-fidelity data, we uncovered a wide range of applications. For example, we can use bio-acoustic data to classify hand gestures such as flicks, claps, scratches, and taps, which combine with on-device motion tracking to create a wide range of expressive input modalities. Bioacoustic sensing can also detect the vibrations of grasped mechanical or motor-powered objects, enabling passive object recognition that can augment everyday experiences with context-aware functionality. Finally, we can generate structured vibrations using a transducer, and show that data can be transmitted through the human body. Overall, our contributions unlock user interface techniques that previously relied on special-purpose and/or cumbersome instrumentation, making such interactions considerably more feasible for inclusion in future consumer devices.},

Our evaluation shows that ﬁngerIO can achieve 2-D ﬁnger tracking with an average accuracy of 8 mm using the in-built microphones and speaker of a Samsung Galaxy S4.

The key challenges in creating such a system are (1) to sense useful hand gestures at ultra-low power so that the device can be powered by the limited energy harvestable from the surrounding environment and (2) to make the system work reliably without requiring training every time a user puts on the wristband. We present successive capacitance sensing, an ultra-low power sensing technique, to capture small skin deformations due to muscle and tendon movements on the user’s wrist, which corresponds to speci�c groups of wrist muscles representing the gestures being performed. We build a wrist muscles-to-gesture model, based on which we develop a hand gesture classi�cation method using both motion and static features. To eliminate the need for per-usage training, we propose a kernel-based on-wrist localization technique to detect the CapBand’s position on the user’s wrist. We prototype CapBand with a custom-designed capacitance sensor array on two� exible circuits driven by a custom-built electronic board, a heterogeneous material-made, deformable silicone band, and a custom-built energy harvesting and management module. Evaluations on 20 subjects show 95.0\% accuracy of gesture recognition when recognizing 15 di�erent hand gestures and 95.3\% accuracy of on-wrist localization.},

	abstract = {Recognition of human gestures plays an important role in a number of human-interactive applications, such as mobile phones, health monitoring systems, and human-assistive robots. Electromyography (EMG) is one of the most common and intuitive methods used for detecting gestures based on muscle activities. The EMG, however, is in general, too sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as electrical noise, electromagnetic signals, humidity, and so on. In this paper, a new method for recognizing the muscular activities is proposed based on air-pressure sensors and air-bladders. The muscular activity is detected by measuring the change of the air pressure in an air-bladder contacting the interested muscle(s). Since the change of the air pressure can be more robustly measured compared with the change of electric signals appeared on the skin, the proposed sensing method is useful for mobile devices due to its great signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fast response time. The principle and applications of the proposed sensing method are introduced in this paper. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of linearity, repeatability, wear-comfort, etc., and is also verified by comparing it with an EMG signal and a motion sensor.},

In this paper, we introduce uTrack, a technique to convert the thumb and fingers into a 3D input system using magnetic field (MF) sensing. A user wears a pair of magnetometers on the back of their fingers and a permanent magnet affixed to the back of the thumb. By moving the thumb across the fingers, we obtain a continuous input stream that can be used for 3D pointing. Specifically, our novel algorithm calculates the magnet’s 3D position and tilt angle directly from the sensor readings. We evaluated uTrack as an input device, showing an average tracking accuracy of 4.84 mm in 3D space – sufficient for subtle interaction. We also demonstrate a real-time prototype and example applications allowing users to interact with the computer using 3D finger input.},

To keep the system robust to noise, we operate each electromagnet at a different frequency and leverage bandpass filters to distinguish signals attributed to individual sensing points. We develop a novel algorithm to efficiently calculate the 3D positions of multiple electromagnets from corresponding field strengths.

FingerTrak explores the feasibility of continuously reconstructing the entire hand postures (20 finger joints positions) without the needs of seeing all fingers. We demonstrate that our system is able to estimate the entire hand posture by observing only the outline of the hand, i.e., hand silhouettes from the wrist using low-resolution (32 × 24) thermal cameras. A customized deep neural network is developed to learn to ”stitch” these multi-view images and estimate 20 joints positions in 3D space. Our user study with 11 participants shows that the system can achieve an average angular error of 6.46◦ when tested under the same background, and 8.06◦ when tested under a different background. FingerTrak also shows encouraging results with the re-mounting of the device and has the potential to reconstruct some of the complicated poses.

For training, the system employs dynamic time warping as well as affinity propagation to create exemplars for each gesture while for testing, the system projects all candidate traces and also the unknown trace onto the same lower dimensional subspace for recognition. A dictionary of 18 gestures is defined and a database of over 3700 traces is created from seven subjects on which the system is tested and evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, our dictionary of gestures is the largest in published studies related to acceleration-based gesture recognition. The system achieves almost perfect user-dependent recognition, and mixed-user and user-independent recognition accuracies that are highly competitive with systems based on statistical methods and with the other accelerometer-based gesture recognition systems available in the literature.},

In this work we present Serendipity, a new technique for recognizing unremarkable and fine-motor finger gestures using integrated motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in off-the-shelf smartwatches. Our system demonstrates the potential to distinguish 5 fine-motor gestures like pinching, tapping and rubbing fingers with an average f1-score of 87\%. Our work is the first to explore the feasibility of using solely motion sensors on everyday wearable devices to detect fine-grained gestures.

	abstract = {Smartwatch is becoming one of the most popular wearable device with many major smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung and Apple releasing their smartwatches recently. Apart from the ﬁtness applications, the smartwatch provides a rich user interface that has enabled many applications like instant messaging and email. Since the smartwatch is worn on the wrist, it introduces a unique opportunity to understand user’s arm, hand and possibly ﬁnger movements using its accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Although user’s arm and hand gestures are likely to be identiﬁed with ease using the smartwatch sensors, it is not clear how much of user’s ﬁnger gestures can be recognized. In this paper, we show that motion energy measured at the smartwatch is suﬃcient to uniquely identify user’s hand and ﬁnger gestures. We identify essential features of accelerometer and gyroscope data that reﬂect the movements of tendons (passing through the wrist) when performing a ﬁnger or a hand gesture. With these features, we build a classiﬁer that can uniquely identify 37 (13 ﬁnger, 14 hand and 10 arm) gestures with an accuracy of 98\%. We further extend our gesture recognition to identify the characters written by the user with her index ﬁnger on a surface, and show that such ﬁnger-writing can also be accurately recognized with nearly 95\% accuracy. Our presented results will enable many novel applications like remote control and ﬁnger-writing-based input to devices using smartwatch.},

Our system allows a user to demonstrate input gestures and manipulations directly to the system, teaching it the desired mappings by example. We developed a musical control application in which userdefined gestures and user-assigned manipulations trigger and modify sounds. The effectiveness of our system was tested by experimentally comparing our user-definable system to a similar, pre-configured version. The results suggest that users prefer to actively configure a physical interface to having expertly-configured presets. In addition, we propose our model as a more general mapping discovery tool for physical interface designers.},

However, their lack of scalability is a major challenge for their wide adoption. In this paper, we present Gesture Marks, a novel approach to touch-gesture interaction that allows a user to access applications and websites using gestures without having to define them first. It offers two distinctive solutions to address the problem of scalability. First, it leverages the “wisdom of the crowd”, a continually evolving library of gesture shortcuts that are collected from the user population, to infer the meaning of gestures that a user never defined himself. Second, it combines an extensible template-based gesture recognizer with a specialized handwriting recognizer to even better address handwriting-based gestures, which are a common form of gesture shortcut. These approaches effectively bootstrap a user’s personal gesture library, alleviating the need to define most gestures manually. Our work was motivated and validated via a series of user studies, and the findings from these studies add to the body of knowledge on gesture-based interaction.},

To develop a richer characterization of use, we turned to a previously untapped source of data: YouTube videos. We collected and analyzed 187 noncommercial videos uploaded to YouTube that depicted a person with a physical disability interacting with a mainstream mobile touchscreen device. We coded the videos along a range of dimensions to characterize the interaction, the challenges encountered, and the adaptations being adopted in daily use. To complement the video data, we also invited the video uploaders to complete a survey on their ongoing use of touchscreen technology. Our findings show that, while many people with motor impairments find these devices empowering, accessibility issues still exist. In addition to providing implications for more accessible touchscreen design, we reflect on the application of usergenerated content to study user interface design.},

In all, 1080 gestures from 20 participants were logged, analyzed, and paired with think-aloud data for 27 commands performed with 1 and 2 hands. Our findings indicate that users rarely care about the number of fingers they employ, that one hand is preferred to two, that desktop idioms strongly influence users’ mental models, and that some commands elicit little gestural agreement, suggesting the need for on-screen widgets. We also present a complete user-defined gesture set, quantitative agreement scores, implications for surface technology, and a taxonomy of surface gestures.

We use this consensus to develop a taxonomy for motion gestures and to specify an end-user inspired motion gesture set.

Developers can easily test the generated code in Gesture Coder, refine it by adding more examples and, once they are satisfied with its performance, integrate the code into their applications. We evaluated our learning algorithm exhaustively with various conditions over a large set of noisy data. Our results show that it is sufficient for rapid prototyping and can be improved with higher quality and more training data. We also evaluated Gesture Coder’s usability through a withinsubject study in which we asked participants to implement a set of multi-touch interactions with and without Gesture Coder.

However, the static nature of paper does not support a number of capabilities, such as search and hyperlinking that an electronic device can provide. The Paper PDA project explores ways in which hybrid paper electronic interfaces can bring some of the capabilities of the electronic medium to interactions occurring on real paper. Key to this effort is the invention of on-paper interaction techniques which retain the flexibility and fluidity of normal pen and paper, but which are structured enough to allow robust interpretation and processing in the digital world. This paper considers the design of a class of simple printed templates that allow users to make common marks in a fluid fashion, and allow additional gestures to be invented by the users to meet their needs, but at the same time encourages marks that are quite easy to recognize.},

We present a touchless, gesture-based interaction framework for the operating room that lets surgeons deﬁne a personalized set of gestures for controlling arbitrary medical computerized systems. Instead of using cameras for capturing gestures, we rely on a few wireless inertial sensors, placed on the arms of the surgeon, eliminating the dependence on illumination and line-ofsight. A discriminative gesture recognition approach based on kernel regression allows us to simultaneously classify performed gestures and to track the relative spatial pose within each gesture, giving surgeons ﬁne-grained control of continuous parameters. An extensible software architecture enables a dynamic association of learned gestures to arbitrary intraoperative computerized systems.

The objective of this work is to propose the utilization of commodity smartwatches for such purpose. Smartwatches embed accelerometer sensors, and they are endowed with wireless communication capabilities (primarily Bluetooth), so as to connect with mobile phones on which gesture recognition algorithms may be executed. The algorithmic approach proposed in this paper accepts as the input readings from the smartwatch accelerometer sensors and processes them on the mobile phone. As a case study, the gesture recognition application was developed for Android devices and the Pebble smartwatch. This application allows the user to define the set of gestures and to train the system to recognize them. Three alternative methodologies were implemented and evaluated using a set of six 3-D natural gestures. All the reported results are quite satisfactory, while the method based on SAX (Symbolic Aggregate approXimation) was proven the most efficient.},

However, current research eﬀorts have not tackled the problem of personalized gesture recognition that often involves user identiﬁcation. To address this problem, we propose in this work a new event-driven service-oriented framework called gesture services for cyber-physical environments (GS-CPE) that extends the architecture of our previous work gesture proﬁle for web services (GPWS). To provide user identiﬁcation functionality, GS-CPE introduces a two-phase cascading gesture password recognition algorithm for gesture-based user identiﬁcation using a two-phase cascading classiﬁer with the hidden Markov model and the Golden Section Search, which achieves an accuracy rate of 96.2\% with a small training dataset. To support personalized gesture interaction, an enhanced version of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm with multiple gestural input sources and dynamic template adaptation support is implemented. Our experimental results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm can achieve an average accuracy rate of 98.5\% in practical scenarios. Comparison results reveal that GS-CPE has faster response time and higher accuracy rate than other gesture interaction systems designed for smart-home environments.},

	abstract = {Automated facial expression recognition can greatly improve the human-machine interface. The machine can provide better and more personalized services when it knows the human's emotion. This kind of improvement is an important progress in this artificial intelligence era. Many deep learning approaches have been applied in recent years due to their outstanding recognition accuracy after training with large amounts of data. The performance is limited, however, by the specific environmental conditions and variations in different persons involved. Hence, this paper addresses the issue of how to customize the generic model without label information from the testing samples. Weighted Center Regression Adaptive Feature Mapping (W-CR-AFM) is mainly proposed to transform the feature distribution of testing samples into that of trained samples. By means of minimizing the error between each feature of testing sample and the center of the most relevant category, W-CR-AFM can bring the features of testing samples around the decision boundary to the centers of expression categories; therefore, their predicted labels can be corrected. When the model which is tuned by W-CR-AFM is tested on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+), Radboud Faces database, and Amsterdam dynamic facial expression set, our approach can improve the recognition accuracy by about 3.01\%, 0.49\%, and 5.33\%, respectively. Compared to the competing deep learning architectures with the same training data, our approach shows the better performance.},

We introduce WalkType, an adaptive text entry system that leverages the mobile device’s built-in tri-axis accelerometer to compensate for extraneous movement while walking. WalkType’s classification model uses the displacement and acceleration of the device, and inference about the user’s footsteps. Additionally, WalkType models finger-touch location and finger distance traveled on the screen, features that increase overall accuracy regardless of movement. The final model was built on typing data collected from 16 participants. In a study comparing WalkType to a control condition, WalkType reduced uncorrected errors by 45.2\% and increased typing speed by 12.9\% for walking participants.},

Task-, behavior-, and subject-related correlates of subjective workload experiences varied as a function of difficulty manipulations within experiments, different sources of workload between experiments, and individual differences in workload definition.

We describe a template-based recognition method that simultaneously aligns the input gesture to the templates using a Sequential Monte Carlo inference technique. Contrary to standard template-based methods based on dynamic programming, such as Dynamic Time Warping, the algorithm has an adaptation process that tracks gesture variation in real time. The method continuously updates, during execution of the gesture, the estimated parameters and recognition results, which offers key advantages for continuous human--machine interaction. The technique is evaluated in several different ways: Recognition and early recognition are evaluated on 2D onscreen pen gestures; adaptation is assessed on synthetic data; and both early recognition and adaptation are evaluated in a user study involving 3D free-space gestures. The method is robust to noise, and successfully adapts to parameter variation. Moreover, it performs recognition as well as or better than nonadapting offline template-based methods.},

To understand what makes a gesture expressive, we need to consider not only its spatial placement and orientation but also its dynamics and the mechanisms enacting them. We start by defining gesture and gesture expressivity, and then we present fundamental aspects of muscle activity and ways to capture information through electromyography and mechanomyography. We present pilot studies that inspect the ability of users to control spatial and temporal variations of 2D shapes and that use muscle sensing to assess expressive information in gesture execution beyond space and time. This leads us to the design of a study that explores the notion of gesture power in terms of control and sensing. Results give insights to interaction designers to go beyond simplistic gestural interaction, towards the design of interactions that draw on nuances of expressive gesture.},

As an increasing number of web sites provide APIs, significant latent value lies in connecting the complementary representations between site and service—in essence, enabling sites themselves to be the example corpus. We introduce d.mix, a tool for creating web mashups that leverages this site-to-service correspondence. With d.mix, users browse annotated web sites and select elements to sample. d.mix’s sampling mechanism generates the underlying service calls that yield those elements. This code can be edited, executed, and shared in d.mix’s wiki-based hosting environment. This sampling approach leverages pre-existing web sites as example sets and supports fluid composition and modification of examples. An initial study with eight participants found d.mix to enable rapid experimentation, and suggested avenues for improving its annotation mechanism.},

To address this issue, we present a CAPpella, a programming by demonstration Context-Aware Prototyping environment intended for end-users. Users "program" their desired context-aware behavior (situation and associated action) in situ, without writing any code, by demonstrating it to a CAPpella and by annotating the relevant portions of the demonstration. Using a meeting and medicine-taking scenario, we illustrate how a user can demonstrate different behaviors to a CAPpella. We describe a CAPpella's underlying system to explain how it supports users in building behaviors and present a study of 14 endusers to illustrate its feasibility and usability.},

To address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. From our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. We identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs.

We investigate how HCI researchers can help to develop accountable systems by performing a literature analysis of 289 core papers on explanations and explainable systems, as well as 12,412 citing papers. Using topic modeling, co-occurrence and network analysis, we mapped the research space from diverse domains, such as algorithmic accountability, interpretable machine learning, context-awareness, cognitive psychology, and software learnability. We reveal fading and burgeoning trends in explainable systems, and identify domains that are closely connected or mostly isolated. The time is ripe for the HCI community to ensure that the powerful new autonomous systems have intelligible interfaces built-in.

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building humancentered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

Shared control unifes human and artifcial intelligence, making the human’s interactions with computers more accessible, safe, precise, efective, creative, and playful. This form of interaction has independently emerged in contexts as varied as mobility assistance, driving, surgery, and digital games. These domains each have their own problems, terminology, and design philosophies. Without a common language for describing interactions in shared control, it is difcult for designers working in one domain to share their knowledge with designers working in another. To address this problem, we present a dimension space for shared control, based on a survey of 55 shared control systems from six diferent problem domains. This design space analysis tool enables designers to classify existing systems, make comparisons between them, identify higher-level design patterns, and imagine solutions to novel problems.},

To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.},

M2A exploits the visual context to display more content while enabling users to locate relevant data intuitively with minimal modiﬁcations to the website. To evaluate the principles behind the framework, we implement a demonstration application in AR and conduct two user-focused experiments. Our experimental study reveals that participants with M2A are 5 times faster to ﬁnd information on a web page compared to a smartphone, and 2 times faster than a traditional AR web browser. Furthermore, users consider navigation on M2A websites to be signiﬁcantly more intuitive and easy to use compared to their desktop and mobile counterparts.},

AR is particularly useful in the manufacturing environment where a diverse set of tasks such as assembly and maintenance must be performed in the most cost-effective and efficient manner possible. While AR systems have seen immense research innovation in recent years, the current strategies utilised in AR for camera calibration, detection, tracking, camera position and orientation (pose) estimation, inverse rendering, procedure storage, virtual object creation, registration, and rendering are still mostly dominated by traditional non-AI approaches. This restricts their practicability to controlled environments with limited variations in the scene. Classical AR methods can be greatly improved through the incorporation of various AI strategies like deep learning, ontology, and expert systems for adapting to broader scene variations and user preferences. This research work provides a review of current AR strategies, critical appraisal for these strategies, and potential AI solutions for every component of the computational pipeline of AR systems. Given the review of current work in both fields, future research work directions are also outlined.},

This paper takes a step towards realizing both of these goals by providing a concrete definition of AI literacy based on existing research. We synthesize a variety of interdisciplinary literature into a set of core competencies of AI literacy and suggest several design considerations to support AI developers and educators in creating learner-centered AI. These competencies and design considerations are organized in a conceptual framework thematically derived from the literature.

In many cases, the user must decide whether to try the automated method again, or fix it themselves using the available user interface. We argue this decision is influenced by both perceived automation accuracy and degree of task “controllability” (how easily and to what extent an automated result can be manually modified). This relationship between accuracy and controllability is investigated in a 750-participant crowdsourced experiment using a controlled, gamified task. With high controllability, self-reported satisfaction remained constant even under very low accuracy conditions, and overall, a strong preference was observed for using manual control rather than automation, despite much slower performance and regardless of very poor controllability.},

Like in human communication, building trust in human-agent communication is essential given its signifcant infuence on user behavior. However, inspiring user trust in CRSs with a “one-size-fts-all” design is difcult, as individual users may have their own expectations for conversational interactions (e.g., who, user or system, takes the initiative), which are potentially related to their personal characteristics. In this study, we investigated the impacts of three personal characteristics, namely personality traits, trust propensity, and domain knowledge, on user trust in two types of text-based CRSs, i.e., user-initiative and mixed-initiative. Our between-subjects user study (N=148) revealed that users’ trust propensity and domain knowledge positively infuenced their trust in CRSs, and that users with high conscientiousness tended to trust the mixed-initiative system.},

	abstract = {Assistive technology featuring artificial intelligence (AI) to support human decision-making has become ubiquitous. Assistive AI achieves accuracy comparable to or even surpassing that of human experts. However, often the adoption of assistive AI systems is limited by a lack of trust of humans into an AI’s prediction. This is why the AI research community has been focusing on rendering AI decisions more transparent by providing explanations of an AIs decision. To what extent these explanations really help to foster trust into an AI system remains an open question. In this paper, we report the results of a behavioural experiment in which subjects were able to draw on the support of an ML-based decision support tool for text classification. We experimentally varied the information subjects received and show that transparency can actually have a negative impact on trust. We discuss implications for decision makers employing assistive AI technology.},

The proposed metric, termed the Index of Pupillary Activity, is shown to discriminate task difﬁculty vis-à-vis cognitive load (if the implied causality can be assumed) in an experiment where participants performed easy and difﬁcult mental arithmetic tasks while ﬁxating a central target (a requirement for replication of prior work). The paper’s contribution is twofold: full documentation is provided for the calculation of the proposed measurement which can be considered as an alternative to the existing proprietary Index of Cognitive Activity (ICA). Thus, it is possible for researchers to replicate the experiment and build their own software which implements this measurement. Second, several aspects of the ICA are approached in a more data-sensitive way with the goal of improving the measurement’s performance.},

	abstract = {Since the popularisation of the Internet in the 1990s, the cyberspace has kept evolving. We have created various computer-mediated virtual environments including social networks, video conferencing, virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR Chat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokemon Go), and Non-Fungible Token Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and unconnected, have bought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term `metaverse' has been coined to further facilitate the digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital `big bang' of our cyberspace is not far away. This survey paper presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital `big bang'. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. We thus examine eight enabling technologies rigorously - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, we discuss six user-centric factors -- Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy, Social Acceptability, Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability. Finally, we propose a concrete research agenda for the development of the metaverse.},

However, this approach puts the burden of user interface (UI) transition solely on users. In this paper, we frst ran a bodystorming design workshop to capture the limitations of existing manual UI transition approaches in spatially diverse tasks. Then we addressed these limitations by designing and evaluating three UI transition mechanisms with different levels of automation and controllability (low-efort manual, semi-automated, fully-automated). Furthermore, we simulated imperfect contextual awareness by introducing prediction errors with diferent costs to correct them. Our results provide valuable lessons about the trade-ofs between UI automation levels, controllability, user agency, and the impact of prediction errors.},

	abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) browsers show geo-referenced data in the current view of a user. When the amount of data grows too large, the display quickly becomes cluttered. Clustering items by spatial and semantic attributes can temporarily alleviate the issue, but is not effective against an increasing amount of data. We present an adaptive information density display for AR that balances the amount of presented information against the potential clutter created by placing items on the screen. We use hierarchical clustering to create a level-of-detail structure, in which nodes closer to the root encompass groups of items, while the leaf nodes contain single items. Our method selects items and groups from different levels of this hierarchy based on user-defined preferences and on the amount of visual clutter caused by placing these items. The number of presented items is adapted during user interaction to avoid clutter. We compare our interface to a conventional AR browser interface in a qualitative user study. Users clearly preferred our interface, because it provided a better overview of the data and allowed for easier comparison. In a second study, we evaluated the effect of different degrees of clustering on search and recall tasks. Users generally made fewer errors, when using our interface for a search task, which indicates that the reduced clutter allowed them to stay focused on finding the relevant items.},

First, potential AR consumers collect local scenes with a semantic understanding technique. ScalAR then synthesizes numerous similar scenes. In VR, a designer authors the AR contents’ semantic associations and validates the design while being immersed in the provided scenes. We adopt a decision-tree-based algorithm to fit the designer’s demonstrations as a semantic adaptation model to deploy the authored AR experience in a physical scene. We further showcase two application scenarios authored by ScalAR and conduct a two-session user study where the quantitative results prove the accuracy of the AR content rendering and the qualitative results show the usability of ScalAR.},

We explored how different adaptation strategies can contribute towards this goal.

We also identified desirable properties of adaptation-based interface techniques, which can be used to guide the design of the next-generation walking-centered augmented reality workspaces.},

Currently, content creators design applications, and users then manually adjust which applications are visible and how much information they show. This choice has to be adjusted every time users switch context, i.e., whenever they switch their task or environment. Since context switches happen many times a day, we believe that MR interfaces require automation to alleviate this problem. We propose a real-time approach to automate this process based on users’ current cognitive load and knowledge about their task and environment. Our system adapts which applications are displayed, how much information they show, and where they are placed. We formulate this problem as a mix of rule-based decision making and combinatorial optimization which can be solved effciently in real-time. We present a set of proof-of-concept applications showing that our approach is applicable in a wide range of scenarios. Finally, we show in a dual-task evaluation that our approach decreased secondary tasks interactions by 36\%.},

Recent work has drawn attention to the emergent explainability requirements of in situ, applied projects, yet further exploratory work is needed to more fully understand this space. This paper investigates applied AI projects and reports on a qualitative interview study of individuals working on AI projects at a large technology and consulting company. Presenting an empirical understanding of the range of stakeholders in industrial AI projects, this paper also draws out the emergent explainability practices that arise as these projects unfold, highlighting the range of explanation audiences (who), as well as how their explainability needs evolve across the AI project lifecycle (when). We discuss the importance of adopting a sociotechnical lens in designing AI systems, noting how the “AI lifecycle” can serve as a design metaphor to further the XAI design field.},

	abstract = {In recent years, AI explainability (XAI) has received wide attention. Although XAI is expected to play a positive role in decision-making and advice acceptance, various opposing effects have also been found. The opposing effects of XAI highlight the critical role of context, especially human factors, in understanding XAI’s impacts. This study investigates the effects of providing three types of post-hoc explanations (alternative advice, prediction confidence scores, and prediction rationale) on two context-specific user decision-making outcomes (AI advice acceptance and advice adoption). Our field experiment results show that users’ epistemic uncertainty matters when understanding XAI’s impacts. As users’ epistemic uncertainty increases, only providing prediction rationale is beneficial, whereas providing alternative advice and showing prediction confidence scores may hinder users’ advice acceptance. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the human aspects of XAI by clarifying XAI and showing that XAI may not always be desirable. It also contributes by highlighting the importance of considering user profiles when pre­ dicting XAI’s impacts, designing XAI, and providing professional services with AI.},

However, users may not be interested in all the information that the applications can produce. Using scenarios of four real-world applications that span the design space of context-aware computing, we conducted two experiments to discover what information users are interested in. In the first experiment, we elicit types of information demands that users have and under what moderating circumstances they have them. In the second experiment, we verify the findings by soliciting users about which types they would want to know and establish whether receiving such information would satisfy them. We discuss why users demand certain types of information, and provide design implications on how to provide different intelligibility types to make context-aware applications intelligible and acceptable to users.},

	abstract = {Intelligibility and control are important user concerns in context-aware applications. They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications.},

By interviewing 20 UX and design practitioners working on various AI products, we seek to identify gaps between the current XAI algorithmic work and practices to create explainable AI products. To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work.

We performed a cross-analysis Amazon Mechanical Turk study comparing the popular state-of-the-art explanation methods to empirically determine which are better in explaining model decisions. The participants were asked to compare explanation methods across applications spanning image, text, audio, and sensory domains. Among the surveyed methods, explanation-by-example was preferred in all domains except text sentiment classification, where LIME's method of annotating input text was preferred. We highlight qualitative aspects of employing the studied explainability methods and conclude with implications for researchers and engineers that seek to incorporate explanations into user-facing deployments.},

In particular, we argue that there are human aspects of context that cannot be sensed or even inferred by technological means, so context-aware systems cannot be designed simply to act on our behalf. Rather, they will have to be able to defer to users in an efficient and nonobtrusive fashion. Our point is particularly relevant for systems that are constructed such that applications are architecturally isolated from the sensing and inferencing that governs their behavior. We propose a design framework that is intended to guide thinking about accommodating human aspects of context. This framework presents four design principles that support intelligibility of system behavior and accountability of human users and a number of human-salient details of context that must be accounted for in context-aware system design.},

Recent work has advanced the state of the art, yet a key challenge remains in understanding unique requirements that might arise when XAI systems are deployed into complex settings of use. In helping envision such requirements, this paper turns to scenario-based design, a method that anticipates and leverages scenarios of possible use early on in system development. To demonstrate the value of the scenario-based design method to XAI design, this paper presents a case study of aging-in-place monitoring. Introducing the concept of “explainability scenarios” as resources in XAI design, this paper sets out a forward-facing agenda for further attention to the emergent requirements of explainability-in-use.},

With this newfound ubiquity, ML has moved beyond academia and grown into an engineering discipline. To that end, interpretability tools have been designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners better understand how ML models work. However, there has been little evaluation of the extent to which these tools achieve this goal. We study data scientists’ use of two existing interpretability tools, the InterpretML implementation of GAMs and the SHAP Python package. We conduct a contextual inquiry (N=11) and a survey (N=197) of data scientists to observe how they use interpretability tools to uncover common issues that arise when building and evaluating ML models. Our results indicate that data scientists over-trust and misuse interpretability tools. Furthermore, few of our participants were able to accurately describe the visualizations output by these tools. We highlight qualitative themes for data scientists’ mental models of interpretability tools. We conclude with implications for researchers and tool designers, and contextualize our ﬁndings in the social science literature.},

	abstract = {In many practical applications of AI, an AI model is used as a decision aid for human users. The AI provides advice that a human (sometimes) incorporates into their decision-making process. The AI advice is often presented with some measure of “conﬁdence” that the human can use to calibrate how much they depend on or trust the advice. In this paper, we present an initial exploration that suggests showing AI models as more conﬁdent than they actually are, even when the original AI is well-calibrated, can improve human-AI performance (measured as the accuracy and conﬁdence of the human’s ﬁnal prediction after seeing the AI advice). We ﬁrst train a model to predict human incorporation of AI advice using data from thousands of human-AI interactions. This enables us to explicitly estimate how to transform the AI’s prediction conﬁdence, making the AI uncalibrated, in order to improve the ﬁnal human prediction. We empirically validate our results across four different tasks—dealing with images, text and tabular data—involving hundreds of human participants. We further support our ﬁndings with simulation analysis. Our ﬁndings suggest the importance of jointly optimizing the human-AI system as opposed to the standard paradigm of optimizing the AI model alone.},

            While a growing number of machine learning (ML) systems have been deployed in clinical settings with the promise of improving patient care, many have struggled to gain adoption and realize this promise. Based on a qualitative analysis of coded interviews with clinicians who use an ML-based system for sepsis, we found that, rather than viewing the system as a surrogate for their clinical judgment, clinicians perceived themselves as partnering with the technology. Our findings suggest that, even without a deep understanding of machine learning, clinicians can build trust with an ML system through experience, expert endorsement and validation, and systems designed to accommodate clinicians’ autonomy and support them across their entire workflow.},

However, in practice, AI systems often are used to provide advice to people in domains ranging from criminal justice and ﬁnance to healthcare. In such AI-advised decision making, humans and machines form a team, where the human is responsible for making ﬁnal decisions. But is the most accurate AI the best teammate? We argue “not necessarily” — predictable performance may be worth a slight sacriﬁce in AI accuracy. Instead, we argue that AI systems should be trained in a human-centered manner, directly optimized for team performance. We study this proposal for a speciﬁc type of human-AI teaming, where the human overseer chooses to either accept the AI recommendation or solve the task themselves. To optimize the team performance for this setting we maximize the team’s expected utility, expressed in terms of the quality of the ﬁnal decision, cost of verifying, and individual accuracies of people and machines. Our experiments with linear and non-linear models on real-world, high-stakes datasets show that the most accuracy AI may not lead to highest team performance and show the beneﬁt of modeling teamwork during training through improvements in expected team utility across datasets, considering parameters such as human skill and the cost of mistakes. We discuss the shortcoming of current optimization approaches beyond well-studied loss functions such as log-loss, and encourage future work on AI optimization problems motivated by human-AI collaboration.},

Achieving high team performance depends on more than just the accuracy of the AI system: Since the human and the AI may have different expertise, the highest team performance is often reached when they both know how and when to complement one another. We focus on a factor that is crucial to supporting such complementary: the human’s mental model of the AI capabilities, speciﬁcally the AI system’s error boundary (i.e. knowing “When does the AI err?”). Awareness of this lets the human decide when to accept or override the AI’s recommendation. We highlight two key properties of an AI’s error boundary, parsimony and stochasticity, and a property of the task, dimensionality. We show experimentally how these properties affect humans’ mental models of AI capabilities and the resulting team performance. We connect our evaluations to related work and propose goals, beyond accuracy, that merit consideration during model selection and optimization to improve overall human-AI team performance.},

	abstract = {Although evidence-based algorithms consistently outperform human forecasters, people often fail to use them after learning that they are imperfect, a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion. In this paper, we present three studies investigating how to reduce algorithm aversion. In incentivized forecasting tasks, participants chose between using their own forecasts or those of an algorithm that was built by experts. Participants were considerably more likely to choose to use an imperfect algorithm when they could modify its forecasts, and they performed better as a result. Notably, the preference for modiﬁable algorithms held even when participants were severely restricted in the modiﬁcations they could make (Studies 1–3). In fact, our results suggest that participants’ preference for modiﬁable algorithms was indicative of a desire for some control over the forecasting outcome, and not for a desire for greater control over the forecasting outcome, as participants’ preference for modiﬁable algorithms was relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the modiﬁcations they were able to make (Study 2). Additionally, we found that giving participants the freedom to modify an imperfect algorithm made them feel more satisﬁed with the forecasting process, more likely to believe that the algorithm was superior, and more likely to choose to use an algorithm to make subsequent forecasts (Study 3). This research suggests that one can reduce algorithm aversion by giving people some control—even a slight amount—over an imperfect algorithm’s forecast.},

With the rapid advances in AI recently, AI-assisted decision making—in which an AI model provides decision recommendations and confidence, while the humans make the final decisions—has emerged as a new paradigm of human-AI collaboration. In this paper, we aim at obtaining a quantitative understanding of whether and when would human decision makers adopt the AI model’s recommendations. We define a space of human behavior models by decomposing the human decision maker’s cognitive process in each decision-making task into two components: the utility component (i.e., evaluate the utility of different actions) and the selection component (i.e., select an action to take), and we perform a systematic search in the model space to identify the model that fits real-world human behavior data the best. Our results highlight that in AI-assisted decision making, human decision makers’ utility evaluation and action selection are influenced by their own judgement and confidence on the decision-making task. Further, human decision makers exhibit a tendency to distort the decision confidence in utility evaluations. Finally, we also analyze the differences in humans’ adoption behavior of AI recommendations as the stakes of the decisions vary.},

	abstract = {Background: Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual languages. Chatbots have the potential to be useful tools for individuals with mental disorders, especially those who are reluctant to seek mental health advice due to stigmatization. While numerous studies have been conducted about using chatbots for mental health, there is a need to systematically bring this evidence together in order to inform mental health providers and potential users about the main features of chatbots and their potential uses, and to inform future research about the main gaps of the previous literature.
Objective: We aimed to provide an overview of the features of chatbots used by individuals for their mental health as reported in the empirical literature.
Methods: Seven bibliographic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar) were used in our search. In addition, backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews was conducted. Study selection and data extraction were carried out by two reviewers independently. Extracted data were synthesised using a narrative approach. Chatbots were classified according to their purposes, platforms, response generation, dialogue initiative, input and output modalities, embodiment, and targeted disorders.
Results: Of 1039 citations retrieved, 53 unique studies were included in this review. The included studies assessed 41 different chatbots. Common uses of chatbots were: therapy (n = 17), training (n = 12), and screening (n = 10). Chatbots in most studies were rule-based (n = 49) and implemented in stand-alone software (n = 37). In 46 studies, chatbots controlled and led the conversations. While the most frequently used input modality was written language only (n = 26), the most frequently used output modality was a combination of written, spoken and visual languages (n = 28). In the majority of studies, chatbots included virtual representations (n = 44). The most common focus of chatbots was depression (n = 16) or autism (n = 10).
Conclusion: Research regarding chatbots in mental health is nascent. There are numerous chatbots that are used for various mental disorders and purposes. Healthcare providers should compare chatbots found in this review to help guide potential users to the most appropriate chatbot to support their mental health needs. More reviews are needed to summarise the evidence regarding the effectiveness and acceptability of chatbots in mental health.},

	abstract = {Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. One promising application for chatbots is to elicit people's self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. As receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. However, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (MHP) through a chatbot. In this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. After using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a MHP and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the MHP. If they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. Comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the MHP, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the MHP; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the MHP through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the MHP. Participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the MHP, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to assess the usability of a chatbot for mental health care within a social enterprise. Chatbots are becoming more prevalent in our daily lives, as we can now use them to book ﬂights, manage savings, and check the weather. Chatbots are increasingly being used in mental health care, with the emergence of “virtual therapists”. In this study, the usability of a chatbot named iHelpr has been assessed. iHelpr has been developed to provide guided self-assessment, and tips for the following areas: stress, anxiety, depression, sleep, and self esteem. This study used a questionnaire developed by Chatbottest, and the System Usability Scale to assess the usability of iHelpr. The participants in this study enjoyed interacting with the chatbot, and found it easy to use. However, the study highlighted areas that need major improvements, such as Error Management and Intelligence. A list of recommendations has been developed to improve the usability of the iHelpr chatbot.},
