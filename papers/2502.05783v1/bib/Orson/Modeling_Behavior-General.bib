	abstract = {The recent arrival of smartphone-sensing methods has made it possible to objectively track consequential everyday health-related behaviors rather than rely on self-reports. To evaluate the viability of using sensing methods to monitor such behaviors in detail, the present research used a smartphone-sensing application to describe the patterns of stability and change that characterize a cohort of students' activity and sociability behaviors over the course of a 10-week academic term. Data were collected from 48 students using a smartphone-sensing application, StudentLife, which was designed to track daily durations of activity (via the accelerometer sensor) and sociability (via the microphone sensor). Results showed stability estimates were moderate to high for activity (rmean= 0.66) and sociability (rmean= 0.72) across the 10 weeks. Students started the term with generally healthy levels of activity (M = 1.87 h) and sociability (M = 4.99 h), which then dropped (activity by 0.42 h, sociability by 0.90 h) over the first half of the term (i.e., before midterm exams). Over the second half of the term, activity levels did not change but sociability increased (by 0.88 h). Students’ ethnicity and academic class predicted variation in the activity and sociability trajectories. Discussion focuses on the implications of our results for designing mHealth interventions to address consequential student outcomes (e.g., mental health, physical health).},

However, there has been limited research focusing on uncovering the phenomenon at a societal scale and simultaneously investigating the social relationships between familiar strangers. With the help of the large-scale mobile phone records, we empirically show the existence of the relationship in the country of Andorra. Built upon the temporal and spatial distributions, we investigate the mechanisms, especially collective temporal regularity and spatial structure that trigger this phenomenon. Moreover, we explore the relationship between social distances on the communication network and the number of encounters and show that larger number of encounters indicates shorter social distances in a social network. The understanding of the physical encounter network could have important implications to understand the phenomena such as epidemics spreading and information diffusion.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L\{é\}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

	abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

	volume = {2},
	abstract = {Although social anxiety and depression are common, they are often underdiagnosed and undertreated, in part due to difficulties identifying and accessing individuals in need of services. Current assessments rely on client self-report and clinician judgment, which are vulnerable to social desirability and other subjective biases. Identifying objective, nonburdensome markers of these mental health problems, such as features of speech, could help advance assessment, prevention, and treatment approaches. Prior research examining speech detection methods has focused on fully supervised learning approaches employing strongly labeled data. However, strong labeling of individuals high in symptoms or state affect in speech audio data is impractical, in part because it is not possible to identify with high confidence which regions of a long speech indicate the person's symptoms or affective state. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework for detecting social anxiety and depression from long audio clips. Specifically, we present a novel feature modeling technique named NN2Vec that identifies and exploits the inherent relationship between speakers' vocal states and symptoms/affective states. Detecting speakers high in social anxiety or depression symptoms using NN2Vec features achieves F-1 scores 17\% and 13\% higher than those of the best available baselines. In addition, we present a new multiple instance learning adaptation of a BLSTM classifier, named BLSTM-MIL. Our novel framework of using NN2Vec features with the BLSTM-MIL classifier achieves F-1 scores of 90.1\% and 85.44\% in detecting speakers high in social anxiety and depression symptoms.},

	abstract = {Depression is a common mood disorder that causes severe medical problems and interferes negatively with daily life. Identifying human behavior patterns that are predictive or indicative of depressive disorder is important. Clinical diagnosis of depression relies on costly clinician assessment using survey instruments which may not objectively reflect the fluctuation of daily behavior. Self-administered surveys, such as the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) commonly used to monitor depression, may show disparities from clinical decision. Smartphones provide easy access to many behavioral parameters, and Fitbit wrist bands are becoming another important tool to assess variables such as heart rates and sleep efficiency that are complementary to smartphone sensors. However, data used to identify depression indicators have been limited to a single platform either iPhone, or Android, or Fitbit alone due to the variation in their methods of data collection. The present work represents a large-scale effort to collect and integrate data from mobile phones, wearable devices, and self reports in depression analysis by designing a new machine learning approach. This approach constructs sparse mappings from sensing variables collected by various tools to two separate targets: self-reported QIDS scores and clinical assessment of depression severity. We propose a so-called heterogeneous multi-task feature learning method that jointly builds inference models for related tasks but of different types including classification and regression tasks. The proposed method was evaluated using data collected from 103 college students and could predict the QIDS score with an R2 reaching 0.44 and depression severity with an F1-score as high as 0.77. By imposing appropriate regularizers, our approach identified strong depression indicators such as time staying at home and total time asleep.},

With the wide availability of smartphones equipped with microphone, accelerometer, GPS, and other source of sensors, it is worthwhile to explore the possibility of automatic emotion detection via smartphone sensing. Particularly, we focus on a novel research problem that tries to detect the compound emotion (a set of multiple dimensional basic emotions) of smartphone users. We observe that users' self-reported emotional states have high correlation with their smartphone usage patterns and sensing data. Based on the observations, we exploit a feature extraction and selection algorithm to find the most significant features. We further adopt a factor graph model to tackle the correlations between features and emotion labels, and propose a machine learning algorithm for compound emotion detection based on the smartphone sensing data. The proposed mechanism is implemented as an APP called MoodExplorer in Android platform. Extensive experiments conducted on the smartphone data collected from 30 university students show that MoodExplorer can recognize users' compound emotions with 76.0\% exact match on average.},

In this work, we define a new framework using a text compression technique on the sequences of credit card purchases to detect ubiquitous patterns of collective behavior. Clustering the consumers by their similarity in purchases sequences, we detect five consumer groups. Remarkably, post checking, individuals in each group are also similar in their age, total expenditure, gender, and the diversity of their social and mobility networks extracted by their mobile phone records.

	abstract = {Well-established fine-scale urban mobility models today depend on detailed but cumbersome and expensive travel surveys for their calibration. Not much is known, however, about the set of mechanisms needed to generate complete mobility profiles if only using passive datasets with mostly sparse traces of individuals. In this study, we present a mechanistic modeling framework (TimeGeo) that effectively generates urban mobility patterns with resolution of 10 min and hundreds of meters. It ties together the inference of home and work activity locations from data, with the modeling of flexible activities (e.g., other) in space and time. The temporal choices are captured by only three features: the weekly home-based tour number, the dwell rate, and the burst rate. These combined generate for each individual: (i) stay duration of activities, (ii) number of visited locations per day, and (iii) daily mobility networks. These parameters capture how an individual deviates from the circadian rhythm of the population, and generate the wide spectrum of empirically observed mobility behaviors. The spatial choices of visited locations are modeled by a rank-based exploration and preferential return (r-EPR) mechanism that incorporates space in the EPR model. Finally, we show that a hierarchical multiplicative cascade method can measure the interaction between land use and generation of trips. In this way, urban structure is directly related to the observed distance of travels. This framework allows us to fully embrace the massive amount of individual data generated by information and communication technologies (ICTs) worldwide to comprehensively model urban mobility without travel surveys.},

We develop a technique that leverages transfer learning to predict which applications are most popular and estimate the whole usage distribution based on the Point of Interest (POI) information of that particular location. We demonstrate that our technique has an 83.0\% hitrate in successfully identifying the top five popular applications, and a 0.15 RMSE when estimating usage with just 10\% sampled sparse data. It outperforms by about 25.7\% over the existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings pave the way for predicting which apps are relevant to a user given their current location, and which applications are popular where. The implications of our findings are broad: it enables a range of systems to benefit from such timely predictions, including operating systems, network operators, appstores, advertisers, and service providers.},

	abstract = {Predicting user behavior makes it possible to provide services suitable for users. In behavior prediction, destination prediction (e.g. predicting a future location) can be applied to various practical applications. ï¿¿e problem is how to predict a destination with high accuracy in the early stage of movement. We call this problem " early destination prediction with trajectory tracking " . Currently, there are two destination prediction methods. One is Next Place Prediction(NPP), that is based on the staying paï¿¿ern such as at which location does a user frequently stay at a certain time of day. ï¿¿e other is prediction based on trajectory tracking. In the former, it is impossible to narrow down the destination by the route. In the laï¿¿er, it is diï¿¿cult to predict with high accuracy the early stage of movement. In this study, we proposed a novel prediction method suitable for " early destination prediction with trajectory tracking " by combining the above two methods. By comparing the accuracy of destination prediction for each percentage of completed movement for 100 users, we conï¿¿rmed that the proposed method is suitable for " early destination prediction with trajectory tracking " .},

	abstract = {Rapidly developing location acquisition technologies have provided us with big GPS trajectory data, which offers a new means of understanding people's daily behaviors as well as urban dynamics. With such data, predicting human mobility at the city level will be of great significance for transportation scheduling, urban regulation, and emergency management. In particular, most urban human behaviors are related to a small number of important regions, referred to as Regions-of-Interest (ROIs). Therefore, in this study, a deep ROI-based modeling approach is proposed for effectively predicting urban human mobility. Urban ROIs are first discovered from historical trajectory data, and urban human mobility is designated using two types of ROI labels (ISROI and WHICHROI). Then, urban mobility prediction is modeled as a sequence classification problem for each type of label. Finally, a deep-learning architecture built with recurrent neural networks is designed as an effective sequence classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that the superior performance of our proposed approach to the baseline models and several real-world practices show the applicability of our approach to real-world urban computing problems.},

	abstract = {Cycles are fundamental to human health and behavior. However, modeling cycles in time series data is challenging because in most cases the cycles are not labeled or directly observed and need to be inferred from multidimensional measurements taken over time. Here, we present CyHMMs, a cyclic hidden Markov model method for detecting and modeling cycles in a collection of multidimensional heterogeneous time series data. In contrast to previous cycle modeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in modeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete and continuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data; and they can share information across individuals to model variation both within and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic and real-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths more accurately than existing methods, with 58\% lower error on simulated data and 63\% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing baseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can model the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the cycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series into groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world health-tracking datasets -- of menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity tracking data -- yields important insights including which symptoms to expect at each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several groups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along dimensions not provided to the model. For example, by modeling missing data in the menstrual cycles dataset, we are able to discover a medically relevant group of birth control users even though information on birth control is not given to the model.},

	abstract = {Mobile health applications that track activities, such as exercise, sleep, and diet, are becoming widely used. While these activity tracking applications have the potential to improve our health, user engagement and retention are critical factors for their success. However, long-term user engagement patterns in real-world activity tracking applications are not yet well understood. Here we study user engagement patterns within a mobile physical activity tracking application consisting of 115 million logged activities taken by over a million users over 31 months. Specifically, we show that over 75\% of users return and re-engage with the application after prolonged periods of inactivity, no matter the duration of the inactivity. We find a surprising result that the re-engagement usage patterns resemble those of the start of the initial engagement period, rather than being a simple continuation of the end of the initial engagement period. This evidence points to a conceptual model of multiple lives of user engagement, extending the prevalent single life view of user activity. We demonstrate that these multiple lives occur because the users have a variety of different primary intents or goals for using the app. We find evidence for users being more likely to stop using the app once they achieved their primary intent or goal (e.g., weight loss). However, these users might return once their original intent resurfaces (e.g., wanting to lose newly gained weight). Based on insights developed in this work, including a marker of improved primary intent performance, our prediction models achieve 71\% ROC AUC. Overall, our research has implications for modeling user re-engagement in health activity tracking applications and has consequences for how notifications, recommendations as well as gamification can be used to increase engagement.},

However, the problem of automatically identifying the most useful features for modeling such activities remains largely unsolved. In this paper we present a hybrid approach to recognizing activities, which combines boosting to discriminatively select useful features and learn an ensemble of static classifiers to recognize different activities, with hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the temporal regularities and smoothness of activities. We tested the activity recognition system using over 12 hours of wearable-sensor data collected by volunteers in natural unconstrained environments. The models succeeded in identifying a small set of maximally informative features, and were able identify ten different human activities with an accuracy of 95\%.},

With the growing ability of collecting information, more and more tem-poral and spatial contextual information is collected in systems, and the location prediction problem becomes crucial and feasible. Some works have been proposed to address this problem, but they all have their limitations. Factorizing Personalized Markov Chain (FPMC) is con-structed based on a strong independence assumption among different factors, which limits its performance. Tensor Factorization (TF) faces the cold start problem in predicting future actions. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model shows promising performance compar-ing with PFMC and TF, but all these methods have problem in modeling continuous time interval and ge-ographical distance. In this paper, we extend RNN and propose a novel method called Spatial Temporal Recur-rent Neural Networks (ST-RNN). ST-RNN can model local temporal and spatial contexts in each layer with time-specific transition matrices for different time inter-vals and distance-specific transition matrices for differ-ent geographical distances. Experimental results show that the proposed ST-RNN model yields significant im-provements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets, i.e., Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Gowalla dataset.},

	abstract = {Understanding smartphone users is fundamental for creating better smartphones, and improving the smartphone usage experience and generating generalizable and reproducible research. However, smartphone manufacturers and most of the mobile computing research community make a simplifying assumption that all smartphone users are similar or, at best, constitute a small number of user types, based on their behaviors. Manufacturers design phones for the broadest audience and hope they work for all users. Researchers mostly analyze data from smartphone-based user studies and report results without accounting for the many different groups of people that make up the user base of smartphones. In this work, we challenge these elementary characterizations of smartphone users and show evidence of the existence of a much more diverse set of users. We analyzed one month of application usage from 106,762 Android users and discovered 382 distinct types of users based on their application usage behaviors, using our own two-step clustering and feature ranking selection approach. Our results have profound implications on the reproducibility and reliability of mobile computing studies, design and development of applications, determination of which apps should be pre-installed on a smartphone and, in general, on the smartphone usage experience for different types of users.},

However, there is growing evidence of problematic use of smartphones that impacts both social and heath aspects of users’ lives. Currently, assessment of overuse or problematic use depends on one-time, self-reported behavioral information about phone use. Due to the known issues with self-reports in such types of assessments, we explore an automated, objective and repeatable approach for assessing problematic usage. We collect a wide range of phone usage data from smartphones, identify a number of usage features that are relevant to this assessment, and build detection models based on Adaboost with machine learning algorithms automatically detecting problematic use. We found that the number of apps used per day, the ratio of SMSs to calls, the number of event-initiated sessions, the number of apps used per event initiated session, and the length of non-event- initiated sessions are useful for detecting problematic usage. With these, a detection model can identify users with problematic usage with 89.6\% accuracy (F-score of .707).},

The analysis is based on a dataset collected in-the-wild. We recorded 5,118 mood reports from 28 users over a period of 20 days. Our results show that users’ emotions have a causal impact on different aspects of mobile phone interaction. On the other hand, we can observe a causal impact of the use of specific applications, reflecting the external users’ context, such as socializing and traveling, on happiness and stress level. This study has profound implications for the design of interactive mobile systems since it identifies the dimensions that have causal effects on users’ interaction with mobile phones and vice versa.

	abstract = {Background: Depression is a burdensome, recurring mental health disorder with high prevalence. Even in developed countries, patients have to wait for several months to receive treatment. In many parts of the world there is only one mental health professional for over 200 people. Smartphones are ubiquitous and have a large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms and providing context-sensitive intervention support. Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold, first to explore the detection of daily-life behavior based on sensor information to identify subjects with a clinically meaningful depression level, second to explore the potential of context sensitive intervention delivery to provide in-situ support for people with depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 126 adults (age 20-57) were recruited to use the smartphone app Mobile Sensing and Support (MOSS), collecting context-sensitive sensor information and providing just-in-time interventions derived from cognitive behavior therapy. Real-time learning-systems were deployed to adapt to each subject's preferences to optimize recommendations with respect to time, location, and personal preference. Biweekly, participants were asked to complete a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9) to track symptom progression. Wilcoxon tests were conducted to compare scores before and after intervention. Correlation analysis was used to test the relationship between adherence and change in PHQ-9. One hundred twenty features were constructed based on smartphone usage and sensors including accelerometer, Wifi, and global positioning systems (GPS). Machine-learning models used these features to infer behavior and context for PHQ-9 level prediction and tailored intervention delivery. Results: A total of 36 subjects used MOSS for ≥2 weeks. For subjects with clinical depression (PHQ-9≥11) at baseline and adherence ≥8 weeks (n=12), a significant drop in PHQ-9 was observed (P=.01). This group showed a negative trend between adherence and change in PHQ-9 scores (rho=−.498, P=.099). Binary classification performance for biweekly PHQ-9 samples (n=143), with a cutoff of PHQ-9≥11, based on Random Forest and Support Vector Machine leave-one-out cross validation resulted in 60.1\% and 59.1\% accuracy, respectively. Conclusions: Proxies for social and physical behavior derived from smartphone sensor data was successfully deployed to deliver context-sensitive and personalized interventions to people with depressive symptoms. Subjects who used the app for an extended period of time showed significant reduction in self-reported symptom severity. Nonlinear classification models trained on features extracted from smartphone sensor data including Wifi, accelerometer, GPS, and phone use, demonstrated a proof of concept for the detection of depression superior to random classification. While findings of effectiveness must be reproduced in a RCT to proof causation, they pave the way for a new generation of digital health interventions leveraging smartphone sensors to provide context sensitive information for in-situ support and unobtrusive monitoring of critical mental health states.},

	abstract = {Background: Existing research postulates a variety of components that show an impact on utilization of technology-mediated mental health information systems (MHIS) and treatment outcome. Although researchers assessed the effect of isolated design elements on the results of Web-based interventions and the associations between symptom reduction and use of components across computer and mobile phone platforms, there remains uncertainty with regard to which components of technology-mediated interventions for mental health exert the greatest therapeutic gain. Until now, no studies have presented results on the therapeutic benefit associated with specific service components of technology-mediated MHIS for depression. Objective: This systematic review aims at identifying components of technology-mediated MHIS for patients with depression. Consequently, all randomized controlled trials comparing technology-mediated treatments for depression to either waiting-list control, treatment as usual, or any other form of treatment for depression were reviewed. Updating prior reviews, this study aims to (1) assess the effectiveness of technology-supported interventions for the treatment of depression and (2) add to the debate on what components in technology-mediated MHIS for the treatment of depression should be standard of care. Methods: Systematic searches in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Effect sizes for each comparison between a technology-enabled intervention and a control condition were computed using the standard mean difference (SMD). Chi-square tests were used to test for heterogeneity. Using subgroup analysis, potential sources of heterogeneity were analyzed. Publication bias was examined using visual inspection of funnel plots and Begg’s test. Qualitative data analysis was also used. In an explorative approach, a list of relevant components was extracted from the body of literature by consensus between two researchers. Results: Of 6387 studies initially identified, 45 met all inclusion criteria. Programs analyzed showed a significant trend toward reduced depressive symptoms (SMD –0.58, 95\% CI –0.71 to –0.45, P{\textless}.001). Heterogeneity was large (I2≥76). A total of 15 components were identified. Conclusions: Technology-mediated MHIS for the treatment of depression has a consistent positive overall effect compared to controls. A total of 15 components have been identified. Further studies are needed to quantify the impact of individual components on treatment effects and to identify further components that are relevant for the design of future technology-mediated interventions for the treatment of depression and other mental disorders.

	abstract = {The ability to understand social systems through the aid of computational tools is central to the emerging field of computational social systems. Such understanding can answer epistemological questions on human behavior in a data-driven manner, and provide prescriptive guidelines for persuading humans to undertake certain actions in real-world social scenarios. The growing number of works in this subfield has the potential to impact multiple walks of human life including health, wellness, productivity, mobility, transportation, education, shopping, and sustenance. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a functional survey of recent advances in sensing, understanding, and shaping human behavior, focusing on real-world behavior of users as measured using passive sensors. Second, we present a case study on how trust, which is an important building block of computational social systems, can be quantified, sensed, and applied to shape human behavior. Our findings suggest that: 1) trust can be operationalized and predicted via computational methods (passive sensing and network analysis) and 2) trust has a significant impact on social persuasion; in fact, it was found to be significantly more effective than the closeness of ties in determining the amount of behavior change.},

	abstract = {Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people’s perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one’s location information, but people would likely view the map’s use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users’ expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people’s expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.},

Taking inspiration from animal behavior studies that have reported significant interconnections between animal spatio-temporal "foraging" behavior and their life outcomes, we analyzed a corpus of hundreds of thousands of human economic transactions and found that financial outcomes for individuals are intricately linked with their spatio-temporal traits like exploration, engagement, and elasticity. Such features yield models that are 30\% to 49\% better at predicting future financial difficulties than the comparable demographic models.},

	abstract = {Access to financial institutions is difficult in developing economies and especially for the poor. However, the widespread adoption of mobile phones has enabled the development of mobile money systems that deliver financial services through the mobile phone network. Despite the success of mobile money, there is a lack of quantitative studies that unveil which factors contribute to the adoption and sustained usage of such services. In this paper, we describe the results of a quantitative study that analyzes data from the world's leading mobile money service, M-Pesa. We analyzed millions of anonymized mobile phone communications and M-Pesa transactions in an African country. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we analyze the customers' usage of M-Pesa and report large-scale patterns of behavior; (2) we present the results of applying machine learning models to predict mobile money adoption (AUC=0.691), and mobile money spending (AUC=0.619) using multiple data sources: mobile phone data, M-Pesa agent information, the number of M-Pesa friends in the user's social network, and the characterization of the user's geographic location; (3) we discuss the most predictive features in both models and draw key implications for the design of mobile money services in a developing country. We find that the most predictive features are related to mobile phone activity, to the presence of M-Pesa users in a customer's ego-network and to mobility. We believe that our work will contribute to the understanding of the factors playing a role in the adoption and sustained usage of mobile money services in developing economies.},

Using a data set involving 52 adults (26 couples) living in a community for over a year, we find that social behavior measured via face-to-face interaction, call, and SMS logs, can be used to predict the spending behavior for couples in terms of their propensity to explore diverse businesses, become loyal customers, and overspend. Our results show that mobile phone based social interaction patterns can provide more predictive power on spending behavior than often-used personality based features. Obtaining novel insights on spending behavior using social-computing frameworks can be of vital importance to economists, marketing professionals, and policy makers. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Mobile sensing relies on data contributed by users through their mobile device (e.g., smart phone) to obtain useful information about people and their surroundings. However, users may not want to contribute due to lack of incentives and concerns on possible privacy leakage. To effectively promote user participation, both incentive and privacy issues should be addressed. Existing work on privacy-aware incentive is limited to special scenario of mobile sensing where each sensing task needs only one data report from each user, and thus not appropriate for generic scenarios in which sensing tasks may require multiple reports from each user (e.g., in environmental monitoring applications). In this paper, we propose a privacy-aware incentive scheme for general mobile sensing, which allows each sensing task to collect one or multiple reports from each user as needed. Besides being more flexible in task management, our scheme has much lower computation and communication cost compared to the existing solution. Evaluations show that, when each node only contributes data for a small fraction of sensing tasks (e.g, due to the incapability or disqualification to generate sensing data for other tasks), our scheme runs at least one order of magnitude faster.},

Our analysis does not limit itself to looking at permissions people feel comfortable granting to an app. Instead it relies on static code analysis to determine the purpose for which an app requests each of its permissions, distinguishing for instance between apps relying on particular permissions to deliver their core functionality and apps requesting these permissions to share information with advertising networks or social networks. Using privacy preferences that reflect people’s comfort with the purpose for which different apps request their permissions, we use clustering techniques to identify privacy profiles. A major contribution of this work is to show that, while people’s mobile app privacy preferences are diverse, it is possible to identify a small number of privacy profiles that collectively do a good job at capturing these diverse preferences.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n},

We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues associated with the protection and sharing of personal information. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance, and detract from, individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered, because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists.},

While any one individual may not provide sufficient samples, aggregating samples across many individuals provides high-quality, high-coverage measurements of the phenomena. Thus, for participatory sensing to be successful, one must motivate a large number of individuals to participate. In this work, we review a variety of incentive mechanisms that motivate people to contribute to a CS effort. We then establish a set of design constraints or minimum requirements that any incentive mechanism for CS must have. These design constrains are then used as metrics to evaluate those approaches and determine their advantages and disadvantages. We also contribute a taxonomy of CS incentive mechanisms and show how current systems fit within this taxonomy. We conclude with the identification of new types of incentive mechanisms that require further investigation.},

	abstract = {Mobile phone sensing is a new paradigm which takes ad-vantage of the pervasive smartphones to collect and ana-lyze data beyond the scale of what was previously possi-ble. In a mobile phone sensing system, the platform re-cruits smartphone users to provide sensing service. Existing mobile phone sensing applications and systems lack good incentive mechanisms that can attract more user participa-tion. To address this issue, we design incentive mechanisms for mobile phone sensing. We consider two system models: the platform-centric model where the platform provides a reward shared by participating users, and the user-centric model where users have more control over the payment they will receive. For the platform-centric model, we design an incentive mechanism using a Stackelberg game, where the platform is the leader while the users are the followers. We show how to compute the unique Stackelberg Equilibrium, at which the utility of the platform is maximized, and none of the users can improve its utility by unilaterally deviating from its current strategy. For the user-centric model, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism, which is com-putationally efficient, individually rational, profitable, and truthful. Through extensive simulations, we evaluate the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our incentive mechanisms.},

Most prior sensor-network research has focused on collecting and processing environmental data using a static topology and an application-aware infrastructure, whereas opportunistic sensing involves collecting, storing, processing and fusing large volumes of data related to everyday human activities. This highly dynamic and mobile setting, where humans are the central focus, presents new challenges for information security, because data originates from sensors carried by people - not tiny sensors thrown in the forest or attached to animals. In this paper we aim to instigate discussion of this critical issue, because opportunistic people-centric sensing will never succeed without adequate provisions for security and privacy. To that end, we outline several important challenges and suggest general solutions that hold promise in this new sensing paradigm.},

In this paper, we study a critical problem in MCS systems, namely, incentivizing user participation. Different from existing work, we incorporate a crucial metric, called users’ quality of information (QoI), into our incentive mechanisms for MCS systems. Due to various fac- tors (e.g., sensor quality, noise, etc.) the quality of the sensory data contributed by individual users varies significantly. Obtaining high quality data with little expense is always the ideal of MCS platforms. Technically, we design incentive mechanisms based on reverse combinatorial auctions. We investigate both the single- minded and multi-minded combinatorial auction models. For the former, we design a truthful, individual rational and computation- ally efficient mechanism that approximately maximizes the social welfare with a guaranteed approximation ratio. For the latter, we design an iterative descending mechanism that achieves close-to- optimal social welfare while satisfying individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we vali- date our theoretical analysis about the close-to-optimal social wel- fare and fast running time of our mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Do people really care about their privacy? Surveys show that privacy is a primary concern for citizens in the digital age. On the other hand, individuals reveal personal information for relatively small rewards, often just for drawing the attention of peers in an online social network. This inconsistency of privacy attitudes and privacy behaviour is often referred to as the “privacy paradox”. In this paper, we present the results of a review of research literature on the privacy paradox. We analyse studies that provide evidence of a paradoxical dichotomy between attitudes and behaviour and studies that challenge the existence of such a phenomenon. The diverse research results are explained by the diversity in research methods, the different contexts and the different conceptualisations of the privacy paradox. We also present several interpretations of the privacy paradox, stemming from social theory, psychology, behavioural economics and, in one case, from quantum theory. We conclude that current research has improved our understanding of the privacy paradox phenomenon. It is, however, a complex phenomenon that requires extensive further research. Thus, we call for synthetic studies to be based on comprehensive theoretical models that take into account the diversity of personal information and the diversity of privacy concerns. We suggest that future studies should use evidence of actual behaviour rather than self-reported behaviour.},

	doi = {10.2196/jmir.4273},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Depression is a common, burdensome, often recurring mental health disorder that frequently goes undetected and untreated. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and have an increasingly large complement of sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns that might be indicative of depressive symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone global positioning systems (GPS) and usage sensors, and their use in identifying depressive symptom severity. METHODS: A total of 40 adult participants were recruited from the general community to carry a mobile phone with a sensor data acquisition app (Purple Robot) for 2 weeks. Of these participants, 28 had sufficient sensor data received to conduct analysis. At the beginning of the 2-week period, participants completed a self-reported depression survey (PHQ-9). Behavioral features were developed and extracted from GPS location and phone usage data. RESULTS: A number of features from GPS data were related to depressive symptom severity, including circadian movement (regularity in 24-hour rhythm; r=-.63, P=.005), normalized entropy (mobility between favorite locations; r=-.58, P=.012), and location variance (GPS mobility independent of location; r=-.58, P=.012). Phone usage features, usage duration, and usage frequency were also correlated (r=.54, P=.011, and r=.52, P=.015, respectively). Using the normalized entropy feature and a classifier that distinguished participants with depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 score ≥5) from those without (PHQ-9 score {\textless}5), we achieved an accuracy of 86.5\%. Furthermore, a regression model that used the same feature to estimate the participants’ PHQ-9 scores obtained an average error of 23.5\%. CONCLUSIONS: Features extracted from mobile phone sensor data, including GPS and phone usage, provided behavioral markers that were strongly related to depressive symptom severity. While these findings must be replicated in a larger study among participants with confirmed clinical symptoms, they suggest that phone sensors offer numerous clinical opportunities, including continuous monitoring of at-risk populations with little patient burden and interventions that can provide just-in-time outreach.},

	abstract = {Alcohol use in young adults is common, with high rates of morbidity and mortality largely due to periodic, heavy drinking episodes (HDEs). Behavioral interventions delivered through electronic communication modalities (e.g., text messaging) can reduce the frequency of HDEs in young adults, but effects are small. One way to amplify these effects is to deliver support materials proximal to drinking occasions, but this requires knowledge of when they will occur. Mobile phones have built-in sensors that can potentially be useful in monitoring behavioral patterns associated with the initiation of drinking occasions. The objective of our work is to explore the detection of daily-life behavioral markers using mobile phone sensors and their utility in identifying drinking occasions. We utilized data from 30 young adults aged 21-28 with past hazardous drinking and collected mobile phone sensor data and daily Experience Sampling Method (ESM) of drinking for 28 consecutive days. We built a machine learning-based model that is 96.6\% accurate at identifying non-drinking, drinking and heavy drinking episodes. We highlight the most important features for detecting drinking episodes and identify the amount of historical data needed for accurate detection. Our results suggest that mobile phone sensors can be used for automated, continuous monitoring of at-risk populations to detect drinking episodes and support the delivery of timely interventions.},

	abstract = {Many of today's mobile products and services engage their users proactively via push notifications. However, such notifications are not always delivered at the right moment, therefore not meeting products' and users' expectations. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an intelligent mobile system that automatically infers moments in which users are open to engage with suggested content. To inform the development of such a system, we carried out a field study with 337 mobile phone users. For 4 weeks, participants ran a study application on their primary phones. They were tasked to frequently report their current mood via a notification-administered experience-sampling questionnaire. In this study, however, we analyze whether they voluntarily engaged with content that we offered at the bottom of that questionnaire. In addition, the study app logged a wide range of data related to their phone use. Based on 120 Million phone-use events and 78,930 questionnaire notifications, we build a machine-learning model that before delivering a notification predicts whether a participant will click on the notification and subsequently engage with the offered content. When compared to a naïve baseline, which emulates current non-intelligent engagement strategies, our model achieves 66.6\% higher success rate in its predictions. If the model also considers the user's past behavior, predictions improve 5-fold over the baseline. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for building an intelligent service that identifies opportune moments for proactive user engagement, while, at the same time, reduces the number of undesirable interruptions.},

In this work, we investigate how college students wear smartwatches and what factors affect wearing behaviors by analyzing a longitudinal activity dataset collected from 50 smartwatch users for 203 days. Our results show that there are several temporal usage patterns and distinct groups of usage patterns. The factors affecting wearing behaviors are contextual, nuanced, and multifaceted.

	abstract = {Large-scale mobile data studies can reveal valuable insights into user behavior, which in turn can assist system designers to create better user experiences. After a careful review of existing mobile data literature, we found that there have been no large-scale studies to understand smartphone usage behavior in India -- the second-largest and fastest growing smartphone market in the world. With the goal of understanding various facets of smartphone usage in India, we conducted a mixed-method longitudinal data collection study through an Android app released on Google Play. Our app was installed by 215 users, and logged 11.9 million data points from them over a period of 8 months. We analyzed this rich dataset along the lines of four broad facets of smartphone behavior -- how users use different apps, interact with notihcations, react to different contexts, and charge their smartphones -- to paint a holistic picture of smartphone usage behavior of Indian users. This quantitative analysis was complemented by a survey with 55 users and semi-structured interviews with 26 users to deeply understand their smartphone usage behavior. While our first-of-its-kind study uncovered many interesting facts about Indian smartphone users, we also found striking differences in usage behavior compared to past studies in other geographical contexts. We observed that Indian users spend significant time with their smartphones after midnight, continuously check notifications without attending to them and are extremely conscious about their smartphones’ battery. Perhaps the most dramatic finding is the nature of mobile consumerism of Indian users as shown by our results. Taken together, these and the rest of our findings demonstrate the unique characteristics that are shaping the smartphone usage behavior of Indian users.},

	abstract = {Submarine channel avulsion is a fundamental process in the evolution of submarine fans that records abrupt changes in the sediment dispersal patterns, and the development of sand-rich splay deposits. On passive margins, changing flow conditions have been invoked to explain the location and timing of channel avulsion. On tectonically active basin margins, processes such as seismic activity, seabed faulting and folding and emplacement of mass-transport complexes (MTCs) are additional triggers. This study is based on the detailed mapping and interpretation of the first 1000m below seabed of a 1900km23D seismic volume in the southern Magdalena Fan, offshore Colombia, a tectonically-active margin. The emplacement of a large MTC deposit ({\textgreater}400km2in area and 200m in thickness) is interpreted to have controlled the avulsion node of a major channel-levee complex-set and influenced the evolution of the subsequent avulsion lobe complex-set. The basal surface of the MTC is highly erosional resulting in net degradation of the seascape. Substrate entrainment by the MTC left behind a narrow erosional remnant ridge that formed a bathymetric anomaly upon which a channel-levee complex-set developed. The irregular levee geometries above the remnant ridge led to instability and levee collapse prior to channel avulsion. Map view geometries and seismic amplitude extractions suggest that the initial avulsion lobes were mud-prone and relatively erratically distributed, and evolved to form well-defined sand-prone lobes. The distribution, morphology and evolution of the avulsion lobe complexes were strongly influenced by the bathymetric anomalies on the MTC top surface which, are generally coincident with protruding megaclasts. The role of MTC emplacement in triggering submarine channel avulsion and the development of sand-prone deposits in proximal locations has important implications for hydrocarbon exploration and production. This study serves as a high-resolution, shallow-subsurface analogue for less well-imaged avulsion cycles on tectonically-active basin margins that are prone to MTCs.},

We present results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive sensing data, self-reports, and clinician administered 7-item BPRS surveys are collected from 36 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-12 months. We show that our system can predict a symptom scale score based on a 7-item BPRS within ±1.45 error on average using automatically tracked behavioral features from phones (e.g., mobility, conversation, activity, smartphone usage, the ambient acoustic environment) and user supplied self-reports. Importantly, we show our system is also capable of predicting an individual BPRS score within ±1.59 error purely based on passive sensing from phones without any self-reported information from outpatients. Finally, we discuss how well our predictive system reflects symptoms experienced by patients by reviewing a number of case studies.},

However, they either depend on special hardware sensors or suffer from the high noise due to the weakness of the heart signals, affecting their accuracy in many practical scenarios. Inspired by medical studies about the heart motion mechanics, we propose the HeartSense heart rate estimation system. Specifically, we show that the gyroscope sensor is the most sensitive sensor for measuring the heart rate. To further counter noise and handle different practical scenarios, we introduce a novel quality metric that allows us to fuse the different gyroscope axes in a probabilistic framework to achieve a robust and accurate estimate. We have implemented and evaluated our system on different Android phones. Results using 836 experiments on different subjects in practical scenarios with a side-by-side comparison with other systems show that HeartSense can achieve 1.03 bpm median absolute error for heart rate estimation. This is better than the state-of-the-art by more than 147\% in median error, highlighting HeartSense promise as a ubiquitous system for medical and personal well-being applications.},

In this collaboration between engineers and psychologists, we present the first study to use smartphone sensors to examine socially anxious individuals’ fine-grained behaviors around periods in which they engage in some form of social interaction, and how these behaviors differ as a function of location (e.g., at home, at work, or at an unfamiliar location). In a two-week study of 52 college students, we show that there is a significant difference in behaviors for individuals based on social anxiety levels and locations, in that individuals higher (vs. lower) in social anxiety symptoms exhibit more movement (as tracked by the accelerometer) around the time of phone calls, especially in an unfamiliar location (i.e., not home or at work). Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for developing better interventions for socially anxious individuals.},

Recognizing context in-the-wild is challenging because of great variability in behavioral patterns, and it requires a complex mapping from sensor features to predicted labels. Data collected in-the-wild may be unbalanced and incomplete, with cases of missing labels or missing sensors. We propose using the multiple layer perceptron (MLP) as a multi-task model for context recognition. Based on features from multi-modal sensors, the model simultaneously predicts many diverse context labels. We analyze the advantages of the model's hidden layers, which are shared among all sensors and all labels, and provide insight to the behavioral patterns that these hidden layers may capture. We demonstrate how recognition of new labels can be improved when utilizing a model that was trained for an initial set of labels, and show how to train the model to withstand missing sensors. We evaluate context recognition on the previously published ExtraSensory Dataset, which was collected in-the-wild. Compared to previously suggested models, the MLP improves recognition, even with fewer parameters than a linear model. The ability to train a good model using data that has incomplete, unbalanced labeling and missing sensors encourages further research with uncontrolled, in-the-wild behavior.},

	abstract = {Sleep is an important part of our daily routine-we spend about one-third of our time doing it. By tracking sleep-related events and activities, sleep monitoring provides decision support to help us understand sleep quality and causes of poor sleep. Wearable devices provide a new way for sleep monitoring, allowing us to monitor sleep from the comfort of our own home. However, existing solutions do not take full advantage of the rich sensor data provided by these devices. In this paper, we present the design and development of SleepGuard, a novel approach to track a wide range of sleep-related events using smartwatches. We show that using merely a single smartwatch, it is possible to capture a rich amount of information about sleep events and sleeping context, including body posture and movements, acoustic events, and illumination conditions. We demonstrate that through these events it is possible to estimate sleep quality and identify factors affecting it most. We evaluate our approach by conducting extensive experiments involved fifteen users across a 2-week period. Our experimental results show that our approach can track a richer set of sleep events, provide better decision support for evaluating sleep quality, and help to identify causes for sleep problems compared to prior work.},

In this paper, we present an empirical study of the correlation between user mobility and app usage patterns. In particular, we focus on users' moving speed as the key mobility metric, and try to answer the following question: are there any notable relations between moving speed and the app usage patterns? Our study is based on a real-world, large-scale dataset of 2G phone network data request records. A critical challenge was that the raw data records are rather coarse-grained. More specifically, unlike GPS traces, the exact locations of users were not readily available. We inferred users' approximate locations according to their interactions with nearby cell towers, whose locations were known. We proposed a novel method to filter out noises and perform reliable speed estimation. We verify our methodology with out of sample data and show its improvement in speed estimation accuracy. We then examined several aspects of mobile data usage patterns, including the data volume, the access frequency, and the app categories, to reveal the correlation between these patterns and users' moving speed. Experimental results based on our large-scale real-world datasets revealed that users under different mobility categories not only have different smartphone usage motivations but also have different ways of using their smartphones.},

Objective: To evaluate whether phone sensor data and machine learning models are useful to detect alcohol use events, and to discuss implications of these results for just-in-time mobile interventions. Methods: 38 non-treatment seeking young adult heavy drinkers downloaded AWARE app (which continuously collected mobile phone sensor data), and reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks, start/end time of prior day's drinking) for 28 days. We tested various machine learning models using the 20 most informative sensor features to classify time periods as non-drinking, low-risk (1 to 3/4 drinks per occasion for women/men), and high-risk drinking ({\textgreater} 4/5 drinks per occasion for women/men). Results: Among 30 participants in the analyses, 207 non-drinking, 41 low-risk, and 45 high-risk drinking episodes were reported. A Random Forest model using 30-min windows with 1 day of historical data performed best for detecting high-risk drinking, correctly classifying high-risk drinking windows 90.9\% of the time. The most informative sensor features were related to time (i.e., day of week, time of day), movement (e.g., change in activities), device usage (e.g., screen duration), and communication (e.g., call duration, typing speed). Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests that sensor data captured from mobile phones of young adults is useful in building accurate models to detect periods of high-risk drinking. Interventions using mobile phone sensor features could trigger delivery of a range of interventions to potentially improve effectiveness.},

CrossCheck is the first step towards the passive monitoring of mental health indicators in patients with schizophrenia and paves the way towards relapse prediction and early intervention. In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing randomized control trial, where passive smartphone sensor data is collected from 21 outpatients with schizophrenia recently discharged from hospital over a period ranging from 2-8.5 months. Our results indicate that there are statistically significant associations between automatically tracked behavioral features related to sleep, mobility, conversations, smartphone usage and self-reported indicators of mental health in schizophrenia. Using these features we build inference models capable of accurately predicting aggregated scores of mental health indicators in schizophrenia with a mean error of 7.6\% of the score range. Finally, we discuss results on the level of personalization that is needed to account for the known variations within people. We show that by leveraging knowledge from a population with schizophrenia, it is possible to train accurate personalized models that require fewer individual-specific data to quickly adapt to new users.},

This paper introduces MyBehavior, a smartphone application that takes a novel approach to generate deeply personalized health feedback. It combines state-of-the-art behavior tracking with algorithms that are used in recommendation systems. MyBehavior automatically learns a user's physical activity and dietary behavior and strategically suggests changes to those behaviors for a healthier lifestyle. The system uses a sequential decision making algorithm, Multi-armed Bandit, to generate suggestions that maximize calorie loss and are easy for the user to adopt. In addition, the system takes into account user's preferences to encourage adoption using the pareto-frontier algorithm. In a 14-week study, results show statistically significant increases in physical activity and decreases in food calorie when using MyBehavior compared to a control condition.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}n},

We assess the effectiveness of personalised prediction models generated using a combination of self-reported content importance and contextual information. We uncover four distinct user types, based on the number of daily notifications and interaction choices. We showcase how usage traits of these groups highlight the requirement for notification filtering approaches, e.g., when specific users habitually neglect to manually filter out unimportant notifications. Our machine learning-based predictor, based on both contextual sensing and notification contents can predict the user's preference for successfully acknowledging an incoming notification with 91.1\% mean accuracy, crucial for time-critical user engagement and interventions.},

	volume = {19},
	issn = {14388871},
	doi = {10.2196/jmir.6820},
	abstract = {Background: Research in psychology demonstrates a strong link between state affect (moment-to-moment experiences of positive or negative emotionality) and trait affect (eg, relatively enduring depression and social anxiety symptoms), and a tendency to withdraw (eg, spending time at home). However, existing work is based almost exclusively on static, self-reported descriptions of emotions and behavior that limit generalizability. Despite adoption of increasingly sophisticated research designs and technology (eg, mobile sensing using a global positioning system [GPS]), little research has integrated these seemingly disparate forms of data to improve understanding of how emotional experiences in everyday life are associated with time spent at home, and whether this is influenced by depression or social anxiety symptoms. Objective: We hypothesized that more time spent at home would be associated with more negative and less positive affect. Methods: We recruited 72 undergraduate participants from a southeast university in the United States. We assessed depression and social anxiety symptoms using self-report instruments at baseline. An app (Sensus) installed on participants' personal mobile phones repeatedly collected in situ self-reported state affect and GPS location data for up to 2 weeks. Time spent at home was a proxy for social isolation. Results: We tested separate models examining the relations between state affect and time spent at home, with levels of depression and social anxiety as moderators. Models differed only in the temporal links examined. One model focused on associations between changes in affect and time spent at home within short, 4-hour time windows. The other 3 models focused on associations between mean-level affect within a day and time spent at home (1) the same day, (2) the following day, and (3) the previous day. Overall, we obtained many of the expected main effects (although there were some null effects), in which higher social anxiety was associated with more time or greater likelihood of spending time at home, and more negative or less positive affect was linked to longer homestay. Interactions indicated that, among individuals higher in social anxiety, higher negative affect and lower positive affect within a day was associated with greater likelihood of spending time at home the following day. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of modeling the relationship between affect and homestay using fine-grained GPS data. Although these findings must be replicated in a larger study and with clinical samples, they suggest that integrating repeated state affect assessments in situ with continuous GPS data can increase understanding of how actual homestay is related to affect in everyday life and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.},

We conclude with a second, in-lab study that evaluates our clas- sification stack, demonstrating 95.2\% accuracy across 25 hand activities.

	abstract = {Sensor-enabled smartphones are opening a new frontier in the development of mobile sensing applications. The recognition of human activities and context from sensor-data using classification models underpins these emerging applications. However, conventional approaches to training classifiers struggle to cope with the diverse user populations routinely found in large-scale popular mobile applications. Differences between users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training process. Under CSN every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor-data to personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users. This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different dimensions of inter-person similarity. Our experiments show CSN outperforms existing approaches to classifier training under the presence of population diversity. © 2011 ACM.},

In this paper we seek to answer whether mobile phones can be used to unobtrusively monitor individuals affected by depressive mood disorders by analyzing only their mobility patterns from GPS traces. In order to get ground-Truth measurements, we have developed a smartphone application that periodically collects the locations of the users and the answers to daily questionnaires that quantify their depressive mood. We demonstrate that there exists a significant correlation between mobility trace characteristics and the depressive moods. Finally, we present the design of models that are able to successfully predict changes in the depressive mood of individuals by analyzing their movements.},

To assess this opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06\% accuracy, daily sleep quality with 83.97\% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48\% accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models, where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality, respectively. Finally, the features of noise and movement were useful to infer sleep quality.},

This allows our algorithm to smoothly transition between “out of the box” with no training data to more fully trained with increasing numbers of observations. Multiple components of the analysis are fused via Bayesian inference to produce a probabilistic map of destinations.

We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm.

To identify how a simple routine learner can demonstrate this in support of family coordination, we conducted six months of nightly interviews with six families, focusing on how they make and execute plans. Our data reveals that only about 40\% of events unfold in a routine manner. When deviations do occur, family members often need but do not have access to accurate information about their routines. With about 90\% of their content concerning deviations, not routines, families do not rely on calendars to support them during these moments. We discuss how coordination tools, like calendars and reminder systems, would improve coordination and reduce stress when augmented with routine information, and how commercial mobile phones can support the automatic creation of routine models. © 2010 ACM.},

A number of studies have investigated driving style, but they often rely on the use of self-reports or simulators, which are not suitable for the real-time, continuous, automated assessment and feedback on the road. In order to understand and model aggressive driving style, we construct an invehicle sensing platform that uses a smartphone instead of using heavyweight, expensive systems. Utilizing additional cheap sensors, our sensing platform can collect useful information about vehicle movement, maneuvering and steering wheel movement. We use this data and apply machine learning to build a driver model that evaluates drivers' driving styles based on a number of driving-related features. From a naturalistic data collection from 22 drivers for 3 weeks, we analyzed the characteristics of drivers who have an aggressive driving style. Our model classified those drivers with an accuracy of 90.5\% (violation-class) and 81\% (questionnaire-class). We describe how, in future work, our model can be used to provide real-time feedback to drivers using only their current smartphone. Copyright © ACM.},

It is argued that the proposed framework resolves a discrepancy in the current driver modeling literature, by explaining not only the short-latency, well-tuned, closed-loop type of control of routine driving, but also the degradation into long-latency, ill-tuned open-loop control in more rare, unexpected, and urgent situations such as near-accidents.},

Although studies exist on the sharing of specific types of information (photos, posts, etc.), one area that has been less explored is how Facebook profiles can share personality information in a broad, machine-readable fashion. In this study, we apply data-mining and machine learning techniques to predict users' personality traits (specifically, the traits of the Big Five personality model) using only demographic and text-based attributes extracted from their profiles. We then use these predictions to rank individuals in terms of the five traits, predicting which users will appear in the top or bottom 5\% or 10\% of these traits. Our results show that when using certain models, we can find the top 10\% most Open individuals with nearly 75\% accuracy, and across all traits and directions, we can predict the top 10\% with at least 34.5\% accuracy (exceeding 21.8\%, which is the best accuracy when using just the best-performing profile attribute).

However, the Markovian framework makes strong restrictive assumptions about the system generating the signal - that it is a single process having a small number of states and an extremely limited state memory. The single-process model is often inappropriate for vision (and speech) applications, resulting in low ceilings on model performance.

Locations such as bus stops and parking lots, where the user frequently changes mode of transportation, are learned from GPS data logs without manual labeling of training data. We experimentally demonstrate how to accurately detect novel behavior or user errors (e.g. taking a wrong bus) by explicitly modeling activities in the context of the user's historical data.

We present the design, implementation and evaluation of the Jigsaw continuous sensing engine, which balances the performance needs of the application and the resource demands of continuous sensing on the phone. Jigsaw comprises a set of sensing pipelines for the accelerometer, microphone and GPS sensors, which are built in a plug and play manner to support: i) resilient accelerometer data processing, which allows inferences to be robust to different phone hardware, orientation and body positions; ii) smart admission control and on-demand processing for the microphone and accelerometer data, which adaptively throttles the depth and sophistication of sensing pipelines when the input data is low quality or uninformative; and iii) adaptive pipeline processing, which judiciously triggers power hungry pipeline stages (e.g., sampling the GPS) taking into account the mobility and behavioral patterns of the user to drive down energy costs. We implement and evaluate Jigsaw on the Nokia N95 and the Apple iPhone, two popular smartphone platforms, to demonstrate its capability to recognize user activities and perform long term GPS tracking in an energy-efficientmanner.

Given emerging sensor technology, however, it is possible to view activity data as a stream of natural language terms. Activity models are then mappings from such terms to activity names, and may be extracted from text corpora such as the web. We show that models so extracted are sufficient to automatically produce labeled segmentations of activity data with an accuracy of 42\% over 26 activities, well above the 3.8\% baseline. The segmentation so obtained is sufficient to bootstrap learning, with accuracy of learned models increasing to 52\%.

	volume = {18},

	abstract = {Background: Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pokémon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on physical activity. Methods: We study the effect of Pokémon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pokémon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers. Results: We find that Pokémon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25\% increase compared with their prior activity level (P{\textless}.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pokémon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pokémon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pokémon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population. Conclusions: Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.},

We propose StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from human voice using smartphones. We investigate methods for adapting a one-size-fitsall stress model to individual speakers and scenarios. We demonstrate that the StressSense classifier can robustly identify stress across multiple individuals in diverse acoustic environments: using model adaptation StressSense achieves 81\% and 76\% accuracy for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. We show that StressSense can be implemented on commodity Android phones and run in real-time.

	abstract = {The ability to determine what day-to-day activity (such as cooking pasta, taking a pill, or watching a video) a person is performing is of interest in many application domains. A system that can do this requires models of the activities of interest, but model construction does not scale well: humans must specify low-level details, such as segmentation and feature selection of sensor data, and high-level structure, such as spatio-temporal relations between states of the model, for each and every activity. As a result, previous practical activity recognition systems have been content to model a tiny fraction of the thousands of human activities that are potentially useful to detect. In this paper, we present an approach to sensing and modeling activities that scales to a much larger class of activities than before. We show how a new class of sensors, based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, can directly yield semantic terms that describe the state of the physical world. These sensors allow us to formulate activity models by translating labeled activities, such as "cooking pasta", into probabilistic collections of object terms, such as "pot". Given this view of activity models as text translations, we show how to mine definitions of activities in an unsupervised manner from the web. We have used our technique to mine definitions for over 20,000 activities. We experimentally validate our approach using data gathered from actual human activity as well as simulated data.},

Recent Findings: To date, most studies consist of pilot evaluations demonstrating feasibility and acceptability of monitoring sleep using smartphones and wearable devices among individuals with psychiatric disorders. Promising findings show early associations between behaviors and sleep parameters and agreement between clinic-based assessments, active smartphone data capture, and passively collected data. Few studies report improvement in sleep or mental health outcomes. Summary: Success of smartphone-based sleep assessments and interventions requires emphasis on promoting long-term adherence, exploring possibilities of adaptive and personalized systems to predict risk/relapse, and determining impact of sleep monitoring on improving patients’ quality of life and clinically meaningful outcomes.},

Subjects downloaded and used the Mindful Moods app on their personal smartphone to complete up to three survey sessions per day, during which a randomized subset of PHQ-9 symptoms of major depressive disorder were assessed on a Likert scale. The study lasted 29 or 30 days without additional follow-up. Outcome measures included adherence, measured by the percentage of completed survey sessions, and estimates of daily PHQ-9 scores collected from the smartphone app, as well as from the traditionally administered PHQ-9.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Overall adherence was 77.78\% (903/1161) and varied with time of day. PHQ-9 estimates collected from the app strongly correlated (r=.84) with traditionally administered PHQ-9 scores, but app-collected scores were 3.02 (SD 2.25) points higher on average. More subjects reported suicidal ideation using the app than they did on the traditionally administered PHQ-9.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with major depressive disorder are able to utilize an app on their personal smartphones to self-assess their symptoms of major depressive disorder with high levels of adherence. These app-collected results correlate with the traditionally administered PHQ-9.

Inferences stemming from such minimal information can be quite accurate, and nonverbal behavior plays an important role in the impression formation. Because protagonists are strangers, employment interviews are a case where both nonverbal behavior and thin slices can be predictive of outcomes. In this work, we analyze the predictive validity of thin slices of real job interviews, where slices are defined by the sequence of questions in a structured interview format. We approach this problem from an audio-visual, dyadic, and nonverbal perspective, where sensing, cue extraction, and inference are automated. Our study shows that although nonverbal behavioral cues extracted from thin slices were not as predictive as when extracted from the full interaction, they were still predictive of hirability impressions with R2 values up to 0.34, which was comparable to the predictive validity of human observers on thin slices. Applicant audio cues were found to yield the most accurate results.},

Results: Among the various challenges discussed in the ethical literature, informational privacy, informed consent, and data security were the primary focus of the current debate. Other topics of discussion were the evaluation and regulation of products, equity in access, vulnerable patient groups, ownership, and secondary use. Conclusion: No clear ethical framework has been established that stimulates passive data-driven innovation while protecting patient integrity. The consensus in the ethical literature, as well as the parallels with similar concerns and solutions in other fields, can lay a foundation for the construction of an ethical framework. The future debate should focus on conflicts between two or more ethical, technical, or clinical values to ensure a safe and effective implementation of passive data in healthcare.},

We use mobile phone based co-location and communication sensing to measure characteristic behavior changes in symptomatic individuals, reflected in their total communication, interactions with respect to time of day (e.g., late night, early morning), diversity and entropy of face-to-face interactions and movement. Using these extracted mobile features, it is possible to predict the health status of an individual, without having actual health measurements from the subject. Finally, we estimate the temporal information flux and implied causality between physical symptoms, behavior and mental health. © 2010 ACM.},

	abstract = {Background: Feelings of loneliness are associated with poor physical and mental health. Detection of loneliness through passive sensing on personal devices can lead to the development of interventions aimed at decreasing rates of loneliness. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of using passive sensing to infer levels of loneliness and to identify the corresponding behavioral patterns. Methods: Data were collected from smartphones and Fitbits (Flex 2) of 160 college students over a semester. The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score{\textgreater}40) and low (≤40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner. Results: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8\% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8\% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5\% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9\% [107/160] and post=73.1\% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2\% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4\% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17\% and confidence=92\%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31\% and confidence=92\%). Conclusions: Passive sensing has the potential for detecting loneliness in college students and identifying the associated behavioral patterns. These findings highlight intervention opportunities through mobile technology to reduce the impact of loneliness on individuals’ health and well-being.},

This has led to the adoption of modeling techniques from other disciplines such as kinetic theory or urban planning. Yet these techniques generate movement behavior that is often perceived as not "realistic" for humans or provides only a macroscopic view on mobility. More recent approaches infer mobility models from real traces provided by positioning technologies or by the marks the mobile users leave in the wireless network. However, there is no common framework for assessing and comparing mobilitymodels. In an attempt to provide a solid foundation for realistic mobility modeling in mobile networking research, we take an engineering approach and thoroughly discuss the required steps of model creation and validation. In this context, we survey how and to what extent existing mobility modeling approaches implement the proposed steps. This also summarizes helpful information for readers who do not want to develop a new model, but rather intend to choose among existing ones.},

In this article, we survey recent literature on urban human mobility from a data mining view: from the data collection and cleaning, to the mobility models and the applications. First, we summarize recent public urban human mobility data sets and how to clean and preprocess such data. Second, we describe recent urban human mobility models and predictors, e.g., the deep learning predictor, for predicting urban human mobility. Third, we describe how to evaluate the models and predictors. We conclude by considering how applications can utilize the mobility models and predictive tools for addressing city challenges.},

	abstract = {Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01\% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76\% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21\% TPR, 66.71\% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window. We end by discussing how StressMon can expand CSCW research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management.},

However, feature extraction for characterizing human mobility remains a heuristic process that relies on the domain knowledge of the condition under consideration. Moreover, we do not have guarantees that these "hand-crafted" metrics are able to eï¿¿ectively capture mobility behavior of users. Indeed, informative emerging patterns in the data might not be characterized by them. This is also a complex and often time-consuming task, since it usually consists of a lengthy trial-and-error process. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using autoencoders for automatically extracting features from the raw input data. Through a series of experiments we show the eï¿¿ectiveness of autoencoder-based features for predicting depressive states of individuals compared to "hand-crafted" ones. Our results show that automatically extracted features lead to an improvement of the performance of the prediction models, while, at the same time, reducing the complexity of the feature design task. Moreover, through an extensive experimental performance analysis, we demonstrate the optimal conï¿¿guration of the key parameters at the basis of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of smart devices has enabled remote health monitoring outside of conventional clinical settings, and has reduced health care delivery cost. Passive audio recording is an essential component in remote health monitoring, however, it poses major privacy issues for subjects in uncontrolled environments like their home. There are existing voice activity detection and speech classification methodologies to identify sound events and obfuscate the human speech. However, they result in frequent false positives \$({\textgreater} {\textbackslash}pmb\{94\}{\textbackslash}\%)\$ when distinguishing human speech from other sound events; their performance is limited to a controlled environment for a specific application; and require large amount of labeled data for training. In this paper, we present a novel speech privacy preservation methodology using generative adversarial networks to segment human speech in a recorded audio and generate human-like random speech to replace the original segment. We implemented our methodology and experimented on standard datasets of speech, environmental sounds, and cough samples generated from our internal mobile health study. Compared to current methodologies, our experimental results show much lower speech segmentation true positive rates of 17\% and 14\% for environmental sounds and cough datasets. Moreover, randomly generated audio samples to obfuscate the speech are shown to be likely indistinguishable from human speech (lower than 0.9\% error in spectral attributes).},

FluSense consists of a novel edge-computing sensor system, models and data processing pipelines to track crowd behaviors and influenza-related indicators, such as coughs, and to predict daily ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza caseloads. FluSense uses a microphone array and a thermal camera along with a neural computing engine to passively and continuously characterize speech and cough sounds along with changes in crowd density on the edge in a real-time manner. We conducted an IRB-approved 7 month-long study from December 10, 2018 to July 12, 2019 where we deployed FluSense in four public waiting areas within the hospital of a large university. During this period, the FluSense platform collected and analyzed more than 350,000 waiting room thermal images and 21 million non-speech audio samples from the hospital waiting areas. FluSense can accurately predict daily patient counts with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95. We also compared signals from FluSense with the gold standard laboratory-confirmed influenza case data obtained in the same facility and found that our sensor-based features are strongly correlated with laboratory-confirmed influenza trends.},

	abstract = {Inability to test at scale has become Achille's heel in humanity's ongoing war against COVID-19 pandemic. An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90\% accuracy. AI4COVID-19's performance is likely to improve as more and better data becomes available. This paper presents a proof of concept to encourage controlled clinical trials and serves as a call for labeled cough data. AI4COVID-19 is not designed to compete with clinical testing. Instead, it offers a complementing tele-testing tool deployable anytime, anywhere, by anyone, so clinical-testing and treatment can be channeled to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose BodyBeat, a novel mobile sensing system for capturing and recognizing a diverse range of non-speech body sounds in real-life scenarios. Non-speech body sounds, such as sounds of food intake, breath, laughter, and cough contain invaluable information about our dietary behavior, respiratory physiology, and affect. The BodyBeat mobile sensing system consists of a custom-built piezoelectric microphone and a distributed computational framework that utilizes an ARM microcontroller and an Android smartphone. The custom-built microphone is designed to capture subtle body vibrations directly from the body surface without being perturbed by external sounds. The microphone is attached to a 3D printed neckpiece with a suspension mechanism. The ARM embedded system and the Android smartphone process the acoustic signal from the microphone and identify non-speech body sounds. We have extensively evaluated the BodyBeat mobile sensing system. Our results show that BodyBeat outperforms other existing solutions in capturing and recognizing different types of important non-speech body sounds. © 2014 ACM.},

Several practical issues are considered in developing SymDetector, such as users' privacy concerns about their acoustic data, resource constraints of the smartphone and different contexts of the smartphone. We have implemented SymDetector on Galaxy S3 and evaluated its performance in real experiments involving 16 users and 204 days. The experimental results show that SymDetector can detect these four types of respiratory symptoms with high accuracy under various conditions.},

One way of solving the problem is to check their health condition by a remote-monitoring technique and support them with well-timed treatment. The purpose of this study is to develop an automatic system that can monitor a health condition in real time using acoustical information and detect an abnormal symptom. In this study, cough sound was chosen as a representative acoustical symptom of abnormal health conditions. For the development of the system distinguishing a cough sound from other environmental sounds, a hybrid model was proposed that consists of an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a hidden Markov model (HMM). The ANN model used energy cepstral coefficients obtained by filter banks based on human auditory characteristics as input parameters representing a spectral feature of a sound signal. Subsequently, an output of this ANN model and a filtered envelope of the signal were used for making an input sequence for the HMM that deals with the temporal variation of the sound signal. Compared with the conventional HMM using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the proposed hybrid model improved recognition rates on low SNR from 5 dB down to -10 dB. Finally, a preliminary prototype of the automatic detection system was simply illustrated. © 2009 IEEE.},

Continuous passive monitoring of subjects using mobile sensors can help detect disease, estimate severity, track progression over time, and predict adverse exacerbation events. One of the most convenient avenues to realize this goal is through analysis of passively recorded natural speech patterns. It has been previously established that diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect pause patterns and prosodic features of speech. In this study we present an exploration of the feasibility of using speech features from natural speech to detect pulmonary disease. Experiments were conducted on a cohort of 131 subjects: 91 with asthma and/or COPD, and 40 healthy controls. Patients and healthy subjects were differentiable with 68\% accuracy; moreover, the subset of patients with the highest disease severity were detected with 89\% accuracy.},

Satyr play was a highly self-conscious genre enagaging not only with the same sorts of myths as tragedy, but also with specific literary forms including epic and tragic poetry. Euripides' Cyclops embodies many of the tropes of satyric drama generally, many of which have been identified as folktale motifs. Euripides' Cyclops depicts a potentially more serious side to these paradoxical creatures, whose ambivalence is evident elsewhere in Greek literature and thought.},

Cough type detection is traditionally done by physical examination through hearing patients coughs in a clinical visit which is subjective and costly. This work tries to provide an objective comprehensive approach for cough type detection using an extensive set of acoustic features applied to the recorded audio from a relatively large population of both healthy subjects and patient with various pulmonary diseases and healthy controls.

In this paper, we present DeepEar - the first mobile audio sensing framework built from coupled Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that simultaneously perform common audio sensing tasks. We train DeepEar with a large-scale dataset including unlabeled data from 168 place visits. The resulting learned model, involving 2.3M parameters, enables DeepEar to significantly increase inference robustness to background noise beyond conventional approaches present in mobile devices. Finally, we show DeepEar is feasible for smartphones by building a cloud-free DSP-based prototype that runs continuously, using only 6\% of the smartphone's battery daily.},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

Full-body motion-control games provide an opportunity for these adults to remain active and engaged; these games are not designed with age-related impairments in mind, which prevents the games from being leveraged to increase the activity levels of older adults. In this paper, we present two studies aimed at developing game design guidelines for full-body motion controls for older adults experiencing age-related changes and impairments. Our studies also demonstrate how full-body motion-control games can accommodate a variety of user abilities, have a positive effect on mood and, by extension, the emotional well-being of older adults.

This paper describes novel approaches to easily perform typical basic spatial tasks within a GIS: e.g. pan-, zoom- and selection-operations by using multi-touch gestures in combination with foot gestures. We are interested in understanding how non-expert users interact with such multi-touch surfaces. We provide a categorization and a framework of multi-touch hand gestures for interacting with a GIS. This framework is based on an initial evaluation. We present results of a more detailed in situ-study mainly focusing on multi-user multi-touch interaction with geospatial data. Furthermore we extend our framework using a combination of multi-touch gestures with a small set of foot gestures to solve geospatial tasks. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper presents Kinesthetic Interaction as a unifying concept for describing the body in motion as a foundation for designing interactive systems. Based on the theoretical foundation for Kinesthetic Interaction, a conceptual framework is introduced to reveal bodily potential in relation to three design themes - kinesthetic development, kinesthetic means and kinesthetic disorder; and seven design parameters - engagement, sociality, movability, explicit motivation, implicit motivation, expressive meaning and kinesthetic empathy. The framework is a tool to be utilized when analyzing existing designs, as well as developing designs exploring new ways of designing kinesthetic interactions.},

The methodology was developed through a series of empirical projects, each focusing on different conceptions of movement available within motion-sensing interactive, immersive spaces. The methodology offers designers a set of principles, perspectives, methods, and tools for exploring and testing movement-related design concepts. It is innovative for the inclusion of the perspective of the mover, together with the traditional perspectives of the observer and the machine.

Such an approach requires no instrumentation to the environment, and only minimal instrumentation to the user, and thus enables truly mobile applications. We show robust gesture recognition with an average accuracy of 93\% across 12 whole-body gestures, and promising results for robust location classification within a building. In addition, we demonstrate a real-time interactive system which allows a user to interact with a computer using whole-body gestures.},

Conventional pattern recognition approaches have made tremendous progress in the past years. However, those methods often heavily rely on heuristic hand-crafted feature extraction, which could hinder their generalization performance. Additionally, existing methods are undermined for unsupervised and incremental learning tasks. Recently, the recent advancement of deep learning makes it possible to perform automatic high-level feature extraction thus achieves promising performance in many areas. Since then, deep learning based methods have been widely adopted for the sensor-based activity recognition tasks. This paper surveys the recent advance of deep learning based sensor-based activity recognition. We summarize existing literature from three aspects: sensor modality, deep model, and application.

Human activity recognition (HAR), a field that has garnered a lot of attention in recent years due to its high demand in various application domains, makes use of time-series sensor data to infer activities. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (convnet) is proposed to perform efficient and effective HAR using smartphone sensors by exploiting the inherent characteristics of activities and 1D time-series signals, at the same time providing a way to automatically and data-adaptively extract robust features from raw data. Experiments show that convnets indeed derive relevant and more complex features with every additional layer, although difference of feature complexity level decreases with every additional layer. A wider time span of temporal local correlation can be exploited (1 × 9-1 × 14) and a low pooling size (1 × 2-1 × 3) is shown to be beneficial. Convnets also achieved an almost perfect classification on moving activities, especially very similar ones which were previously perceived to be very difficult to classify. Lastly, convnets outperform other state-of-the-art data mining techniques in HAR for the benchmark dataset collected from 30 volunteer subjects, achieving an overall performance of 94.79\% on the test set with raw sensor data, and 95.75\% with additional information of temporal fast Fourier transform of the HAR data set.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are the most common respiratory diseases that impact millions of people worldwide annually. With advances in mobile computing and machine learning techniques, there has been increased interest in using mobile devices to monitor pulmonary diseases. Nevertheless, the current state-of-the-art technology requires active involvement and high-effort input from the users, impeding continuous monitoring of pulmonary conditions. In this work, two algorithms are proposed for passive assessment of pulmonary condition: one for detection of obstructive pulmonary disease and the other for estimation of the pulmonary function in terms of F EV1/F V C ratio, which is an established clinical metric. The algorithms were developed and validated using the data sets from two studies: research study (healthy=40, patholog-ical=91) and in-clinic study (healthy=10, pathological=60). From the cross-study validation where a classifier was trained on the research data set and tested on the in-clinic data set, the detection accuracy of the pathological class was obtained as 73.7\% and the F1 score was 84.5\% (87.2\% precision and 82.0\% recall). In our regression analysis, the F EV1/F V C ratio was predicted with a mean absolute error of 8.6\%. Our analysis shows promising results and this work presents a meaningful milestone towards the passive assessment of pulmonary functions from spontaneous speech collected from a mobile phone.},

	abstract = {Everyday wearables with enhanced computational capacity, good quality sensors, and machine learning/artificial intelligence enabled algorithms have the potential to play a key role not only in the fitness and wellness sector but also in the field of disease diagnostics and monitoring. The major challenges are a limited number of sensors, reliable data collection and processing, and deployment of computationally efficient algorithms. In this multi-cohort study, we have used everyday wearables such as chest band and smartwatch to investigate the heart rate variability (HRV) of 131 subjects which include 40 healthy controls, 69 asthma patients, 9 COPD patients and 13 patients with a co-morbidity of asthma and COPD. We aimed at a comprehensive investigation by exploring a total of 58 features including time domain, frequency domain, non-linear and entropy measures of HRV to identify the HRV indices that provide significant discriminatory information for classification between healthy and pulmonary patients. Feature ranking has been done by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. Classification of patients with the 15 top ranked features using data from the chest band heart rate sensor as well as estimated HRV parameters from smartwatch PPG signal have been investigated separately. Using the chest band data, a classification accuracy of 82.07\%, precision of 83.13\%, recall of 81.53\% and F-1 score of 81.7\% have been achieved; whereas using the smartwatch data, a classification accuracy of 80\%, precision of 79.9\%, recall of 80\% and F-1 score of 79.94\% have been achieved for the test set with an AdaBoost classifier. Heart rate variability metrics also showed significant correlation with disease severity and impact on health-related quality of life as measured by pulmonary function test, Asthma Symptoms Utility Index and COPD assessment test score respectively. The results indicate that HRV analysis using everyday wearables may be helpful in the assessment and management of asthma and COPD.},

Two experiments with a total of ten test subjects performed six daily activities were conducted in this study: one with a device fixed on the waist in sixteen different orientations and another with three different device locations (i.e., shirt-pocket, trouser-pocket and waist) in two different device orientations. For handling with varying device orientations, a projection-based method for device coordinate system estimation has been proposed. Based on the dataset with sixteen different device orientations, the experimental results have illustrated that the proposed method is efficient for rectifying the acceleration signals into the same coordinate system, yielding significantly improved activity recognition accuracy. After signal transformation, the recognition results of signals acquired from different device locations are compared. The experimental results show that when the sensor is placed on different rigid body, different models are required for certain activities. © 2011 IEEE.},

Without observable diagnostic cri- teria, the signs of depression may go unnoticed, resulting in high demand for detecting depression in advance automati- cally. This paper tackles the challenging problem of forecast- ing severely depressed moods based on self-reported histo- ries. Despite the large amount of research on understanding individual moods including depression, anxiety, and stress based on behavioral logs collected by pervasive computing devices such as smartphones, forecasting depressed moods is still an open question. This paper develops a recurrent neu- ral network algorithm that incorporates categorical embed- ding layers for forecasting depression. We collected large- scale records from 2,382 self-declared depressed people to conduct the experiment. Experimental results show that our method forecast the severely depressed mood of a user based on self-reported histories, with higher accuracy than SVM. The results also showed that the long-term historical information of a user improves the accuracy of forecasting depressed mood.},

A notable feature of our study is that we leverage a dataset that includes clinical ground truth. We find that behavioral data from smartphones can predict clinical depression with good accuracy. In addition, combining behavioral data and PHQ-9 scores can provide prediction accuracy significantly exceeding each in isolation, indicating that behavioral data captures relevant features that are not reflected by PHQ-9 scores. Finally, we develop multi-feature regression models for PHQ-9 scores that achieve significantly improved accuracy compared to direct regression models based on single features.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in wearable sensor technologies have led to a variety of approaches for detecting physiological stress. Even with over a decade of research in the domain, there still exist many significant challenges, including a near-Total lack of reproducibility across studies. Researchers often use some physiological sensors (custom-made or off-The-shelf), conduct a study to collect data, and build machine-learning models to detect stress there is little effort to test the applicability of the model with similar physiological data collected from different devices, or the efficacy of the model on data collected from different studies, populations, or demographics. This paper takes the first step towards testing reproducibility and validity of methods and machine-learning models for stress detection. To this end, we analyzed data from 90 participants, from four independent controlled studies, using two different types of sensors, with different study protocols and research goals. We started by evaluating the performance of models built using data from one study and tested on data from other studies. Next, we evaluated new methods to improve the performance of stress-detection models and found that our methods led to a consistent increase in performance across all studies, irrespective of the device type, sensor type, or the type of stressor. Finally, we developed and evaluated a clustering approach to determine the stressed/not-stressed classification when applying models on data from different studies, and found that our approach performed better than selecting a threshold based on training data. This paper's thorough exploration of reproducibility in a controlled environment provides a critical foundation for deeper study of such methods, and is a prerequisite for tackling reproducibility in free-living conditions.},

Nevertheless, very little research has examined predicting depressed mood within a day, which is essential given the large amount of variation occurring within days. The current study utilized passively collected sensor data collected from a smartphone application to future depressed mood from hour-to-hour in an ecological momentary assessment study in a sample reporting clinical levels of depression (N = 31). Using a combination of nomothetic and idiographically-weighted machine learning models, the results suggest that depressed mood can be accurately predicted from hour to hour with an average correlation between out of sample predicted depressed mood levels and observed depressed mood of 0.587, CI [0.552, 0.621]. This suggests that passively collected smartphone data can accurately predict future depressed mood among a sample reporting clinical levels of depression. If replicated in other samples, this modeling framework may allow just-in-time adaptive interventions to treat depression as it changes in the context of daily life.},

Inspired by the transferrable knowledge learning ability of humans, this paper develops a practical DFGR system based on metalearning to solve the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we design a deep network which could not only learn discriminative deep features, but also learn a transferrable similarity evaluation ability from the training set and apply the learned knowledge to the new testing conditions.

            Increased stability in one’s daily routine is associated with well-being in the general population and often a goal of behavioral interventions for people with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia. Assessing behavioral stability has been limited in clinical research by the use of retrospective scales, which are susceptible to reporting biases and memory inaccuracies. Mobile passive sensors, which are less susceptible to these sources of error, have emerged as tools to assess behavioral patterns in a range of populations. The present study developed and examined a metric of behavioral stability from data generated by a passive sensing system carried by 61 individuals with schizophrenia for one year. This metric—the Stability Index—appeared orthogonal from existing measures drawn from passive sensors and matched the predictive performance of state-of-the-art features. Specifically, greater stability in social activity (e.g., calls and messages) were associated with lower symptoms, and greater stability in physical activity (e.g., being still) appeared associated with elevated symptoms. This study provides additional support for the predictive value of individualized over population-level data in psychiatric populations. The Stability Index offers also a promising tool for generating insights about the impact of behavioral stability in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.},

	abstract = {This review investigates the effects of psychological stress on the human body measured through biosignals. When a potentially threatening stimulus is perceived, a cascade of physiological processes occurs mobilizing the body and nervous system to confront the imminent threat and ensure effective adaptation. Biosignals that can be measured reliably in relation to such stressors include physiological (EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG) and physical measures (respiratory rate, speech, skin temperature, pupil size, eye activity). A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efficiency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review on biosignal patterns caused during stress conditions and reliable practical guidelines towards more efficient detection of stress.},

	abstract = {Objective
Physical or mental imbalance caused by harmful stimuli can induce stress to maintain homeostasis. During chronic stress, the sympathetic nervous system is hyperactivated, causing physical, psychological, and behavioral abnormalities. At present, there is no accepted standard for stress evaluation. This review aimed to survey studies providing a rationale for selecting heart rate variability (HRV) as a psychological stress indicator.


Methods
Term searches in the Web of Science®, National Library of Medicine (PubMed), and Google Scholar databases yielded 37 publications meeting our criteria. The inclusion criteria were involvement of human participants, HRV as an objective psychological stress measure, and measured HRV reactivity.


Results
In most studies, HRV variables changed in response to stress induced by various methods. The most frequently reported factor associated with variation in HRV variables was low parasympathetic activity, which is characterized by a decrease in the high-frequency band and an increase in the low-frequency band. Neuroimaging studies suggested that HRV may be linked to cortical regions (e.g., the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) that are involved in stressful situation appraisal.


Conclusion
In conclusion, the current neurobiological evidence suggests that HRV is impacted by stress and supports its use for the objective assessment of psychological health and stress.},

	abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term ({\textasciitilde}5 min), and ultra-short-term ({\textless}5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from {\textasciitilde}2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

While researchers have been exploring mobile devices for respiration rate monitoring, passive and continuous monitoring is still not feasible due to many usability challenges (e.g., active participation) in existing approaches. This paper presents an end-to-end system called RRMonitor that leverages the movement sensors from commodity earbuds to continuously monitor the respiration rate in near real-time. While developing the systems, we extensively explored some key parameters, algorithms, and approaches from existing literature that are better suited for continuous and passive respiration rate monitoring. RRMonitor can passively track the respiration rate with a mean absolute error as low as 1.64 cycles per minute without requiring active participation from the user.},

Traditionally breathing is monitored using specialized devices such as chestband or spirometers which are uncomfortable for daily use. Recent works show the feasibility of estimating breathing rate using earbuds’ motion sensors. However, non-breathing head motion is one of the biggest challenges for breathing rate estimation using earbuds. In this paper, we propose algorithms to estimate breathing rate in presence of non-breathing head motion using inertial sensors embedded in commodity earbuds. Using the chestband as a reference device, we show that our algorithms can estimate breathing rate in resting positions with error rate 2.34 breaths per minute (BPM). Our algorithms can handle passive head motion and reduce the error by 27.78\%. Furthermore, our algorithms can handle active head motion and help reduce the error by 45.70\% when intentional non-breathing head motion is present in the data segment. It can be a big stride towards passive breathing monitoring in daily life using commodity earbuds.},

	abstract = {Stress plays a critical role in our lives, impacting our productivity and our long-term physiological and psychological well-being. This has motivated the development of stress monitoring solutions to better understand stress, its impact on productivity and teamwork, and help users adapt their habits toward more sustainable stress levels. However, today’s stress monitoring solutions remain obtrusive, requiring active user participation (e.g., self-reporting), interfering with people’s daily activities, and often adding more burden to users looking to reduce their stress. In this paper, we introduce WiStress, the first system that can passively monitor a user’s stress levels by relying on wireless signals. WiStress does not require users to actively provide input or to wear any devices on their bodies. It operates by transmitting ultra-low-power wireless signals and measuring their reflections off the user’s body. WiStress introduces two key innovations. First, it presents the first machine learning network that can accurately and robustly extract heartbeat intervals (IBI’s) from wireless reflections without constraints on a user’s daily activities. Second, it introduces a stress classification framework that combines the extracted heartbeats with other wirelessly captured stress-related features in order to infer a subject’s stress level. We built a prototype of WiStress and tested it on 22 different subjects across different environments in both stress-induced and free-living conditions. Our results demonstrate that WiStress has high accuracy (84\%-95\%) in inferring a person’s stress level in a fully-automated way, paving the way for ubiquitous sensing systems that can monitor stress and provide feedback to improve productivity, health, and well-being.

The TROIKA framework has high estimation accuracy and is robust to strong motion artifacts. Many variants can be straightforwardly derived from this framework. Experimental results on datasets recorded from 12 subjects during fast running at the peak speed of 15 km/h showed that the average absolute error of heart rate estimation was 2.34 beat per minute, and the Pearson correlation between the estimates and the ground truth of heart rate was 0.992.

PPG signal’s second derivative wave contains important health-related information. Thus, analysis of this waveform can help researchers and clinicians to evaluate various cardiovascular-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. Moreover, investigating the second derivative wave of PPG signal can also assist in early detection and diagnosis of various cardiovascular illnesses that may possibly appear later in life. For early recognition and analysis of such illnesses, continuous and real-time monitoring is an important approach that has been enabled by the latest technological advances in sensor technology and wireless communications.

	abstract = {Background: The prevalence of dementia is expected to rapidly increase in the next decades, warranting innovative solutions improving diagnostics, monitoring and resource utilization to facilitate smart housing and living in the nursing home. This systematic review presents a synthesis of research on sensing technology to assess behavioral and psychological symptoms and to monitor treatment response in people with dementia.
Methods: The literature search included medical peer-reviewed English language publications indexed in Embase, Medline, Cochrane library and Web of Sciences, published up to the 5th of April 2019. Keywords included MESH terms and phrases synonymous with “dementia”, “sensor”, “patient”, “monitoring”, “behavior”, and “therapy”. Studies applying both cross sectional and prospective designs, either as randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies were included. The study was registered in PROSPERO 3rd of May 2019.
Results: A total of 1,337 potential publications were identiﬁed in the search, of which 34 were included in this review after the systematic exclusion process. Studies were classiﬁed according to the type of technology used, as (1) wearable sensors, (2) nonwearable motion sensor technologies, and (3) assistive technologies/smart home technologies. Half of the studies investigated how temporarily dense data on motion can be utilized as a proxy for behavior, indicating high validity of using motion data to monitor behavior such as sleep disturbances, agitation and wandering. Further, up to half of the studies represented proof of concept, acceptability and/or feasibility testing. Overall, the technology was regarded as non-intrusive and well accepted.
Conclusions: Targeted clinical application of speciﬁc technologies is poised to revolutionize precision care in dementia as these technologies may be used both by patients and caregivers, and at a systems level to provide safe and effective care. To},

	abstract = {Mental health disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and depression, are prevalent in modern society. Early detection of mental illness is essential to minimize the negative consequences of long-term psychological discomfort and behavioral dysfunction. As a diverse set of embedded sensors in smart mobile devices becomes commonplace, passively and continuously collected mobile sensing data are increasingly being used to develop machine learning based tools for early-stage disease diagnosis. In the training process of machine learning models, self-reported results from ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) are usually employed to provide supervisions. However, complete responses of these high-frequency surveys in the wild are impractical due to heavy user burden and low user engagement. Without the availability of EMA responses in low level of label granularity, the annotations in the high level can only provide weak supervisions. To leverage the vast majority of unannotated data in different levels of granularity, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end graph neural network algorithm called semi-supervised Graph Instance Transformer (SS-GIT) based on multiple instance learning and contrastive self-supervised learning to predict early signs of generalized anxiety disorder and depression under the weak supervisions. Using a mobile sensing dataset that we collected from around 1,300 participants in the wild, our empirical results demonstrate improved performance when compared to the existing state-of-the-art baseline graph neural networks for mental health inference. On average, our proposed model outperforms the best baseline model by 8.8\% on Fl-score, 6.7\% on ROC-AUC, and 7.2\% on PR-AUC.},

Whereas early research in emotion regulation predominantly employed static, self-report measurement, the past decade has seen a shift in focus toward understanding the dynamic nature of regulation processes. This is reflected in recent refinements in the definition of emotion regulation that emphasize the importance of the ability to flexibly adapt regulation efforts across contexts. The latest proliferation of digital technologies employed in mental health research offers the opportunity to capture the state- and context-sensitive nature of emotion regulation. In this conceptual review, we examine the use of digital technologies (ecological momentary assessment; wearable and smartphone technology, physical activity, acoustic data, visual data, and geo-location; smart-home technology; virtual reality; social media) in the assessment of emotion regulation and describe their application to interventions. We also discuss challenges and ethical considerations and outline areas for future research.},

Creating novel, unobtrusive measures of resilience would provide an accessible approach to evaluate symptom susceptibility without the perceived stigma of formal mental health assessments. In this work, we created a system to find indicators of resilience using passive wearable sensors and smartphone-delivered ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This system identified indicators of resilience during a medical internship, the high stress first-year of a residency program. We then created density estimation approaches to predict these indicators before mental health changes occurred, and validated whether the predicted indicators were also associated with resilience. Our system identified resilience indicators associated with physical activity (step count), sleeping behavior, reduced heart rate, increased mood, and reduced mood variability. Density estimation models were able to replicate a subset of the associations between sleeping behavior, heart rate, and resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first methodology to identify and predict indicators of resilience using passive sensing and EMA. Researchers studying resident mental health can apply this approach to design resilience-building interventions and prevent mental health symptom development.

	abstract = {Objective: The present study explored pathways from the personality traits of neuroticism and conscientiousness through health-related behaviors to diurnal patterns of the stress hormone cortisol using data from a large national study. Method: Using prospective data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS II) study and the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE II, a MIDUS substudy), hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) and Monte Carlo estimation for multilevel model mediation were used to test direct and indirect effects (via general activity level, moderate and vigorous physical activity, lifetime history of regular smoking, and alcohol consumption) of neuroticism and conscientiousness on cortisol at wakeup, diurnal cortisol slope, and cortisol awakening response (N ϭ 960). Results: Initial HLM models showed greater levels of conscientiousness were associated with steeper (i.e., healthier) diurnal cortisol slope. Consistent with a hypothesized indirect biobehavioral pathway, when controlling for demographic factors, cortisol-related medications, daily stressors, and positive affect, HLM models showed the relationship between conscientiousness and diurnal cortisol slope was mediated by general activity levels. Lifetime history of smoking was associated with flatter diurnal cortisol slope, but did not mediate the effect of conscientiousness on diurnal cortisol slope. No effects were found for neuroticism. Conclusions: The results support a psychophysiological model of resilience— one that provides a more complete rendering of the health-protective mechanisms of conscientiousness via hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis functioning. Specifically, the mediated pathway suggests greater engagement in the activities of day-to-day life are an instrumental means by which conscientious individuals experience healthier patterns of stress hormone secretion.},

Typically, features of emotion regulation are assessed with selfreport questionnaires. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an objective measure proposed as an index of emotional regulation capacity. A limited number of studies have shown that self-reported difﬁculties in emotion regulation are associated with HRV. However, results from prior studies are inconclusive, and an ecological validation of the association has not yet been tested. Therefore, further exploration of the relation between self-report questionnaires and psychophysiological measures of emotional regulation is needed. The present study investigated the contribution of self-reported emotion regulation difﬁculties on HRV in a student sample. We expected higher scores on emotion regulation difﬁculties to be associated with lower vagus-mediated HRV (vmHRV). Sixty-three participants ﬁlled out the Difﬁculties in Emotion Regulation Scale and their resting HRV was assessed. In addition, a subsample of participants provided ambulatory 24-h HRV data, in order to ecologically validate the resting data. Correlation analyses indicated that self-reported difﬁculties in emotion regulation was negatively associated with vmHRV in both resting HRV and 24-h HRV. Speciﬁcally, when exploring the contribution of the different facets of emotion dysregulation, the inability to accept negative emotions showed the strongest association with HRV.

Labeled data in human activity recognition is scarce and hard to come by, as sensor data collection is expensive, and the annotation is time-consuming and error-prone. To address this problem, we introduce IMUTube, an automated processing pipeline that integrates existing computer vision and signal processing techniques to convert videos of human activity into virtual streams of IMU data. These virtual IMU streams represent accelerometry at a wide variety of locations on the human body. We show how the virtually-generated IMU data improves the performance of a variety of models on known HAR datasets. Our initial results are very promising, but the greater promise of this work lies in a collective approach by the computer vision, signal processing, and activity recognition communities to extend this work in ways that we outline. This should lead to on-body, sensor-based HAR becoming yet another success story in large-dataset breakthroughs in recognition.

	abstract = {Recently, IMUTube introduced a paradigm change for bootstrapping human activity recognition (HAR) systems for wearables. The key idea is to utilize videos of activities to support training activity recognizers based on inertial measurement units (IMUs). This system retrieves video from public repositories and subsequently generates virtual IMU data from this. The ultimate vision for such a system is to make large amounts of weakly labeled videos accessible for model training in HAR and, as such, to overcome one of the most pressing issues in the field: the lack of significant amounts of labeled sample data. In this paper we present the first in-detail exploration of IMUTube in a realistic assessment scenario: the analysis of free-weight gym exercises. We make significant progress towards a flexible, fully-functional IMUTube system by extending it such that it can handle a range of artifacts that are common in unrestricted online videos, including various forms of video noise, non-human poses, body part occlusions, and extreme camera and human motion. By overcoming these real-world challenges, we are able to generate high-quality virtual IMU data, which allows us to employ IMUTube for practical analysis tasks. We show that HAR systems trained by incorporating virtual sensor data generated by IMUTube significantly outperform baseline models trained only with real IMU data. In doing so we demonstrate the practical utility of IMUTube and the progress made towards the final vision of the new bootstrapping paradigm.

Recently, learned representations have been used successfully, offering promising alternatives to manually engineered features. Our work focuses on effective use of small amounts of labeled data and the opportunistic exploitation of unlabeled data that are straightforward to collect in mobile and ubiquitous computing scenarios. We hypothesize and demonstrate that explicitly considering the temporality of sensor data at representation level plays an important role for effective HAR in challenging scenarios. We introduce the Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) framework to human activity recognition, which captures the temporal structure of sensor data streams. Through a range of experimental evaluations on real-life recognition tasks, we demonstrate its effectiveness for improved HAR. CPC-based pre-training is self-supervised, and the resulting learned representations can be integrated into standard activity chains. It leads to significantly improved recognition performance when only small amounts of labeled training data are available, thereby demonstrating the practical value of our approach. Through a series of experiments, we also develop guidelines to help practitioners adapt and modify the framework towards other mobile and ubiquitous computing scenarios.},

Information exposure in a public health crisis can impact people’s attitudes towards and responses to the crisis and risks, and ultimately the trajectory of a pandemic. As such, there is a need for work that documents, organizes, and investigates what COVID-19 visualizations have been presented to the public. We address this gap through an analysis of 668 COVID-19 visualizations. We present our fndings through a conceptual framework derived from our analysis, that examines who, (uses) what data, (to communicate) what messages, in what form, under what circumstances in the context of COVID-19 crisis visualizations. We provide a set of factors to be considered within each component of the framework. We conclude with directions for future crisis visualization research.},

	abstract = {The current norm for measuring blood pressure (BP) at home is using an automated BP cuff based on oscillometry. Despite providing a viable and familiar method of tracking BP at home, oscillometric devices can be both cumbersome and inaccurate with the inconvenience of the hardware typically limiting measurements to once or twice per day. To address these limitations, a wrist-watch BP monitor was developed to measure BP through a simple maneuver: holding the watch against the sternum to detect micro-vibrations of the chest wall associated with the heartbeat. As a pulse wave propagates from the heart to the wrist, an accelerometer and optical sensor on the watch measure the travel time -- pulse transit time (PTT) -- to estimate BP. In this paper, we conducted a study to test the accuracy and repeatability of our device. After calibration, the diastolic pressure estimations reached a root-mean-square error of 2.9 mmHg. The watch-based system significantly outperformed (p{\textless}0.05) conventional pulse arrival time (PAT) based wearable blood pressure estimations -- the most commonly used method for wearable BP sensing in the existing literature and commercial devices. Our device can be a convenient means for wearable BP monitoring outside of clinical settings in both health-conscious and hypertensive populations.},

	abstract = {With the widespread proliferation of (miniaturized) sensing facilities and the massive growth and popularity of the field of machine learning (ML) research, new frontiers in automated sensor data analysis have been explored that lead to paradigm shifts in many application domains. In fact, many practitioners now employ and rely more and more on ML methods as integral part of their sensor data analysis workflows—thereby not necessarily being ML experts or having an interest in becoming one. The availability of toolkits that can readily be used by practitioners has led to immense popularity and widespread adoption and, in essence, pragmatic use of ML methods. ML having become mainstream helps pushing the core agenda of practitioners, yet it comes with the danger of misusing methods and as such running the risk of leading to misguiding if not flawed results.
            Based on years of observations in the ubiquitous and interactive computing domain that extensively relies on sensors and automated sensor data analysis, and on having taught and worked with numerous students in the field, in this article I advocate a considerate use of ML methods by practitioners, i.e., non-ML experts, and elaborate on pitfalls of an overly pragmatic use of ML techniques. The article not only identifies and illustrates the most common issues, it also offers ways and practical guidelines to avoid these, which shall help practitioners to benefit from employing ML in their core research domains and applications.},

But these tend to represent the psychological facet of mental states, which might not align with the physiological facet of that state. Our paper demonstrates that when what people “feel” difers from what people “say they feel”, we witness a semantic gap that limits predictions. We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (ofine sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psychosocial signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.},

There is a need to create accessible and computable digital mental health datasets to advance inclusive and transparently validated research for creating robust real-world digital biomarkers of mental health. Here we share and describe one of the largest and most diverse real-world behavior datasets from over two thousand individuals across the US. The data were generated as part of the two NIMH-funded randomized clinical trials conducted to assess the effectiveness of delivering mental health care continuously remotely. The longitudinal dataset consists of self-assessment of mood, depression, anxiety, and passively gathered phone-based behavioral data streams in real-world settings.

            Given the limitations of traditional approaches, wearable artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the technologies that have been exploited to detect or predict depression. The current review aimed at examining the performance of wearable AI in detecting and predicting depression. The search sources in this systematic review were 8 electronic databases. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two reviewers independently. The extracted results were synthesized narratively and statistically. Of the 1314 citations retrieved from the databases, 54 studies were included in this review. The pooled mean of the highest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.89, 0.87, 0.93, and 4.55, respectively. The pooled mean of lowest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and RMSE was 0.70, 0.61, 0.73, and 3.76, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that there is a statistically significant difference in the highest accuracy, lowest accuracy, highest sensitivity, highest specificity, and lowest specificity between algorithms, and there is a statistically significant difference in the lowest sensitivity and lowest specificity between wearable devices. Wearable AI is a promising tool for depression detection and prediction although it is in its infancy and not ready for use in clinical practice. Until further research improve its performance, wearable AI should be used in conjunction with other methods for diagnosing and predicting depression. Further studies are needed to examine the performance of wearable AI based on a combination of wearable device data and neuroimaging data and to distinguish patients with depression from those with other diseases.},

	abstract = {Early detection of suicidal ideation in depressed individuals can allow for adequate medical attention and support, which in many cases is life-saving. Recent NLP research focuses on classifying, from a given piece of text, if an individual is suicidal or clinically healthy. However, there have been no major attempts to differentiate between depression and suicidal ideation, which is an important clinical challenge. Due to the scarce availability of EHR data, suicide notes, or other similar verified sources, web query data has emerged as a promising alternative. Online sources, such as Reddit, allow for anonymity that prompts honest disclosure of symptoms, making it a plausible source even in a clinical setting. However, these online datasets also result in lower performance, which can be attributed to the inherent noise in web-scraped labels, which necessitates a noise-removal process. Thus, we propose SDCNL, a suicide versus depression classification method through a deep learning approach. We utilize online content from Reddit to train our algorithm, and to verify and correct noisy labels, we propose a novel unsupervised label correction method which, unlike previous work, does not require prior noise distribution information. Our extensive experimentation with multiple deep word embedding models and classifiers display the strong performance of the method in anew, challenging classification application. We make our code and dataset available at https://github.com/ayaanzhaque/SDCNL},

	abstract = {Major depression constitutes a serious challenge in personal and public health. Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.},

Building on findings about health information seeking and sharing practices in online forums, and social media like Twitter, we address three research challenges. First, we present a characterization of self-disclosure in mental illness communities on reddit. We observe individuals discussing a variety of concerns ranging from the daily grind to specific queries about diagnosis and treatment. Second, we build a statistical model to examine the factors that drive social support on mental health reddit communities. We also develop language models to characterize mental health social support, which are observed to bear emotional, informational, instrumental, and prescriptive information. Finally, we study disinhibition in the light of the dissociative anonymity that reddit’s throwaway accounts provide. Apart from promoting open conversations, such anonymity surprisingly is found to gather feedback that is more involving and emotionally engaging. Our findings reveal, for the first time, the kind of unique information needs that a social media like reddit might be fulfilling when it comes to a stigmatic illness. They also expand our understanding of the role of the social web in behavioral therapy.},

We apply the recently introduced Ailment Topic Aspect Model to over one and a half million health related tweets and discover mentions of over a dozen ailments, including allergies, obesity and insomnia. We introduce extensions to incorporate prior knowledge into this model and apply it to several tasks: tracking illnesses over times (syndromic surveillance), measuring behavioral risk factors, localizing illnesses by geographic region, and analyzing symptoms and medication usage. We show quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output. Our results suggest that Twitter has broad applicability for public health research.},

We present a case involving a suicide note on Facebook and discuss potential consequences of this phenomenon based on literature found searching PubMed and Google.
There are numerous reports of suicide notes on Facebook in the popular press, but none in the professional literature. Online social network users attempted to prevent planned suicides in several reported cases. To date there is no documented evidence of a copycat suicide, directly emulating a suicide announced on Facebook.
Suicide notes on online social networks may allow for suicide prevention via the immediate intervention of other network users. But it is not yet clear to what extent suicide notes on online social networks actually induce copycat suicides. These effects deserve future evaluation and research.},

	abstract = {Background: Online communities provide support for individuals looking for help with suicidal ideation and crisis. As community data are increasingly used to devise machine learning models to infer who might be at risk, there have been limited efforts to identify both risk and protective factors in web-based posts. These annotations can enrich and augment computational assessment approaches to identify appropriate intervention points, which are useful to public health professionals and suicide prevention researchers.
Objective: This qualitative study aims to develop a valid and reliable annotation scheme for evaluating risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation in posts in suicide crisis forums.
Methods: We designed a valid, reliable, and clinically grounded process for identifying risk and protective markers in social media data. This scheme draws on prior work on construct validity and the social sciences of measurement. We then applied the scheme to annotate 200 posts from r/SuicideWatch—a Reddit community focused on suicide crisis.
Results: We documented our results on producing an annotation scheme that is consistent with leading public health information coding schemes for suicide and advances attention to protective factors. Our study showed high internal validity, and we have presented results that indicate that our approach is consistent with findings from prior work.
Conclusions: Our work formalizes a framework that incorporates construct validity into the development of annotation schemes for suicide risk on social media. This study furthers the understanding of risk and protective factors expressed in social media data. This may help public health programming to prevent suicide and computational social science research and investigations that rely on the quality of labels for downstream machine learning tasks.},

For every death by suicide, an estimated 138 people’s lives are meaningfully affected, and almost any other statistic around suicide deaths is equally alarming. The pervasiveness of social media—and the near-ubiquity of mobile devices used to access social media networks—offers new types of data for understanding the behavior of those who (attempt to) take their own lives and suggests new possibilities for preventive intervention. We demonstrate the feasibility of using social media data to detect those at risk for suicide. Specifically, we use natural language processing and machine learning (specifically deep learning) techniques to detect quantifiable signals around suicide attempts, and describe designs for an automated system for estimating suicide risk, usable by those without specialized mental health training (eg, a primary care doctor). We also discuss the ethical use of such technology and examine privacy implications. Currently, this technology is only used for intervention for individuals who have “opted in” for the analysis and intervention, but the technology enables scalable screening for suicide risk, potentially identifying many people who are at risk preventively and prior to any engagement with a health care system. This raises a significant cultural question about the trade-off between privacy and prevention—we have potentially life-saving technology that is currently reaching only a fraction of the possible people at risk because of respect for their privacy. Is the current trade-off between privacy and prevention the right one?},

            Social media is now being used to model mental well-being, and for understanding health outcomes. Computer scientists are now using quantitative techniques to predict the presence of specific mental disorders and symptomatology, such as depression, suicidality, and anxiety. This research promises great benefits to monitoring efforts, diagnostics, and intervention design for these mental health statuses. Yet, there is no standardized process for evaluating the validity of this research and the methods adopted in the design of these studies. We conduct a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art in predicting mental health status using social media data, focusing on characteristics of the study design, methods, and research design. We find 75 studies in this area published between 2013 and 2018. Our results outline the methods of data annotation for mental health status, data collection and quality management, pre-processing and feature selection, and model selection and verification. Despite growing interest in this field, we identify concerning trends around construct validity, and a lack of reflection in the methods used to operationalize and identify mental health status. We provide some recommendations to address these challenges, including a list of proposed reporting standards for publications and collaboration opportunities in this interdisciplinary space.},

	abstract = {Halbert L. Dunn’s concept of wellness is a multidimensional aspect encompassing social and mental well-being. Neglecting these dimensions over time can have a negative impact on an individual’s mental health. The manual efforts employed in in-person therapy sessions reveal that underlying factors of mental disturbance if triggered, may lead to severe mental health disorders. In our research, we introduce a fine-grained task focused on identifying indicators of wellness dimensions and mark their presence in self-narrated human-writings on Reddit social media platform. Our work serves as a valuable ground work for the early detection of chronic mental disturbances. We present the MULTIWD dataset, a curated collection comprising 3281 instances, as a specifically designed and annotated dataset that facilitates the identification of multiple wellness dimensions in Reddit posts. In our study, we utilize existing classifiers to solve this multi-label classification task and introduce them as baselines. We highlight practical implications and our findings indicate the potential for further enhancements to develop more comprehensive and contextually-aware AI models in this domain.},

Early detection of mental disorders and suicidal ideation from social content provides a potential way for effective social intervention. However, classifying suicidal ideation and other mental disorders is challenging as they share similar patterns in language usage and sentimental polarity. This paper enhances text representation with lexiconbased sentiment scores and latent topics and proposes using relation networks to detect suicidal ideation and mental disorders with related risk indicators. The relation module is further equipped with the attention mechanism to prioritize more critical relational features. Through experiments on three real-world datasets, our model outperforms most of its counterparts.},

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of social media data bring to fore the importance of real-time responsible AI models for mental health analysis. Aiming to classify the research directions for social computing and tracking advances in the development of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models, we propose a comprehensive survey on quantifying mental health on social media. We compose a taxonomy for mental healthcare and highlight recent attempts in examining social well-being with personal writings on social media. We define all the possible research directions for mental healthcare and investigate a thread of handling online social media data for stress, depression and suicide detection for this work. The key features of this manuscript are (i) feature extraction and classification, (ii) recent advancements in AI models, (iii) publicly available dataset, (iv) new frontiers and future research directions. We compile this information to introduce young research and academic practitioners with the field of computational intelligence for mental health analysis on social media. In this manuscript, we carry out a quantitative synthesis and a qualitative review with the corpus of over 92 potential research articles. In this context, we release the collection of existing work on suicide detection in an easily accessible and updatable repository:https://github.com/drmuskangarg/mentalhealthcare.},

	abstract = {Depression is a common mental illness that has to be detected and treated at an early stage to avoid serious consequences. There are many methods and modalities for detecting depression that involves physical examination of the individual. However, diagnosing mental health using their social media data is more eﬀective as it avoids such physical examinations. Also, people express their emotions well in social media, it is desirable to diagnose their mental health using social media data. Though there are many existing systems that detects mental illness of a person by analysing their social media data, detecting the level of depression is also important for further treatment. Thus, in this research, we developed a gold standard data set that detects the levels of depression as ‘not depressed’, ‘moderately depressed’ and ‘severely depressed’ from the social media postings. Traditional learning algorithms were employed on this data set and an empirical analysis was presented in this paper. Data augmentation technique was applied to overcome the data imbalance. Among the several variations that are implemented, the model with Word2Vec vectorizer and Random Forest classiﬁer on augmented data outperforms the other variations with a score of 0.877 for both accuracy and F1 measure.},

To achieve our goal, we trained a user-level classifier that can detect at-risk users that achieves a reasonable precision and recall. We also trained a tweet-level classifier that predicts if a tweet indicates depression. This task was much more difficult due to the imbalanced data. In the dataset that we labeled, we came across 5\% depression tweets and 95\% non-depression tweets. To handle this class imbalance, we used undersampling methods. The resulting classifier had high recall, but low precision. Therefore, we only use this classifier to compute the estimated percentage of depressed tweets and to add this value as a feature for the user-level classifier.},
