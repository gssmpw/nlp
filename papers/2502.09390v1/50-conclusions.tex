\section{Conclusions and Summary}
\label{sec:conclusions-summary}

This study introduced a multi-question chain-of-thought prompt strategy that significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large language models. By generating and answering a series of sub-questions before addressing the primary query, our method improves response accuracy over traditional baselines and established techniques such as canonical chain-of-thought and RaR \cite{dengRephraseRespondLet2024}. Experiments with Llama 3 models and GPT-4o on several Q\&A datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness.

These results show how carefully designed prompts can improve multi-step reasoning in large language models. They also point to the value of exploring adaptive prompt techniques across different NLP tasks. As these models evolve, multi-question prompting may further sharpen automated reasoning and foster more dependable AI interactions.
