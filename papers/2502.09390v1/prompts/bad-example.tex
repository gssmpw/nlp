Correct answer is \textbf{March and April}, which is found in the reasoning chain, probably due to this fact appearing in the relevant external context provided to the model (not shown here). The final model's answer is wrong, necessitating the need to correctly extract answers for better analysis and research.}

      Question: In what month is the annual documentary film festival, that is presented by the fortnightly published British journal of literary essays, held? \\
      \midrule
      The annual documentary film festival, presented by the fortnightly published British journal, is the Open City Documentary Festival. \\
      \\
      Let's break down the context: \\
      \\
      The journal is described as a fortnightly published British journal of literary essays. \\
      The London Review of Books is mentioned as a publication associated with the London International Documentary Festival, but it is a monthly publication, not fortnightly. \\
      The Open City Documentary Festival is not mentioned in the context as being associated with a specific journal, but it is a  documentary film festival that takes place in London. \\
      However, the Open City Documentary Festival is not the only festival that matches the description. The London Review of Bookseller is a monthly publication, but the journal described in the question is fortnightly. The London Review of Books is not the journal described in the question. \\
      The Open City Documentary Festival is not the only festival that matches the description, but it is the only festival that is associated with a journal that is published twice a year, which could be interpreted as fortnightly. \\
      However, the London Independent Film Festival is not the correct answer because it is held in April, and the journal is not mentioned in the context. \\
      The London International Documentary Festival is held in \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{March and April}}, but the journal is not mentioned in the context. \\
      The Open City Documentary Festival is the only festival that matches the description of being associated with a journal that is published twice a year, which could be interpreted as fortnightly. \\
      \\
      Answer: \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Open City}}. \\
