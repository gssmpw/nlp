  \caption{Synthetic data generation and verification using OpenAI Deep Research in a loop. We go beyond problem-solving by generating new problems and solving them by answers and  proofs, and verifying that the answers and proofs are correct and complete. OpenAI Deep Research has internet access, including access to existing IMO solutions, and therefore it is not used to solve these problems or synthesize data used for solving these problems. However, we can use Deep Research to generate new problems. In addition to previous IMO problems, these generated problems will serve as part of our training data toward the 2025 IMO.}
