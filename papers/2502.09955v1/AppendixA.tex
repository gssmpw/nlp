\section{Overview}
\label{appendix:A}

\subsection*{IMO}

Appendix \ref{appendix:B} lists 2024 IMO, USAMO, and 2023 IMO Shortlist problems, their answers, and ground truth solutions \cite{imo2024problems_and_solutions}\cite{usamo2024problems_and_solutions}\cite{imo2023_shortlist_problems_and_solutions}. Appendicies \ref{appendix:C}, \ref{appendix:D} and \ref{appendix:E} present our ablation results for the answers of 2024 IMO, USAMO and 2023 IMO Shorlist problems using different models and a dozen approaches. Appendix \ref{appendix:F} describes the combinatorics problems encoding to state and action spaces, and rewards, and Appendix \ref{appendix:G} shows the visual game representation of the problems. Appendix \ref{appendix:H} provides the generated code of the corresponding games along with images and descriptions. Appendix \ref{appendix:I} shows the agent architecture to prove the combinatorics problems. Appendix \ref{appendix:J} shows autoformalized Lean Theorems of each combinatorics problem, followed by a natural languge proof in Appendix \ref{appendix:K}. In appendix \ref{appendix:L}, we present limitations to solving combinatorics problems. Appendix \ref{appendix:M} lists prompts and meta-prompts, and Appendix \ref{appendix:N} lists the data used for in-context learning in encoding problems and decoding solutions. Appendix \ref{appendix:Y} describes our approach for generating new IMO problems and solutions.

\subsection*{ARC}
Appendix \ref{appendix:O} shows the agent architecture. Appendices \ref{appendix:P} and \ref{appendix:Q} show tasks where diverse models and methods succeed however o3 and humans fail, respectively. Appendix \ref{appendix:R} shows diverse models and methods performance for 400 ARC puzzles, including model knowledge cutoff dates. Appendix \ref{appendix:X} plots a diversity performance curve, showing the relationship between adding models and methods and solving ARC tasks.

\subsection*{HLE}
Appendix \ref{appendix:S} shows a sample of HLE questions and answer and the performance of best-of-N sampling as N increases. Appendix \ref{appendix:T} shows an extensive evaluation for 100 randomly sampled questions across eight different methods. Appendix \ref{appendix:U} shows the ablation results of diverse methods by question category and type. Appendix \ref{appendix:V} lists hard math problems from the HLE.
