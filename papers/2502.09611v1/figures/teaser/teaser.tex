\caption{\textbf{An illustration of our approach.} The LHS illustrates the standard flow matching paradigm, where every sample in the source Gaussian distribution (shown as a circular point) can be mapped to every sample in the conditional target mode (shown as a cross point), where each class samples are shown in a different color. In contrast, our method, shown on the RHS, constructs a class-specific conditional distribution as a source prior distribution. Each sample in the source distribution is, on average, closer to its corresponding sample in the target mode.
