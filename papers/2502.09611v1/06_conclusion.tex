\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we introduce a novel initialization for flow-based generative models using condition-specific priors, improving both training time and inference efficiency. 
Our method allows for significantly shorter probability paths, reducing the global truncation error.  
Our approach achieves improved performance on MS-COCO and ImageNet-64, surpassing baselines in FID, KID, and CLIP scores, particularly at lower NFEs.
The flexibility of our method opens avenues for further exploration of other conditional initialization. While this work we assumed a GMM structure of the prior distribution, different structures can be explored. Furthermore, one could incorporate additional conditions such as segmentation maps or depth maps.
