\begin{abstract}
%Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have been widely used to represent 3D scenes due to their continuous function properties. However, one of the major drawbacks is that a separate neural network must be trained from scratch for each signal. 
This paper addresses the challenge of Neural Field (NeF) generalization, where models must efficiently adapt to new signals given only a few observations. To tackle this, we propose Geometric Neural Process Fields (\name{}), a probabilistic framework for neural radiance fields that explicitly captures uncertainty. We formulate NeF generalization as a probabilistic problem, enabling direct inference of NeF function distributions from limited context observations.
To incorporate structural inductive biases, we introduce a set of geometric bases that encode spatial structure and facilitate the inference of NeF function distributions. Building on these bases, we design a hierarchical latent variable model, allowing \name{} to integrate structural information across multiple spatial levels and effectively parameterize INR functions. This hierarchical approach improves generalization to novel scenes and unseen signals.
Experiments on novel-view synthesis for 3D scenes, as well as 2D image and 1D signal regression, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing uncertainty and leveraging structural information for improved generalization.

% Specifically, in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) generalization, there exists an information gap between the context set (continuous 2D RGB and rays) and the target set (3D discrete points), which is commonly ignored by the previous NeRF generalization methods. 
% To this end, we introduce a set of posterior Gaussian bases based on the context set to provide the structure geometry information of the scene for each spatial location. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical neural process modeling to modulate the INR function globally and locally. The experimental results on both the ShapNet novel views synthesis task and the 2D image regression task show state-of-the-art performance.
