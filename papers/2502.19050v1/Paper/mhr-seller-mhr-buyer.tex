In this section, we consider the bilateral trade instances where both traders' valuation distributions are MHR. As the main result of this setting, we obtain an improved GFT approximation as follows.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:improved GFT:mhr traders}
For every bilateral trade instance $\btinstance$ where both traders have MHR valuation distributions, there exists probability $\mixprob\in[0, 1]$ such that the {\BiasedRandomOffer} is {\ksfair} and its GFT is at least at least $\frac{1}{e-1}$ fraction of the second best GFT benchmark $\OPTSB$.\footnote{The $\frac{1}{e - 1}$ approximation in this theorem also holds for the first best GFT benchmark $\OPTFB$, i.e., $\GFT{\mech} \geq \frac{1}{e - 1}\cdot \OPTFB$.}
\end{theorem}
\mbc{this looks unrelated ($\fixedPriceGFTPercentageUBMHR$ is for 0 value seller):} We complement this positive result with a negative result (\Cref{thm:improved GFT:mhr buyer} in \Cref{sec:improved GFT}) showing that the GFT approximation is at most $\fixedPriceGFTPercentageUBMHR$ for \emph{all} BIC, IIR, ex ante WBB mechanisms that are {\ksfair}, when both traders' distributions are MHR.
\Cref{thm:improved GFT:mhr traders} follows straightforwardly from the GFT approximation shown by \citet{Fei-22}.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem~3.1 in \citealp{Fei-22}]
\label{thm:BO SO GFT:mhr traders}
    For every bilateral trade instance, if the buyer (resp.\ seller) has MHR valuation distribution, then the {\SellerOffer} (resp.\ {\BuyerOffer}) obtains at least $\frac{1}{e - 1}$ fraction of the first best GFT benchmark $\OPTFB$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{thm:improved GFT:mhr traders}]
    Applying \Cref{thm:blackbox reduction} with the (unbiased) {\RandomOffer}, there exists $\mixprob\in[0, 1]$ such that the {\BiasedRandomOffer} is {\ksfair}. Since in the {\BiasedRandomOffer}, either {\BuyerOffer} or {\SellerOffer} are implemented in every realized execution, invoking \Cref{thm:BO SO GFT:mhr traders} finishes the proof.

% We highlight some interesting open questions for this setting. First, can we obtain a further improved GFT approximation that beats $\frac{1}{e - 1}$ when both traders have MHR distributions? Note this cannot be achieved by a direct generalization of \Cref{thm:improved GFT:mhr buyer} which analyzes the {\ksfair} {\FixPrice} (that is DSIC). As shown in \citet{BD-21} (Proposition B.1), there exists bilateral instances where both traders have MHR distribution, and no DSIC, IIR, ex ante WBB mechanism can achieve $\eps$ fraction of the second best GFT benchmark for every $\eps > 0$. Second, can we obtain a GFT approximation that beats $\frac{1}{2}$ when both traders have regular distributions? As we shown in \Cref{lem:BROM:regular}, this cannot be achieved by using the {\ksfair} {\BiasedRandomOffer}. Hence, new implementations of {\ksfair} mechanisms might be needed.
