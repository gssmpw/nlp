In this work, we study the impact of fairness requirements on the social efficiency of the Bayesian bilateral trade problem. In spirit, the ex-ante determination of a mechanism for bilateral trade can be viewed as a cooperative bargaining problem. Motivated by the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution to the bargaining problem, we introduce the notion of {\ksfairness}. Although the {\SecondBest} cannot be achieved by mechanisms that are both {\ksfair} and truthful (that is, BIC, IIR, and ex ante WBB), approximating it is possible. We characterize the best, or almost the best, fraction of the {\SecondBest} obtainable by any {\ksfair} mechanism in various settings. We first present results for general bilateral trade instances, and then results for zero-value seller instances where the buyer value distribution is either regular or MHR.

There are many interesting directions for future research. First, it would be interesting to understand whether the GFT-optimal {\ksfair} mechanism is indeed the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. One possible approach is to systematically develop a framework that converts any ex ante WBB, {\ksfair} mechanism to an ex ante (or ex post) SBB, {\ksfair} mechanism without negative transfer. \citet{BCW-22} develops a framework to convert ex ante WBB mechanisms to ex post SBB mechanisms with the same allocation, but it does not preserve {\ksfairness}.
Second, for zero-value seller instances, it would also be worthwhile to improve our results by developing a pure analytical analysis (without the final numerical evaluations of the GFT approximation ratios). Third, for general bilateral trade instances, can one obtain a further improved GFT approximation that beats $\frac{1}{e - 1}$ when both traders have MHR distributions? 
Note this cannot be achieved by a direct generalization of \Cref{thm:improved GFT:mhr buyer} (which analyzes a {\ksfair} {\FixPrice}, which is DSIC). As shown in \citet{BD-21} (Proposition B.1), for any $\varepsilon > 0$  there exist bilateral instances where both traders have MHR distributions, for which no DSIC, IIR, ex ante WBB mechanism can achieve $\varepsilon$ fraction of the {\SecondBest}.
More generally, is it possible to obtain a GFT approximation that beats $\frac{1}{2}$ when both traders have regular distributions? As we have shown in \Cref{lem:BROM:regular}, this cannot be achieved using the {\ksfair} {\BiasedRandomOffer}. Hence, new implementations of {\ksfair} mechanisms might be needed. Finally, it would be valuable to extend the definitions and results to multi-buyer settings, and then also to double-auction settings.
