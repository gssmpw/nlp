\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced \ours{}, a novel approach leveraging a video diffusion prior to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. Our proposed SAP and TAP schemes effectively address the challenges of maintaining consistency across spatio-temporal tiles. Furthermore, our DSSAG provides high-frequency detail enhancement without incurring additional computational costs.

\paragraph{Limitations \& Future Work}
Since \ours{} is based on a diffusion model, it may generate false details and face difficulties in achieving real-time VSR. Moreover, \ours{} may struggle to maintain temporal consistency across distant temporal tiles in long video clips, as TAP primarily relies on nearby tiles. Addressing this issue could be a promising future direction.
