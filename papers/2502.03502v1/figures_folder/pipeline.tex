    \caption{Overall pipeline of proposed {\ours}. An encoded low-resolution video latent is concatenated to the current noisy latent $x_t$, and it undergoes alternating denoising processes using both {\ssi} (\ssiabb) and {\tfi} (\tfiabb). At this stage, the noisy latent is split and merged before and after the denoising process, respectively. 
    After each denoising step, {\drg} ({\drgabb}) is applied to enhance the quality of the image further.}
