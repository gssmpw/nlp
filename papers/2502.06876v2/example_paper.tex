\begin{abstract}


Achieving balanced alignment of large language models (LLMs) in terms of Helpfulness, Honesty, and Harmlessness (3H optimization) constitutes a cornerstone of responsible AI, with existing methods like data mixture strategies facing limitations including reliance on expert knowledge and conflicting optimization signals. While model merging offers a promising alternative by integrating specialized models, its potential for 3H optimization remains underexplored.
This paper establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for model merging in 3H-aligned LLMs, systematically evaluating 15 methods (12 training-free merging and 3 data mixture techniques) across 10 datasets associated with 5 annotation dimensions, 2 LLM families, and 2 training paradigms. Our analysis reveals three pivotal insights: (i) previously overlooked collaborative/conflicting relationships among 3H dimensions, (ii) the consistent superiority of model merging over data mixture approaches in balancing alignment trade-offs, and (iii) the critical role of parameter-level conflict resolution through redundant component pruning and outlier mitigation. Building on these findings, we propose R-TSVM, a \textbf{R}eweighting-enhanced \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}ector \textbf{M}erging method that incorporates outlier-aware parameter weighting and sparsity-adaptive rank selection strategies adapted to the heavy-tailed parameter distribution and sparsity for LLMs, further improving LLM alignment across multiple evaluations. Our models will be available at \href{https://huggingface.co/Jinluan}{3H\_Merging}.

% Aligning large language models (LLMs) with Helpfulness, Harmlessness, and Honesty (3H) is critical for responsible AI. While conventional data mixture methodologies are hampered by expertise-intensive manual configuration and computationally prohibitive scaling demands in balancing these objectives, model merging emerges as a performant and resource-efficient alternative. This paper first expands the exploration to a wider array of model merging techniques for 3H Optimization, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study spanning 15 representative methods (12 training-free merging methods and 3 representative data mixture methods), 10 training tasks associated with 5 annotation dimensions of preference datasets, 2 classific families of LLMs, and 2 different training settings. Unlike previous merging works that discuss the merits and mechanism of linear or spherical interpolation with different rewarded policies, this paper unveils previously overlooked conflict issues for 3H optimization, establishing the theoretical and experimental principle and insight for further studies. We subsequently propose a novel \textbf{R}eweighting-based optimization including outlier weighting and sparsity-ware rank selection based on \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}ector \textbf{M}erging method (\textbf{R-TSVM}), further improving LLM alignment across multiple evaluations. Our findings offer a promising direction for LLM alignment, advancing the development of ethically-constrained language models while maintaining computational efficiency.


\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper explores model merging for 3H optimization of large language models (LLMs) during the alignment stage. Its potential impacts are contingent on how these merging methods are utilized. On the positive side, assisted by model merging techniques, achieving a better-aligned model without retraining or adjusting the data mixture ratio many times could lead to significant reductions in energy consumption, contributing to the development of green AI and achieving improved performance in resource-constrained environments. However, there is a potential negative aspect in terms of private protection, as the competitors may steal your model parameters through model merging without prior notice. However, given the technical focus of this work, there are no specific societal consequences directly stemming from it that need to be highlighted here.
