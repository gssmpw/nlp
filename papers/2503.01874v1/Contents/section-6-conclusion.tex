\section{Conclusion}
\label{section-6}

In this work, we revealed two issues in model merging: high parameter overlap and unbalanced weight distribution in task vector sparsification. 
To address these issues, we proposed Conflict-Aware and Balanced Sparsification (CABS). 
CABS effectively reduces overlap and ensures a balanced distribution of retained weights, thus enhancing model merging across various tasks and model sizes. 
Extensive experiments on both small- and large-scale models demonstrated CABS's effectiveness in improving merged models' performance and generalization.
% We also dive into CABS's components and provide insights into its robust handling of sparsification challenges in model merging.
