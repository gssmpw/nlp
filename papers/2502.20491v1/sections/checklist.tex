\section{Paper Checklist}

\begin{enumerate}

\item For most authors...
\begin{enumerate}
\item Would answering this research question advance science without violating social contracts, such as violating privacy norms, perpetuating unfair profiling, exacerbating the socio-economic divide, or implying disrespect to societies or cultures?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics} for discussion on how we handled our data to avoid violating privacy norms.}

\item Do your main claims in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?
\answerYes{Yes, the abstract states that our objectives are to understand the inputs into r/popular on Reddit which is an algorithmically curated trending feed and its potential impacts on user behavior.}

\item Do you clarify how the proposed methodological approach is appropriate for the claims made? 
\answerYes{Yes, before each result section (see Section~\ref{sec:rq1}, Section~\ref{sec:rq2}, and Section~\ref{sec:rq3}), we described the modeling and why the specific model was selected.}

\item Do you clarify what are possible artifacts in the data used, given population-specific distributions?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:limitations}.}

\item Did you describe the limitations of your work?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:limitations}.}

\item Did you discuss any potential negative societal impacts of your work?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics}.}

\item Did you discuss any potential misuse of your work?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics}.}

\item Did you describe steps taken to prevent or mitigate potential negative outcomes of the research, such as data and model documentation, data anonymization, responsible release, access control, and the reproducibility of findings?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics} for discussion on data anonymization, access control, and reproducibility. Regarding responsible release, we chose not to release the dataset, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics} for reasoning.}

\item Have you read the ethics review guidelines and ensured that your paper conforms to them?
\answerYes{Yes, any questions that were not answered in the paper are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:ethics}.}

\end{enumerate}

\item Additionally, if your study involves hypotheses testing...
\begin{enumerate}

\item Did you clearly state the assumptions underlying all theoretical results?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Have you provided justifications for all theoretical results?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you discuss competing hypotheses or theories that might challenge or complement your theoretical results?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Have you considered alternative mechanisms or explanations that might account for the same outcomes observed in your study?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you address potential biases or limitations in your theoretical framework?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Have you related your theoretical results to the existing literature in social science?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you discuss the implications of your theoretical results for policy, practice, or further research in the social science domain?
\answerNA{NA}

\end{enumerate}

\item Additionally, if you are including theoretical proofs...
\begin{enumerate}

\item Did you state the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you include complete proofs of all theoretical results?
\answerNA{NA}

\end{enumerate}

\item Additionally, if you ran machine learning experiments...
\begin{enumerate}
\item Did you include the code, data, and instructions needed to reproduce the main experimental results (either in the supplemental material or as a URL)?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you specify all the training details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen)?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you report error bars (e.g., with respect to the random seed after running experiments multiple times)?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you include the total amount of compute and the type of resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, internal cluster, or cloud provider)?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Do you justify how the proposed evaluation is sufficient and appropriate to the claims made? 
\answerNA{NA}

\item Do you discuss what is ``the cost`` of misclassification and fault (in)tolerance?
\answerNA{NA}

\end{enumerate}

\item Additionally, if you are using existing assets (e.g., code, data, models) or curating/releasing new assets, \textbf{without compromising anonymity}...
\begin{enumerate}

\item If your work uses existing assets, did you cite the creators?
\answerYes{Yes, we used \citet{bert-model}'s BERT model to identify toxic comments and cited them accordingly in the Section~\ref{sec:undesired-definition}.}

\item Did you mention the license of the assets?
\answerNo{No, the citation is provided.}

\item Did you include any new assets in the supplemental material or as a URL?
\answerNo{No, because releasing the data would compromise anonymity.}

\item Did you discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose data you're using/curating?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics}.}

\item Did you discuss whether the data you are using/curating contains personally identifiable information or offensive content?
\answerYes{Yes, see Section~\ref{sec:ethics}.}

\item If you are curating or releasing new datasets, did you discuss how you intend to make your datasets FAIR (see \citet{fair})?
\answerNo{No, because we are not releasing the dataset we used.}

\item If you are curating or releasing new datasets, did you create a Datasheet for the Dataset (see \citet{gebru2021datasheets})? 
\answerNA{NA}

\end{enumerate}

\item Additionally, if you used crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects, \textbf{without compromising anonymity}...
\begin{enumerate}

\item Did you include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you describe any potential participant risks, with mentions of Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you include the estimated hourly wage paid to participants and the total amount spent on participant compensation?
\answerNA{NA}

\item Did you discuss how data is stored, shared, and deidentified?
\answerNA{NA}

\end{enumerate}
