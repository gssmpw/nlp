\section{Ethics Statement} \label{sec:ethics}

We acknowledge that curation algorithms are often kept secret not only to safeguard intellectual property but also to prevent manipulation by users seeking undue attention or prioritization. Although our findings improve our understanding of these systems, we do not believe that they provide actionable strategies for malicious actors to compromise trending feeds, such as r/popular. Instead, by examining these systems, our work promotes transparency by assessing the factors that influence these systems. This analysis is valuable to a variety of stakeholders, as outlined earlier.

Regarding consent, the data used in this study was collected via a publicly accessible API and did not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from our institution(s). To protect user privacy, no identities have been disclosed and we are not releasing the dataset. However, this study is fully replicable by collecting data snapshots using Reddit's API (see Section~\ref{sec:data}). The dataset is securely stored on a firewalled, password-protected server at our institution(s). Additionally, the content of the comments used were not revealed and were only used to label them as undesired or non-undesired using an offline instance of \citet{bert-model}'s BERT model.
