	abstract = {Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate “any resolution” on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio and sub-images are encoded separately as additional features. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model’s reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.},

	abstract = {Effective human-robot collaboration hinges on robust communication channels, with visual signaling playing a pivotal role due to its intuitive appeal. Yet, the creation of visually intuitive cues often demands extensive resources and specialized knowledge. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising avenues for enhancing human-robot interactions and revolutionizing the way we generate context-aware visual cues. To this end, we introduce SiSCo–a novel framework that combines the computational power of LLMs with mixed-reality technologies to streamline the creation of visual cues for human-robot collaboration. Our results show that SiSCo improves the efficiency of communication in human-robot teaming tasks, reducing task completion time by approximately 73\% and increasing task success rates by 18\% compared to baseline natural language signals. Additionally, SiSCo reduces cognitive load for participants by 46\%, as measured by the NASA-TLX subscale, and receives above-average user ratings for on-the-fly signals generated for unseen objects. To encourage further development and broader community engagement, we provide full access to SiSCo’s implementation and related materials on our GitHub repository.1},

We propose a framework that simplifies robot deployment by allowing direct communication using natural language. It uses large language models (LLM) for prompt processing, workspace understanding, and waypoint generation. It also employs Augmented Reality (AR) to provide visual feedback of the planned outcome. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework with a simple pick-and-place task, which we implement on a real robot. Moreover, we present an early concept of expressive robot behavior and skill generation that can be used to communicate with the user and learn new skills (e.g., object grasping)},

However, it encounters challenges such as an expansive user expression space and limited support for debugging and editing, which restrict its application in end-user programming. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers promising avenues for the translation and interpretation between human language instructions and the code executed by robots, but their application in end-user programming systems requires further study. We introduce Cocobo, a natural language programming system with interactive diagrams powered by LLMs. Cocobo employs LLMs to understand users’ authoring intentions, generate and explain robot programs, and facilitate the conversion between executable code and flowchart representations. Our user study shows that Cocobo has a low learning curve, enabling even users with zero coding experience to customize robot programs successfully.},

These tools are expected to empower users in determining system behavior, although very little is understood about how end users perceive, experience, and use these systems. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by investigating end-user experience with on-the-fly robot EUP. We trained 21 end users to use an existing on-the-fly EUP tool, asked them to create robot interactions for four scenarios, and assessed their overall experience. Our findings provide insight into how these systems should be designed to better support end-user experience with on-the-fly EUP, focusing on user interaction with an automatic program synthesizer that resolves imprecise user input, the use of multimodal inputs to express user intent, and the general process of programming a robot.},

	abstract = {Time is a universal psychological dimension, but time perception has often been studied and discussed in relative isolation. Increasingly, researchers are searching for unifying principles and integrated models that link time perception to other domains. In this review, we survey the links between temporal cognition and other psychological processes. Specifically, we describe how subjective duration is affected by nontemporal stimulus properties (perception), the allocation of processing resources (attention), and past experience with the stimulus (memory). We show that many of these connections instantiate a “processing principle,” according to which perceived time is positively related to perceptual vividity and the ease of extracting information from the stimulus. This empirical generalization generates testable predictions and provides a starting-point for integrated theoretical frameworks. By outlining some of the links between temporal cognition and other domains, and by providing a unifying principle for understanding these effects, we hope to encourage time-perception researchers to situate their work within broader theoretical frameworks, and that researchers from other fields will be inspired to apply their insights, techniques, and theorizing to improve our understanding of the representation and judgment of time.},

	abstract = {People employ expressive behaviors to effectively communicate and coordinate their actions with others, such as nodding to acknowledge a person glancing at them or saying "excuse me" to pass people in a busy corridor. We would like robots to also demonstrate expressive behaviors in human-robot interaction. Prior work proposes rule-based methods that struggle to scale to new communication modalities or social situations, while data-driven methods require specialized datasets for each social situation the robot is used in. We propose to leverage the rich social context available from large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate motion based on instructions or user preferences, to generate expressive robot motion that is adaptable and composable, building upon each other. Our approach utilizes few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to translate human language instructions into parametrized control code using the robot's available and learned skills. Through user studies and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces behaviors that users found to be competent and easy to understand.

This paper presents a Natural Programming System (NPS) that is geared to non-expert users. The main goal of such a system is to provide an enjoyable interactive platform for the users to build different programs within their social robot platform. The end-user can build a complex net of actions and conditions (a sequence) in a social robot via mixed-initiative dialogs and multimodal interaction. The system has been implemented and tested in Maggie, a real social robot with multiple skills, conceived as a general HRI researching platform. The robot’s internal features (skills) have been implemented to be verbally accessible to the end-user, who can combine them into others that are more complex following a bottom-up model. The built sequence is internally implemented as a Sequence Function Chart (SFC), which allows parallel execution, modularity and re-use. A multimodal Dialog Manager System (DMS) takes charge of keeping the coherence of the interaction. This work is thought for bringing social robots closer to non-expert users, who can play the game of “teaching how to do things” with the robot.},

	abstract = {Pedagogical agents are typically designed to take on a single role: either as a tutor who guides and instructs the student, or as a tutee that learns from the student to reinforce what he/she knows. While both agent-role paradigms have been shown to promote student learning, we hypothesize that there will be heightened benefit with respect to students’ learning and emotional engagement if the agent engages children in a more peer-like way — adaptively switching between tutor/tutee roles. In this work, we present a novel active role-switching (ARS) policy trained using reinforcement learning, in which the agent is rewarded for adapting its tutor or tutee behavior to the child’s knowledge mastery level. To investigate how the three different child–agent interaction paradigms (tutee, tutor, and peer agents) impact children’s learning and affective engagement, we designed a randomized controlled between-subject experiment. Fifty-nine children aged 5–7 years old from a local public school participated in a collaborative word-learning activity with one of the three agent-role paradigms. Our analysis revealed that children’s vocabulary acquisition benefited from the robot tutor’s instruction and knowledge demonstration, whereas children exhibited slightly greater affect on their faces when the robot behaves as a tutee of the child. This synergistic effect between tutor and tutee roles suggests why our adaptive peer-like agent brought the most benefit to children’s vocabulary learning and affective engagement, as compared to an agent that interacts only as a tutor or tutee for the child. This work sheds light on how fixed role (tutor/tutee) and adaptive role (peer) agents support children’s cognitive and emotional needs as they play and learn. It also contributes to an important new dimension of designing educational agents — actively adapting roles based on the student’s engagement and learning needs.},

Any given conversation of this type may include: (a) the human forming an intent, (b) the human expressing that intent as a command or utterance, (c) the AI performing one or more rounds of inference on that command to resolve ambiguities and/or requesting clarifications from the human, (d) the AI showing the inferred meaning of the command and/or its execution on current and future situations or data, (e) the human hopefully correctly recognizing whether the AI's interpretation actually aligns with their intent. In the process, they may (f) update their model of the AI's capabilities and characteristics, (g) update their model of the situations in which the AI is executing its interpretation of their intent, (h) confirm or refine their intent, and (i) revise their expression of their intent to the AI, where the loop repeats until the human is satisfied. With these critical cognitive and computational steps within this back-and-forth laid out as a framework, it is easier to anticipate where communication can fail, and design algorithms and interfaces that ameliorate those failure points.},

The author helps researchers understand thematic analysis, a process that is a part of many qualitative methods, and provides clear guidelines about learning to develop techniques to apply it to one's own research. The book shows how to sense themes, which is the first step in analyzing information, as well as how to develop codes, through the use of numerous examples from myriad research settings. Research design issues that are essential to rigorous and high-quality use of qualitative information include sampling, scoring and scaling, and reliability. In so doing, this volume confronts the debate between positivist and postmodernist takes on the research act. The author argues for an ecumenical approach to doing research and as such his book will be of interest to researchers across a broad spectrum of disciplines and approaches.

The AUIs are used in state-of-the-art software products, applications for mobile devices, and websites. Moreover, AUI is an emerging research field in a mobile context, as it can enhance usability, performance, and user satisfaction. This study aims to propose a conceptual framework for developing a real-time self-adaptive user interface based on the Android Operating System (OS). Furthermore, the focus is on developing the core algorithms for the modules of the proposed framework. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, three case studies have been designed based on the daily and weekly activities of the user. Moreover, an expert-based validation approach is employed to obtain the expert’s feedback regarding the proposed framework. The result indicates that the proposed framework helps improve user satisfaction and experience by making an intelligent mobile device interface. The results of the framework’s evaluation and validation show the proposed framework’s feasibility and effectiveness. We conclude that the current work is beneficial in filling the identified research gap. Moreover, this research shows the significance of an adaptive interface in an Android OS-based context. In addition, it not only helps in improving the user interest and satisfaction but also enhances the overall performance of the mobile device.},

Despite advances made in the fields of human-robot interaction, information systems, and marketing, there is relatively little known about how to apply a service robot in retailing. In this paper we aim to shed light on this issue by exploring the added value, roles, and prototyping of a service robot in fashion retailing. Using two Dutch fashion stores as real-life settings, we apply different interaction techniques (observation, interview, survey, structured role play, prototyping) to generate first insights and obtain lessons learned. The results of our study suggest that fashion retailers would benefit most from using service robots for communication of promotions and provision of product information. When applying service robots to these use cases, customers seem to prefer briefly and clearly expressed information that is communicated in a style that matches (in) store communications. Still, the lack of personal attention and social support associated with a service robot makes retailers and store personnel rather reluctant to use them for their service excellence-oriented stores.},

By combining Ontology modeling and reasoning with Combinatorial Optimization, the system decides what information to present, when to present it, where to visualize it in the display - and how, taking into consideration contextual factors as well as placement constraints. The main objective of the proposed approach is to optimize the SA associated with the displayed UI at run-time, while avoiding information overload and induced stress. In the context of this work, we have deployed our computational approach to the use case of an Augmented Reality (AR) system for Law Enforcement Agents (LEAs). To explore the benefits and limitations of the developed system, two evaluations have been conducted. The first one was an expert-based evaluation with LEAs and User Experience (UX) experts, assessing the appropriateness of the system’s decisions. The second one was a user-based evaluation involving LEAs from different agencies, estimating the SA, the mental workload and the overall UX associated with the system, through an AR simulation. The results indicate that the system enhances SA, and while not imposing workload, it provides an overall positive UX.},

	abstract = {Service robots are envisioned to undertake a wide range of tasks at the request of users. Semantic parsing is one way to convert natural language commands given to these robots into executable representations. Methods for creating semantic parsers, however, rely either on large amounts of data or on engineered lexical features and parsing rules, which has limited their application in robotics. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that leverages neural semantic parsing methods in combination with contextual word embeddings to enable the training of a semantic parser with little data and without domain specific parser engineering. Key to our approach is the use of an anonymized target representation which is more easily learned by the parser. In most cases, this simplified representation can trivially be transformed into an executable format, and in others the parse can be completed through further interaction with the user. We evaluate this approach in the context of the RoboCup@Home General Purpose Service Robot task, where we have collected a corpus of paraphrased versions of commands from the standardized command generator. Our results show that neural semantic parsers can predict the logical form of unseen commands with 89\% accuracy. We release our data and the details of our models to encourage further development from the RoboCup and service robotics communities.},

	abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied in software engineering to perform tasks such as translating code between programming languages, generating code from natural language, and autocompleting code as it is being written. When used within development tools, these systems typically treat each model invocation independently from all previous invocations, and only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface. This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model’s responses. We developed a prototype system – the Programmer’s Assistant – in order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code, as well as software engineers’ receptiveness to the idea of conversing with, rather than invoking, a code-fluent LLM. Through an evaluation with 42 participants with varied levels of programming experience, we found that our system was capable of conducting extended, multi-turn discussions, and that it enabled additional knowledge and capabilities beyond code generation to emerge from the LLM. Despite skeptical initial expectations for conversational programming assistance, participants were impressed by the breadth of the assistant’s capabilities, the quality of its responses, and its potential for improving their productivity. Our work demonstrates the unique potential of conversational interactions with LLMs for co-creative processes like software development.},

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered remarkable advancements across diverse code-related tasks, known as Code LLMs, particularly in code generation that generates source code with LLM from natural language descriptions. This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development.

	abstract = {This paper designed a voice interactive robot system that can conveniently execute assigned service tasks in real-life scenarios. It is equipped without a microphone where users can control the robot with spoken commands; the voice commands are then recognized by a well-trained deep neural network model of automatic speech recognition (ASR), which enables the robot to execute and complete the command based on the navigation of a real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The voice interaction recognition model is divided into two parts: (1) speaker separation and (2) ASR. The speaker separation is applied by a deep-learning system consisting of eight convolution layers, one LSTM layer, and two fully connected (FC) layers to separate the speaker’s voice. This model recognizes the speaker’s voice as a referrer that separates and holds the required voiceprint and removes noises from other people’s voiceprints. Its automatic speech recognition uses the novel sandwich-type conformer model with a stack of three layers, and combines convolution and self-attention to capture short-term and long-term interactions. Specifically, it contains a multi-head self-attention module to directly convert the voice data into text for command realization. The RGB-D vision-based camera uses a real-time appearance-based mapping algorithm to create the environment map and replace the localization with a visional odometer to allow the robot to navigate itself. Finally, the proposed ASR model was tested to check if the desired results will be obtained. Performance analysis was applied to determine the robot’s environment isolation and voice recognition abilities. The results showed that the practical robot system successfully completed the interactive service tasks in a real environment. This experiment demonstrates the outstanding performance with other ASR methods and voice control mobile robot systems. It also verified that the designed voice interaction recognition system enables the mobile robot to execute tasks in real-time, showing that it is a convenient way to complete the assigned service applications.},

	abstract = {An important issue in medical robotics is communication between physicians and robots. Speech-based communication is of particular advantage in robot-assisted surgery. It frees the surgeon’s hands; hence, he can focus on the principal tasks. Man-machine voice communication is the subject of research in various domains (industry, social robotics), but medical robots are very specific. They must precisely synchronize their activities with operators. Voice commands must be possibly short. They must be executed without significant delays. An important factor is the use of a vision system that provides visual information in direct synchronization with surgeon actions. Its functions could be also controlled using speech. The aim of the research presented in this paper was to develop a method facilitating creation of voice-controlled medical robotic systems, fulfilling the mentioned requirements and taking into account possible scenarios of man-machine collaboration in such systems. A robot skill description (RSD) format was proposed in order to facilitate programming of voice control applications. A sample application was developed, and experiments were conducted in order to draw conclusions regarding the usefulness of speech-based interfaces in medical robotics. The results show that a reasonable selection of system functions controlled by voice may lead to significant improvement of man-machine collaboration.},

These service robots are intended to be operated by nonexpert users, and their service tasks involve direct interaction between these robots and their human users. Thus, human-friendly interactive features are generally preferred for such service robots. Humans prefer to use voice instructions, responses, and suggestions to convey ideas to their peers. However, information conveyed through natural language communication is imprecise because it tends to contain uncertain/qualitative information instead of precise quantitative information. Therefore, the ability to cope with uncertain information in natural language instructions is mandatory for human-friendly service robots. This paper presents a review of service robots and systems that can cope with uncertain information in natural language instructions. The available literature has been investigated and analyzed to identify the limitations of the existing methods and possible improvements. The identified limitations and possible improvements are presented as the outcomes of the review.},

	abstract = {Voice assistants have become hugely popular in the home as domestic and entertainment devices. Recently, there has been a move towards developing them for work settings. For example,
              Alexa for Business
              and
              IBM Watson
              for Business
              were designed to improve productivity, by assisting with various tasks, such as scheduling meetings and taking minutes. However, this kind of assistance is largely limited to planning and managing user's work. How might they be developed to do more by way of empowering people at work? Our research is concerned with achieving this by developing an agent with the role of a facilitator that assists users during an ongoing task. Specifically, we were interested in whether the modality in which the agent interacts with users makes a difference: How does a voice versus screen-based agent interaction affect user behavior? We hypothesized that voice would be more immediate and emotive, resulting in more fluid conversations and interactions. Here, we describe a user study that compared the benefits of using voice versus screen-based interactions when interacting with a system incorporating an agent, involving pairs of participants doing an exploratory data analysis task that required them to make sense of a series of data visualizations. The findings from the study show marked differences between the two conditions, with voice resulting in more turn-taking in discussions, questions asked, more interactions with the system and a tendency towards more immediate, faster-paced discussions following agent prompts. We discuss the possible reasons for why talking and being prompted by a voice assistant may be preferable and more effective at mediating human-human conversations and we translate some of the key insights of this research into design implications.},

            We argue for an interdisciplinary approach that connects existing models and theories in Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) to traditions in communication theory. In this article, we review existing models of interpersonal communication and interaction models that have been applied and developed in the contexts of HRI and social robotics. We argue that often, symmetric models are proposed in which the human and robot agents are depicted as having similar ways of functioning (similar capabilities, components, processes). However, we argue that models of human–robot interaction or communication should be asymmetric instead. We propose an asymmetric interaction model called AMODAL-HRI (an Asymmetric MODel of ALterity in Human–Robot Interaction). This model is based on theory on joint action, common robot architectures and cognitive architectures, and Kincaid’s model of communication. On the basis of this model, we discuss key differences between humans and robots that influence human expectations regarding interacting with robots, and identify design implications.},

We propose a formalism that enables a robot to decide optimally between taking a physical action toward task completion and issuing an utterance to the human teammate. We focus on two types of utterances: verbal commands, where the robot asks the human to take a physical action, and state-conveying actions, where the robot informs the human about its internal state, which captures the information that the robot uses in its decision making. Human subject experiments show that enabling the robot to issue verbal commands is the most effective form of communicating objectives, while retaining user trust in the robot. Communicating information about the robot’s state should be done judiciously, since many participants questioned the truthfulness of the robot statements when the robot did not provide sufficient explanation about its actions.},

	abstract = {We introduce the concept of "empathic grounding" in conversational agents as an extension of Clark's conceptualization of grounding in conversation in which the grounding criterion includes listener empathy for the speaker's affective state. Empathic grounding is generally required whenever the speaker's emotions are foregrounded and can make the grounding process more efficient and reliable by communicating both propositional and affective understanding. Both speaker expressions of affect and listener empathic grounding can be multimodal, including facial expressions and other nonverbal displays. Thus, models of empathic grounding for embodied agents should be multimodal to facilitate natural and efficient communication. We describe a multimodal model that takes as input user speech and facial expression to generate multimodal grounding moves for a listening agent using a large language model. We also describe a testbed to evaluate approaches to empathic grounding, in which a humanoid robot interviews a user about a past episode of pain and then has the user rate their perception of the robot's empathy. We compare our proposed model to one that only generates non-affective grounding cues in a between-subjects experiment. Findings demonstrate that empathic grounding increases user perceptions of empathy, understanding, emotional intelligence, and trust. Our work highlights the role of emotion awareness and multimodality in generating appropriate grounding moves for conversational agents.},

Gist extraction generates keywords and summaries as anchors to support the review and interaction with spoken text. LLM-assisted macro revisions allow users to respeak, split, merge, and transform dictated text without specifying precise editing locations. Together they pave the way for interactive dictation and revision that help close gaps between spontaneously spoken words and well-structured writing. In a comparative study with 12 participants performing verbal composition tasks, Rambler outperformed the baseline of a speech-to-text editor + ChatGPT, as it better facilitates iterative revisions with enhanced user control over the content while supporting surprisingly diverse user strategies.},

	abstract = {Current practice in Human Computer Interaction as encouraged by educational institutes, academic review processes, and institutions with usability groups advocate usability evaluation as a critical part of every design process. This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration.},

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping. A controlled lab study confirmed the usability and effectiveness of VISAR in facilitating the argumentative writing planning process.},

This is made possible through an intelligible interface that communicates relevant information. This intelligibility enhances user comprehension, enabling them to anticipate the robot's actions and respond appropriately. However, because robots can perform a wide variety of actions and communication resources are limited, such as the number of available "pixels", visualizations must be carefully designed. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a visual design framework and design space that can be used to create intelligible visualizations for human-robot interaction. Our framework focuses on three key components: information type, pixel layout, and robot type. We demonstrate how intelligibility can be integrated into interactions through prototype visualizations featuring a one-dimensional pixel layout, laying the groundwork for developing more detailed and understandable visualizations.},

	abstract = {358
            Background: Studies have shown that patients with new cancer diagnoses are overwhelmed due to the large amount of information presented at their initial oncology visit. Inability to meet these high informational demands has been associated with poorer outcomes. Most patient education is done verbally despite data showing that patients only retain 14\% of verbal communication compared to 85\% of information with visual aids. The aim of this study was to determine if implementation of a visual educational tool on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment would improve comprehension in patients with new diagnoses. Methods: We designed an educational tool to visually depict breast cancer subtype, stage, and treatment plan. We recruited English-speaking patients with new diagnoses of breast cancer who were seen for an initial oncology visit at the Mount Sinai Dubin Breast Center. Patients were randomized to receive the visual aid (intervention) or continue with standard-of-care (control). For patients randomized to the intervention arm, the oncologist used the visual aid to provide education on their diagnosis and treatment plan during the visit. All patients completed a survey at their initial visit and approximately 1 month after diagnosis. The survey included demographic information, patient preferences, and assessment of their understanding of diagnosis and treatment. The worksheet and surveys were piloted with 5 patients with breast cancer and modified based on their feedback. A knowledge score was calculated based on their survey responses with scores ranging from 2 (low knowledge) to 6 (all questions answered correctly). We utilized paired t-test to compare the means of knowledge scores at initial visit and 1 month follow up. Results: Twenty female patients were enrolled from 2022-2023 with a median age of 61 years. Ten patients were randomized to the intervention arm and 10 to the control arm. The initial mean knowledge score of the control group was 4.9 and the follow up mean score was 5.6 (P = 0.11). The initial mean score of the intervention group was 5.3 whereas the follow up mean score was 5.6 (P = 0.84). There was no significant difference between the intervention group and the control group (P = 0.944). An increase in overall scores was noted from initial to follow up survey in all groups. There was a complete elimination of all low scores ({\textless} 3) across both groups in the follow up survey. Conclusions: Education at the initial visit improves understanding of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Our study demonstrated a standardized informational tool did not improve understanding when compared to individualized teaching with their oncologist. However, our study was limited to a single breast cancer center with a small sample size and English-speaking patients. Next steps include translation of the educational tool into additional languages, as well as expansion of this study to a larger patient population.},

This chapter discusses different kinds of exhibits that help to clarify a point to the audience, and accompanies an oral presentation. Each of these kinds of exhibits requires its own equipment, whether it is a chalk and a chalkboard, a projector, or a poster board. Flipcharts and posters accommodate small audiences and require well-lighted conditions. Slides require subdued lighting but can serve a rather large audience.

	abstract = {Ensuring accessibility in mobile applications remains a significant challenge, particularly for visually impaired users who rely on screen readers. User interface icons are essential for navigation and interaction and often lack meaningful alt-text, creating barriers to effective use. Traditional deep learning approaches for generating alt-text require extensive datasets and struggle with the diversity and imbalance of icon types. More recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) require complete UI screens, which can be impractical during the iterative phases of app development. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously generate informative alt-text for mobile UI icons with partial UI data. By incorporating icon context, that include class, resource ID, bounds, OCR-detected text, and contextual information from parent and sibling nodes, we fine-tune an off-the-shelf LLM on a small dataset of approximately 1.4k icons, yielding IconDesc. In an empirical evaluation and a user study IconDesc demonstrates significant improvements in generating relevant alt-text. This ability makes IconDesc an invaluable tool for developers, aiding in the rapid iteration and enhancement of UI accessibility.},

The study is based on a computational linguistic analysis conducted on a database of 7,435 scientific publications over the last 2 decades. This comprehensive dataset was extracted from the Scopus database using specific key-words. Our results show how relevant terms of verbal communication evolved, which are the main coherent topics and how they have changed over the years. We highlighted positive and negative trends for the most coherent topics and the distribution over the years for the most significant ones. In particular, verbal communication resulted in being highly relevant for social robotics.

	abstract = {Research in service robotics strives at having a positive impact on people’s quality of life by the introduction of robotic helpers for everyday activities. From this ambition arises the need of enabling natural communication between robots and ordinary people. For this reason, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is an extensively investigated topic, exceeding language-based exchange of information, to include all the relevant facets of communication. Each aspect of communication (e.g. hearing, sight, touch) comes with its own peculiar strengths and limits, thus they are often combined to improve robustness and naturalness. In this contribution, an HRI framework is presented, based on pointing gestures as the preferred interaction strategy. Pointing gestures are selected as they are an innate behavior to direct another attention, and thus could represent a natural way to require a service to a robot. To complement the visual information, the user could be prompted to give voice commands to resolve ambiguities and prevent the execution of unintended actions. The two layers (perceptive and semantic) architecture of the proposed HRI system is described. The perceptive layer is responsible for objects mapping, action detection, and assessment of the indicated direction. Moreover, it has to listen to uses’ voice commands. To avoid privacy issues and not burden the computational resources of the robot, the interaction would be triggered by a wake-word detection system. The semantic layer receives the information processed by the perceptive layer and determines which actions are available for the selected object. The decision is based on object’s characteristics, contextual information and user vocal feedbacks are exploited to resolve ambiguities. A pilot implementation of the semantic layer is detailed, and qualitative results are shown. The preliminary findings on the validity of the proposed system, as well as on the limitations of a purely vision-based approach, are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the evolving field of industrial automation, operator awareness of robot actions and intentions is critical for safety and efficiency, especially when working in close proximity to robots. From the robot-to-human communication angle, a collaborative robot (cobot) is expected to express its internal states and monitor task progress. Various traditional communication modalities (e.g., tower light, external screen, LED ring, and sound) often fall short of conveying nuanced information, while a flexible display curved around the cobot arm using organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology provides a potential advantage. Integrated seamlessly with the robot, this interface enhances interaction by displaying text and video, enriching communication, and positively influencing the human–robot collaboration experience. In this work, we investigate a novel integrated flexible OLED display technology used as a robotic skin-interface to improve robot-to-human communication in a real industrial setting at Volkswagen (VW), following a user-centric Double-Diamond co-design process. We first conducted a co-design workshop with six operator representatives to collect their ideas and expectations on how the robot should communicate with them. The gathered information was used to design an interface for a collaborative human-robot interaction task in motor assembly. The interface was implemented in a workcell and validated qualitatively with a small group of operators (n = 9) and quantitatively with a large group (n = 42). The validation results showed that using flexible OLED technology could improve the operators’ attitude toward the robot, increase their intention to use the robot, enhance perceived enjoyment, social influence, and trust, and reduce their anxiety.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative large language model (LLM)-based robotic system for enhancing multi-modal human-robot interaction (HRI). Traditional HRI systems relied on complex designs for intent estimation, reasoning, and behavior generation, which were resource-intensive. In contrast, our system empowers researchers and practitioners to regulate robot behavior through three key aspects: providing high-level linguistic guidance, creating "atomic actions" and expressions the robot can use, and offering a set of examples. Implemented on a physical robot, it demonstrates proficiency in adapting to multi-modal inputs and determining the appropriate manner of action to assist humans with its arms, following researchers' defined guidelines. Simultaneously, it coordinates the robot's lid, neck, and ear movements with speech output to produce dynamic, multi-modal expressions. This showcases the system's potential to revolutionize HRI by shifting from conventional, manual state-and-flow design methods to an intuitive, guidance-based, and example-driven approach.

	volume = {612},
	abstract = {End-user development (EUD), the practice of users creating, modifying, or extending programs for personal use, is a valuable but often challenging task for nonprogrammers. From the beginning, EUD systems have shown that recommendations can improve the user experience. However, these usability improvements are limited by a reliance on handcrafted rules and heuristics to generate reasonable and useful suggestions. When the number of possible recommendations is large or the available context is too limited for traditional reasoning techniques, recommender technologies present a promising solution. In this paper, we provide an overview of the state of the art in end-user development, focusing on the different kinds of recommendations made to users. We identify four classes of suggestion that could most directly benefit from existing recommendation techniques. Along the way we explore straightforward applications of recommender algorithms as well as a few difficult but high-value recommendation problems in EUD. We discuss the ways that EUD systems have been evaluated in the past and suggest the modifications necessary to evaluate recommenders within the EUD context. We highlight EUD research as one area that can facilitate the transition of recommender system evaluation from algorithmic performance evaluation to a more user-centered approach. We conclude by restating our findings as a new set of research challenges for the recommender systems community.},

	abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered remarkable advancements across diverse code-related tasks, known as Code LLMs, particularly in code generation that generates source code with LLM from natural language descriptions. This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and offer an empirical comparison using the HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development. Furthermore, we have established a dedicated resource GitHub page (https://github.com/juyongjiang/CodeLLMSurvey) to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in the field.},

We compared our three grounding interfaces to an ungrounded control interface in a crowdsourced study (N=80) using a natural language system that generates small programs. We found that the grounding interfaces reduced cognitive load and improved task performance. The structured grounding interface further reduced speaker change costs and improved technology acceptance, without sacrificing the perception of control. We discuss the implications of designing grounded conversational interactions in natural language systems.},

In this paper, we explore the use of automated feedback (compilers and multi-modal models) to guide LLMs to generate high-quality UI code. Our method starts with an existing LLM and iteratively produces improved models by self-generating a large synthetic dataset using an original model, applying automated tools to aggressively filter, score, and de-duplicate the data into a refined higher quality dataset. The original LLM is improved by finetuning on this refined dataset. We applied our approach to several open-source LLMs and compared the resulting performance to baseline models with both automated metrics and human preferences. Our evaluation shows the resulting models outperform all other downloadable baselines and approach the performance of larger proprietary models.},

	abstract = {Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.},

A comparative study (N=40) showed that Stylette lowered the learning curve, helping participants perform styling changes 35\% faster than those using developer tools. By presenting various alternatives for a single goal, the tool helped participants familiarize themselves with CSS through experimentation.

RL-AUIAC is based on three Knowledge Layers (KL)s depending on the kind of adaptation and the resolved problem at each layer. KL uses the Exploration-Exploitation dilemma to respond to the question: what to learn from each planned-adaptation sequences? In fact, Disability Knowledge Layer (DKL)learns UI structure behavior depending on the disability profile. Modality Knowledge Layer(MKL) learns facilities of adaptation on the basis of the couple .

	abstract = {Large-language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in improving human-robot interaction, offering advanced conversational skills and versatility in managing diverse, open-ended user requests in various tasks and domains. Despite the potential to transform human-robot interaction, very little is known about the distinctive design requirements for utilizing LLMs in robots, which may differ from text and voice interaction and vary by task and context. To better understand these requirements, we conducted a user study (n = 32) comparing an LLM-powered social robot against text- and voice-based agents, analyzing task-based requirements in conversational tasks, including choose, generate, execute, and negotiate. Our findings show that LLM-powered robots elevate expectations for sophisticated non-verbal cues and excel in connection-building and deliberation, but fall short in logical communication and may induce anxiety. We provide design implications both for robots integrating LLMs and for fine-tuning LLMs for use with robots.},

We first present a formal definition of ICL and clarify its correlation to related studies. Then, we organize and discuss advanced techniques, including training strategies, demonstration designing strategies, as well as related analysis. Finally, we discuss the challenges of ICL and provide potential directions for further research. We hope that our work can encourage more research on uncovering how ICL works and improving ICL.},

Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models.

	abstract = {Communication is a central component in social human–robot interaction that needs to be planned and designed prior to the actual communicative act. We therefore propose a pragmatic, linear view of communication design for social robots that corresponds to a sender–receiver perspective. Our framework is based on Lasswell’s 5Ws of mass communication: Who, says what, in which channel, to whom, with what effect. We extend and adapt this model to communication in HRI. In addition, we point out that, besides the predefined communicative acts of a robot, other characteristics, such as a robot’s morphology, can also have an impact on humans, since humans tend to assign meaning to every cue in robots’ behavior and appearance. We illustrate the application of the extended framework to three different studies on human–robot communication to demonstrate the incremental value as it supports a systematic evaluation and the identification of similarities, differences, and research gaps. The framework therefore offers the opportunity for meta-analyses of existing research and additionally draws the path for future robust research designs for studying human–robot communication.},

The screen was deployed to compensate for expressive shortcomings of a social robot due to its mechanical limitations of non-movable facial features. The participants played Rock-Paper-Scissors with the robot for which we programmed the right hand to show gestures. Half of the participants received facial expressions via a screen during the game, whereas the other half did not get screen feedback. We annotated the video-recorded interactions and collected questionnaire and interview data to assess the applicability of the screen. With our data we could show noteworthy results: First, the robot which provided facial expressions was rated more intelligent. Second, the participants who had interacted with the robot showing facial expressions, rated the task as more attractive than participants who did not receive facial expressions from the robot. The fact that we could not detect a negative inﬂuence of the screen, underlines the applicability of a screen in an HRI game-playing scenario to display facial expressions and contribute to an enhanced interaction.},

However, researchers sometimes struggle to make sense of nuanced connections between recommended papers and their own research context, as existing systems only present paper titles and abstracts. To help researchers spot these connections, we present PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alerts system that provides contextualized text descriptions of recommended papers based on user-collected papers. PaperWeaver employs a computational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer users' research interests from their collected papers, extract context-specific aspects of papers, and compare recommended and collected papers on these aspects. Our user study (N=15) showed that participants using PaperWeaver were able to better understand the relevance of recommended papers and triage them more confidently when compared to a baseline that presented the related work sections from recommended papers.},

	abstract = {This chapter deals with visual aids used to enhance oral presentations. It is intended to guide planning and presentation of visual aids; actual construction of visual aids is covered in other texts, some of which are recommended at the end of the chapter. What sets off a visual aid from a visual message is how is it applied and used. Visual aids, as they are explained here, are meant to enhance a personal presentation, while a visual message is meant to present a stand-alone message in the absence of a presenter (e.g. a park interpretation sign or an advertisement). The old adage is that a picture is worth a thousand words, but it is important to understand that this valued picture be the right picture, presented well, at the right time, or else it will detract from the presentation rather than support it. Visual aids are important because of differences in the way people perceive messages. Some audience members will react best to verbal information, some to visual, and some to written material. Thus presenting messages in multiple formats broadens the audience impact. People tend to remember more of what they see and hear. So visual aids supporting verbal information act to dramatically increase the impact of a presentation. Furthermore, visual aids increase an audience’s attention span, and can, when used properly, add structure to information to facilitate understanding.},

We introduce EmoWear, a smartwatch voice messaging system enabling users to apply 30 animation teasers on message bubbles to reflect emotions. EmoWear eases senders' choice by prioritizing emotions based on semantic and acoustic processing. EmoWear was evaluated in comparison with a mirroring system using color-coded message bubbles as emotional cues (N=24). Results showed EmoWear significantly enhanced emotional communication experience in both receiving and sending messages. The animated teasers were considered intuitive and valued for diverse expressions. Desirable interaction qualities and practical implications are distilled for future design.

We present Graphologue, an interactive system that converts text-based responses from LLMs into graphical diagrams to facilitate information-seeking and question-answering tasks. Graphologue employs novel prompting strategies and interface designs to extract entities and relationships from LLM responses and constructs node-link diagrams in real-time.

We analyzed recorded videos of their family interactions and conducted pre- and post-deployment interviews. Our findings highlight telepresence robots’ potential as family communication tools, enabling immersive, natural, and dynamic interactions through physical embodiment and autonomy. Particularly, we identified five categories of family interaction mediated by telepresence robots: engaging in multi-party family communication, exploring home, restoring family routines, providing support, and having joint physical activities.

If robots of the future are supposed to engage in social interaction with humans, it is essential that they can generate and understand these behaviors. In this article, I give an overview of several studies that show how humans in interaction with a humanlike robot make use of the same coordination signals typically found in studies on human-human interaction, and that it is possible to automatically detect and combine these cues to facilitate real-time coordination. The studies also show that humans react naturally to such signals when used by a robot, without being given any special instructions. They follow the gaze of the robot to disambiguate referring expressions, they conform when the robot selects the next speaker using gaze, and they respond naturally to subtle cues, such as gaze aversion, breathing, facial gestures, and hesitation sounds.},

	abstract = {In the field of graphic design, automating the integration of design elements into a cohesive multi-layered artwork not only boosts productivity but also paves the way for the democratization of graphic design. One existing practice is Graphic Layout Generation (GLG), which aims to layout sequential design elements. It has been constrained by the necessity for a predefined correct sequence of layers, thus limiting creative potential and increasing user workload. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG) as a more flexible and pragmatic setup, which creates graphic composition from unordered sets of design elements. To tackle the HLG task, we introduce Graphist, the first layout generation model based on large multimodal models. Graphist efficiently reframes the HLG as a sequence generation problem, utilizing RGB-A images as input, outputs a JSON draft protocol, indicating the coordinates, size, and order of each element. We develop new evaluation metrics for HLG. Graphist outperforms prior arts and establishes a strong baseline for this field. Project homepage: https://github.com/graphic-design-ai/graphist},

The framework follows a meta-programming approach by enabling users to program cobots by voice in addition to using a mouse, tablet or keyboard. Upon a voice instruction (such as move, pick, release, etc.), the framework automates the manual tasks required to manipulate the vendor-provided HPI. The main advantages of this approach are simplified, guided programming, which only requires the knowledge of 5–10 voice instructions; increased programming speed by up to 46\% compared to the manual approach; and the possibility of sharing programs as videos.

	abstract = {Introduction  Research into current robot middleware has revealed that most of them are either too complicated or outdated. These facts have motivated the development of a new middleware to meet the requirements of usability by non-experts. The proposed middleware is based on Android and is intended to be placed over existing robot SDKs and middleware. It runs on the android tablet of the Cruzr robot. Various toolings have been developed, such as a web component to control the robot via a webinterface, which facilitates its use.
Methods  The middleware was developed using Android Java and runs on the Cruzr tablet as an app. It features a WebSocket server that interfaces with the robot and allows control via Python or other WebSocket-compatible languages. The speech interface utilizes Google Cloud Voice text-to-speech and speech-to-text services. The interface was implemented in Python, allowing for easy integration with existing robotics development workflows, and a web interface was developed for direct control of the robot via the web.
Results  The new robot middleware was created and deployed on a Cruzr robot, relying on the WebSocket API and featuring a Python implementation. It supports various robot functions, such as text-to-speech, speech-to-text, navigation, displaying content and scanning bar codes. The system’s architecture allows for porting the interface to other robots and platforms, showcasing its adaptability. It has been demonstrated that the middleware can be run on a Pepper robot, although not all functions have been implemented yet. The middleware was utilized to implement healthcare use cases and received good feedback.
Conclusion  Cloud and local speech services were discussed in regard to the middleware’s needs, to run without having to change any code on other robots. An outlook on how the programming interface can further be simplified by using natural text to code generators has been/is given. For other researchers using the aforementioned platforms (Cruzr, Pepper), the new middleware can be utilized for testing human-robot interaction. It can be used in a teaching setting, as well as be adapted to other robots using the same interface and philosophy regarding simple methods.},

Thus, those who design and implement robots will need to understand how different levels of delay in response may affect users’ satisfaction with the conversation, how to balance the trade-off between a robot’s quality of voice and response time, and how to design strategies to mitigate possible negative effects of a long delay. Via an online video-prototype study on a service robot with 94 Chinese participants, we ﬁnd that users could tolerate up to 4s delay but their satisfaction drops at the 8s delay during both information-retrieval conversations and chitchats. We gain an in-depth understanding of users’ preference for the trade-off between the voice quality and the response speed, as well as their opinions on possible robot graphic user interface (GUI) design to alleviate negative user experience with response latency.},

	abstract = {Our experience of Generative AI platforms is through applications such as ChatGPT, a general purpose chatbot that can capably respond to a broad diversity of natural language prompts. Generative AI chatbots are designed to be conversational applications. As such, their ability to keep us engaged depends in part on how suitably personalized their outputs are to both our prompts and our underlying motivations. Correspondingly, reported instances of adverse user experiences with chatbots have involved outputs that are personalized in coercive or disturbing ways. Thus, personalization also brings with it psychological safety risks. Research has long shown that humans are highly susceptible to anthropomorphizing computation systems with conversational capabilities, an important facet of understanding why chatbots can both satisfy and threaten a user’s sense of well-being. Recent studies reveal that Generative AI chatbots can be highly proficient at understanding and appealing to distinct human personality traits. Nonetheless, such chatbots are trained on corpora that include toxic, abusive, and manipulative language – this is the primary source of psychological safety risk for users predisposed to anthropomorphizing conversational computation systems. Given the current AI industry trajectory to deepen user engagement with chatbots, it is important to consider both the promises and perils of personalization. In this regard, I present a categorization of Generative AI chatbots based on the extent to which their design and use is premised on personalized user experiences, with examples of in-market chatbots that fall into each category. I then present a rubric for thinking about the psychological safety risks that may be posed by a Generative AI chatbot, considering the extent to which the chatbot is designed to provide, or its users intend to experience, personalized interactions. I conclude by examining the possibilities for deepening personalization proficiency of chatbots with different types of user data and the issues these raise for further research, legal compliance, industry best practices development, and public policy development.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel dataset, the Multimodal Human-Human-Robot-Interactions (MHHRI) dataset, with the aim of studying personality simultaneously in human-human interactions (HHI) and human-robot interactions (HRI) and its relationship with engagement. Multimodal data was collected during a controlled interaction study where dyadic interactions between two human participants and triadic interactions between two human participants and a robot took place with interactants asking a set of personal questions to each other. Interactions were recorded using two static and two dynamic cameras as well as two biosensors, and meta-data was collected by having participants fill in two types of questionnaires, for assessing their own personality traits and their perceived engagement with their partners (self labels) and for assessing personality traits of the other participants partaking in the study (acquaintance labels). As a proof of concept, we present baseline results for personality and engagement classification. Our results show that (i) trends in personality classification performance remain the same with respect to the self and the acquaintance labels across the HHI and HRI settings; (ii) for extroversion, the acquaintance labels yield better results as compared to the self labels; (iii) in general, multi-modality yields better performance for the classification of personality traits.},

We conducted three workshops (N=28 design students) to evaluate the framework. The participants found ACTIVE4 helpful in guiding them towards a more systematic understanding of the environmental influences and office workers’ personal needs for reducing physical inactivity.

This can have a negative impact on the psychological state of other forum users and moderators, who are tasked to identify and delete such content. We investigate a preventative approach to this problem with the design of EChat, a proof-of-concept augmentation to online forums that helps users attend to their emotional state. The user’s current emotional state is detected using facial emotion recognition, and the aesthetics of the UI are adapted to reflect this emotion. In case of an emotion with negative valence such as anger or sadness, the UI aesthetic is gradually transitioned to one that evokes a more positive emotion. Semi-structured interviews with EChat users confirm the potential of emotion-aware design to reduce hateful content, and also highlight important design considerations.},

In this work, we study the PLPs layout design for different scenarios and propose a design space to guide the large-scale creation of PLPs. We propose LayoutVQ-VAE, a novel model specialized in generating layouts with internal and external constraints. LayoutVQ-VAE differs from previous methods as it learns a discrete latent representation of layout and can model the relationship between layout representation and scenarios without applying heuristics. Experiments on publicly available benchmarks for different layout types validate that our method performs comparably or favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. Case studies show that the proposed approach including the design space and model is effective in producing large-scale high-quality PLPs layouts for mobile shopping platforms.},

	abstract = {Service robots for personal use in the home and the workplace require end-user development solutions for swiftly scripting robot tasks as the need arises. Many existing solutions preserve ease, efficiency, and convenience through simple programming interfaces or by restricting task complexity. Others facilitate meticulous task design but often do so at the expense of simplicity and efficiency. There is a need for robot programming solutions that reconcile the complexity of robotics with the on-the-fly goals of end-user development. In response to this need, we present a novel, multimodal, and on-the-fly development system, Tabula. Inspired by a formative design study with a prototype, Tabula leverages a combination of spoken language for specifying the core of a robot task and sketching for contextualizing the core. The result is that developers can script partial, sloppy versions of robot programs to be completed and refined by a program synthesizer. Lastly, we demonstrate our anticipated use cases of Tabula via a set of application scenarios.},

This paper presents a generic software platform for automatic AUI generation by analyzing user behaviour patterns and customizing web user interfaces using machine learning. AdaBoost classifier showed 100\% accuracy for large UI components and user scenarios (n=800). The AUI generator supports the configuration and automation of capturing user behaviour, data storage, processing, querying analysis results and dynamic rendering of the user interface. AUI platform had SUS value of 80.75. The SUS scores for the UIs without AUI was 57.3 and with AUI scored 64.35 on average. The proposed AUI platform provides production level UI design means to meet dynamic adaptability on user traits.},

As the complexity of the command increases, extracting the right structure using the template-based algorithm decreases becomes more problematic.

We present a method for robustly handling miscommunication between people and robots in task-oriented spoken dialogue. This capability is implemented in TeamTalk, a conversational interface to robots that supports detection and recovery from the situated grounding problems of referential ambiguity and impossible actions. We introduce a representation that detects these problems and a nearest-neighbor learning algorithm that selects recovery strategies for a virtual robot. When the robot encounters a grounding problem, it looks back on its interaction history to consider how it resolved similar situations. The learning method is trained initially on crowdsourced data but is then supplemented by interactions from a longitudinal user study in which six participants performed navigation tasks with the robot. We compare results collected using a general model to user-specific models and find that user-specific models perform best on measures of dialogue efficiency, while the general model yields the highest agreement with human judges. Our overall contribution is a novel approach to detecting and recovering from miscommunication in dialogue by including situated context, namely, information from a robot’s path planner and surroundings.},

In this paper, we explore the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the video editing workflow to reduce these barriers. Our design vision is embodied in LAVE, a novel system that provides LLM-powered agent assistance and language-augmented editing features. LAVE automatically generates language descriptions for the user's footage, serving as the foundation for enabling the LLM to process videos and assist in editing tasks. When the user provides editing objectives, the agent plans and executes relevant actions to fulfill them. Moreover, LAVE allows users to edit videos through either the agent or direct UI manipulation, providing flexibility and enabling manual refinement of agent actions. Our user study, which included eight participants ranging from novices to proficient editors, demonstrated LAVE's effectiveness. The results also shed light on user perceptions of the proposed LLM-assisted editing paradigm and its impact on users' creativity and sense of co-creation. Based on these findings, we propose design implications to inform the future development of agent-assisted content editing.},

The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. To this end, both academia and industry have endeavored to develop MLLMs that can compete with or even better than GPT-4V, pushing the limit of research at a surprising speed. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLMs. First of all, we present the basic formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts, including architecture, training strategy and data, as well as evaluation. Then, we introduce research topics about how MLLMs can be extended to support more granularity, modalities, languages, and scenarios. We continue with multimodal hallucination and extended techniques, including Multimodal ICL (M-ICL), Multimodal CoT (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). To conclude the paper, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

In this paper, we present our efforts toward constructing a framework that can serve as an intermediary between a user and their user interface (UI), enabling dynamic and real-time interactions. We employ a system that stands upon textual semantic mappings of UI components, in the form of annotations. These mappings are stored, parsed, and scaled in a custom data structure, supplementary to an agent-based prompting backend engine. Employing textual semantic mappings allows each component to not only explain its role to the engine but also provide expectations. By comprehending the needs of both the user and the components, our LLM engine can classify the most appropriate application, extract relevant parameters, and subsequently execute precise predictions of the user's expected actions. Such an integration evolves static user interfaces into highly dynamic and adaptable solutions, introducing a new frontier of intelligent and responsive user experiences.},

	abstract = {Robots are becoming interactive and robust enough to be adopted outside laboratories and in industrial scenarios as well as interacting with humans in social activities. However, the design of engaging robot-based applications requires the availability of usable, flexible and accessible development frameworks, which can be adopted and mastered by researchers and practitioners in social sciences and adult end users as a whole. This paper surveys Visual Programming Environments aimed at enabling a paradigm fostering the so-called End-User Development of applications involving robots with social capabilities. The focus of this article is on those Visual Programming Environments that are designed to support social research goals as well as to cater for professional needs of people not trained in more traditional text-based computer programming languages. This survey excludes interfaces aimed at supporting expert programmers, at allowing industrial robots to perform typical industrial tasks (such as pick and place operations), and at teaching children how to code. After having performed a systematic search, sixteen programming environments have been included in this survey. Our goal is two-fold: first, to present these software tools with their technical features and Authoring Artificial Intelligence modeling approaches, and second, to present open challenges in the development of Visual Programming Environments for end users and social researchers, which can be informative and valuable to the community. The results show that the most recent such tools are adopting distributed and Component-Based Software Engineering approaches and web technologies. However, few of them have been designed to enable the independence of end users from high-tech scribes. Moreover, findings indicate the need for (i) more objective and comparative evaluations, as well as usability and user experience studies with real end users; and (ii) validations of these tools for designing applications aimed at working “in-the-wild” rather than only in laboratories and structured settings.},

We propose a design of a web based programming interface that makes it possible for end-users with different backgrounds to program robots using natural language. We used the cognitive dimensions framework to compare the usability of the newly created and the currently employed programming interfaces. The results showed that domain specialists are able to make robot programs more quickly and pleasantly with the proposed interface than with an existing one. Another important ﬁnding is that without physical simulation of the robot behaviours, the end-users do not feel conﬁdent enough to develop their scenarios in a realistic setting.},

In this paper, we propose MenuCraft, an AI-assisted designer for menu design that enables collaboration between the designer and a dialogue system to design menus. MenuCraft offers an interactive language-based menu design tool that simplifies the menu design process and enables easy customization of design options.

	abstract = {Mobile apps are indispensable for people's daily life, and automated GUI (Graphical User Interface) testing is widely used for app quality assurance. There is a growing interest in using learning-based techniques for automated GUI testing which aims at generating human-like actions and interactions. However, the limitations such as low testing coverage, weak generalization, and heavy reliance on training data, make an urgent need for a more effective approach to generate human-like actions to thoroughly test mobile apps. Inspired by the success of the Large Language Model (LLM), e.g., GPT-3 and ChatGPT, in natural language understanding and question answering, we formulate the mobile GUI testing problem as a Q\&A task. We propose GPTDroid, asking LLM to chat with the mobile apps by passing the GUI page information to LLM to elicit testing scripts, and executing them to keep passing the app feedback to LLM, iterating the whole process. Within it, we extract the static context of the GUI page and the dynamic context of the iterative testing process, design prompts for inputting this information to LLM, and develop a neural matching network to decode the LLM's output into actionable steps to execute the app. We evaluate GPTDroid on 86 apps from Google Play, and its activity coverage is 71\%, with 32\% higher than the best baseline, and can detect 36\% more bugs with faster speed than the best baseline. GPTDroid also detects 48 new bugs on the Google Play with 25 of them being confirmed/fixed. We further summarize the capabilities of GPTDroid behind the superior performance, including semantic text input, compound action, long meaningful test trace, and test case prioritization.},

This study introduces an AI-based chatbot that allows users to respond to validated screening surveys for mental disorders (PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PCL-5) in a natural, free-text conversation manner with real-time feedback. The study's objectives include evaluating the chatbot's usability and reducing the frequency of response clarifications while accurately interpreting users’ responses. The system was assessed running in hybrid NLU mode (Phase 2; N = 587; Mage = 21.56, SD = 5.56, 67.8\% women) after being trained on data collected while running in rule-based mode (Phase 1; N = 274; Mage = 21.86, SD = 5.50). During user-chatbot interactions, the chatbot required clarification only 4.64\% of the time. Using the AI NLU model, the chatbot could understand user responses in 85.65\% of cases and interpret free-text similarly to human annotators. In terms of usability, the chatbot in hybrid NLU mode was perceived as more engaging, friendly, and easier to use than in the rule-based NLU mode, which may be indirectly attributed to the enhanced autonomy provided by the AI NLU model.},

	abstract = {There is a close connection between health and the quality of one’s social life. Strong social bonds are essential for health and wellbeing, but often health conditions can detrimentally affect a person’s ability to interact with others. This can become a vicious cycle resulting in further decline in health. For this reason, the social management of health is an important aspect of healthcare. We propose that socially assistive robots (SARs) could help people with health conditions maintain positive social lives by supporting them in social interactions. This paper makes three contributions, as detailed below. We develop a framework of social mediation functions that robots could perform, motivated by the special social needs that people with health conditions have. In this framework we identify five types of functions that SARs could perform: (a) changing how the person is perceived, (b) enhancing the social behavior of the person, (c) modifying the social behavior of others, (d) providing structure for interactions, and (e) changing how the person feels. We thematically organize and review the existing literature on robots supporting human–human interactions, in both clinical and non-clinical settings, and explain how the findings and design ideas from these studies can be applied to the functions identified in the framework. Finally, we point out and discuss challenges in designing SARs for supporting social interactions, and highlight opportunities for future robot design and HRI research on the mediator role of robots.},

Therefore, it is interesting to investigate whether a robot should have a separate device to incorporate digital content or use its face to toggle between facial expressions and digital content. From the human–robot interface (HRI) design perspective, a robot with a tablet obviously is closer to a real human teacher using a tablet while teaching students in a classroom. However, limited research has been done to explore such HRI design and its impacts on human behaviours. A robot-facilitated storytelling learning system was developed in this study to evaluate the impact of HRI design on college students’ learning behaviours in two different conditions: ‘Robot with Tablet’ or ‘Robot only’. The results revealed that both learning conditions of HRI design benefited college students from knowledge acquisition of vocabulary and comprehension of story content. Furthermore, ‘Robot only’ which is more cost-effective was found to be as good as that of ‘Robot with Tablet’ for the students in terms of knowledge acquisition, cognitive load and learning fatigue.},

	abstract = {Virtual assistants allow users to interact with apps using a conversational mode. A particular kind of device supporting virtual assistants is the smart speaker, which allows end users to access contents and services, perform searches and command smart environments via voice interaction. These devices are gaining relevance among users, and the number of apps available for giving them more conversational capabilities grows constantly. However, there is a gap between what can be achieved using these devices and the information available on the web, i.e. most web apps don't have one smart speaker app counterpart. In this work, we present a two-step approach to defining conversational interfaces for virtual assistants based on existing web sites. During the first step, the user creates web content blocks, which describe target contents and the strategy for retrieving them. In the second step, the user uses web content blocks to specify the conversational interface. Although the approach could be considered generic enough for any kind of conversational interface, we focus our research on voice user interfaces, considering smart speaker apps as a major target. With our approach, apps based on voice user interfaces for smart speakers may be developed in a no-code manner. We describe and illustrate the approach by presenting usage examples and an evaluation using the Alexa service and an Amazon Echo device. The evaluation shows promising results for two case studies where there is no significant difference between the user experience when comparing solutions developed using the Alexa SDK versus apps using our approach.},

To tackle such an issue, this paper presents a design study that investigated data-enabled analogue journaling (DEAJ) to help college students improve their mental wellness through paper-based self-reflection aided by automatic self-tracking. Specifically, based on several design iterations we developed a DEAJ tool, called EmoVis, which could generate a printed visualisation based on daily physiological data and event tags to support doodling or structured writing in analogue journaling for everyday stress management. We conducted a six-day mixed methods field study with 32 college students to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of EmoVis. Results suggested that EmoVis can significantly improve the engagement and need for self-reflection due to context-based reflection and data-enabled exploratory journaling. Furthermore, the doodling canvas was experienced as a joyful tool for mindfulness and creative DEAJ, while reflecting with a writing template was perceived as efficient. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of DEAJ approaches for daily stress coping in students’ college life.},

	abstract = {Previous research examining how icons’ concreteness, visual complexity, and distinctiveness influence visual search performance have led to disagreements over which icon characteristic most affects behaviour. These icon characteristics are often poorly defined and interrelated, particularly concreteness. Accordingly, drawing strong inferences about the robustness of concreteness as a factor in search for visual icons is challenging. Here, we operationalised concreteness into three distinct levels: concrete icons were images of real-world objects, photorealistic icons were drawings of the object, and abstract icons were images with no conceptual information. Across two experiments, participants rated each icon on various icon characteristics (e.g. concreteness, visual complexity) to provide a ground truth for these factors and to validate our concreteness manipulation. In a separate study, naive participants performed a visual search task for a target icon. Oculomotor measures were utilised to elucidate how various icon characteristics affected search performance. Although we were unable to fully disassociate concreteness from visual complexity, we found that icons high in concreteness improved search performance, but as visual complexity increased, object identification became slower. This was largely demonstrated through increased verification times for complex targets. The present set of studies indicate that highly concrete and simple icons engender search benefits.},

The results indicate that co-creation with service robots has an important autonomy-enhancing effect on employees. Furthermore, the relationship between co-creation with service robots and employee wellbeing through the need for competence and the need for relatedness is also mediated by the need for autonomy.

	abstract = {The theory of Objective Self-Awareness (OSA) and related studies suggest that embodiment of personalised avatars may induce self-awareness and influence self-esteem. Additionally, the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm suggests that humans may mindlessly respond to computers in ways that are similar to human interactions. Based on those assertions, it is plausible that virtual embodiment of a personalised avatar and interactions with a virtual agent can shift self-esteem. However, those effects on self-esteem have not been thoroughly examined in past studies. To address these research gaps, a 2 (avatar personalisation: personalised vs. non-personalised avatar) × 2 (virtual agent interaction valence: positive vs. negative) between-subjects experiment was conducted using a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation (N =171). Findings from the study showed that there was no effects of avatar personalisation and virtual agent interaction valence on state self-esteem change. However, the pairwise comparisons present some preliminary indications that avatar personalisation and positive interactions with a virtual agent may facilitate improvements in state self-esteem altogether. Implications of the study findings are discussed.},

Addressing these challenges, we introduce MAxPrototyper, our human-centered, multi-agent system for interactive design generation. The core of MAxPrototyper is a theme design agent. It coordinates with specialized sub-agents, each responsible for generating specific parts of the design. Through an intuitive online interface, users can control the design process by providing text descriptions and layout. Enhanced by improved language and image generation models, MAxPrototyper generates each component with careful detail and contextual understanding. Its multi-agent architecture enables a multi-round interaction capability between the system and users, facilitating precise and customized design adjustments throughout the creation process.},

For concepts that are difficult to describe through language, users may struggle to create prompts. Moreover, many of these models are built as end-to-end systems, lacking support for iterative shaping of the image. In response, we introduce PromptPaint, which combines T2I generation with interactions that model how we use colored paints. PromptPaint allows users to go beyond language to mix prompts that express challenging concepts. Just as we iteratively tune colors through layered placements of paint on a physical canvas, PromptPaint similarly allows users to apply different prompts to different canvas areas and times of the generative process. Through a set of studies, we characterize different approaches for mixing prompts, design trade-offs, and socio-technical challenges for generative models. With PromptPaint we provide insight into future steerable generative tools.},

	abstract = {Automating activities through robots in unstructured environments, such as construction sites, has been a long-standing desire. However, the high degree of unpredictable events in these settings has resulted in far less adoption compared to more structured settings, such as manufacturing, where robots can be hard-coded or trained on narrowly defined datasets. Recently, pretrained foundation models, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), have demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by providing zero-shot solutions for problems do not present in the training data, proposing them as a potential solution for introducing robots to unstructured environments. To this end, this study investigates potential opportunities and challenges of pretrained foundation models from a multi-dimensional perspective. The study systematically reviews application of foundation models in two field of robotic and unstructured environment and then synthesized them with deliberative acting theory. Findings showed that linguistic capabilities of LLMs have been utilized more than other features for improving perception in human-robot interactions. On the other hand, findings showed that the use of LLMs demonstrated more applications in project management and safety in construction, and natural hazard detection in disaster management. Synthesizing these findings, we located the current state-of-the-art in this field on a five-level scale of automation, placing them at conditional automation. This assessment was then used to envision future scenarios, challenges, and solutions toward autonomous safe unstructured environments. Our study can be seen as a benchmark to track our progress toward that future.},

In addition, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Human-Agent Collaboration method, ReHAC. This approach includes a policy model designed to determine the most opportune stages for human intervention within the task-solving process. We construct a human-agent collaboration dataset to train this policy model in an offline reinforcement learning environment. Our validation tests confirm the model's effectiveness. The results demonstrate that the synergistic efforts of humans and LLM-based agents significantly improve performance in complex tasks, primarily through well-planned, limited human intervention.

We contribute Metaphorian, a system that supports science writers with the creation of scientific metaphors by facilitating the search, extension, and iterative revision of metaphors. Metaphorian uses a large language model-based workflow inspired by the heuristic rules revealed from a study with six professional writers. A user study (n=16) revealed that Metaphorian significantly enhances satisfaction, confidence, and inspiration in metaphor writing without decreasing writers’ sense of agency.

Generative AI stands to obviate this entirely by allowing users to generate code from naturalistic language prompts. In this essay, we explore the extent to which "traditional" programming languages remain relevant for non-expert end-user programmers in a world with generative AI. We posit the "generative shift hypothesis": that generative AI will create qualitative and quantitative expansions in the traditional scope of end-user programming. We outline some reasons that traditional programming languages may still be relevant and useful for end-user programmers. We speculate whether each of these reasons might be fundamental and enduring, or whether they may disappear with further improvements and innovations in generative AI. Finally, we articulate a set of implications for end-user programming research, including the possibility of needing to revisit many well-established core concepts, such as Ko's learning barriers and Blackwell's attention investment model.},

This paper presents an interface for the commanding home robots by using stroke gestures on a computer screen. This interface allows the user to control robots and design their behaviors by sketching the robot's behaviors and actions on a top-down view from ceiling cameras. To convey a feeling of directly controlling the robots, our interface employs the live camera view.

For this purpose, we first conducted a preliminary study with experienced VR users to identify users’ needs for interacting with the physical world, which led to a set of features for customizing the scale, placement, and activation method of a reality lens. We evaluated the design in a user study (n=12) and collected the feedback of participants engaged in two VR applications while encountering a range of interventions from the physical world. The results show that users’ VR presence tends to be better preserved when interacting with the physical world with the support of the RealityLens interface.},

On the optimistic side, such large language models have the potential to improve productivity by providing an automated AI pair programmer for every programmer in the world. On the cautionary side, since these large language models do not understand program semantics, they offer no guarantees about quality of the suggested code. In this paper, we present an approach to augment these large language models with post-processing steps based on program analysis and synthesis techniques, that understand the syntax and semantics of programs. Further, we show that such techniques can make use of user feedback and improve with usage. We present our experiences from building and evaluating such a tool Jigsaw, targeted at synthesizing code for using Python Pandas API using multi-modal inputs. Our experience suggests that as these large language models evolve for synthesizing code from intent, Jigsaw has an important role to play in improving the accuracy of the systems.},

	abstract = {The ability of social agents, be it virtually-embodied avatars or physically-embodied robots, to display social behavior and interact with their users in a natural way represents an important factor in how effective such agents are during interactions. In particular, endowing the agent with effective communicative abilities, well-suited for the target application or task, can make a significant difference in how users perceive the agent, especially when the agent needs to interact in complex social environments. In this work, we consider how two core input communication modalities present in human-robot interaction—speech recognition and touch-based selection—shape users’ perceptions of the agent. We design a short interaction in order to gauge adolescents’ reaction to the input communication modality employed by a robot intended as a long-term companion for motivating them to engage in daily physical activity. A study with n = 52 participants shows that adolescents perceive the robot as more of a friend and more socially present in the speech recognition condition than in the touch-based selection one. Our results highlight the advantages of using speech recognition as an input communication modality even when this represents the less robust choice, and the importance of investigating how to best do so.},

	abstract = {Despite the proliferation of chatbots (conversational agents) in increasingly varied contexts, user satisfaction with chatbot interactions remains a challenge. We do not yet fully understand chatbot usability and adoption factors or how to customize chatbots based on users' personality traits. One important and under researched aspect of chatbot design is users' perceptions of different communication modalities such as voice and text. In this between-group study (n = 393 participants), we asked participants to rate an equivalent text-based (n = 189) and voice-based (n = 204) non-directive, goal-attainment coaching chatbot in terms of usability, performance expectancy and risk perception. We also considered participants' personality in terms of extraversion. For usability across all participants, there was no difference between the chatbots for all participants; however, a higher rating of the voicebot was observed in the group classified as introverts and no difference was found for participants classified as extroverts. For performance expectancy all participants, extroverts and introverts rated the textbot higher. Risk ratings showed no difference between bots for all participants, extroverts and introverts. The results suggest that the voicebot was considered slightly easier to use for some participants while the textbot was considered to perform better by all participants. Creators of chatbots should consider using voice as a modality to attract users and text as a mode to accomplish complex tasks. Extraversion did not play a significant part in chatbot communication modality choice. These results may assist in designing context and audience-specific chatbots for increased efficacy and user satisfaction.},

The reference robot used in the research was Pepper, a humanoid robot equipped with a tablet on its front. During the research, various multimodal communication strategies were formalised, implemented and preliminarily evaluated by means of a questionnaire. The results show some statistically significant preferences for specific strategies, marking new avenues of investigation with regard to robot-to-human multimodal communication and its adaptation to the user features.},

Different genders and cultures use non-verbal communication differently and these differences can impact the nature of interpersonal communication. Nonverbal communication can become a barrier or tear down barriers to effective communication. According to researchers, non-verbal rules may differ as per the situation, and each situation determines its set of rules. Different types of people have very different yet distinct sets of non-verbal communication behaviors. This paper is an overview of different types of non-verbal communication such as body language, hand movement, facial expressions, and eye contact. Non-verbal communication involves multiple channels, is continuous and more ambiguous in nature, and often contradicts the spoken word. When non-verbal and verbal communications conflict, individuals tend to rely on non-verbal clues as a means to interpret the true meaning of a communication.},

Our aim is to exploit a dialogical paradigm to allow a natural and robust interaction between the human and the robot. The proposed dialogue system should improve the robustness and the flexibility of the overall interactive system, including multimodal fusion, interpretation, and decision-making. The dialogue is represented as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDPs) to cast the inherent communication ambiguity and noise into the dialogue model. POMDPs have been used in spoken dialogue systems, mainly for tourist information services, but their application to multimodal human-robot interaction is novel. This paper presents the proposed model for dialogue representation and the methodology used to compute a dialogue strategy. The whole architecture has been integrated on a mobile robot platform and has bee n tested in a human-robot interaction scenario to assess the overall performances with respect to baseline controllers.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns human-inspired robotic eye-hand coordination algorithms using custom built robotic eyes that were interfaced with a Baxter robot. Eye movement was programmed anthropomorphically based on previously reported research on human eye-hand coordination during grasped object transportation. Robotic eye tests were first performed on a component level where accurate position and temporal control were achieved. Next, 11 human subjects were recruited to observe the novel robotic system to quantify the ability of robotic eye-hand coordination algorithms to convey two kinds of information to people during object transportation tasks: first, the transported object’s delivery location and second, the level of care exerted by the robot to transport the object. Most subjects correlated decreased frequency in gaze fixations on an object’s target location with increased care of transporting an object, although these results were somewhat mixed among the 11 human subjects. Additionally, the human subjects were able to reliably infer the delivery location of the transported object purely by the robotic eye-hand coordination algorithm with an overall success rate of 91.4\%. These results suggest that anthropomorphic eye-hand coordination of robotic entities could be useful in pedagogical or industrial settings.},

This paper explores using tablets to render mixed-reality visual environments that support human-robot collaboration for object manipulation. A mobile interface is created on a tablet by integrating real-time vision, 3D graphics, touchscreen interaction, and wireless communication. This mobile interface augments a live video of physical objects in a robot's workspace with corresponding virtual objects that can be manipulated by a user to intuitively command the robot to manipulate the physical objects. By generating the mixed-reality environment on an exocentric view provided by the tablet camera, the interface establishes a common frame of reference for the user and the robot to effectively communicate spatial information for object manipulation. After addressing challenges due to limitations in mobile sensing and computation, the interface is evaluated with participants to examine the performance and user experience with the suggested approach.},

	abstract = {This work proposes an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed for HoloLens 2 which allows human operators, without particular experience or knowledge of robotics, to easily interact with collaborative robots. Building on the application presented in a previous work of the authors, the novel contributions are focused on a bi-directional interaction that manages the exchange of data from the robot to the human operator and, in the meantime, the ﬂow of commands in the opposite direction. More in detail, the application includes the reading of the robot state, in terms of joint positions, velocities and torques, the visualization of the workspace and the generation and manipulation of the end-effector trajectory by directly moving a set of way-points displayed in the AR environment. Finally, the trajectory feasibility is veriﬁed and notiﬁed to the user by taking into account the workspace limits. A usability study of the AR platform has been conducted involving 45 participants with different ages and expertise in robot programming and Extended Reality (XR) platforms, comparing two programming methods: a classical kinesthetic teaching interface, provided by the Franka Emika Panda cobot, and the presented AR platform. Participants have reported the effectiveness of the proposed platform, experiencing less physical demand and higher intuitiveness and usability.},

We present a novel design for a home control interface in the form of a social robot, commanded via tangible icons and giving feedback through expressive gestures. We experimentally compare the robot to three common smart-home interfaces: a voice-control loudspeaker; a wall-mounted touch-screen; and a mobile application. Our ﬁndings suggest that interfaces that rate higher on ﬂow rate lower on usability, and vice versa. Participants’ sense of control is highest using familiar interfaces, and lowest using voice control. Situation awareness is highest using the robot, and also lowest using voice control. These ﬁndings raise questions about voice control as a smart-home interface, and suggest that embodied social robots could provide for an engaging interface with high situation awareness, but also that their usability remains a considerable design challenge.},

We are presenting a user study within a smart oﬃce setting in which 84 participants were either interrupted by a tablet, a non-expressive social robot, or an expressive social robot by being asked to perform tasks regarding their physical well-being. Results show that each type of user interface bears diﬀerent advantages. While the tablet comes with a signiﬁcantly higher usability and a lower level of perceived workload, both versions of the social robot outperform the tablet in terms of social perception and the overall evaluation of the interaction. Overall, the results provide valuable insights informing designers of smart environments which device to choose to enhance certain aspects of the quality of interaction.},

	abstract = {Robotics have advanced significantly over the years, and human–robot interaction (HRI) is now playing an important role in delivering the best user experience, cutting down on laborious tasks, and raising public acceptance of robots. New HRI approaches are necessary to promote the evolution of robots, with a more natural and flexible interaction manner clearly the most crucial. As a newly emerging approach to HRI, multimodal HRI is a method for individuals to communicate with a robot using various modalities, including voice, image, text, eye movement, and touch, as well as bio-signals like EEG and ECG. It is a broad field closely related to cognitive science, ergonomics, multimedia technology, and virtual reality, with numerous applications springing up each year. However, little research has been done to summarize the current development and future trend of HRI. To this end, this paper systematically reviews the state of the art of multimodal HRI on its applications by summing up the latest research articles relevant to this field. Moreover, the research development in terms of the input signal and the output signal is also covered in this manuscript.},

This work describes four studies, including a systematic literature review, with an overall sample of 141 participants in the survey (experts and novices), focus group sessions and testing of chatbots to (i) define attributes to assess the quality of interaction with chatbots and (ii) the designing and piloting a new scale to measure satisfaction after the experience with chatbots. Two instruments were developed: (i) A diagnostic tool in the form of a checklist (BOT-Check). This tool is a development of previous works which can be used reliably to check the quality of a chatbots experience in line with commonplace principles. (ii) A 15-item questionnaire (BOT Usability Scale, BUS-15) with estimated reliability between .76 and .87 distributed in five factors. BUS-15 strongly correlates with UMUX-LITE by enabling designers to consider a broader range of aspects usually not considered in satisfaction tools for non-conversational agents, e.g. conversational efficiency and accessibility, quality of the chatbot’s functionality and so on. Despite the convincing psychometric properties, BUS-15 requires further testing and validation. Designers can use it as a tool to assess products, thus building independent databases for future evaluation of its reliability, validity and sensitivity.},

It mainly deals with Voice User Interfaces - VUI (also called Spoken Dialogue Interfaces - SDIs) but also includes issues on multimodal interfaces, involving speech and other modalities. Human-machine interaction in the area of robotics raises certain challenges that respective interface design for other domains ignores. Robots, and more importantly, service robots, execute actual tasks based on plans and scenarios that, in effect, layout their usage. The completion requirements, as well as the workﬂow needed for those tasks, form a very signiﬁcant set of rules that affect and sometimes govern the interaction between the user and the machine. Those rules are embedded to the design of the interaction system and, together with the communicated context, provide the sets and constraints that the system is based upon. These constraints can be realized in the form of speciﬁc dialogue management design, dialogue ﬂow, belief states models, veriﬁcation, disambiguation, and grounding techniques as well as more subtly use of speciﬁc speech and dialogue acts – all the above affect all stages of the lifecycle. Moreover, signiﬁcant merit goes to usability, and the techniques for its evaluation, issues that are of the utmost importance when any user-machine interface is designed and assessed.},

Usability tests were iteratively conducted on 245 Japanese subjects with age-groups from 20s to 60s using a prototype of an in-vehicle information application. Next we calculated and analyzed statistics of the usability tests. We discuss the differences in usability with respect to age-groups and how to handle them. We propose that it is necessary to make voice guidance straightforward and to devise a VUI consistent with a GUI (VGUI) in order to let users understand the system structure. Also we found that the default design of a VGUI should be as simple as possible so that elderly users, who may be slow to learn the new system structure, are able to easily learn it.},

	abstract = {As robots are deployed into large-scale human environments, they will need to engage in task-oriented dialogues about objects and locations beyond those that can currently be seen. In these contexts, speakers use a wide range of referring gestures beyond those used in the small-scale interaction contexts that HRI research typically investigates. In this work, we thus seek to understand how robots can better generate gestures to accompany their referring language in large-scale interaction contexts. In service of this goal, we present the results of two human-subject studies: (1) a humanhuman study exploring how human gestures change in large-scale interaction contexts, and to identify human-like gestures suitable to such contexts yet readily implemented on robot hardware; and (2) a human-robot study conducted in a tightly controlled Virtual Reality environment, to evaluate robots’ use of those identified gestures. Our results show that robot use of Precise Deictic and Abstract Pointing gestures afford different types of benefits when used to refer to visible vs. non-visible referents, leading us to formulate three concrete design guidelines. These results highlight both the opportunities for robot use of more humanlike gestures in large-scale interaction contexts, as well as the need for future work exploring their use as part of multi-modal communication.},

The results show that subjects are more likely to cooperate with human rather than with robotic partners; that they are more likely to cooperate after receiving a verbal reaction following a sub-optimal social outcome; and that the effect of the verbal reaction is not dependent on the nature of the partner. Our findings provide new evidence on the effects of verbal communication in strategic frameworks that involves humanoid robotic partners. The results are robust to: the exclusion of students of Economics-related subjects, the inclusion of a set of psychological and behavioral controls, the subjects’ perception on robots’ behavior, and gender biases in human–human interactions.},

The model is intended to be irreducible, to highlight the essential communication entities and their interrelations, and potentially to cover all conceivable kinds of communication of meaning. It is designed to clearly account for both verbal and nonverbal meaning, the different roles played by minds and bodies in communication, and the relation between presemiotic and semiotic media features. As a result, the model also pinpoints fundamental obstacles for communication located in media products themselves, and demonstrates how Shannon’s model of transmission of computable data can be incorporated in a model of human communication of meaning.},

	abstract = {Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) is a research area that developed steadily during the last years. While robots in the last decades of the 20th century have been mostly constructed to work autonomously, the rise of service robots during the last 20 years has mostly contributed to the development of effective communication methods between human users and robots. This development has been even accelerated with the advancement of humanoid robots, where the demand for effective human-robot-interaction is even more obvious. It is also amazing to note that, inspired by the success of HRI in the area of service and humanoid robotics, human-robot-interfaces become nowadays even attractive for areas, where HRI has never played a major role before, especially for industrial robots or robots in outdoor environments. Compared to classical human-computer-interaction (HCI), one can say that the basic interaction algorithms are not that much different in HRI, e.g. a speech or gesture recognizer would not work much differently in both domains. The major differences between HCI and HRI are more in the different utilization of modalities, which also depends very much on the type of employed robot. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is the description of the major differences between HCI and HRI and the presentation of the most important modalities used in HRI and how they affect the interaction depending on the various types of available robot platforms.},

            Is it possible to integrate a humanoid social robot into the work processes or customer care in an official environment, e.g. in municipal offices? If so, what could such an application scenario look like and what skills would the robot need to have when interacting with human customers? What are requirements for this kind of interactions? We have devised an application scenario for such a case, determined the necessary or desirable capabilities of the robot, developed a corresponding robot application and carried out initial tests and evaluations in a project together with the Kiel City Council. One of the most important insights gained in the project was that a humanoid robot with natural language processing capabilities based on large language models as well as human-like gestures and posture changes (animations) proved to be much more preferred by users compared to standard browser-based solutions on tablets for an information system in the City Council. Furthermore, we propose a connection of the ACT-R cognitive architecture with the robot, where an ACT-R model is used in interaction with the robot application to cognitively process and enhance a dialogue between human and robot.},

As these models become integral components of various applications, the need for personalized and customized responses has gained prominence. Thispaper explores the realm of personalization and customization within the context of LLM responses, aiming to enhance user interaction and satisfaction.The objective of this study is to investigate methodologies for tailoring LLM-generated responses to individual user preferences, thereby optimizing the overalluser experience. We delve into the challenges and opportunities presented by personalization and customization, addressing issues such as privacy concerns, ethicalconsiderations, and the delicate balance between generalization and specificity in response generation.Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and methodologies, we propose a framework that combines user profiling, contextual analysis, and feedbackmechanisms to dynamically adapt LLM responses. The proposed framework seeks to strike a balance between providing personalized content and maintaining theintegrity of the underlying language model.The potential applications of personalized LLM responses span a wide range of domains, including chatbots, virtual assistants, and content recommendation systems.By tailoring responses to individual users, we anticipate improvements in engagement, satisfaction, and the overall effectiveness of LLM-powered applications.},

In this paper, we argue that we must start to re-consider the hallmarks of cooperative communication and the core capabilities that we have developed for it, and which conversational agents need to be equipped with: incremental joint co-construction and mentalizing. We base our argument on a vast body of work on human-human communication and its psychological processes that we reason to be relevant and necessary to take into account when modeling human-agent communication. We contrast those with current conceptualizations of human-agent interaction and formulate suggestions for the development of future systems.},

Social (or Sociable) robots are designed to interact with people in a natural, interpersonal manner – often to achieve positive outcomes in diverse applications such as education, health, quality of life, entertainment, communication, and tasks requiring collaborative teamwork. The long-term goal of creating social robots that are competent and capable partners for people is quite a challenging task. They will need to be able to communicate naturally with people using both verbal and nonverbal signals. They will need to engage us not only on a cognitive level, but on an emotional level as well in order to provide effective social and task-related support to people. They will need a wide range of social-cognitive skills and a theory of other minds to understand human behavior, and to be intuitively understood by people. A deep understanding of human intelligence and behavior across multiple dimensions (i. e., cognitive, affective, physical, social, etc.) is necessary in order to design robots that can successfully play a beneficial role in the daily lives of people. This requires a multidisciplinary approach where the design of social robot technologies and methodologies are informed by robotics, artificial intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, design, anthropology, and more.},

In response, unconstrained natural-language interaction with robots has emerged as a significant research area. We discuss the problem of parsing natural language commands to actions and control structures that can be readily implemented in a robot execution system. Our approach learns a parser based on example pairs of English commands and corresponding control language expressions. We evaluate this approach in the context of following route instructions through an indoor environment, and demonstrate that our system can learn to translate English commands into sequences of desired actions, while correctly capturing the semantic intent of statements involving complex control structures. The procedural nature of our formal representation allows a robot to interpret route instructions online while moving through a previously unknown environment.},

	abstract = {The number of robots deployed in our daily surroundings is ever-increasing. Even in the industrial setup, the use of coworker robots is increasing rapidly. These cohabitant robots perform various tasks as instructed by colocated human beings. Thus, a natural interaction mechanism plays a big role in the usability and acceptability of the robot, especially by a non-expert user. The recent development in natural language processing (NLP) has paved the way for chatbots to generate an automatic response for users’ query. A robot can be equipped with such a dialogue system. However, the goal of human-robot interaction is not focused on generating a response to queries, but it often involves performing some tasks in the physical world. Thus, a system is required that can detect user intended task from the natural instruction along with the set of pre- and post-conditions. In this work, we develop a dialogue engine for a robot that can classify and map a task instruction to the robot’s capability. If there is some ambiguity in the instructions or some required information is missing, which is often the case in natural conversation, it asks an appropriate question(s) to resolve it. The goal is to generate minimal and pin-pointed queries for the user to resolve an ambiguity. We evaluate our system for a telepresence scenario where a remote user instructs the robot for various tasks.

If we are to make progress in this field then we must be able to compare the results from different studies. A literature review has been performed on the measurements of five key concepts in HRI: anthropomorphism, animacy, likeability, perceived intelligence, and perceived safety. The results have been distilled into five consistent questionnaires using semantic differential scales. We report reliability and validity indicators based on several empirical studies that used these questionnaires. It is our hope that these questionnaires can be used by robot developers to monitor their progress. Psychologists are invited to further develop the questionnaires by adding new concepts, and to conduct further validations where it appears necessary.},

Unfortunately, a large number of new media are designed from a perspective of viewing and treating humans primarily as consumers. The possibility for humans to be and act as designers  (in cases in which they desire to do so) should be accessible not only to a small group of high-tech scribes, but rather to all interested individuals and groups. Meta-design characterizes activities, processes, and objectives to create new media and environments that allow users to act as designers and be creative.In this paper we discuss problems addressed by our research on meta-design, provide a conceptual framework for meta-design, and illustrate our developments in the context of a particular system, the Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory.},

This would not only address the needs for diverse users but also pave the way for a richer and more inclusive spectrum of human-robot interactions. To achieve this, a framework for a bilingual robot has been proposed in this paper. The robot exhibits the ability to articulate messages in spoken language, complemented by non-verbal cues such as expressive gestures, all while concurrently conveying information through sign language. The system can generate natural language expressions with speech audio, spontaneous prosody-based gestures, and sign language displayed on a virtual avatar on a robot's screen. The preliminary findings from this research showcase the robot's capacity to seamlessly blend natural language expressions with synchronized gestures and sign language, underlining its potential to revolutionize communication dynamics in diverse settings.},

To address the challenge, we leveraged the principle of least collaborative effort in communication grounding theory and designed three grounded conversational interactions: 1) a grounding interface allows users to start with a provisional input and then invite a conversational agent to complete their input, 2) a multiple grounding interface presents multiple inputs for the user to select from, and 3) a structured grounding interface guides users to write inputs in a structure best understood by the system. We compared our three grounding interfaces to an ungrounded control interface in a crowdsourced study (N=80) using a natural language system that generates small programs. We found that the grounding interfaces reduced cognitive load and improved task performance. The structured grounding interface further reduced speaker change costs and improved technology acceptance, without sacrificing the perception of control. We discuss the implications of designing grounded conversational interactions in natural language systems.},

This shift to using NL to program enhances collaborative programming by reducing communication barriers and context-switching among programmers from varying backgrounds. However, programmers may face challenges during prompt engineering in a collaborative setting as they need to actively keep aware of their collaborators’ progress and intents. In this paper, we aim to investigate ways to assist programmers’ prompt engineering in a collaborative context. We first conducted a formative study to understand the workflows and challenges of programmers when using NL for collaborative programming. Based on our findings, we implemented a prototype, CoPrompt, to support collaborative prompt engineering by providing referring, requesting, sharing, and linking mechanisms. Our user study indicates that CoPrompt assists programmers in comprehending collaborators’ prompts and building on their collaborators’ work, reducing repetitive updates and communication costs.},

We examine this challenge in the specific context of data analysis in spreadsheets, in a system that maps the user’s natural language query to Python code using the Codex generator, executes the code, and shows the result. We propose grounded abstraction matching, which bridges the abstraction gap by translating the code back into a systematic and predictable naturalistic utterance. In a between-subjects, think-aloud study (n=24), we compare grounded abstraction matching to an ungrounded alternative based on previously established query framing principles. We find that the grounded approach improves end-users’ understanding of the scope and capabilities of the code-generating model, and the kind of language needed to use it effectively.},

	abstract = {In recent years, models, composition paradigms, and tools for mashup development have been proposed to support the integration of information sources, services and APIs available on the Web. The challenge is to provide a gate to a “programmable Web,” where end users are allowed to construct easily composite applications that merge content and functions so as to satisfy the long tail of their specific needs. The approaches proposed so far do not fully accommodate this vision. This article, therefore, proposes a mashup development framework that is oriented toward the End-User Development. Given the fundamental role of user interfaces (UIs) as a medium easily understandable by the end users, the proposed approach is characterized by UI-centric models able to support a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) specification of data integration and service orchestration. It, therefore, contributes to the definition of adequate abstractions that, by hiding the technology and implementation complexity, can be adopted by the end users in a kind of “democratic” paradigm for mashup development. This article also shows how model-to-code generative techniques translate models into application schemas, which in turn guide the dynamic instantiation of the composite applications at runtime. This is achieved through lightweight execution environments that can be deployed on the Web and on mobile devices to support the pervasive use of the created applications.},

This paper explores the multifaceted impact of LLMs on robotics, addressing key challenges and opportunities for leveraging these models across various domains. By categorizing and analyzing LLM applications within core robotics elements—communication, perception, planning, and control—we aim to provide actionable insights for researchers seeking to integrate LLMs into their robotic systems. Our investigation focuses on LLMs developed post-GPT-3.5, primarily in text-based modalities while also considering multimodal approaches for perception and control. We offer comprehensive guidelines and examples for prompt engineering, facilitating beginners’ access to LLM-based robotics solutions. Through tutorial-level examples and structured prompt construction, we illustrate how LLM-guided enhancements can be seamlessly integrated into robotics applications. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers navigating the evolving landscape of LLM-driven robotics, offering a comprehensive overview and practical guidance for harnessing the power of language models in robotics development.},

AI programming assistants such as GitHub Copilot X enable conversational programming, narrowing the gap between human intent and code generation. However, prior literature has identified a key challenge--there is a gap between user's mental model of the system's understanding after a sequence of natural language utterances, and the AI system's actual understanding. To address this, we introduce Programming with Representations (PwR), an approach that uses representations to convey the system's understanding back to the user in natural language. We conducted an in-lab task-centered study with 14 users of varying programming proficiency and found that representations significantly improve understandability, and instilled a sense of agency among our participants. Expert programmers use them for verification, while intermediate programmers benefit from confirmation. Natural language-based development with LLMs, coupled with representations, promises to transform software development, making it more accessible and efficient.},

	abstract = {Chat LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 have shown promise in assisting humans in coding, particularly by enabling them to conversationally provide feedback. However, current approaches assume users have expert debugging skills, limiting accessibility for non-professional programmers. In this paper, we first explore Chat LLMs' limitations in assisting non-professional programmers with coding. Through a formative study, we identify two key elements affecting their experience: the way a Chat LLM explains its generated code and the structure of human-LLM interaction. We then propose IntelliExplain, a new conversational code generation framework with enhanced code explanations and a structured interaction paradigm, which enforces both better code understanding and a more effective feedback loop. In two programming tasks (SQL and Python), IntelliExplain yields significantly higher success rates and reduces task time compared to the vanilla Chat LLM. We also identify several opportunities that remain in effectively offering a chat-based programming experience for non-professional programmers.},

However, providing these demonstrations is cumbersome for endusers. In addition, users who are not familiar with the system often fail to demonstrate sufﬁciently varied demonstrations. We propose an alternative PbD framework that involves demonstrating the task once and then providing additional task information explicitly, through interactions with a visualization of the action. We present a simple action representation that supports this framework and describe a system that implements the framework on a two-armed mobile manipulator. We demonstrate the power of this system by evaluating it on a diverse task benchmark that involves manipulation of everyday objects. We then demonstrate that the system is easy to learn and use for novice users through a user study in which participants program a subset of the benchmark. We characterize the limitations of our system in task generalization and end-user interactions and present extensions that could address some of the limitations.},

This paper presents a novel augmented reality (AR) based interface to facilitate human-virtual robot interaction. A number of human-virtual robot interaction methods have been formulated and implemented with respect to the various types of operations needed in different robotic applications. A Euclidean distance-based method is developed to assist the users in the interaction with the virtual robot and the spatial entities in an AR environment. A monitor-based visualization mode is adopted as it enables the users to perceive the virtual contents associated with different interaction methods, and the virtual content augmented in the real environment is informative and useful to the users during their interaction with the virtual robot. Case researches are presented to demonstrate the successful implementation of the AR-based HRI interface in planning robot pick-and-place operations and path following operations.},

	abstract = {Task planning can require defining myriad domain knowledge about the world in which a robot needs to act. To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

We contribute CodeBotler, an open-source robot-agnostic tool to program service mobile robots from natural language, and RoboEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities of generating programs to complete service robot tasks. CodeBotler performs program generation via few-shot prompting of LLMs with an embedded domain-specific language (eDSL) in Python, and leverages skill abstractions to deploy generated programs on any general-purpose mobile robot. RoboEval evaluates the correctness of generated programs by checking execution traces starting with multiple initial states, and checking whether the traces satisfy temporal logic properties that encode correctness for each task. RoboEval also includes multiple prompts per task to test for the robustness of program generation. We evaluate several popular state-of-the-art LLMs with the RoboEval benchmark, and perform a thorough analysis of the modes of failures, resulting in a taxonomy that highlights common pitfalls of LLMs at generating robot programs.},

Still, a publicly available general tool to conduct such experiments is currently not available in the research community, and researchers often develop and implement their own tools, customized for each individual experiment. Besides being inefficient in terms of programming efforts, this also makes it harder for non-technical researchers to conduct Wizard-of-Oz experiments. In this paper, we present a general and easy-to-use tool for the Pepper robot, one of the most commonly used robots in this context. While we provide the concrete interface for Pepper robots only, the system architecture is independent of the type of robot and can be adapted for other robots. A configuration file, which saves experiment-specific parameters, enables a quick setup for reproducible and repeatable Wizard-of-Oz experiments. A central server provides a graphical interface {\textless}italic{\textgreater}via{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} a browser while handling the mapping of user input to actions on the robot. In our interface, keyboard shortcuts may be assigned to phrases, gestures, and composite behaviors to simplify and speed up control of the robot.

The interface, including source code, is made commonly available, and we hope that it will be useful for researchers with any background who want to conduct HRI experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {An understanding of how humans and robots can successfully interact to accomplish speciﬁc tasks is crucial in creating more sophisticated robots that may eventually become an integral part of human societies. A social robot needs to be able to learn the preferences and capabilities of the people with whom it interacts so that it can adapt its behaviors for more efﬁcient and friendly interaction. Advances in human–computer interaction technologies have been widely used in improving human–robot interaction (HRI). It is now possible to interact with robots via natural communication means such as speech. In this paper, an innovative approach for HRI via voice-controllable intelligent user interfaces is described. The design and implementation of such interfaces are described. The traditional approaches for human–robot user interface design are explained and the advantages of the proposed approach are presented. The designed intelligent user interface, which learns user preferences and capabilities in time, can be controlled with voice. The system was successfully implemented and tested on a Pioneer 3-AT mobile robot. 20 participants, who were assessed on spatial reasoning ability, directed the robot in spatial navigation tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of the voice control in HRI. Time to complete the task, number of steps, and errors were collected. Results indicated that spatial reasoning ability and voice-control were reliable predictors of efﬁciency of robot teleoperation. 75\% of the subjects with high spatial reasoning ability preferred using voice-control over manual control. The effect of spatial reasoning ability in teleoperation with voice-control was lower compared to that of manual control.},

Human Robot Collaboration (HRC) is able to bring about this balance by combining the benefits of manual assembly and robotic automation. When introducing a hybrid concept, safety and human acceptance are of vital importance for achieving implementation. Fenceless coexistence may lead to discomfort of operators especially in cases where close Human Robot Interaction (HRI) occurs. This work aims at designing and implementing a natural Human-System and System-Human interaction framework that enables seamless interaction between operators and their “robot colleagues”. This natural interaction will strengthen hybrid implementation through increased: a) operator’s and system’s awareness, b) operator’s trust to the system, and through the decrease of: a) human errors and b) safety incidents. The overall architecture of the proposed system makes it scalable, flexible, and applicable in different collaborative scenarios by enabling the connectivity of multiple interfaces with customizable environments according to operator’s needs. The performance of the system is evaluated on a scenario originating from the automotive industry proving that an intuitive interaction framework can increase acceptance and performance of both robots and operators.},

While end-user robot programming methods such as kinesthetic teaching have introduced direct approaches to task demonstration that allow users to avoid working with traditional programming constructs, our formative study revealed that everyday people still have difficulties in specifying effective robot programs using these methods due to challenges in understanding robot kinematics and programming without situated context and assistive system feedback. These findings informed our development of Demoshop, an interactive robot programming tool that includes user-centric programming aids to help end-users author and edit task demonstrations. To evaluate the effectiveness of Demoshop, we conducted a user study comparing task performance and user experience associated with using Demoshop relative to a widely used commercial baseline interface. Results of our study indicate that users have greater task efficiency while authoring robot programs and maintain stronger mental models of the system when using Demoshop compared to the baseline interface. Our system implementation and study have implications for the further development of assistance in end-user robot programming.},

However, the adoption of this kind of technology has been limited by the complexity of robot manipulation tasks and the difficulty in controlling a multiple-DOF arm using a joystick or a similar device. Motivated by this need, we present an assistive vision-based interface for robot manipulation. Our proposal is to replace the direct joystick motor control interface present in a commercial wheelchair mounted assistive robotic manipulator with a human-robot interface based on visual selection. The scene in front of the robot is shown on a screen, and the user can then select an object with our novel grasping interface. We develop computer vision and motion control methods that drive the robot to that object. Our aim is not to replace user control, but instead augment user capabilities through our system with different levels of semi-autonomy, while leaving the user with a sense that he/she is in control of the task. Two disabled pilot users, were involved at different stages of our research. The first pilot user during the interface design along with rehab experts. The second performed user studies along with an 8 subject control group to evaluate our interface. Our system reduces robot instruction from a 6-DOF task in continuous space to either a 2-DOF pointing task or a discrete selection task among objects detected by computer vision.},
