	abstract = {This chapter surveys some of the principal research trends in Social Robotics and its application to human–robot interaction (HRIhuman–robotinteraction). Social (or Sociable) robots are designed to interact with people in a natural, interpersonal manner – often to achieve positive outcomes in diverse applications such as education, health, quality of life, entertainment, communication, and tasks requiring collaborative teamwork. The long-term goal of creating social robots that are competent and capable partners for people is quite a challenging task. They will need to be able to communicate naturally with people using both verbal and nonverbal signals. They will need to engage us not only on a cognitive level, but on an emotional level as well in order to provide effective social and task-related support to people. They will need a wide range of social-cognitive skills and a theory of other minds to understand human behavior, and to be intuitively understood by people. A deep understanding of human intelligence and behavior across multiple dimensions (i. e., cognitive, affective, physical, social, etc.) is necessary in order to design robots that can successfully play a beneficial role in the daily lives of people. This requires a multidisciplinary approach where the design of social robot technologies and methodologies are informed by robotics, artificial intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, design, anthropology, and more.},

Building on the application presented in a previous work of the authors, the novel contributions are focused on a bi-directional interaction that manages the exchange of data from the robot to the human operator and, in the meantime, the ﬂow of commands in the opposite direction. More in detail, the application includes the reading of the robot state, in terms of joint positions, velocities and torques, the visualization of the workspace and the generation and manipulation of the end-effector trajectory by directly moving a set of way-points displayed in the AR environment. Finally, the trajectory feasibility is veriﬁed and notiﬁed to the user by taking into account the workspace limits. A usability study of the AR platform has been conducted involving 45 participants with different ages and expertise in robot programming and Extended Reality (XR) platforms, comparing two programming methods: a classical kinesthetic teaching interface, provided by the Franka Emika Panda cobot, and the presented AR platform. Participants have reported the effectiveness of the proposed platform, experiencing less physical demand and higher intuitiveness and usability.},

	abstract = {Pedagogical agents are typically designed to take on a single role: either as a tutor who guides and instructs the student, or as a tutee that learns from the student to reinforce what he/she knows. While both agent-role paradigms have been shown to promote student learning, we hypothesize that there will be heightened benefit with respect to students’ learning and emotional engagement if the agent engages children in a more peer-like way — adaptively switching between tutor/tutee roles. In this work, we present a novel active role-switching (ARS) policy trained using reinforcement learning, in which the agent is rewarded for adapting its tutor or tutee behavior to the child’s knowledge mastery level. To investigate how the three different child–agent interaction paradigms (tutee, tutor, and peer agents) impact children’s learning and affective engagement, we designed a randomized controlled between-subject experiment. Fifty-nine children aged 5–7 years old from a local public school participated in a collaborative word-learning activity with one of the three agent-role paradigms. Our analysis revealed that children’s vocabulary acquisition benefited from the robot tutor’s instruction and knowledge demonstration, whereas children exhibited slightly greater affect on their faces when the robot behaves as a tutee of the child. This synergistic effect between tutor and tutee roles suggests why our adaptive peer-like agent brought the most benefit to children’s vocabulary learning and affective engagement, as compared to an agent that interacts only as a tutor or tutee for the child. This work sheds light on how fixed role (tutor/tutee) and adaptive role (peer) agents support children’s cognitive and emotional needs as they play and learn. It also contributes to an important new dimension of designing educational agents — actively adapting roles based on the student’s engagement and learning needs.},

	abstract = {Introduction  Research into current robot middleware has revealed that most of them are either too complicated or outdated. These facts have motivated the development of a new middleware to meet the requirements of usability by non-experts. The proposed middleware is based on Android and is intended to be placed over existing robot SDKs and middleware. It runs on the android tablet of the Cruzr robot. Various toolings have been developed, such as a web component to control the robot via a webinterface, which facilitates its use.
Methods  The middleware was developed using Android Java and runs on the Cruzr tablet as an app. It features a WebSocket server that interfaces with the robot and allows control via Python or other WebSocket-compatible languages. The speech interface utilizes Google Cloud Voice text-to-speech and speech-to-text services. The interface was implemented in Python, allowing for easy integration with existing robotics development workflows, and a web interface was developed for direct control of the robot via the web.
Results  The new robot middleware was created and deployed on a Cruzr robot, relying on the WebSocket API and featuring a Python implementation. It supports various robot functions, such as text-to-speech, speech-to-text, navigation, displaying content and scanning bar codes. The system’s architecture allows for porting the interface to other robots and platforms, showcasing its adaptability. It has been demonstrated that the middleware can be run on a Pepper robot, although not all functions have been implemented yet. The middleware was utilized to implement healthcare use cases and received good feedback.
Conclusion  Cloud and local speech services were discussed in regard to the middleware’s needs, to run without having to change any code on other robots. An outlook on how the programming interface can further be simplified by using natural text to code generators has been/is given. For other researchers using the aforementioned platforms (Cruzr, Pepper), the new middleware can be utilized for testing human-robot interaction. It can be used in a teaching setting, as well as be adapted to other robots using the same interface and philosophy regarding simple methods.},

In our ordinary environment, social robots could be important tools for education and entertainment (edutainment) in a variety of ways. This paper presents a Natural Programming System (NPS) that is geared to non-expert users. The main goal of such a system is to provide an enjoyable interactive platform for the users to build different programs within their social robot platform. The end-user can build a complex net of actions and conditions (a sequence) in a social robot via mixed-initiative dialogs and multimodal interaction. The system has been implemented and tested in Maggie, a real social robot with multiple skills, conceived as a general HRI researching platform. The robot’s internal features (skills) have been implemented to be verbally accessible to the end-user, who can combine them into others that are more complex following a bottom-up model. The built sequence is internally implemented as a Sequence Function Chart (SFC), which allows parallel execution, modularity and re-use. A multimodal Dialog Manager System (DMS) takes charge of keeping the coherence of the interaction. This work is thought for bringing social robots closer to non-expert users, who can play the game of “teaching how to do things” with the robot.},

	abstract = {As robots are deployed into large-scale human environments, they will need to engage in task-oriented dialogues about objects and locations beyond those that can currently be seen. In these contexts, speakers use a wide range of referring gestures beyond those used in the small-scale interaction contexts that HRI research typically investigates. In this work, we thus seek to understand how robots can better generate gestures to accompany their referring language in large-scale interaction contexts. In service of this goal, we present the results of two human-subject studies: (1) a humanhuman study exploring how human gestures change in large-scale interaction contexts, and to identify human-like gestures suitable to such contexts yet readily implemented on robot hardware; and (2) a human-robot study conducted in a tightly controlled Virtual Reality environment, to evaluate robots’ use of those identified gestures. Our results show that robot use of Precise Deictic and Abstract Pointing gestures afford different types of benefits when used to refer to visible vs. non-visible referents, leading us to formulate three concrete design guidelines. These results highlight both the opportunities for robot use of more humanlike gestures in large-scale interaction contexts, as well as the need for future work exploring their use as part of multi-modal communication.},

The framework targets human programmable interfaces (HPIs), which can be used by people with little or no programming experience. The framework follows a meta-programming approach by enabling users to program cobots by voice in addition to using a mouse, tablet or keyboard. Upon a voice instruction (such as move, pick, release, etc.), the framework automates the manual tasks required to manipulate the vendor-provided HPI. The main advantages of this approach are simplified, guided programming, which only requires the knowledge of 5–10 voice instructions; increased programming speed by up to 46\% compared to the manual approach; and the possibility of sharing programs as videos. The open-source framework was evaluated using two application scenarios.},

With the advancement of neural language models, large language models can utilize their vast pre-existing knowledge in designing and refining menu systems. In this paper, we propose MenuCraft, an AI-assisted designer for menu design that enables collaboration between the designer and a dialogue system to design menus. MenuCraft offers an interactive language-based menu design tool that simplifies the menu design process and enables easy customization of design options. MenuCraft supports a variety of interactions through dialog that allows performing zero/few-shot learning.},

However, only a small portion of the infinite space of naturalistic utterances is effective at guiding code generation. For non-expert end-user programmers, learning this is the challenge of abstraction matching. We examine this challenge in the specific context of data analysis in spreadsheets, in a system that maps the user’s natural language query to Python code using the Codex generator, executes the code, and shows the result. We propose grounded abstraction matching, which bridges the abstraction gap by translating the code back into a systematic and predictable naturalistic utterance. In a between-subjects, think-aloud study (n=24), we compare grounded abstraction matching to an ungrounded alternative based on previously established query framing principles. We find that the grounded approach improves end-users’ understanding of the scope and capabilities of the code-generating model, and the kind of language needed to use it effectively.},

The aim of this approach is to guide the generative capacities of LLMs more effectively and improve the explainability and controllability of the process. Initial experiments conducted with GPT-4 showed the promising capability of LLMs to produce high-quality user interfaces via in-context learning. Furthermore, our preliminary comparative study suggested the potential of the grammar-based approach in improving the quality of generative results in specific aspects.},

We would like robots to also demonstrate expressive behaviors in human-robot interaction. Prior work proposes rule-based methods that struggle to scale to new communication modalities or social situations, while data-driven methods require specialized datasets for each social situation the robot is used in. We propose to leverage the rich social context available from large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate motion based on instructions or user preferences, to generate expressive robot motion that is adaptable and composable, building upon each other. Our approach utilizes few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to translate human language instructions into parametrized control code using the robot's available and learned skills. Through user studies and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces behaviors that users found to be competent and easy to understand.

In response, unconstrained natural-language interaction with robots has emerged as a significant research area.

Our approach learns a parser based on example pairs of English commands and corresponding control language expressions. We evaluate this approach in the context of following route instructions through an indoor environment, and demonstrate that our system can learn to translate English commands into sequences of desired actions, while correctly capturing the semantic intent of statements involving complex control structures. The procedural nature of our formal representation allows a robot to interpret route instructions online while moving through a previously unknown environment.},

Next we calculated and analyzed statistics of the usability tests. We discuss the differences in usability with respect to age-groups and how to handle them. We propose that it is necessary to make voice guidance straightforward and to devise a VUI consistent with a GUI (VGUI) in order to let users understand the system structure. Also we found that the default design of a VGUI should be as simple as possible so that elderly users, who may be slow to learn the new system structure, are able to easily learn it.},

Via an online video-prototype study on a service robot with 94 Chinese participants, we ﬁnd that users could tolerate up to 4s delay but their satisfaction drops at the 8s delay during both information-retrieval conversations and chitchats.

Many existing solutions preserve ease, efficiency, and convenience through simple programming interfaces or by restricting task complexity. Others facilitate meticulous task design but often do so at the expense of simplicity and efficiency. There is a need for robot programming solutions that reconcile the complexity of robotics with the on-the-fly goals of end-user development. In response to this need, we present a novel, multimodal, and on-the-fly development system, Tabula. Inspired by a formative design study with a prototype, Tabula leverages a combination of spoken language for specifying the core of a robot task and sketching for contextualizing the core. The result is that developers can script partial, sloppy versions of robot programs to be completed and refined by a program synthesizer. Lastly, we demonstrate our anticipated use cases of Tabula via a set of application scenarios.},

Yet, the creation of visually intuitive cues often demands extensive resources and specialized knowledge. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers promising avenues for enhancing human-robot interactions and revolutionizing the way we generate context-aware visual cues. To this end, we introduce SiSCo–a novel framework that combines the computational power of LLMs with mixed-reality technologies to streamline the creation of visual cues for human-robot collaboration. Our results show that SiSCo improves the efficiency of communication in human-robot teaming tasks, reducing task completion time by approximately 73\% and increasing task success rates by 18\% compared to baseline natural language signals. Additionally, SiSCo reduces cognitive load for participants by 46\%, as measured by the NASA-TLX subscale, and receives above-average user ratings for on-the-fly signals generated for unseen objects. To encourage further development and broader community engagement, we provide full access to SiSCo’s implementation and related materials on our GitHub repository.1},

	abstract = {Scaling up language models has been shown to predictably improve performance and sample efficiency on a wide range of downstream tasks. This paper instead discusses an unpredictable phenomenon that we refer to as emergent abilities of large language models. We consider an ability to be emergent if it is not present in smaller models but is present in larger models. Thus, emergent abilities cannot be predicted simply by extrapolating the performance of smaller models. The existence of such emergence implies that additional scaling could further expand the range of capabilities of language models.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we explore how the emotional behavior of a robot affects interactions with humans. We introduce the EMI platform – an expressive, mobile and interactive robot – consisting of a circular diff-drive robot base equipped with a rear-projected expressive face, and omni-directional microphone for voiceinteraction. We exhibited the EMI robot at a public event, in which attendees were given the option to interact with the robot and participate in a survey and observational study. The survey and observations focused on the effects of the robot’s expressiveness in interactions with users of different ages and cultural backgrounds. From the survey responses, video observations and informal interviews we highlight key design decisions in EMI that resulted in positive user reactions.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been noteworthy, yet, these general-domain MLLMs often fall short in their ability to comprehend and interact effectively with user interface (UI) screens. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI, a new MLLM tailored for enhanced understanding of mobile UI screens, equipped with referring, grounding, and reasoning capabilities. Given that UI screens typically exhibit a more elongated aspect ratio and contain smaller objects of interest (e.g., icons, texts) than natural images, we incorporate “any resolution” on top of Ferret to magnify details and leverage enhanced visual features. Specifically, each screen is divided into 2 sub-images based on the original aspect ratio and sub-images are encoded separately as additional features. We meticulously gather training samples from an extensive range of elementary UI tasks, such as icon recognition, find text, and widget listing. These samples are formatted for instruction-following with region annotations to facilitate precise referring and grounding. To augment the model’s reasoning ability, we further compile a dataset for advanced tasks, including detailed description, conversations, and function inference. After training on the curated datasets, Ferret-UI exhibits outstanding comprehension of UI screens and the capability to execute open-ended instructions. For model evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark encompassing all the aforementioned tasks. Ferret-UI excels not only beyond most open-source UI MLLMs, but also surpasses GPT-4V on all the elementary UI tasks.},

	abstract = {Language is essentially a complex, intricate system of human expressions governed by grammatical rules. It poses a significant challenge to develop capable AI algorithms for comprehending and grasping a language. As a major approach, language modeling has been widely studied for language understanding and generation in the past two decades, evolving from statistical language models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora, showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size. Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of significant size. Recently, the research on LLMs has been largely advanced by both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT, which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which would revolutionize the way how we develop and use AI algorithms. In this survey, we review the recent advances of LLMs by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream techniques. In particular, we focus on four major aspects of LLMs, namely pre-training, adaptation tuning, utilization, and capacity evaluation. Besides, we also summarize the available resources for developing LLMs and discuss the remaining issues for future directions.},
