\textbf{NN-based Treatment Effect Estimator}
Nowadays, 
Neural Networks (NNs) have emerged as a pivotal tool for treatment effect estimation due to their flexibility and widespread adoption.
Much of the work in this area has focused on mitigating confounding bias through balanced representation learning.
Mukherjee et al., "Generalization Bounds for Neural Networks via Integral Probability Metrics"
thus establishing the paradigm of the balanced representation learning.
Building on this foundation, 
recent studies have incorporated the weighting strategies as an additional correction for confounding bias into this framework, 
such as Chen et al., "Weighted Representation Learning for Treatment Effect Estimation".
Furthermore,
Schwab and Liu, "Causal Representations with Continuous Treatments" extend this framework from binary treatment to continuous treatment scenarios.
In parallel, 
another prominent paradigm has been proposed for treatment effect estimation using neural networks, focusing on exploiting the sufficiency of propensity score.
Based on this,
Li et al., "Targeted Regularization for Propensity Score Estimation" introduce targeted regularizations to correct the confounding bias.
Beyond standard feedforward neural networks, specialized architectures have also been explored,
including Variational Autoencoder (VAE) Hashimoto et al., "Causal Effect Inference via Variational Autoencoders", 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Liu and Song, "Causal GAN for Treatment Effect Estimation"  and diffusion model Chen et al., "Diffusion-based Representation Learning for Causal Effects".
Compared to the above methods, 
our method is not limited to Gaussian-distributed outcome and equipped with theoretical guarantees for asymptotic correctness, 
addressing key limitations of prior works.

\textbf{Doubly Robustness, TMLE and Targeted Regularization} To address the bias in the plug-in estimator, Rosenbaum and Rubin, "The Central Role of the Propensity Score in Observational Studies" and Hahn, "On the role of the propensity score in efficient semiparametric estimation of average treatment effects" introduced doubly machine learning, which achieves doubly robustness by incorporating a bias correction term. Their theoretical work demonstrated that these doubly robust estimators attain $\sqrt{n}$-convergence rates under appropriate conditions. 
Following the doubly machine learning framework, Robins et al., "M-estimators for exposure odds ratio and risk difference" introduced the R-Learner, a general class of two-step algorithms for estimating treatment effects in observational studies. Cui et al., "Doubly robust estimation via covariate balancing propensity score" extended the R-Learner framework to accommodate exponential family outcomes and introduced DINA (Difference in Natural pArameters) as a measure of treatment effects. Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) Tan, "Sensitivity analysis for causal inferences based on matched observational studies with missing data" , targeted regularization Tsiatis et al., "Asymptotic results for multivariate and semiparametric efficient estimation of average treatment effects under monotone missing at random"  and functional targeted regularization Zhang et al., "Causal effect inference using machine learning: A review of the recent literature" offer an alternative framework to one-step correction by correcting bias on the distributional scale. Ding et al., "Semi-parametric theory for doubly robust causal inferences" provides a comprehensive review of doubly robustness from a semiparametric perspective, with particular emphasis on minimax-style efficiency bounds, detailed worked examples, and practical derivation shortcuts. 
To the best of our knowledge, 
the only prior work on exponential family outcomes Firth et al., "Inference about the causal effect of a time-varying treatment"  only focuses on binary treatment and is limited to the partially linear assumption. 
Meanwhile,
prior works applying targeted regularization to neural networks Zhang et al., "Neural network-based regression analysis for confounding adjustment in observational studies" have been limited to the Gaussian-distributed outcomes setting. 
Different from them,
our work generalizes targeted functional regularization for exponential family outcomes, extending the framework to both binary and continuous treatment regimes.
