\textbf{Examples of iterative sketch completion.}
After the initial sketch completion, the user can keep the strokes generated in the first completion and (a) edit the sketch or (b) update the input prompt .
Then, our method will complete the sketch once again to add more details.
(The blue and green line denotes the input partial sketch of the first and second iteration, respectively.)
