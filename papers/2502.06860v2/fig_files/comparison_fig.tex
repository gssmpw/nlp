\textbf{Comparision with existing methods.} 
Given (a) the input partial sketch and the stylized prompt, (b) the results generated by ControlNet LineArt often do not accurately depict the content of the input prompt.
(c) ControlNet Scribble generates completed sketches with more details of the input prompt compared to ControlNet LineArt, but the partial sketches are sometimes missing, and the styles deviate significantly from those of the input partial sketches.
(d) Completed sketches generated by the first stage of our method accurately represent the contents of the input prompts, but the styles are inconsistent.
(e) Our full method further adjusts the styles of all strokes to match the styles of the partial sketches.
