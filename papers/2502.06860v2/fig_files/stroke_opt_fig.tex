\textbf{Overview of stroke optimization.} 
Given (a) the user-provided partial sketch and (b) the guidance image generated by the conditional T2I model, our method (c) iteratively updates the position, opacity, and width of each stroke.
This ensures that the resulting style-agnostic completed sketch is in visual alignment with the guidance image but does not overlap with the user-provided partial sketch.
