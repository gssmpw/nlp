\textbf{Overview of our method.}
Given a user-provided prompt $\inputprompt$ and a partial sketch $\inputsketch$, our method first (a) stylizes the input prompt by augmenting it using style descriptions generated by the VLM (\textbf{bold text}).
Using the stylized prompt $\finalprompt$, the method then performs (b) stroke optimization to generate strokes that fill the missing regions, thus ensuring that the style-agnostic completed sketch $\intermediatesketch$ can fully represents the content of the user-provided prompt.
To align the styles of $\intermediatesketch$ and $\inputsketch$, we (c) instruct the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that modifies the strokes of $\intermediatesketch$.
Finally, we obtain a final completed sketch $\completesketch$ wherein the styles of the strokes are aligned to those of the $\inputsketch$.
