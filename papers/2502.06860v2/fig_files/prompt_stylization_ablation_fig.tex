\textbf{Prompt stylization ablation study example.} 
(a) The guidance image generated using the partial sketch and the original input prompt, which lacks style descriptions, does not align with the style of the partial sketch. 
Thus, our method could not then generate a final completed sketch that accurately depicted the complete content and the desired style.
(b) In contrast, use of a stylized prompt created a guidance image that was consistent with the style, leading to a more completed sketch.
(The \textbf{bold text} in the prompt are style descriptions generated by the VLM.)
