\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\input{fig_files/limitation_fig}
\paragraph{Reliance on large pretrained models.}
Our method uses two pretrained models: ControlNet to generate the guidance images and a VLM to stylize input prompt and create the style adjustment code.
It is thus inevitable that these models may occasionally generate unsatisfied results.
For example, as shown in~\cref{fig:limitation}(a), when the guidance image lacks the content specified in the input prompt, our method cannot generate strokes that accurately depict the desired content.
Also, the style adjustment code generated by the VLM may not accurately adjust the strokes to represent the content and preserve the style, even when the guidance image is clear (\cref{fig:limitation}(b)).

\paragraph{Non-interactive generation.}
Our method allows users to simply co-create sketches using machine learning methods.
However, currently, stroke optimization and adjustment code generation require a few minute.
This limitation hinders our ability to provide users with interactive feedback and completed sketch.
In the future, we will explore multi-scale stroke optimization, which will allow us to provide users with previews and enable interactive sketch completion.
