\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce \methodName, a style-aware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles by leveraging both the recognition and generation capabilities of a pretrained  vision-language model (VLM).
Our method allows users to provide only a partial sketch,  and our method will complete missing content specified in the input prompt by optimizing strokes and stroke style adjustment.
We demonstrate that the style descriptions extracted by the VLM from the partial sketch enable our method to accurately complete the sketch, reflecting both the intended content and the style in the input partial sketch.
Extensive experiment results indicate our method is effective across various sketch scenarios.
