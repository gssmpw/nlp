However, both of them cannot directly capture word connections in a sentence, which is important for dependency parsing given its goal is to establish dependency relations between words. In this paper, we propose to implicitly capture word connections from unlabeled data by a word ordering model with self-attention mechanism. Experiments show that these implicit word connections do improve our parsing model. Furthermore, by combining with a pre-trained language model, our model gets state-of-the-art performance on the English PTB dataset, achieving 96.35{\%} UAS and 95.25{\%} LAS.",

Most of their methods take dependency-tree labels as input features for NER model training. However, such dependency information is not inherently provided in most NER corpora, making the methods with low usability in practice. To effectively exploit the potential of word-dependency knowledge, motivated by the success of Multi-Task Learning on cross-domain NER, we investigate a novel NER learning method incorporating cross-domain Dependency Parsing (DP) as its auxiliary learning task. Then, considering the high consistency of word-dependency relations across domains, we present an unsupervised domain-adapted method to transfer word-dependency knowledge from high-resource domains to low-resource ones. With the help of cross-domain DP to bridge different domains, both useful cross-domain and cross-task knowledge can be learned by our model to considerably benefit cross-domain NER. To make better use of the cross-task knowledge between NER and DP, we unify both tasks in a shared network architecture for joint learning, using Maximum Mean Discrepancy(MMD). Finally, through extensive experiments, we show our proposed method can not only effectively take advantage of word-dependency knowledge, but also significantly outperform other Multi-Task Learning methods on cross-domain NER.

abstract = {In this thesis we develop a discriminative learning method for dependency parsing using online large-margin training combined with spanning tree inference algorithms. We will show that this method provides state-of-the-art accuracy, is extensible through the feature set and can be implemented efficiently. Furthermore, we display the language independent nature of the method by evaluating it on over a dozen diverse languages as well as show its practical applicability through integration into a sentence compression system. We start by presenting an online large-margin learning framework that is a generalization of the work of Crammer and Singer [34, 37] to structured outputs, such as sequences and parse trees. This will lead to the heart of this thesis---discriminative dependency parsing. Here we will formulate dependency parsing in a spanning tree framework, yielding efficient parsing algorithms for both projective and non-projective tree structures. We will then extend the parsing algorithm to incorporate features over larger substructures without an increase in computational complexity for the projective case. Unfortunately, the non-projective problem then becomes NP-hard so we provide structurally motivated approximate algorithms. Having defined a set of parsing algorithms, we will also define a rich feature set and train various parsers using the online large-margin learning framework. We then compare our trained dependency parsers to other state-of-the-art parsers on 14 diverse languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, German, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. Having built an efficient and accurate discriminative dependency parser, this thesis will then turn to improving and applying the parser. First we will show how additional resources can provide useful features to increase parsing accuracy and to adapt parsers to new domains. We will also argue that the robustness of discriminative inference-based learning algorithms lend themselves well to dependency parsing when feature representations or structural constraints do not allow for tractable parsing algorithms. Finally, we integrate our parsing models into a state-of-the-art sentence compression system to show its applicability to a real world problem.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

Its improved translation performance on low resource languages hints at potential cross-lingual transfer capability for downstream tasks. In this paper, we evaluate the cross-lingual effectiveness of representations from the encoder of a massively multilingual NMT model on 5 downstream classification and sequence labeling tasks covering a diverse set of over 50 languages. We compare against a strong baseline, multilingual BERT (mBERT) (Devlin et al. 2018), in different cross-lingual transfer learning scenarios and show gains in zero-shot transfer in 4 out of these 5 tasks.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={05}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Siddhant, Aditya and Johnson, Melvin and Tsai, Henry and Ari, Naveen and Riesa, Jason and Bapna, Ankur and Firat, Orhan and Raman, Karthik}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={8854-8861} }

Recent approaches use training data only in a resource-rich language (such as English) to fine-tune large-scale cross-lingual pre-trained language models, which transfer knowledge from resource-rich languages (source) to low-resource languages (target). Due to the big difference between languages, the model fine-tuned only by the source language may not perform well for target languages. In our study, we make an interesting observation that while the top 1 result predicted by the previous approaches may often fail to hit the ground-truth answer, there are still good chances for the correct answer to be contained in the set of top k predicted results. Intuitively, the previous approaches have empowered the model certain level of capability to roughly distinguish good answers from bad ones. However, without sufficient training data, it is not powerful enough to capture the nuances between the accurate answer and those approximate ones. Based on this observation, we develop a two-stage approach to enhance the model performance. The first stage targets at recall; we design a hard-learning (HL) algorithm to maximize the likelihood that the top k predictions contain the accurate answer. The second stage focuses on precision, where an answer-aware contrastive learning (AA-CL) mechanism is developed to learn the minute difference between the accurate answer and other candidates. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines on two cross-lingual MRC benchmark datasets.}, number={10}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Chen, Nuo and Shou, Linjun and Gong, Ming and Pei, Jian}, year={2022}, month={Jun.}, pages={10501-10508} }

In this paper, we propose Cross-Lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) task for the languages other than English. Firstly, we present several back-translation approaches for CLMRC task which is straightforward to adopt. However, to exactly align the answer into source language is difficult and could introduce additional noise. In this context, we propose a novel model called Dual BERT, which takes advantage of the large-scale training data provided by rich-resource language (such as English) and learn the semantic relations between the passage and question in bilingual context, and then utilize the learned knowledge to improve reading comprehension performance of low-resource language. We conduct experiments on two Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets CMRC 2018 and DRCD. The results show consistent and significant improvements over various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, which demonstrate the potentials in CLMRC task.

abstract = {Lack of training data in low-resource languages presents huge challenges to sequence labeling tasks such as named entity recognition (NER) and machine reading comprehension (MRC). One major obstacle is the errors on the boundary of predicted answers. To tackle this problem, we propose CalibreNet, which predicts answers in two steps. In the first step, any existing sequence labeling method can be adopted as a base model to generate an initial answer. In the second step, CalibreNet refines the boundary of the initial answer. To tackle the challenge of lack of training data in low-resource languages, we dedicatedly develop a novel unsupervised phrase boundary recovery pre-training task to enhance the multilingual boundary detection capability of CalibreNet. Experiments on two cross-lingual benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach achieves SOTA results on zero-shot cross-lingual NER and MRC tasks.},

However, since word order variances generally exist in different languages, cross-lingual models that overfit into the word order of the source language could have sub-optimal performance in target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that reducing the word order information fitted into the models can improve the adaptation performance in target languages. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce several methods to make models encode less word order information of the source language and test them based on cross-lingual word embeddings and the pre-trained multilingual model. Experimental results on three sequence labeling tasks (i.e., part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and slot filling tasks) show that reducing word order information injected into the model can achieve better zero-shot cross-lingual performance. Further analysis illustrates that fitting excessive or insufficient word order information into the model results in inferior cross-lingual performance. Moreover, our proposed methods can also be applied to strong cross-lingual models and further improve their performance.}, number={15}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Liu, Zihan and Winata, Genta I and Cahyawijaya, Samuel and Madotto, Andrea and Lin, Zhaojiang and Fung, Pascale}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={13461-13469} }

However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.",

abstract = {One of the effective approaches for answering natural language questions (NLQs) over knowledge graphs consists of two main stages. It first creates a query graph based on the NLQ and then matches this graph over the knowledge graph to construct a structured query. An obstacle in the first stage is the need to build question interpretations with candidate resources, even if some implicit phrases exist in the sentence. In the second stage, a serious problem is to map diverse NLQ relations to their corresponding predicates. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel sequential word parsing-based method to construct and refine an uncertain question graph that is disambiguated directly over the knowledge graph. Instead of relying on the syntactic dependency relations and some predefined rules that recognize the relations and their arguments, we consider the identified entities and variables in the NLQ as well as their corresponding place in the structure of a query graph pattern to build question triples. First, by leveraging the ordered dependency tree of an NLQ, sentence words are reordered. Then the question graph structure is constructed by parsing the new sequence backward, starting from the identified items. Subsequently, the question graph is refined by eliminating the useless elements. Additionally, to improve the relation similarity measure in the graph similarity process, we exploit the knowledge hidden in a relation pattern taxonomy. Experimental studies over several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective as it achieves promising results in answering the complex NLQs.}

In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific task and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with understanding beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs and outputs, then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a range of linguistic tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in this direction, we present the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE, gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset for probing models for understanding of specific linguistic phenomena, and an online platform for evaluating and comparing models. For some benchmark tasks, training data is plentiful, but for others it is limited or does not match the genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models that can represent linguistic knowledge in a way that facilitates sample-efficient learning and effective knowledge-transfer across tasks. While none of the datasets in GLUE were created from scratch for the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held test data, which is used to ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate baselines that use ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique, as well as state-of-the-art sentence representation models. The best models still achieve fairly low absolute scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields similarly weak performance over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.",

To address this challenge, some recent efforts of cross-lingual MRC employ machine translation to transfer knowledge from English to other languages, through either explicit alignment or implicit attention. For effective knowledge transition, it is beneficial to leverage both semantic and syntactic information. However, the existing methods fail to explicitly incorporate syntax information in model learning. Consequently, the models are not robust to errors in alignment and noises in attention. In this work, we propose a novel approach, which jointly models the cross-lingual alignment information and the mono-lingual syntax information using a graph. We develop a series of algorithms, including graph construction, learning, and pre-training. The experiments on two benchmark datasets for cross-lingual MRC show that our approach outperforms all strong baselines, which verifies the effectiveness of syntax information for cross-lingual MRC.}, number={11}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Xu, Zenan and Shou, Linjun and Pei, Jian and Gong, Ming and Su, Qinliang and Quan, Xiaojun and Jiang, Daxin}, year={2023}, month={Jun.}, pages={13861-13868} }

We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce Markov chains that mix faster between modes. Consequently, mixing between modes would be more efficient at higher levels of representation.  To better understand this, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels.  The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing between modes and interpolating between samples.}

However, since word order variances generally exist in different languages, cross-lingual models that overfit into the word order of the source language could have sub-optimal performance in target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that reducing the word order information fitted into the models can improve the adaptation performance in target languages. To verify this hypothesis, we introduce several methods to make models encode less word order information of the source language and test them based on cross-lingual word embeddings and the pre-trained multilingual model. Experimental results on three sequence labeling tasks (i.e., part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and slot filling tasks) show that reducing word order information injected into the model can achieve better zero-shot cross-lingual performance. Further analysis illustrates that fitting excessive or insufficient word order information into the model results in inferior cross-lingual performance. Moreover, our proposed methods can also be applied to strong cross-lingual models and further improve their performance.}, number={15}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Liu, Zihan and Winata, Genta I and Cahyawijaya, Samuel and Madotto, Andrea and Lin, Zhaojiang and Fung, Pascale}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={13461-13469} }
