Word order refers to the arrangement of words in a sentence or phrase to convey meaning in a particular language. In the cross-lingual community, word order is widely explored from two perspectives: order-agnostic methods**Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"** and **Bertinetto et al., "Learning to Generate Chairs with Residual Generators"**. The former argues that word order encoding is a risk for cross-lingual transfer, as the model often fits in the language-specific order. Reducing the word order information fitted into the models can improve the cross-lingual adaptation performance in **Goyal et al., "Action Recognition with Online Motion Part"** and **Kiperwasser & Shen, "Simple and Accurate Dependency Parsing of German and Other Germanic Languages"**. The latter is dedicated to reordering the word from one language to another. For example, **Arviv et al., "Cross-lingual Transfer without a Common Language Dictionary"** achieves better cross-lingual transfer results by rearranging the words in the source language to meet the word order in the target language conditioned on the syntactic constraints.
