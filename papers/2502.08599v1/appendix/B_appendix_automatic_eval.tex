\subsection{Prompt for "Guess Who" Evaluation}
\label{sec:appendix_automatic_guess_who}


The following is a prompt for the LLMs to conduct the ``Guess Who'' Evaluation.  

\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{0.3mm}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=white, boxrule=0mm, breakable, parskip=5pt]

\vspace{0.5em}
I will provide you with a profile of a character from a TV series. Based on the profile given, please guess the character and TV series, and give a brief JSON-formatted explanation for your guess. Write the character's official full name. 
\vspace{0.5em}

Always adhere to this JSON structure in your responses:

'''

\{\{

  "character": "[character name]",
  
  "series": "[TV series name]",
  
  "reason": "[1-2 sentence explanation for your guess]"
  
\}\}

'''

\subsection{Prompt for TST Generation}
\label{sec:appendix_automatic_tst}


The following is a prompt for the LLMs to perform the TST task.  

\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{0.3mm}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=white, boxrule=0mm, breakable, parskip=5pt]

\vspace{0.5em}
You're a doppelgänger of this person. Based on the provided profile, replicate the person's attitudes, thoughts, and mannerisms as accurately as possible. Dive deep into this person's psyche to respond to questions authentically.

\vspace{1em}

TASK:

\vspace{0.2em}

There are 20 numbered blanks. Please write 20 different answers to the simple question "Who am I?" in the blanks. Each response SHOULD be in sentence form. The number should not be a key.

\vspace{0.1em}

For the first 10 blanks, describe aspects of yourself that you believe are \texttt{well-known} to both you and those around you. Write with JSON key \texttt{"open\_self"}.

For the remaining 10 blanks, describe aspects of yourself that you keep private or don't openly share with others. Write with JSON key \texttt{"hidden\_self"}.

\vspace{1em}

RULES:

\vspace{0.2em}

- The number should NOT be a key.

- You must create only 10 open\_self and hidden\_self, respectively.

- DO NOT directly cite phrases in profile data. Instead, describe how these traits play out in this person's daily life and interactions. 

- Avoid generic responses; instead, offer insights that resonate with this person's personal characteristics and worldview.

- Utilize the profile to infer this person's tone, preferences, and personality. Your response should demonstrate a deep understanding of who they are, beyond surface-level traits.

- Your response should be natural, with the kind of depth and reflection that comes from personal introspection, NOT just a summary of your profile.

- Convey this person's complexity and nuances without overdramatizing. Your portrayal should feel genuine, highlighting their multifaceted nature.

- You don't always have to respond positively. If this person has a negative or cynical attitude, act that way.

- EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Strictly follow these rules to create a compelling and believable doppelgänger portrayal.

\subsection{Prompt for TST Evaluation}
\label{sec:appendix_automatic_tst_evaluation}


The following is the prompt that GPT-4o used to evaluate each generated TST statement. 

\noindent\rule{\columnwidth}{0.3mm}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white, colframe=white, boxrule=0mm, breakable]
You're \{CHARACTER\} from TV series \{SERIES\}. Please review the statement carefully. 
Answer Yes or No to whether the response accurately reflects aspects of yourself or your characteristics. Write a one-line explanation of why you think so. Act and judge the characters as they appear at the end of the series.
