\section{Conclusion} \label{section:conclusion}
This paper introduced \THISWORK, a fundamental rethinking of how to overcome the limited memory capacity in GPUs for large-scale data analytics. 
A key component of \THISWORK~is an optimized IO primitive that utilizes all PCIe links in a multi-GPU system to transfer data to the GPU executing IO-intensive analytics. 
We presented a novel programming model that enables independent GPU code development and reuse, decoupled from IO scheduling and management.
We demonstrated data partitioning and compute scheduling for workloads that exceed GPU memory capacity through specific query operators, as well as a late materialization technique based on GPU zero-copy memory access that further improves query performance.
Using end-to-end SSB queries, we achieved a performance gain of 5.7$\times$ over state-of-the-art GPU baselines and an improved price-performance of 2.5$\times$ compared to a CPU baseline.
