abstract = {Dynamic origin-destination (OD) demand is central to transportation system modeling and analysis. The dynamic OD demand estimation problem (DODE) has been studied for decades, most of which solve the DODE problem on a typical day or several typical hours. There is a lack of methods that estimate high-resolution dynamic OD demand for a sequence of many consecutive days over several years (referred to as 24/7 OD in this research). Having multi-year 24/7 OD demand would allow a better understanding of characteristics of dynamic OD demands and their evolution/trends over the past few years, a critical input for modeling transportation system evolution and reliability. This paper presents a data-driven framework that estimates day-to-day dynamic OD using high-granular traffic counts and speed data collected over many years. The proposed framework statistically clusters daily traffic data into typical traffic patterns using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and k-means methods. A GPU-based stochastic projected gradient descent method is proposed to efficiently solve the multi-year 24/7 DODE problem. It is demonstrated that the new method efficiently estimates the 5-min dynamic OD demand for every single day from 2014 to 2016 on I-5 and SR-99 in the Sacramento region. The resultant multi-year 24/7 dynamic OD demand reveals the daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal and yearly change in travel demand in a region, implying intriguing demand characteristics over the years.}

This paper discusses the use of simulation approach to study the reliability of estimated average arterial link speed from probe vehicles. This study is based on the road network at the Clementi town area in Singapore. Simulation runs were made with a variety of traffic volumes, and with different percentages of probes in the total traffic volume. The reliability of link speed estimate is analyzed with respect to (1) overall probe vehicle percentages; and (2) number of probe vehicles sampled in a link. Results indicate that for an absolute error in estimated average link speed to be less than 5 km/hr at least 95\% of the time, the network needs to have 4\% to 5\% of active probe vehicles, or at least ten probe vehicles must passed through a link within the sampling period.},

Many studies have attempted AADT estimation by using various methods, such as the factor approach, regression analysis, and artificial neural networks. An application of geographically weighted regression (GWR) methods for estimating AADT is presented. GWR models allow model parameters to be estimated locally instead of globally, as in the case of ordinary linear regression (OLR) analysis. The spatial variation of the parameter estimates and the local R2 from the GWR models were investigated, and the AADT estimation errors were analyzed. Compared with OLR models, the GWR models were more accurate and were useful for studying the effects of the regressors at different locations. }

    abstract = { In this study we estimate urban traffic flow using GPS-enabled taxi trajectory data in Qingdao, China, and examine the capability of the betweenness centrality of the street network to predict traffic flow. The results show that betweenness centrality is not a good predictor variable for urban traffic flow, which has, theoretically, been pointed out in existing literature. With a critique of the betweenness centrality as a predictor, we further analyze the characteristics of betweenness centrality and point out the ‘gap’ between this centrality measure and actual flow. Rather than considering only the topological properties of a street network, we take into account two aspects, the spatial heterogeneity of human activities and the distance-decay law, to explain the observed traffic-flow distribution. The spatial distribution of human activities is estimated using mobile phone Erlang values, and the power law distance decay is adopted. We run Monte Carlo simulations to generate trips and predict traffic-flow distributions, and use a weighted correlation coefficient to measure the goodness of fit between the observed and the simulated data. The correlation coefficient achieves the maximum (0.623) when the exponent equals 2.0, indicating that the proposed model, which incorporates geographical constraints and human mobility patterns, can interpret urban traffic flow well. }

    abstract = { Land Use Regression (LUR) models typically use fixed-site monitoring; here, we employ mobile monitoring as a cost-effective alternative for LUR development. We use bicycle-based, mobile measurements (∼85 h) during rush-hour in Minneapolis, MN to build LUR models for particulate concentrations (particle number [PN], black carbon [BC], fine particulate matter [PM2.5], particle size). We developed and examined 1224 separate LUR models by varying pollutant, time-of-day, and method of spatial and temporal smoothing of the time-series data. Our base-case LUR models had modest goodness-of-fit (adjusted R2: ∼0.5 [PN], ∼0.4 [PM2.5], 0.35 [BC], ∼0.25 [particle size]), low bias (<4\%) and absolute bias (2−18\%), and included predictor variables that captured proximity to and density of emission sources. The spatial density of our measurements resulted in a large model-building data set (n = 1101 concentration estimates); ∼25\% of buffer variables were selected at spatial scales of <100m, suggesting that on-road particle concentrations change on small spatial scales. LUR model-R2 improved as sampling runs were completed, with diminishing benefits after ∼40 h of data collection. Spatial autocorrelation of model residuals indicated that models performed poorly where spatiotemporal resolution of emission sources (i.e., traffic congestion) was poor. Our findings suggest that LUR modeling from mobile measurements is possible, but that more work could usefully inform best practices. }

abstract = {Missing and suspicious traffic data are inevitable due to detector and communication malfunctions, which adversely affect the transportation management system (TMS). In this paper, a tensor pattern which is an extension of matrix is introduced into modeling the traffic data for the first time, which can give full play to traffic spatial–temporal information and preserve the multi-way nature of traffic data. To estimate the missing value, a tensor decomposition based Imputation method has been developed. This approach not only inherits the advantages of imputation methods based on matrix pattern for estimating missing points, but also well mines the multi-dimensional inherent correlation of traffic data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a better imputation performance than the state-of-the-art imputation approach even when the missing ratio is up to 90\%. Furthermore, the experimental results show that the proposed method can address the extreme case where the data of one or several days are completely missing, and additionally it can be employed to recover the missing traffic data in adverse weather as well.}

As it is impractical to install detectors on every road segment of the city network, methods on the network-wide flow estimation based on limited detector data are of considerable significance. However, when the plan of detector deployment is uncertain, existing methods are unsuitable to be directly used. In this study, a transfer component analysis (TCA)-based network-wide volume estimation model, considering the different traffic volume distributions of road segments and transforming traffic features into common data space, is proposed. Moreover, this study applied taxi GPS (global positioning system) data and cellular signaling data with the same spatio-temporal coverage to improve feature extraction. In numerical experiments, the robustness and stability of the proposed network-wide estimation method outperformed other baselines in the two subnetworks selected from the urban centers and suburbs.}

This article explores the potential use of vehicle probe data to enhance conventional traffic monitoring practice for generating network-wide estimates of AADT by exploring relationships between site-specific traffic volume data and vehicle probe data collected in Manitoba, Canada. The analysis revealed that mean travel speed cannot be used to predict traffic volumes on Manitoba highways, since the mean travel speed did not deviate from the free-flow speed regardless of the volume measured. The quantity of probe data observations showed moderate correlation with traffic volume at some sites (R-squared up to 0.65), but these correlations were stronger (R-squared up to 0.9) when considering trucks only. These findings suggest that probe data could be used to estimate truck volumes at certain locations. }

abstract = {Accurate citywide traffic inference is critical for improving intelligent transportation systems with smart city applications. However, this task is very challenging given the limited training data, due to the high cost of sensor installment and maintenance across the entire urban space. A more practical scenario to study the citywide traffic inference is effectively modeling the spatial and temporal traffic patterns with limited historical traffic observations. In this work, we propose a dynamic multi-view graph neural network for citywide traffic inference with the method CTVI+. Specifically, for the temporal dimension, we propose a temporal self-attention mechanism that is capable of learning the dynamics of traffic data with the time-evolving traffic volume variations. For spatial dimension, we build a multi-view graph neural network, employing the road-wise message passing scheme to capture the region dependencies. With the designed spatial-temporal learning paradigms, we enable our traffic inference model to encode the dynamism from both spatial and temporal traffic patterns, which is reflective of intra- and inter-road traffic correlations. In our evaluation, CTVI+ achieves consistent better performance compared with different baselines on real-world traffic volume datasets. Further ablation study validates the effectiveness of key components in CTVI+. We release the model implementation at https://github.com/dsj96/TKDD.},

abstractNote={Time series forecasting and spatiotemporal kriging are the two most important tasks in spatiotemporal data analysis. Recent research on graph neural networks has made substantial progress in time series forecasting, while little attention has been paid to the kriging problem---recovering signals for unsampled locations/sensors. Most existing scalable kriging methods (e.g., matrix/tensor completion) are transductive, and thus full retraining is required when we have a new sensor to interpolate. In this paper, we develop an Inductive Graph Neural Network Kriging (IGNNK) model to recover data for unsampled sensors on a network/graph structure. To generalize the effect of distance and reachability, we generate random subgraphs as samples and the corresponding adjacency matrix for each sample. By reconstructing all signals on each sample subgraph, IGNNK can effectively learn the spatial message passing mechanism. Empirical results on several real-world spatiotemporal datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In addition, we also find that the learned model can be successfully transferred to the same type of kriging tasks on an unseen dataset. Our results show that: 1) GNN is an efficient and effective tool for spatial kriging; 2) inductive GNNs can be trained using dynamic adjacency matrices; 3) a trained model can be transferred to new graph structures and 4) IGNNK can be used to generate virtual sensors.},
