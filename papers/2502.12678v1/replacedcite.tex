% \textbf{optimistic online gradient descent} 
Our \oomdmethod{} is strictly related to the idea of optimistic online gradient descent ____ originally proposed in online learning to achieve small regret in case of slow varying loss sequences. Our update that uses only one projection per update was proposed in ____. The name of our method is due to a similar algorithm introduced in the context of variational inequalities by ____.
