\label{sec:conclusion}
Our paper introduces a new encoding paradigm called \proj, designed to support various data distributions and heterogeneous computability for group-wise weight quantization.
To solve the challenge of employing group-wise quantization in KV cache, we propose real-time quantization components.
We extend the processing unit (PE) in a systolic array to support the efficient computation of \proj, and we implement the real-time update components through the lightweight comparator and fixed-point multiplier.
% By adaptively selecting the appropriate encoding for each group, \proj achieve the minimal accuracy loss in several LLMs.
Our evaluation shows \proj achieves the minimal accuracy loss in several LLMs and achieves on average 2.99$\times$ (up to 4.46$\times$) speedup and 2.81$\times$ (up to 4.10$\times$) energy reduction to the SOTA LLM accelerator.
