    \caption{The diversity of data representation with coefficient $a$. The 4-bit data types have 16 points. Left part of figure shows how the distribution varies with the increase of a. Right part of figure shows that when setting a to a different value, it can nearly match the distribution of several data types, including \texttt{float}, \texttt{NF}, \texttt{PoT}, and \texttt{INT}.}
