\begin{abstract}
Combinatorial optimization problems, such as scheduling and route planning, are crucial in various industries but are computationally intractable due to their \emph{NP-hard} nature. Neural Combinatorial Optimization methods leverage machine learning to address these challenges but often depend on sequential decision-making, which is prone to error accumulation as small mistakes propagate throughout the process. Inspired by self-evaluation techniques in Large Language Models, we propose a novel framework that generates and evaluates subsets of assignments, moving beyond traditional stepwise approaches. Applied to the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem, our method integrates a heterogeneous graph neural network with a Transformer to build a policy model and a self-evaluation function. Experimental validation on challenging, well-known benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% All the code and data associated with this paper will be made publicly available upon its acceptance.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning and Combinatorial Optimization. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
