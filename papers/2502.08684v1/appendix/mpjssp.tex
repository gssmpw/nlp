\section{Features and edges of the state}
\label{app:features}

For job-type and operation-type nodes, the feature set is defined as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Binary Completion Indicator:} For jobs, $b_j \in \{0, 1\}$, where $b_j = 1$ if job $j$ is completed; otherwise, $b_j = 0$.
    \item \textbf{Operation Readiness Indicator:} For operations, $b_o \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates whether operation $o$ is ready to be scheduled.
    \item \textbf{Completion Time:} $t_j \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is the timestamp of the last completed operation for job $j$.
    \item \textbf{Mean Processing Time:} $p_o \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ represents the expected duration of operation $o$.
    \item \textbf{Remaining Operations Count:} $r_j = |\mathcal{O}_j^{\text{rem}}|$ denotes the number of pending operations for job $j$.
    \item \textbf{Remaining Workload:} $s_j = \sum_{o \in \mathcal{O}_j^{\text{rem}}} \bar{p}_o$, where $\bar{p}_o \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$ is the processing time for operation $o$.
    \item \textbf{Job Completion Time Difference:} $t_j - t_{\text{min}}$, where $t_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum completion time across all jobs.
\end{itemize}

For machine-type nodes, the feature set is derived from machine-related metrics, capturing key information about machine states and performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Number of Pending Operations:} $|\mathcal{O}_m^{\text{pending}}|$, the total number of operations yet to be assigned to machine $m$.
    \item \textbf{Assignable Operations Count:} $|\mathcal{O}_m^{\text{assignable}}|$, the number of first operations from each job that can currently be assigned to machine $m$.
    \item \textbf{Sum of Processing Times:} $\sum_{o \in \mathcal{O}_m^{\text{assignable}}} p_{o,m}$, the total processing time of all operations assignable to machine $m$.
    \item \textbf{Last Assigned Completion Time:} $t_{\text{final}}^m$, the completion time of the last operation assigned to machine $m$.
    % \item \textbf{Difference to Minimum Completion Time:} $t_{\text{final}}^m - t_{\text{min}}$, where $t_{\text{min}}$ is the earliest completion time across all machines.
    % \item \textbf{Earliest Completion Flag:} Binary feature $f_m = 1$ if $t_{\text{final}}^m = t_{\text{min}}$, otherwise $f_m = 0$.
    % \item \textbf{Mean Completion Time Difference:} $\frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}|} \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M}} (t_{\text{final}}^m - t_{\text{min}})$, the average difference to the minimum completion time.
    % \item \textbf{Minimum Completion Time Difference:} $\min_{m \in \mathcal{M}} (t_{\text{final}}^m - t_{\text{min}})$, the smallest difference to the minimum completion time.
    % \item \textbf{Machine Utilization Rate:} $\frac{\text{occupations}^m}{t_{\text{final}}^m}$, the occupation rate of machine $m$.
\end{itemize}

Edges in the graph capture relationships between nodes and are defined as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Undirected Edges (Machine-Operation):} Represent the compatibility between machines and operations, carrying features such as processing time.
    \item \textbf{Directed Edges (Operation-Job):} Define the relationship between operations and their jobs, indicating job ownership.
    \item \textbf{Directed Edges (Operation-Operation):} Enforce precedence constraints between dependent operations.
    \item \textbf{Directed Edges (Machine-Job):} Connect machines to the first pending operation of each job, including processing time features.
    % \item \textbf{Job-Machine Connections:} Represent mutual influence between jobs and machines, adding structural context.
\end{itemize}

Two edge types carry specific features: operation-machine edges and job-machine edges. The features for operation-machine edges include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Processing Time:} $p_{o,m}$, the time required to execute operation $o$ on machine $m$.
    \item \textbf{Processing Time Relative to Job Workload:} $\frac{p_{o,m}}{\max_{o' \in \mathcal{O}_j} p_{o'}}$, where $\mathcal{O}_j$ is the set of remaining operations for job $j$, and $p_{o'}$ is the processing time of $o'$.
    \item \textbf{Processing Time Compared to Machine Capability:} $\frac{p_{o,m}}{\max{o' \in \mathcal{O}_m} p_{o'}}$, where $\mathcal{O}_m$ is the set of operations machine $m$ can process, and $p_{o'}$ is the processing time of $o'$.
\end{itemize}
