\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper, we propose a self-evaluation mechanism applied to the JSSP, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two widely recognized benchmarks. By evaluating subsets of actions collectively and leveraging a hybrid architecture of HGNNs and Transformers, our approach demonstrates strong generalization and robustness, outperforming classic methods like OR-Tools on larger instances. Future work includes combining supervised learning with reinforcement and self-supervised approaches, integrating beam search for improved inference, and extending the methodology to other combinatorial optimization problems, such as vehicle routing and resource allocation.
