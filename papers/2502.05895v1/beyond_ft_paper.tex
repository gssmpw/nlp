% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered

% \begin{abstract}
% Personalized text-to-image generation aims to create images tailored to user-defined concepts and textual descriptions. Balancing the fidelity of the learned concept with its ability for generation in various contexts presents a significant challenge. Existing methods often address this through diverse fine-tuning parameterizations and enhanced sampling strategies that integrate superclass trajectories during the diffusion process. While improved sampling offers a cost-effective, training-free solution for enhancing fine-tuned models, systematic analyses of these methods remain limited. Current approaches typically tie sampling strategies to fixed fine-tuning configurations, making it difficult to isolate their impact on generation outcomes. To address this, we systematically analyze sampling strategies beyond fine-tuning, exploring the influence of concept and superclass trajectories on the results. We show that a weighted mix of these trajectories establishes a strong baseline for improving adaptability across contexts. This approach integrates seamlessly with diverse training strategies, providing an efficient framework to optimize fidelity, editability, and computational efficiency in text-to-image generation.

While improved sampling offers a cost-effective, training-free solution for enhancing fine-tuned models, systematic analyses of these methods remain limited. Current approaches typically tie sampling strategies with fixed fine-tuning configurations, making it difficult to isolate their impact on generation outcomes. To address this issue, we systematically analyze sampling strategies beyond fine-tuning, exploring the impact of concept and superclass trajectories on the results. Building on this analysis, we propose a decision framework evaluating text alignment, computational constraints, and fidelity objectives to guide strategy selection. It integrates with diverse architectures and training approaches, systematically optimizing concept preservation, prompt adherence, and resource efficiency. The source code can be found
