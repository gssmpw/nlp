Information retention is a key %
component of successful feature extraction. It has hence already been addressed by prior works---mainly in the context of scattering CNNs, both over Euclidean domains ____ and graphs ____. While the question of energy decay seems to be reasonably settled for scattering CNNs over Euclidean domains, the literature is rather sparse on energy decay in more general feature extractors, in particular, scattering CNNs over non-Euclidean domains. %
