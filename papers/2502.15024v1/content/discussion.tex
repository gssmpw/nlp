\section{Conclusion and future directions}
Based on low-degree heuristics, our paper gives rigorous evidence for a computational phase transition at the Kesten-Stigum threshold. 
We view our work as a first step in studying this phenomenon, leaving open many interesting questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is it possible to obtain unconditional lower bound against broad classes of polynomial-time algorithms (for example low-degree polynomials or local statistics \cite{banks2021local,ding2022robust} below the Kesten-Stigum threshold?
    \item Below the Kesten-Stigum threshold, suppose we are given an initalization achieving recovery rate $n^{-0.49}$, could we boost the accuracy in polynomial time to get a weak recovery algorithm?
    \item Can we show a computational-statistical gap for learning the graphon function when the number of blocks $k\leq \sqrt{n}$ (as in \cite{luo2023computational})?
\end{itemize}
