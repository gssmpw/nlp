\section{Low-degree lower bound beyond constant number of blocks}\label{sec:beyond-constant-ldlr}

By extending the result of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a}, we can get a more general bound (with respect to $k$) on low degree likelihood ratio of k-SBM. The proof of the extended result follows trivially from the proof of Theorem 2.20 of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a}. Therefore, we only provide a proof sketch by pointing out the simple modifications that we need from the original proof.

\begin{theorem}[Restatement of \cref{thm:ldlr-sbm}]\torestate{
Let $d=o(n),k=o(\log(n))$ and $\e\in [0,1]$. 
Let $\mu:\{0,1\}^{n \times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be the relative density of SBM $(n, d, \varepsilon, k)$ with respect to $G\left(n, \frac{d}{n}\right)$. 
Let $\mu^{\leqslant \ell}$ be the projection of $\mu$ to the degree-$\ell$
polynomials with respect to the norm induced by $G\left(n, \frac{d}{n}\right)$ For any constant $\delta>0$,
\begin{align*}
\left\|\mu^{\leqslant \ell}\right\| \text{ is } \begin{cases}
    \geqslant n^{\Omega(1)}, & \quad \text{if } \varepsilon^2 d > (1+\delta) k^2, \quad \ell \geqslant O(\log n) \\[8pt]
    \leqslant O_{\delta, \varepsilon, d} \left(\exp(k^2)\right), & \quad \text{if } \varepsilon^2 d < (1-\delta) k^2, \quad \ell < n^{0.99}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    In this proof, we stick to the notations of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a}. The only modification we need is that the size of the $\delta$-net of the unit sphere in $\R^k$, denoted by $C(\delta, k)$, is equal to $\exp(O_\delta(k))$. The size of the $\delta$-net $C(\delta, k)$ is crucial in Proposition 6.4 and Proposition 6.5 of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a} and is treated as constant in the proof of Theorem 2.16 and Theorem 2.20 of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a}.
    
    By plugging $C(\delta, k)=O_\delta(\exp(k))$ into the upper bound of the small deviation term $L_1$ in the proof of Theorem 2.16 of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a}, it follows that we have $\Norm{L^{\leq D}} = O_\delta(\exp(k))$ for the likelihood ratio $L$ and $D \leq o(n/\log(n))$. Then, the bound on low-degree likelihood ratio of k-SBM follows from the same reduction as in proof of Theorem 2.20 of \cite{pmlr-v134-bandeira21a}.
