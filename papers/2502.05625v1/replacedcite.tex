% \textbf{Constrained Optimization for Diffusion Sampling} Prior work by ____ frames the diffusion model sampling process as a constrained optimization problem. While this approach guarantees constraint satisfaction and is applicable to a diverse set of domains, it cannot directly cope with latent representations present in stable diffusion models. This challenge is primarily posed by the inability to represent constraints directly in the latent space. This work similarly models the reverse process as a constrained optimization problem, but adapts the constraint imposition to operate upon the latent throughout the sampling procedure.
