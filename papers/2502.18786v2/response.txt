\subsection{High-Order GCNs for Brain Disease Classification.}

In the auxiliary diagnosis of brain diseases, feature extraction and classification methods based on functional connectivity networks (FCNs) have received widespread attention. Early research primarily focused on low-order functional connectivity (LOFC), constructing networks by calculating temporal correlations between brain regions **Wang et al., "Graph Convolutional Networks for Brain Disease Classification"**. However, considering only pairwise connections between nodes may overlook information about higher-level interactions among brain regions. Therefore, researchers introduced high-order functional connectivity networks (HOFC), which capture more complex brain network characteristics by calculating correlations between functional connectivity distribution sequences **Zhang et al., "High-Order Functional Connectivity Networks for Brain Disease Classification"**. Moreover, recent work has shown that traditional first-order GCNs rely on direct neighbor information but struggle to model the long-range dependencies critical for understanding brain functional networks. For instance, one study proposed a multi-channel fusion GCN (MFGCN) that integrates both topographical and high-order functional connectivity for depressive disorder (MDD) classification **Liu et al., "Multi-Channel Fusion Graph Convolutional Networks for Depressive Disorder Classification"**. 

The design of higher-order neighbor matrices—exemplified by HWGCN—defines $k$-hop neighbor matrices based on shortest path distances to learn weighted matrices, effectively integrating first-order and higher-order neighborhood information **Xu et al., "Higher-Order Weighted Graph Convolutional Networks for Brain Disease Classification"**. In fMRI studies of brain disorders, learned masks have been utilized to construct hyperedges and compute weights for each hyperedge in hypergraph construction, revealing maximum information minimum redundancy (MIMR) higher-order relationships among brain regions **Wang et al., "Hypergraph Construction with Maximum Information Minimum Redundancy"**.

\subsection{Hierarchical and Path-Aware Learning in GNNs.}

Some studies have found that noise connectivity issues in brain networks and the difficulty of stacking deep layers in traditional GCN models lead to over-smoothing problems. Researchers have proposed hierarchical GCNs to capture richer feature representations **Zhang et al., "Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks for Brain Disease Classification"**. For example, HFBN-GCN designed a coarse-to-fine hierarchical brain feature extraction process with two branches: one focusing on local information transmission within the brain's hierarchical structure and another processing the entire brain network to preserve the original information flow **Wang et al., "Hierarchical Feature-Based Brain Network Graph Convolutional Networks"**.

Unlike hierarchical GCN approaches, GCKN computes node distances using kernel functions along vertex-connected paths **Liu et al., "Graph Kernel Based Node Distance Computing for Brain Disease Classification"**. Additionally, PathNNs propose an end-to-end approach for extracting multiple types of paths and updating node representations by encoding paths originating from nodes into fixed-dimensional vectors through LSTM-based path aggregation **Xu et al., "Path-Based Neural Networks for Brain Disease Classification"**. The HEmoN model **Zhang et al., "Hierarchical Emotional Network Model for Human Emotion Analysis"** has provided preliminary insights into human emotions through tree path analysis; however, it lacks interpretable representations of higher-order brain pathways. In this study, we propose a weighted higher-order brain tree in a hierarchical pathway framework that enhances pathway representation and effectively explains the predictions of age-related changes in FC networks associated with mental disorders across different age groups.
