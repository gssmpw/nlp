\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Road Network Representation Learning} aims to transform the road network into a general low-dimensional representation matrix. Since graph representation learning methods can model the topological structure of the road network \citet{Wang, "Graph Convolutional Networks"}, some existing methods \citet{Zhang}, "Network Embedding" take the spatial correlations of road segments into account by using graph representation learning methods.
A more recent method \citet{Liu, "Road Network Representation Learning with Spatial and Temporal Correlations"} takes the transition patterns into account when modeling the road networks. In summary, our proposed method is the first attempt to jointly model the dynamics of road segments based on trajectory and traffic state data.


\textbf{Trajectory Representation Learning} aims to transform the trajectory into a general low-dimensional representation vector. Early TRL studies \citet{Kim}, "Learning Trajectory Representations with Autoencoders" obtain trajectory representations through the reconstruction task. Recent TRL methods \citet{Xu, "Trajectory Representation Learning via Graph Neural Networks"}, primarily first obtain the road network representations and then derive trajectory representations through sequential models with self-supervised tasks. The trajectory representation is assumed to be static in most methods, with only a few encoding temporal information in trajectories. For example, Trembr \citet{Li}, "Road Network Embedding with Temporal Information" and START \citet{Wang2}, "Temporal Graph Attention Networks for Trajectory Representation Learning" reconstructs timestamps during the decoding process. However, they do not consider the impact of dynamic traffic states on trajectory representations, which is one of our main contributions.
