\noindent \textbf{LLM Reasoning and Planning.} Many efforts have been made to enhance LLMs' reasoning and planning capabilities, such as Chain of Thought ____, Tree-of-Thought ____, Graph-of-Thought ____, and Program-of-Thoughts ____. Some works propose verification steps to improve responses ____, but empirical studies show that LLMs still struggle with complex reasoning and planning tasks ____.

\noindent \textbf{Model Ensemble.} These methods aim to harness the strengths of multiple LLMs by combining their outputs, re-ranking results, or predicting the best-performing model for specific inputs. 
% 
Techniques like GENFUSER ____ and Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) ____ focus on output fusion. 
%
Among them, MoA is the closest to our MoO, which uses an LLM-based aggregator and proposers in a forward layer-wise structure. However, MoA relies on very large LLMs with strong instruction-following capabilities, which are lacking in small to medium-sized LLMs.

\noindent \textbf{Multi-Agent Systems.} Multi-agent collaboration methods use multiple task-specific LLMs ____. These methods are computationally expensive and may not always outperform single-agent solutions with strong prompts.

\noindent \textbf{Mixture-of-Experts (MoE).} An MoE model, originally proposed by ____, is a type of ensemble model where multiple ``experts'' are trained, and each expert specializes in different aspects of the input data. The key idea is that different experts handle different parts of the problem, and a ``gating'' network decides which expert (or combination of experts) to use for a given input. Our MoO paradigm is inspired by MoE, but it applies the concept at the data level.

\noindent \textbf{Context Enhancement for SFT.} The works by ____ and ____ incorporate Chain-of-Thought reasoning and detailed scratchpads into SFT for reasoning tasks. Our MoO approach falls under this category as it enhances the context by fusing external LLMs-generated responses (i.e., opinions) during the training process.
