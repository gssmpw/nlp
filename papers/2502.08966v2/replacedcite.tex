\section{Background and Related Work}
\textbf{Agentic AI Systems and Tool-Based AI Agents.}
The integration of external environments with LMs is often described as \textit{Composite AI Systems} ____ or simply \textit{agents}____. These systems leverage the LM’s capabilities to comprehend natural language ____, perform reasoning ____ and planning ____. Tool-Based Agent Systems (TBAS) ____, a subclass of LM agentic systems, operate in a single context and interact with external environments via tool calls. Widely adopted in applications like Bing’s ChatGPT integration ____, TBAS also power platforms like OpenAI’s GPTs ____ and CustomGPT.ai ____, enabling developers to customize agents with specific instructions and tools.

\textbf{Prompt Injection For LMs.}
A prompt injection attack____ occurs when malicious inputs, or prompts, are introduced into the agent’s history (context) to alter its behavior. Prompt injections, often as natural language instruction pretending to be the user, but at times it could be nonsensical text making its detection even more subtle____. While users can initiate such attacks to bypass application-defined guidelines ____ or extract system prompts ____, our focus is on prompt injections originating from tools that retrieve data from untrusted sources such as other websites, public reviews, comments, etc. ____. These injections can maliciously manipulate the TBAS, causing it to perform unintended or harmful tasks. 

\textbf{Defenses for Prompt Injection and Privacy Leakage.} Defenses can be categorized into two strategies:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item \textit{Injected Prompt Detection:} Possible prompt injections can be identified using perplexity measures or another LM trained to flag anomalies ____.
    \item \textit{Prompt Impact Mitigation:} These limit injection effects using (i) data sanitization approaches such as parapharsing____, retokenization____, delimiters, (ii) fine-tuning on non-instruction-tuned models ____, (iii)
        restricting tools based on user requests ____, or (iv)
        pretraining LMs to enforce hierarchies or improve instruction/data separation____.
\end{itemize}

Most of these techniques are heuristic based and not conservative, nor do they allow an application developer to provide a security policy specifying allowed actions given a current integrity and confidentiality environment. Compared to RTBAS, data sanitization methods are heuristics driven and are subject to adversarial jailbreaking  ____; tool restrictions allow attacks using unrestricted tools; pre-training techniques are difficult to apply to commercial models, and still rely on the LM to ignore malicious prompts, albeit with greater difficulties. 

Much research____ has been completed on training time privacy concerns. Inference-time techniques have been focused on detecting outputs with possible PIIs____ or desensitizing them before sending to the LM____. However, they typically are not focused on tool-based environments.

\textbf{Information Flow for LLMs} 
____ explores the similar selective propagation approach. However,  their mechanism requires enumerating all possible subsets of relevant prior input regions (documents in RAG) to identify the minimal subset that leads to similar outputs. As noted in their paper, the naive implementation of this mechanism incurs a worst-case complexity that is exponential in the number of prior input regions, potentially reaching thousands in the RAG scenarios. Even their optimized version still requires exponential enumeration with respect to the number of levels in a lattice, resulting in 16-64 additional LM calls with a typical lattice with 4-6 levels. In contrast, as we will discuss later, our mechanism employs a dependency analyzer that efficiently detects relevant input regions in parallel by a single call, reducing the computational overhead from exponential to constant. This fundamental improvement highlights the practicality of our approach. Lastly, unlike our technique, ____ does not specify the propagation of labels beyond labeling the response, which makes it inapplicable to interactive settings such as tool-calling. There is also no mechanism to verify the computed label against allowed policy or solicit user confirmations. 


\textbf{Attention Score as a Measure of Saliency.}
\textit{Attention scores}____, which measure a transformer-based model's ``focus'' on past tokens, is a widely-used technique in the machine learning community to explain a neural network's internal processing____, prune irrelevant input texts____, etc.  In this work, we leverage attention scores as an input to the \dependencydetector, as they capture the degree to which output tokens are influenced by specific input regions.
