\section{Ethics considerations}

Our experiments were conducted using publicly available benchmarks and constructed datasets explicitly designed for this study. No real-world user data or personally identifiable information (PII) was involved in the development or evaluation of our methods. The attacks explored in this research are well-documented within the community and do not necessitate additional disclosure. Additionally, our experiments included subjecting language models to potentially harmful tasks and simulating attacks on TBAS applications. We have received assurances from OpenAI, the language model vendor, that these interactions will not be used for training or improving their models.
