    \caption{Real-world teleoperation system integrating augmented reality for intuitive robot control. The setup includes two Franka Emika Panda robots: a Leader Robot (cyan) controlled by a Meta Quest 3 user and a Follower Robot (blue) mirroring its movements. An ORBBEC Femto Bolt depth camera (yellow) captures the scene for real-time point cloud visualization (green). The top-left and top-right images show the augmented view, reconstructing objects (e.g., red and yellow cups) in XR. The bottom image presents the physical setup, where the Leader Robot is directly controlled while the Follower Robot autonomously replicates actions, enabling precise, immersive remote operation.}
