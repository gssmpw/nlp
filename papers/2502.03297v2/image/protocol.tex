    \caption{The master node broadcasts UDP messages containing its details to the broadcast address (e.g., \textit{192.168.0.255}) at port 7720. Each IP address in the diagram (e.g., \textit{192.168.0.100/0}) represents a device's unique address on the network, where '0' indicates a dynamically assigned port provided by the operating system. XR nodes, upon startup, listen on the broadcast port (7720) to receive these messages, extract the master node's IP and ZMQ socket address, and build a stable connection. This architecture supports both request-response and publish-subscribe communication patterns, ensuring robust, multi-device connectivity with automatic reconnection capabilities.}
