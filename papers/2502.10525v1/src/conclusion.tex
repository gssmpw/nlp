\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we studied the problem of watermarking open-source LLMs.  
Noting the fragmentation in prior work on this topic, we laid the foundation for systematic future study of OSM watermarking.  
We revisited the requirements for generation-time LLM watermarking, discussed how they apply in the open-source setting, introduced a novel requirement, \emph{durability}, and applied a new systematic evaluation procedure to existing OSM watermarks.  
Finding that none of the current watermarks are durable, we proposed scaling watermark distillation methods, highlighting their benefits and limitations.  
We hope our work can kick-start progress on this crucial yet challenging problem.
