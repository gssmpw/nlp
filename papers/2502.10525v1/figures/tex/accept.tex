    \caption{Definition and evaluation of OSM watermark durability. 
    \numcir{1}: Given a base unwatermarked model, a watermark is embedded into its weights. 
    \numcir{2}: The model is uploaded to a model-sharing platform like Hugging Face.
    \numcir{3}: The model is tested against the established requirements for generation-time watermarks. 
    \numcir{4}: Yet, third-party users modify the weights of the model through quantization, pruning, merging, and finetuning, and may distribute the modified model. 
    We ask: \emph{are such modified models still watermarked}? 
    To evaluate this, we introduce a new requirement: {durability}, and propose a systematic evaluation procedure based on the most common model modifications.
