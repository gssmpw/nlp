abstract = {Recently, a revolutionary effort to seek fundamental improvement of 802.11, known as IEEE 802.11ax, has been approved to deliver high efficiency wireless local area network (HEW) technologies for dense scenario. The de-facto random access mechanism of IEEE 802.11ax is uplink {OFDMA}-based random access ({UL} {OFDMA} {RA}) mechanism. In this paper, we provide a simple but accurate analytical model to study the system efficiency and delay performance of UL {OFDMA} RA under saturated condition, in the assumption of a finite number of stations and ideal channel conditions in a single-hop WLAN. Simulations are conducted to validate analytical results. In addition, we use this analytical model to identify the appropriate {OFDMA}-based random access parameter set (RAPS) that can maximize the system performance, a feature which is essential for system design and configuration.},

abstract = {We consider a wireless network with a base station serving multiple traffic streams to different destinations. Packets from each stream arrive to the base station according to a stochastic process and are enqueued in a separate (per stream) queue. The queueing discipline controls which packet within each queue is available for transmission. The base station decides, at every time t, which stream to serve to the corresponding destination. The goal of scheduling decisions is to keep the information at the destinations fresh. Information freshness is captured by the Age of Information (AoI) metric.In this paper, we derive a lower bound on the AoI performance achievable by any given network operating under any queueing discipline. Then, we consider three common queueing disciplines and develop both an Optimal Stationary Randomized policy and a Max-Weight policy under each discipline. Our approach allows us to evaluate the combined impact of the stochastic arrivals, queueing discipline and scheduling policy on AoI. We evaluate the AoI performance both analytically and using simulations. Numerical results show that the performance of the Max-Weight policy is close to the analytical lower bound.},

abstract = {Applications like environmental sensing, and health and activity sensing, are supported by networks of devices (nodes) that send periodic packet transmissions over the wireless channel to a sink node. We look at simple abstractions that capture the following commonalities of such networks (a) the nodes send periodically sensed information that is temporal and must be delivered in a timely manner, (b) they share a multiple access channel and (c) channels between the nodes and the sink are unreliable (packets may be received in error) and differ in quality. We consider scheduled access and slotted ALOHA-like random access. Under scheduled access, nodes take turns and get feedback on whether a transmitted packet was received successfully by the sink. During its turn, a node may transmit more than once to counter channel uncertainty. For slotted ALOHA-like access, each node attempts transmission in every slot with a certain probability. For these access mechanisms we derive the age of information (AoI), which is a timeliness metric, and arrive at conditions that optimize AoI at the sink. We also analyze the case of symmetric updating, in which updates from different nodes must have the same AoI. We show that ALOHA-like access, while simple, leads to AoI that is worse by a factor of about 2e, in comparison to scheduled access.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a network where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$N$ </tex-math></inline-formula> links contend for the channel using the well-known carrier sense multiple access scheme. By leveraging the notion of stochastic hybrid systems, we find: 1) a closed-form expression of the average age when links generate packets at will 2) an upperbound of the average age when packets arrive stochastically to each link. This upperbound is shown to be generally tight, and to be equal to the average age in certain scenarios. Armed with these expressions, we formulate the problem of minimizing the average age by calibrating the back-off time of each link. Interestingly, we show that the minimum average age is achieved for the same back-off time in both the sampling and stochastic arrivals scenarios. Then, by analyzing its structure, we convert the formulated optimization problem to an equivalent convex problem that we find its optimal solution. Insights on the interaction between links and numerical implementations of the optimized Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) scheme in an IEEE 802.11 environment are presented. Next, to further improve the performance of the optimized CSMA scheme, we propose a modification to it by giving each link the freedom to transition to SLEEP mode. The proposed approach provides a way to reduce the burden on the channel when possible. This leads, as will be shown in the paper, to an improvement in the performance of the network. Simulations results are then laid out to highlight the performance gain offered by our approach in comparison to the optimized standard CSMA scheme.},

ABSTRACT = {IEEE 802.11ax uplink orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based random access (UORA) is a new feature for random channel access in wireless local area networks (WLANs). Similar to the legacy random access scheme in WLANs, UORA performs the OFDMA backoff (OBO) procedure to access the channel and decides on a random OBO counter within the OFDMA contention window (OCW) value. An access point (AP) can determine the OCW range and inform each station (STA) of it. However, how to determine a reasonable OCW range is beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.11ax standard. The OCW range is crucial to the UORA performance, and it primarily depends on the number of contending STAs, but it is challenging for the AP to accurately and quickly estimate or keep track of the number of contending STAs without the aid of a specific signaling mechanism. In addition, the one for this purpose incurs an additional delay and overhead in the channel access procedure. Therefore, the performance of a UORA scheme can be degraded by an improper OCW range, especially when the number of contending STAs changes dynamically. We first observed the effect of OCW values on channel efficiency and derived its optimal value from an analytical model. Next, we proposed a simple yet effective OBO control scheme where each STA determines its own OBO counter in a distributed manner rather than adjusting the OCW value globally. In the proposed scheme, each STA determines an appropriate OBO counter depending on whether the previous transmission was successful or not so that collisions can be mitigated without leaving OFDMA resource units unnecessarily idle. The results of a simulation study confirm that the throughput of the proposed scheme is comparable to the optimal OCW-based scheme and is improved by up to 15 times compared to the standard UORA scheme.},

ABSTRACT = {Wi-Fi is a popular wireless technology and is continuously extended to keep pace with requirements such as high throughput, real-time communication, dense networks, or resource and energy efficiency. The IEEE 802.11ax standard, also known as Wi-Fi 6, promises to provide data rates of up to almost 10 Gb/s, lower energy consumption, and higher reliability. Its capabilities go far beyond Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) and novel technical concepts have been introduced for this purpose. As such, the Wi-Fi 6 standard includes Multi-User Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (MU OFDMA), Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU MIMO), new mechanisms for Spatial Reuse (SR), new mechanisms for power saving, higher-order modulation, and additional minor improvements. In this paper, we provide a survey of Wi-Fi 6. Initially, we provide a compact technological summary of Wi-Fi 5 and its predecessors. Then, we discuss the potential application domains of Wi-Fi 6, which are enabled through its novel features. Subsequently, we explain these features and review the related works in these areas. Finally, performance evaluation tools for Wi-Fi 6 and future roadmaps are discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The IEEE 802.11ax standard, which realizes multi-user transmission based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), has been highlighted as a key technology to meet high future demand for Wi-Fi systems. Since this standard is still being developed, performance analysis through mathematical modeling is of paramount importance; however, existing studies have several limitations. Firstly, most of these consider only the saturation network throughput, whereas for 802.11ax in particular, the access delay of the nodes needs to be studied carefully, since they no longer acquire the medium independently but depend solely on the access point’s (AP’s) schedule. Secondly, since the network performance may be affected to a greater extent by legacy nodes than by 802.11ax nodes, it is desirable to consider various heterogeneous cases of networks with existing legacy nodes. In this paper, a new analytical framework for the 802.11ax MAC protocol is provided. Markov-chain-based models are developed to represent the behavior of the 802.11ax nodes, and both non-saturated traffic conditions and co-existence with the legacy nodes are considered. Through both analysis and MATLAB simulations, it is shown that the proposed model accurately evaluates the throughput and the delay performance under various network conditions.},
