\section{Conclusion}

In this survey, we provide an systematic overview of diffusion model-based molecular generative methods, addressing the growing need for clarity in this rapidly evolving area. By introducing a novel taxonomy that categorizes research based on method formulations, data modalities, and task types, we offer a structured framework to navigate the research landscape. Furthermore, we identify opportunities in the existing literature, highlighting promising directions for future exploration.
