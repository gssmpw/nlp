\textbf{GCN-based Methods.}\quad
The skeletal representation of humans, characterized by joints and their adjacent links, can be effectively modeled as a graph. This correlation has been extensively explored by researchers ____. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), specifically designed for graph data, offer a robust method for feature extraction in this context.
In ____, a multi-scale graph was introduced that adeptly captures features across multiple scales, enabling the accurate prediction of future human motions. Concurrently, ____ developed a semi-constrained graph that explicitly encodes skeletal connections and integrates prior knowledge. Building on this, they proposed a multi-scale spatial-temporal graph ____ to achieve comprehensive modeling.
Differently, our work simulate the human visual system. We design a unique GCN structure that handles dynamic and static information separately, thereby eliminating the disruption of irrelevant data. Moreover, we encode the data hierarchically to obtain richer localized human information.

\textbf{TCN-based methods.} \quad
RNNs are inherently prone to error accumulation ____. Conversely, Temporal Recurrent Networks (TCNs) mitigate common issues such as gradient explosion or vanishing gradients, as their back-propagation paths diverge from the temporal sequence direction. These strengths have led to the increasing application of TCNs in HMP.  
For instance, in ____, TCNs are employed to decode the dynamics of sub-motions and the spatial correlations within the entire motion sequence to predict future movements. Subsequently, ____ propounds a residual TCN that is characterized by a minimalist design yet delivers high efficiency.
Diverging from conventional methods, we have developed a TCN-based model. This network harmoniously fuses the strengths of both RNNs and TCNs, creating a recurrent temporal convolutional network adept at predicting future movements. 

\textbf{GAN-based Methods.} \quad
GANs have emerged as a pivotal tool in addressing HMP challenges, not only for constructing novel networks but also for advancing learning algorithms. Recent advancements include specialized adaptations such as HP-GAN, which modifies the improved WGAN-GP for probabilistic HMP ____. Additionally, Bi-GANs ____ and GAN-poser ____ introduce bi-directional structures to enhance prediction accuracy. An AMGAN ____ targets kinematic chains.
Adversarial strategies in motion analysis also be leveraged for network training ____, demonstrating their effectiveness in various contexts. Notably, SGRU ____ employs GANs to simulate path integral, offering a distinct perspective on motion modeling.
In our investigation, we contribute a theoretical demonstration that dimension reduction significantly enhances the convergence of WGAN. Moreover, we utilize GANs for motion context modeling.
