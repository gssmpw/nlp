\begin{abstract}

The field of mechanistic interpretability in pre-trained transformer models has demonstrated substantial evidence supporting the ``linear representation hypothesis'', which is the idea that high level concepts are encoded as vectors in the space of activations of a model. Studies also show that model generation behavior can be steered toward a given concept by adding the concept's vector to the corresponding activations. We show how to leverage these properties to build a form of logical implication into models, enabling transparent and interpretable adjustments that induce a chosen generation behavior in response to the presence of any given concept. Our method, Logical Implication Model Steering (LIMS), unlocks new hand-engineered reasoning capabilities by integrating neuro-symbolic logic into pre-trained transformer models.

\section{Introduction}

In this work, we are motivated by recent advances in mechanistic interpretability which deepen our understanding of the representations within pre-trained transformer models, as well as by the goal of bridging neuro-symbolic and algorithmic capabilities with these representations. Harnessing the extensive knowledge and intuitive processing embedded in these models in a high-level, interpretable, and algorithmic way, holds the potential to unlock significantly greater reasoning capabilities and control.


Driven by these motivations, we introduce the Logical Implication Model Steering (LIMS) method, which extracts and uses concept vectors to allow a user to ``program'' logical implication into model generation behavior in a transparent and interpretable manner. LIMS achieves this by implementing the atomic building blocks for a general neuro-symbolic logic. More specifically, one introduces a circuit into the internal workings of the pre-trained transformer which approximately obeys the logic: ``If concept $P$ is present in an input $x$, behave according to generation behavior consistent with the concept $Q$''. 
We refer to this as ``If $P(x)$ then $Q(x)$'' or ``$P\rightarrow Q$''.
As an example, the concept $P$ may be a user requesting for the model to behave in a harmful or toxic way, and $Q$ could be the generation behavior rejecting such a request.
Our method uses a simple contrastive approach to distinguish when concepts and behaviors are present or not, and extracts the ``$P$''-condition and ``$Q$''-behavior as concept vectors $p,q$, such that then one can add a feed-forward circuit to steer with $q$ only when sensing $p$.
As opposed to a traditionally opaque fine-tuning or prompting process, the resulting LIMS circuit provides an interpretable and disentangled function, promoting transparency and precision with a separation between model classification accuracy of $P$ and controlled behavior adjustments into $Q$. 

We demonstrate that the interpretability of LIMS has practical benefits, allowing one to observe the relative difficulties of classification and steering on a given task, or use simple statistical models on the decoupled sensing and steering components to estimate model generalization from classification.
We also show the utility of LIMS in some Large Language Model (LLM) use cases, including detecting and reducing hallucinations, increased model safety, and increasing reasoning when required to solve math problems. We demonstrate significant gains even in the very low data regime of 100 training data points, including on the difficult problem of reducing hallucinations caused by insufficient information in context, where traditional fine-tuning required at least 10 times more data to compare. 
In addition, LIMS circuits do not need to be learned with backpropagation of gradients through the model, and the process is only as memory and compute intensive as model inference, allowing a user with limited resources to ``train'' LIMS circuits into much larger models than model fine-tuning. 
Although LIMS introduces its circuit with a nonlinear mapping, we also introduce a ``mergeable'' LIMS variant (m-LIMS) that facilitates easy deployment by merging into existing parameters with no architecture changes required. The m-LIMS variant performs just as well as LIMS, at the cost of a slight reduction in interpretability. 


The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item We formalize and introduce the LIMS method. To our knowledge, LIMS is the first general method unifying neuro-symbolic logic into the representations of pre-trained generative transformers. %% typo
    \item We demonstrate LIMS's utility and analyze its interpretability in very low-data regimes across several language modeling tasks, including:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Detecting and flagging hallucinations (HaluEval dataset \cite{halueval}).
        \item Reducing hallucinated responses by addressing unanswerable questions (SQuAD 2 unanswerable benchmark \cite{squad2}).
        \item Improving reasoning through automatic chain-of-thought trajectories in math problems (GSM8K \cite{gsm8k}).
        \item Rejecting harmful or toxic instructions in adversarial prompts (AdvBench \cite{advbench}).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item We demonstrate the existence of novel concept vectors for insufficient information and chain-of-thought reasoning, while also contributing to the body of work on concept vectors for hallucination detection \cite{hallucsurvey,hallullmcheck,hallusteering}.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Background and Relevant Works}

Neural networks have long been hypothesized to represent individual features or “concepts” as consistent vectors within their representation space, a premise known as the linear representation hypothesis \cite{oglinearhyp}. 

Formalizations of this hypothesis and concept representations have been explored prior to our work in \cite{linearhyp}, which defines concepts separately for generation and input space and investigates their relation. Our approach to formalizing concepts follows similar principles.
Mechanistic interpretability research has provided extensive empirical support, identifying numerous concept vectors in transformers, including those for entities, directions, colors \cite{directioncolor}, truthfulness \cite{truthfulvec}, and even player positions in Othello \cite{othellointerp}. Concept vectors can both classify when a concept is present and steer generation toward or away from it \cite{ogsteering}. 
Notably, steering has been demonstrated for refusal behaviors in LLMs \cite{refusaldirection} and for reducing hallucinations \cite{hallusteering}. However, generation is often harder than classification and models may internally distinguish a concept like hallucination without being able to incorporate it into their outputs. For instance, concept vectors can sometimes predict incorrect reasoning in math problems before generation begins \cite{physics2}, or encode latent knowledge that models cannot retrieve in responses \cite{physics3.1,physics3.2}. Another limitation is that feed-forward circuits not present in pre-training can require extended re-training to learn \cite{physics3.1}. LIMS circumvents this issue by hand-engineering the desired circuit; For example fine-tuning struggles to adapt models to follow instructions to refrain from answering questions when the prompt lacks sufficient information, while LIMS can achieve the desired effect with controlled behavior shifts (\S \ref{section:experiments}).

Our approach aligns with broader efforts in neuro-symbolic methods, which integrate logic and structured representations into neural networks to enhance interpretability, control, and generalizable reasoning. Methods like \cite{arlsat,logictext} focus on parsing LLM outputs into a symbolic logic, however these methods treat the transformer as a black box and do not operate on the internal representations.
In \cite{neurotrans}, adding symbolic linguistic knowledge-graph into the embeddings of a transformer to increase training data efficiency for sentiment analysis is investigated. The work \cite{kermit} joins a transformer with a separate neuro-symbolic network through an added output MLP, so that both networks influence generation. In contrast to LIMS, neither approach uses the existing representations of a transformer to allow integration of a general symbolic logic.
The survey \cite{neurosymbolictrends} highlights the challenge and necessity of research in unified representations for neuro-symbolic methods, where a neural network's representations are in the same space as the fuzzy symbolic logic, as is the case for LIMS.

The LIMS method shares similarities with transformer memory editing techniques such as \cite{memedit,memmend,memwise,memat,memit,memfast}, in which factual knowledge is mechanistically located in the representations of a transformer, and modified by replacement with different knowledge. While architecturally similar to LIMS or m-LIMS, these approaches differ in both their goals and mechanisms. Memory editing techniques primarily focus on parallel factual updates, where knowledge is treated as a collection of discrete entries to be updated or replaced, and both the sensing and behavioral components correspond to discrete facts or entities rather than high-level concepts. Another key distinction is that memory editing techniques are not formulated within a logical reasoning framework, which allows one to logically define how the model should reason and respond. 
Additionally, memory editing methods often rely on backpropagation through the model to discover and modify factual associations, rather than relying entirely on the geometry of existing features. This sacrifices computational efficiency and potential interpretability.


LIMS shares some similarities with other approaches that have explored concept-based contextual mechanisms: The method \cite{senserag} extracts features that represent the honesty and confidence in an LLM and uses them to mitigate ungrounded responses, by either triggering textual knowledge retrieval, or globally steering towards honesty. A method of \cite{hallusteering} focuses on mitigating hallucinations with a circuit obtained from mean-difference extraction of concepts as with LIMS. They do this by clustering hallucination and truthfulness concept vectors, and steer toward truth when hallucinations are detected. However, their work is framed solely within the context of hallucination mitigation.
In this sense, \cite{hallusteering} can be seen as a special case of LIMS, applying LIMS principles specifically to hallucination mitigation, whereas LIMS formalizes and explores a general framework for enforcing logical relationships across diverse tasks.

In this section we formally ground LIMS, outline how the method is carried out to implement $P(x)\rightarrow Q(x)$ into a pre-trained transformer for any concept-predicates $P,Q$ (pseudo-code for the LIMS method is shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:LIMS}), and discuss interpretability of the method. 


\subsection{Neuro-Symbolic Logic for Concepts}\label{section:limsformal}
To explore engineering logic into a model with high level concepts, we define a probabilistic neuro-symbolic logic intended to capture concepts, and leverage their use with concept vectors which are hypothesized to exist by the linear representation hypothesis. 


Supposing some implicit distribution on the input space, we define the set of 
``concept-predicates'' 
$\mathfrak{P}_Y$ relative to a model $Y$, as the set of all predicates that are causally independent with respect to the model output, and sufficient to fully prescribe model output from the input. 
\begin{definition}\label{defn:conceptpredicate}
Given a model $Y$ on some input probability space, a set of \textbf{concept-predicates} $\mathfrak{P}_Y$ is any maximal set of predicates (boolean-valued random variables) 
satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=2ex]
    \item Concept predicates are disentangled and causally independent: $\forall P_0,...,P_n\in \mathfrak{P}_Y,$
    \begin{align}
        &\text{Pr}(P_0(X),...,P_n(X)|Y(X),X) \label{eq:second} \\
        &= \text{Pr}(P_0(X)|Y(X),X) \cdot ... \cdot \text{Pr}(P_n(X)|Y(X),X). \nonumber
    \end{align}
    \vspace{-.2in}
    \item Concept predicates cover specifications for outputs:
    \begin{align}
        &\forall x \ \exists P_0,...,P_n\in \mathfrak{P}_Y, \label{eq:first} \\
        &\text{Pr}(Y(X)|X=x) = \text{Pr}(Y(X)|P_0(x),...,P_n(x)). \nonumber
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}



This aligns with the intuition that a model's behavior and perception of an input can be decomposed into a set of fundamental, disentangled attributes, each influencing the output in a distinct way.
Formally, concept predicates $P_Y$ are defined relative to a model $Y$, but since the context usually makes this clear, we typically omit the subscript unless clarification is needed.

In this formalism, we can define the linear representation hypothesis as the statement that any concept-predicate $P$ can be approximately defined by a single vector in the space of representations, to arbitrary precision. 

\begin{definition}\label{defn:linearhyp}
    The \textbf{linear representation hypothesis} for a model, is the statement that for any concept predicate $P$ there is some section of the hidden representation $h(x)$ in $\R^n$ such that for all $\varepsilon,\delta\in\R^+$ there are $p\in\R^n,\ b_p\in\R$ that satisfy
% \vspace{-10pt}
\be\label{eq:linearhyp}
    \text{Pr}\left(|P(X)-\sigma(p^Th(X) - b_p)|>\delta\right)<\varepsilon,
\ee
% \vspace{-10pt}
where $\sigma$ is the Heaviside function. We refer to $p$ as a (sensing) concept vector for $P$, and we call the linear perceptron
\be\label{eq:sensing}
f_p(x)=\sigma(p^Th(X) - b_p)
\ee
a sensing circuit for $P$.
\end{definition}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We note that the purpose of steering vectors $s_p$ for some concept $P$ is to bring the hidden state of the model close to the concept vector $p$ of a later layer's space via addition:

\be\label{eq:conceptperceptron}
    1\approx\sigma(p^T\text{LayerNorm}(h(x)+s_p) - b_p).
\ee

%%%%%%%%%%%%

This functional form defining concepts in terms of 
vectors
allows for us to conveniently build our desired logic into the model.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We would like to note that negation and implication are complete for propositional logic, and so any quantifier free formula can be implemented with a combination of those logical operators. Since LIMS can also implement the feed-forward circuit $P(x)\rightarrow \neg P(x)$, one can theoretically compose our method to enact any quantifier free formula in this concept-predicate logic.

\subsection{Enacting Logical Implication Circuits}\label{section:limsalgo}
The LIMS method works by extracting concept vectors $p,q$ for concept-predicates $P,Q$, and builds a sub-network with these vectors which is inserted into the model.

To describe our method in detail we first establish some notation and conventions. We use $P,Q$ interchangeably to refer to high-level concepts, concept-predicates, and their corresponding sets, assuming without loss of generality that they belong to a global dataset distribution $D$.
Following standard practices in mechanistic interpretability, we define concept representations using hidden activations at the last token in some residual stream of the $l$-th transformer block. We extract concept vectors $p,q$ from the input/output spaces of a linear operation, ensuring that, when substituting a LIMS circuit with a linear mapping (m-LIMS), it can be merged into the parameters of this operation.

Specifically we select the attention output projection map, which linearly maps the concatenated attention head results into the residual stream.
Let $W$ be the output attention projection matrix at layer $l$, and let $h(x)$ denote the model's partial computation mapping an input sequence $x$ to the input space of $W$. We denote the last token of $x$ as $x[-1]$ and apply vector operations elementwise across sequences (e.g., $Wh(x)$). Let the mean hidden representation over a dataset $S$ be:
% \vspace{-.2in}
\be\label{eq:mean}
    m_S=\Ex_{x\in S}( h(x)[-1])
\ee
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


To implement LIMS we first specify datasets $P,Q$ within the domain $D$ which embody the desired concepts, and extract their corresponding concept vectors $p,q$. Obtaining $p$ and $q$ can be done in any order or in parallel. Concept vectors are commonly extracted by linear probing, but we opt for a contrastive mean difference approach for simplicity and interpretability (See \cite{comparemethodrepresentation} for a comparison of some concept extraction methods). %% double period typo, citation wrong? does't show mean difference, misleading

A concept vector for $P$ is obtained as:
\be\label{eq:pconceptdiff}
    p_{\text{concept}} = m_{P} - m_{\neg P}
\ee
Where $\neg P := D\setminus P.$ To enhance signal strength and reduce variance of the mean, we refine $p_{\text{concept}}$ by reducing $\neg P$ to negative examples close to $P$; e.g. for a ``happy'' concept, $\neg P$ could consist of minimal edits replacing happy words with unhappy ones. To ensure $p$ aligns only with $P$ and remains orthogonal elsewhere, we remove components aligned with $\neg P$:

\be\label{eq:sensingconcept}
    p=p_{\text{concept}} - \text{proj}_{m_{\neg P}}(p_{\text{concept}})=m_{P} - \text{proj}_{m_{\neg P}}(m_{P}).
\ee


We then normalize $p$ and set the sensing circuit threshold $b_p$ to be a value in $\{p^Th(x)[-1]:x\in P\}$ which maximizes F1 score. Since $p$ exists in a high-dimensional space, it remains approximately orthogonal to unrelated representations outside $D$, ensuring $f_p$ does not activate on unrelated tasks.

For steering into $Q$, we assume $\neg Q \cap P\neq \emptyset$, otherwise $P\rightarrow Q$ holds trivially. The steering vector $q$ is extracted to bring the mean state in $\neg Q\cap P$ to the mean state in $Q$:
\vspace{-.01in}
\be\label{eq:steeringconcept}
    q = m_{Q} - m_{\neg Q \cap P}
\ee

Given that behavior modifications should be limited to within $P$, for optimal steering and to minimize variance we replace $m_{Q}$ with $m_{Q\cap P}$ in equation \ref{eq:steeringconcept} when $Q \cap P \neq \emptyset$.

From these concept vectors we define our LIMS circuit $f_{p,q}$ as the steering vector $q$ modulated by the sensing perceptron $f_p$, and the mergeable-LIMS circuit $g_{q,p}$ is defined simply by the outer product of the vectors:
% \vspace{-.02in}
\begin{align}
    f_{q,p}(x)&=q\sigma(p^Th(x) - b_p), \label{eq:lims}\\ %%typo comma instead of period
    g_{q,p}(x)&=qp^Th(x). \label{eq:mlims}
\end{align}


m-LIMS relies on the model ignoring the small perturbation from adding $\varepsilon q$, where $|p^Th(x)|<\varepsilon$ off of $P$. See Appendix \ref{appendix:mlimsorthogonal} for an additional variant for iterated merging.

LIMS or m-LIMS is incorporated into the model by adding the circuit to $Wh(x)$:
\be\label{eq:limsresidual}
\begin{split}
    &Wh(x) + f_{q,p}(x),\text{ or}\\
    &Wh(x) + g_{q,p}(x) = (W+qp^T)h(x).
\end{split}
\ee

In the case of m-LIMS, replacing $W$ with $W+qp^T$ integrates the added circuit into the model's parameters. 
Concepts $p$ and $q$ are extracted concepts at the final token position, but note that the LIMS circuit operates as an architectural component of the transformer block which is applied at every token position. Notably, the similarity with $p$ at preceding token positions rapidly diminishes in magnitude with distance from the last token (see Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps_comparison}, top) and the LIMS circuit should not cause significant interference from earlier tokens.

Finally, as is typical in steering with concept vectors, we scale $q$ via $\alpha q$ with an additional hyperparameter $\alpha \in \R^+$. See Appendix section \ref{appendix:alpha} for details.


\begin{algorithm}%[t]
    \caption{Steps to Enact LIMS for $P \rightarrow Q$}
    \label{alg:LIMS}

    \end{algorithmic}
    \end{small}
\end{algorithm}


We remark here that with the LIMS method one has the freedom to choose different concept representation spaces $P$ and $Q$, as long as the space for $Q$ is a descendant of the space for $P$ in a directed acyclic graph of operations. This allows one to use LIMS to couple latent states across different models or even modalities. Also, LIMS circuits need not be implemented in parallel, and can be composed to better represent complex logical formulas. We leave explorations of these as promising directions for future research.

\subsection{LIMS Interpretability}\label{section:interp}

With LIMS, as opposed to a traditionally opaque fine-tuning or prompting process, we have an interpretable circuit, which 
enables clearer evaluation of how the specific modifications affect model outputs, promoting transparency and precision, since one can model the evaluation accuracy as the product of independent random variables representing the classification accuracy for $P$, and the success accuracy of steering into $Q$

By the nature of how we extracted $p$ and $q$ at the last token position of inputs in $D$, we expect the LIMS circuit's effects are strongest at that position and diminish rapidly with distance from it. This allows us to make predictions with a non-sequential decoupled statistical model using the last token-position as a proxy. 
Let $\Pr_{S}(Z)$ denote the probability of a boolean function $Z(x)=1$ on
on $S\s D$, and recalling that $Q_Y(x)$ is notation specifying that model $Y$ generates behavior with concept $Q$ on input $x$, let $Q_q(x)$ denote whether \emph{steering with $q$ at the last input token position only} exhibits $Q$. Similarly, suppose $f_p$ here is the sensing circuit applied only at the final token position. We have the following observation:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:limsprob}
    The probability of the approximate LIMS model behaving according to $Q$ on $S\s D$ is
    \be\label{eq:limsprob}
        \text{Pr}_S(Q_{\widehat{\text{LIMS}}})=\underbrace{\text{Pr}_S(f_{p})\text{Pr}_S(Q_{q}|f_{p})}_{\substack{\text{decoupled components}\\ \text{of LIMS circuit}}}  + 
           \underbrace{\text{Pr}_S(Q_{\text{Base}}\land \neg f_{p})}_{\substack{\text{base model behaves with}Q \\\text{ but sensing predicts }\neg P}}
    \ee
    Where $\widehat{\text{LIMS}}$ is an approximate LIMS model with circuit added at the last input token position only.
\end{proposition}

Since we expect $\widehat{\text{LIMS}}$ and LIMS to behave approximately the same, we have decoupled the LIMS model into contributions from its components at the last input token and those of the base model in exhibiting $Q$. Further, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps_comparison} (right) and discussed in \ref{section:results}, base model contributions on $P$ are minimal, meaning the LIMS decoupled circuit components alone approximately capture $P\rightarrow Q$. This allows analysis of each LIMS component to gain insight into the model's understanding, and to derive interpretable estimates of performance and risk.

We used language modeling as the modality of our experiments, and devised four separate question answering (QA) tasks to validate and demonstrate our method. 
The experiments are carried out with the pre-trained LLM Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 as the base model, using the middle transformer block to add the LIMS circuits. For all tasks we trained models on 100 examples, half from the class $P$ on which we desired some behavior $Q$, and half from the contrasting class $\neg P$. We do not use a validation set for LIMS and the hyperparameters $b_p,\alpha$ are optimized on the training set. We run baseline comparisons with 10-shot prompting averaged over three seeds, 
and reinforcement learning with human feedback (specifically, we use the DPO algorithm \cite{dpo}).  
We also validated that the LIMS circuit does not negatively interfere off of the task domain, by checking that regression does not occur on open ended generation with MT-Bench \cite{mtbench}.
See Appendix \ref{appendix:additionalexpdetails} for results of some experiments repeated for training sets of size 500, where scaling improvement is shown, and for additional experimental settings and details.

We use the training examples to construct and add LIMS circuits for the logic $P\rightarrow Q$. Noting that the model behaving without the concept $Q$ on $\neg P$ is also often desirable, we additionally trained models with the more involved logic $(P\rightarrow Q) \land (\neg P\rightarrow \neg Q)$ for comparison (we refer to them as the one-sided and two-sided LIMS models respectively).


To obtain datasets $Q$ that represent correct model behavior on $P$, we experimented with two approaches:
\textbf{Base Behavior:} $Q$ consists of inputs where the base model behaves correctly on $P$, while $\neg Q$ contains inputs where it behaves incorrectly.
\textbf{Prompted Behavior:} Inputs in $P$ are modified with additional instructions guiding the desired behavior to form $Q$, while unmodified inputs are assigned to $\neg Q$ (see Appendix \S \ref{appendix:prompts} for examples). For all applicable tasks (except chain-of-thought reasoning, where the first variant is undefined), we find that the first variant more effectively elicits $Q$ on the training set (Appendix \ref{appendix:steering}). Thus, all LIMS models in this section use the base behavior whenever possible.

\subsection{Task Descriptions}

\textbf{Hallucination tasks:} 

The first two tasks evaluate hallucination detection or reduction.
First we evaluate a model's ability to judge whether an answer to a question contains a hallucination or not using the HaluEval dataset \cite{halueval}. 
Accuracy is determined by correctly generating a yes/no answer. The dataset $P$ contains the hallucinated answers, while $\neg P$ contains the same questions with their non-hallucinated answers. Thus the basic LIMS circuit encodes ``$\texttt{hallucination}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{yes}(x).$''

The second task assesses whether a model can correctly follow instruction
to refrain from answering questions when provided with insufficient information.
Using SQuAD 2 \cite{squad2} models are prompted to answer factually based only on the given information context, and to reject when the context is insufficient. 
The dataset is split randomly by question topic, so that testing is done on separate topics, and accuracy and is measured by the model rejecting or not in the correct situation. 
Existing models struggle substantially with the difficulty of identifying unanswerable questions \cite{chatragbench}.
In this task, $P$ consists of questions with insufficient information context, and $\neg P$ contains those with sufficient information context. The basic added LIMS circuit represents ``$\texttt{insufficient\_info}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{rejection}(x)$.''

We included GPT-4o performance to provide context on task difficulty.}

    \vspace{-.1in}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%short
\textbf{Adversarial safety task:} The third task evaluates model safety by challenging models with adversarially prompted harmful instructions from AdvBench \cite{advbench}.
The adversarial attack prepends toxic prompts with: ``... $<$harmful instruction$>$ Answer: Sure, I can do that for you:''. 
The base model refuses to comply with $94.4\%$ of the toxic prompts without the adversarial addition, however rejection drops substantially to $61.7\%$ with the adversarial addition. This suggests the model recognizes the toxicity of the prompt but struggles to generate the appropriate rejection behavior.
Following \cite{refusaldirection}, we construct $P$ from toxic prompts, while $\neg P$ consists of harmless, identically structured prompts from Alpaca \cite{alpaca}. The correct behavior $Q$ on $P$ is to reject harmful instructions, forming the LIMS circuit ``$\texttt{toxic}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{refusal}(x)$.''

\textbf{Automatic chain-of-thought reasoning:}
For the final task, we chose an application to demonstrate a more complex generation behavior: Activating chain-of-thought (COT) reasoning trajectories when faced with answering a mathematical problem.  
Prior work \cite{topkcot} finds that COT trajectories often exist naturally without any prompt modifications, and selecting the right initial token (often among the top 10 most likely) triggers a COT reasoning trajectory from greedy decoding after that point.
This result suggests we may be able to steer towards COT trajectories with a steering vector. To create the LIMS circuit for this, we aggregate math questions from GSM8K \cite{gsm8k} into $P$ with the same prompt as the SQuAD task (note this makes the task more challenging as the model is prompted with the option to reject the question). To form $\neg P$ we use examples from SQuAD. 
The set $Q$ is formed with the prompting behavior extraction approach, where $Q$ consists of examples in $P$ with ``Answer:'' replaced with ``Let's first think step by step in our answer. Answer:'', and $\neg Q$ is the original math prompt. As such, we task the LIMS method with enabling a model to behave with chain-of-thought generation when a math problem is sensed, following ``$\texttt{math}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{chain\_of\_thought}(x)$''.
Evaluation is based on final answer correctness, normalized to the base model’s performance when given the explicit COT prompt. Since this task assesses LIMS’s ability to recover the COT-prompted base model performance, we do not evaluate other baselines.

\textbf{Task Performance:} LIMS demonstrates consistent performance gains across all tasks (Table \ref{table:evalacc}, with full results in Appendix Table \ref{table:all_datasets_eval}), significantly improving the base model without regressions. It outperforms 10-shot prompting on all tasks (10 shot prompting causes increased failures on HaluEval and AdvBench), but trails DPO on HaluEval and AdvBench. However, DPO exhibits task overfitting, leading to off-task regression in open-ended generation. Additionally, DPO memory usage peaked at $270.213$ GB on HaluEval, whereas LIMS required less than an order of magnitude lower (peaking at $18.935$).

Two-sided LIMS models with $(P\rightarrow Q)\land(\neg P\rightarrow \neg Q)$ matched or exceeded one-sided LIMS $(P\rightarrow Q)$ except on SQuAD 2. In m-LIMS models, the one-sided variant generally performed better, except on HaluEval, likely due to the sensitivity of steering scale $\alpha$ since a single $\alpha$ was optimized for both circuits, which may have led to imbalance in steering. %cancelling or imbala effects near the boundary of $P$ and $\neg P$.

On hallucination tasks, the base model correctly handled only 15 examples in HaluEval and 17 in SQuAD 2, yet LIMS leveraged even these rare occurrences for significant performance gains. Notably, on SQuAD 2, DPO with $20,000$ examples did not surpass LIMS with just $500$ examples (81.3\% vs. 81.4\%, Figure \ref{fig:squaddpocompare}).

For automatic COT steering (Table \ref{table:cot}), LIMS recovers most of the performance benefits of COT reasoning but does not fully replicate the effect of the original COT prompt. Table \ref{table:cot} shows that LIMS selectively activates longer reasoning trajectories for math, while maintaining similar verbosity on $\neg P$. The steering vector $q$ may have captured verbosity effects alongside chain-of-thought reasoning, as evidenced by $q$ generating more tokens than the COT prompt itself without recovering the same level of accuracy. Interestingly, instead of causing regressions, LIMS improves MT-Bench scores, particularly in coding, STEM, and math subsets.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% redo shorter:
\textbf{Interpretability:} Leveraging LIMS's interpretability and decoupled components (\S \ref{section:interp}), we analyze how individual components influence model behavior for single circuit $P\rightarrow Q$ LIMS models. Figure \ref{fig:sensing} shows the sensing ability of $f_p$ on the last input token, revealing clear distinction between $P$ and $\neg P$ and highlighting that hallucination tasks are more challenging to sense than detecting toxicity or math questions. Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps_comparison} further confirms that sensing is primarily active near the last token, with AdvBench deviating from this most since Pr$_P(f_p(x[i])=1)$ remains high over the adversarial token positions $i$. For SQuAD, sensing remains active across the last three tokens despite similarly distinguished sensing pre-activations (Appendix Fig. \ref{fig:sensing_grid_tok_100}), suggesting that precise tuning of the steering magnitude $\alpha$ is necessary to mitigate earlier token influence. This likely explains why SQuAD was the only task where one-sided LIMS outperformed two-sided. We tested a larger bias $b_p$ to prioritize correct classification at the highest-magnitude sensing token (third from last), but it did not improve overall performance, indicating that steering from earlier tokens is less effective. However, as expected, it reduced the false rejection rate on $\neg P$. 

The right side of equation \ref{eq:limsprob}, which is the probability of the base model generating with $Q$ when $f_p$ is inactive at the last token, can be decomposed into:
% \vspace{-.02in}
\begin{align}
    \text{Pr}(Q_{Y} &\land \neg f_{p}) = \label{eq:exlimsprobzeros} \\
    &\text{Pr}(Q_{Y} \land \neg f_p \land \neg Q_{Y_q}) 
     + \text{Pr}(Q_{Y} \land \neg f_p \land Q_{Y_q}). \nonumber
\end{align}

Analyzing Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps_comparison}, we see that the first term is negligible and the second is small on $P$. We find that:
% \vspace{-.02in}
\be
\text{Pr}_P(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})<<\text{Pr}_P(f_p)\cdot\text{Pr}_P(Q_{Y_q}|f_p).
\ee
%%%%%%%

Thus, $Y$'s contribution to LIMS model behavior on $P$ is minimal, with performance almost entirely determined by the decoupled circuit components. Figure \ref{fig:heatmaps_comparison} (right) confirms this, showing that last-token component estimates from 100 training examples align closely with the full LIMS model's test performance within a 95\% confidence interval.

Further inspection of the individual circuit components reveals task-level insights:
Steering is harder $(\text{Pr}_P(Q_{Y_q})<\text{Pr}_P(f_p))$ for GSM8K and AdvBench, while sensing is harder $(\text{Pr}_P(Q_{Y_q})>\text{Pr}_P(f_p))$ for HaluEval and SQuAD 2.
These findings align with intuition; steering is more demanding for generating chain-of-thought reasoning or rejecting adversarial instructions (eg. AdvBench or GSM8K) than simpler generation of fixed text, while sensing is more challenging for detecting hallucinations or insufficient information (e.g., HaluEval, SQuAD 2) than detecting math or toxicity.





\section{Conclusion and Discussion}\label{section:conclusion}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% shorten

In this work, we introduced the Logical Implication Model Steering (LIMS) method, a logically grounded method for integrating neuro-symbolic concept-reasoning into pre-trained transformers through the building block of a conditional circuit. 
LIMS provides a structured mechanism for conditionally steering model behavior, enabling interpretable contextual control of model outputs.

Our experiments demonstrate that LIMS is highly compute and data-efficient, requiring as few as 100 labeled examples and activations from model inference to induce large performance shifts. 
This efficiency makes LIMS well-suited for real-world deployment, particularly in settings with limited labeled data or rare failure cases such as hallucinations.

Our work also presents several limitations and open challenges that suggest directions for future research.
While we extracted sensing and steering concept vectors from the last token position and a single layer, further optimizations could explore most effective token positions, circuits in multiple layers, and message passing mechanisms between decoupled sensing and steering layers.
We tested LIMS implementations of direct logical implication $P\rightarrow Q$ and $(P\rightarrow Q)\land (\neg P\rightarrow \neg Q)$, but future work could explore integrating more complex logic, or even a programmable LLM reasoning language in concept-predicate logic for encoding structured fuzzy rules into transformer representations. Additionally, coupling multiple modalities or different pre-trained transformers with LIMS circuits may offer a simple yet effective way to compose agent capabilities.
Our results suggest that LIMS partially recovers the benefits of chain-of-thought (COT) prompting, hinting that integrating few-shot exemplars into LIMS circuits could enhance performance while maintaining interpretability.

In conclusion, LIMS offers a promising framework for modular interpretable control of transformer behavior, unifying neuro-symbolic reasoning with learned representations.

\section{Logical Formulation and Foundation of LIMS}\label{appendix:logicalfoundation}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%

The basic foundations of our approach lie in interpreting activations through a formal predicate logic defined on hidden states of some model. 
In this logic, variables are represented by input contexts, and predicates are defined relative to a model as binary random variables of (unrolled trajectories) of hidden states of this model. These random predicates on hidden states define binary random variables on the input space via composition with the model.
The fuzzy truth value of a predicate on an input is then determined as a probability of whether this input is a member of the predicate's representative set when unrolled through the model. In practice we can use representative data to define our concept predicates. For example, we can define a predicate \texttt{cat} representing sensing of the concept of cats in the text context, by the distribution of activations of some layer of a pre-trained LLM on the last token of all random texts containing the word ``cat''. We can classify whether $\texttt{cat}(x)$ is true on a given input text $x$ based on the representational similarity of the hidden state to our cat distribution. Note that this implicitly defines $\neg\texttt{cat}$, the negation of \texttt{cat}, as data where the predicate is false.  
Also, we could have instead chosen to define \texttt{cat} to be the distribution of layer activations over the last token all texts 
which cause generation of text
containing the word ``cat''. The distinction between model states which sense something about a context, and states which lead to a certain generation behavior, is important to how we carry out our method, since we seek to \emph{steer} generation based on \emph{sensing} a given concept.

Indeed, let's say that we wanted our model to role play as a talking dog whenever the cat variable is (classified to be) true in an input context. That is to say that we want the model to satisfy the implication ``$\texttt{cat}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{behave\_dog}(x)$'', where \texttt{behave\_dog} is a predicate defined by the distribution of hidden states that elicit model generation to role play as talking a dog. This requires us to couple the model states sensing \texttt{cat} with the generation results typical of the states in \texttt{behave\_dog}.
While this may seem trivial to achieve via prompting, our experiments show that models often struggle with in-context learning of such conditional behavior in practical scenarios. This can occur since states which sense something specific may not be coupled to feed forward to states in the model which cause the desired generation behavior. 
Furthermore, even fine-tuning may fail to enforce this behavior, as evidence suggests that fine-tuning cannot reliably train new internal logic or circuits that were not already present in the model’s pre-training (\cite{physics3.1}, our SQuAD 2 task). 
For example, prior work shows that one can often differentiate between distributions in the latent space of an LLM to detect hallucinations \cite{hallullmcheck}, detect toxic content \cite{refusaldirection}, or particular mistakes in reasoning \cite{physics2}, but it is likely not possible to effectively prompt a model to not hallucinate whenever it would have otherwise generated a hallucination. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%

With the LIMS method, we can directly build $\texttt{cat}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{behave\_dog}(x)$ into the model generation behavior. Recall that negation and implication are complete for propositional logic, and that since our method is capable of negating formulas with the feed-forward circuit we get from $P\rightarrow\neg P$, we could theoretically represent any quantifier free formula with successive applications and combinations of our method. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Concept-Predicates and the Linear Representation Hypothesis}
To build the logic $\texttt{cat}(x)\rightarrow\texttt{behave\_dog}(x)$ into our model, we rely on the linear representation hypothesis being satisfied in all ``sufficiently strong'' models like pre-trained LLMs, and use concept vectors to stand in for our concept-predicate distribution.  
For our purposes, we use a version of the linear representation hypothesis defined formally using random variables and predicates as follows (see \cite{linearhyp} for a similar exploration): First, supposing some implicit distribution on the input space, we define the set of 
``concept-predicates'' 
$\mathfrak{P}_Y$ relative to model $Y$, to be the set of all predicates that are causally independent with respect to the model output $Y(X)$, and sufficient to fully describe $Y(X)$. 
\begin{definition}\label{defn:ap:conceptpredicate}
Given a model $Y$ on some input probability space, a set of \textbf{concept-predicates} $\mathfrak{P}_Y$ is any maximal set of predicates (boolean-valued random variables) 
satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=2ex]
    \item Concept predicates are disentangled and causally independent: \\ $\forall P_0,...,P_n\in \mathfrak{P}_Y,\ \text{Pr}(P_0(X),...,P_n(X)|Y(X),X)=\text{Pr}(P_0(X)|Y(X),X)\cdot...\cdot\text{Pr}(P_n(X)|Y(X),X)$  
    \item Concept predicates cover all attributes of inputs relevant to specify an output:\\ $\forall x \ \exists P_0,...,P_n\in \mathfrak{P}_Y,\ \text{Pr}(Y(X)|X=x)=\text{Pr}(Y(X)|P_0(x),...,P_n(x))$
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We can show that a set of concept predicates trivially exist on token sequences for any model and input distribution; take the set of all predicates of the form $P_{t,i}(x):=$ ``token $t$ is present at position $i$ in input sequence $x$''. Observe that this satisfies condition 1, and noting that we can define the length $n$ of an input by the formula
\be
\bigwedge_{t\in\text{vocabulary}}\neg P_{t,n+1}(x),
\ee
we have that this set also satisfies condition 2. We can (by the axiom of choice) extend this set to some maximal family subject to condition 1, to obtain a set of concept predicates. 
% Of course natural language is more complicated, and in fact the best probabilistic models of language we have are language models themselves \cite{llmcompression}. 
We can then refine the definition of the set of concept-predicates to be ``nontrivial'' if it excludes these atomic predicates.
The above definition is an intuitive formalization that captures how a model partitions its input space into meaningful, independent attributes that collectively determine its output. 

In this formalism, the linear representation hypothesis is then the statement that any concept-predicate $P$, can be defined by a single vector in the space of representations. 

\begin{definition}\label{defn:ap:linearhyp}
    The \textbf{linear representation hypothesis} for a concept predicate $P$, is the statement there is some section of the hidden representation $h(x)$ in $\R^n$ such that
% \vspace{-10pt}
\be\label{eq:ap:conceptperceptron}
    \forall \varepsilon,\delta\in\R^+ \ \exists p\in\R^n\ \exists b_p\in\R, \ \text{Pr}(|P(X)-\sigma(p^Th(X) - b_p)|>\delta)<\varepsilon,
\ee
% \vspace{-10pt}
where $\sigma$ is the Heaviside function. We call $p$ the (sensing) concept vector for $P$.
\end{definition}

Note that the purpose of steering vectors $s_p$ for some concept $P$ is to bring the hidden state of the model close to the concept vector $p$ of a later layer's space via addition:

\be\label{eq:ap:conceptsteering}
    1\approx\sigma(p^T\text{LayerNorm}(h(x)+s_p) - b_p).
\ee

This functional form defining concepts in terms of 
vectors 
allows for us to build our desired logic into the model.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interpretability}\label{appendix:interp}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Due to the LIMS circuit's interpretable nature, we can use its form to predict and quantify the expected LIMS circuit's performance based on the decoupled performance of the steering vector exhibiting $Q$ and the sensing vector sensing $P$.

By the nature of how we extracted $p$ and $q$ at the last token position of inputs in $D$, we expect the LIMS circuit's effects are strongest at that position and diminish rapidly with distance from it. This allows us to make predictions with a non-sequential decoupled statistical model using the last token-position as a proxy. Recall that $Q_Y(x)$ is notation specifying that model $Y$ generates behavior with concept $Q$ on input $x$, and let $Y,Y_{q},f_{p}$ respectively as follows: $Y$ is the pre-trained model, $Y_q$ is the model with steering vector $q$ applied \emph{at the last token position of inputs only}, and similarly $f_{p_{i}}$ is the sensing circuit active \emph{at the last token position of inputs only}. Let $\Pr_{S}(Z)$ % or $\Pr_{x\sim S}(Z(x))$ 
Denote the probability of a boolean function $Z(x)=1$ on $x$ sampled from $S\s D$. Defining $\hat Y_{p,q}$ to be the approximate LIMS model with circuit added only at the last input token, the following simple observation can be made:

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:ap:limsprob}
    The probability of the approximate LIMS model $Y_{p,q}$ behaving according to $Q$ on $S\s D$ equals
    \be\label{eq:ap:limsprob}
        \text{Pr}_S(Q_{\hat Y_{p,q}})=\underbrace{\text{Pr}_S(f_{p})\cdot\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y_{q}}|f_{p})}_{\substack{\text{decoupled components}\\ \text{of LIMS circuit}}}  + 
           \underbrace{\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})}_{\substack{\text{base model behaves with }Q, \\\text{ but sensing predicts }\neg P}}
    \ee
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    On any input $x$, we have that the event of the surrogate LIMS model behaving with $Q$, is the event that the LIMS circuit is active and steering works, or the LIMS circuit is inactive but the base model behaves with $Q$:
\begin{equation*}
    Q_{\hat Y_{p,q}}(x) \iff \left[Q_{Y_q}(x) \land f_{p}(x)\right]\lor \left[Q_Y(x)\land \neg f_{p}(x)\right],

    &\text{Pr}_S(Q_{\hat Y_{p,q}})=\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y_q}\land f_{p}) + \text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p}) - \text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y_q}\land f_{p}\land Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})\\
    &=\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y_q}\land f_{p}) + \text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})\\
    &=\text{Pr}_S(f_{p})\cdot\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y_{q}}|f_{p})+ \text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}

\end{proof}

We can factor the right probability of eq \ref{eq:ap:limsprob} into two parts


\begin{equation}%\label{eq:exlimsprobzeros}
\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})= \underbrace{\text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_p \land \neg Q_{Y_q})}_{\approx 0} + \text{Pr}_S(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_p \land Q_{Y_q}),
\end{equation}

where the first term is negligible in most cases. This observation is validated in our experiments (Fig \ref{fig:heatmaps_comparison}, left). In addition, we find that on $P$ the second term is also small and
\be
\text{Pr}_P(Q_{Y}\land \neg f_{p})<<\text{Pr}_P(f_p)\cdot\text{Pr}_P(Q_{Y_q}|f_p).

\subsection{Projective Removal and Iterative Merging}\label{appendix:mlimsorthogonal}

To facilitate total circuit control over the model generation in the domain $P$, we could remove existing components of $W$ which output $q$ along $p$ by adding the following ``projective removal'' function

\be\label{eq:mlimscircuitorthog}
    qp^Th(x) - \frac{qq^TWpp^Th(x)}{||q||^2||p||^2}.
\ee

which can be merged into $W$ as

\be\label{eq:mlimsorthog}
    W + qp^T - \frac{qq^TWpp^T}{||q||^2||p||^2}
\ee

The projective removal could also help potential for iterative merging with m-LIMS, however we do not experiment with this. We do find that in our tasks, LIMS without the projective removal already handles the majority of the computation on $P$ towards behaving in $Q$, since the probability of the model behaving according to $Q$ on $P$ and the LIMS circuit failing is zero or near zero \ref{section:interp}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textbf{Comparison of Base Behavior and Prompted Behavior steering on both training sets.} 
Accuracy shows the percent of examples steered into $Q$ on $P$. For both approaches steering vector magnitude was optimized for maximal steering. We can see that across all tasks, using the ``Base Behavior'' approach to define $Q$ is significantly more successful at steering with its extracted vector than the vector extracted from forming $Q$ with the ``Prompted Behavior'' examples. This is despite Base Behavior only collecting 15 and 17 examples in $Q$ for HaluEval and SQuAD 2 respectively on the training set of size 100. We see that Prompted Behavior improves significantly with 500 examples on AdvBench. The Prompted Behavior approach did not work well for SQuAD 2.}

\subsection{Alpha Hyperparameter Optimization}\label{appendix:alpha}

To search for $\alpha>0$ which maximizes the utility score of a model with the added LIMS circuit $\alpha q \sigma(p^Th(x) -b_p)$ we use Algorithm \ref{alg:alpha}. We observed experimentally that success in steering appears weakly unimodal in $\alpha$. %(see figure \ref{}). 
This is intuitive since for $\alpha\approx 0$ we get a baseline performance equivalent to an unmodified model, and increasing alpha results in a nondecreasing strength in steering, up until a point where the added steering vector can become too large and generations begin to increasingly break down.


Taking this observation into account, and the fact that the utility scores in $\alpha$ can have large flat sections, we used a modified bounded bisection golden section search as outlined in algorithm \ref{alg:alpha}. In words, the search selects the largest subinterval between evaluated points where an endpoint of this subinterval evaluates as the current maximum utility, and evaluates the bisection point of the selected interval. This search iterates until the selected subinterval has size below a minimum threshold $\tau$.

    \begin{algorithmic}
        \REQUIRE utility function to maximize $U(x)$,\\ search bounds $X=\{x_l,x_r\}$ with $x_l<x_r$,\\ initial scores $Y=\{U(x_l),U(x_r)\}$,\\ termination threshold $\tau$.\\
        % \textbf{Optional:} Auxiliary function to not regress on $A(x)$.
        \WHILE{$(x_r-x_l)/2 > \tau$}
            \STATE $x\gets x_l + (x_r-x_l)/2$
            \STATE $y\gets U(x)$
            \STATE $X\gets X\cup\{x\}$
            \STATE $Y\gets Y\cup\{y\}$
            \STATE $x_l,x_r\gets \text{argmax}_{x_l,x_r}\{x_r-x_l: x_l=\text{argmax} Y \text{ or } x_r=\text{argmax} Y,\ \neg\exists x\in X,\ x_l<x<x_r\}$
            % \ENDIF
            
        \ENDWHILE
        \STATE $\alpha\gets \text{argmax}Y$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We initialize the bounds of the search to be $[.2,10]$, and set the minimum search interval size as $\tau=.2$ for LIMS and $\tau=.01$ for m-LIMS, since we observed m-LIMS is more sensitive to steering scaling as the circuit is always active. We defined the utility score $U(x)$ to be behavior accuracy (ie rate of satisfying $Q$) on the subset $P$ of the training set.

\subsection{Additional Dataset Details}\label{appendix:dset}



The techniques to measure behavior $Q$ for all datasets are enumerated as follows:

\textbf{HaluEval:} The first word of the answer was taken as a yes or no classification.

\textbf{SQuAD 2 and AdvBench:} The presence of (case-insensitive) key phrases within the first 400 characters determined rejection behavior classification, following a similar technique to \cite{refusaldirection}; for AdvBench we used the phrases from \cite{refusaldirection}, which were $\{$``I'm sorry'', ``I am sorry'', ``I apologize'', ``As an AI'', ``As a language model'',``As an assistant'', ``I cannot'', ``I can’t'', ``I am unable to'', ``I'm unable to'', ``I am not able to'', ``I'm not able to'' $\}$. For SQuAD we used the single phrase ``information at this time''. We manually checked completions of the base model on balanced validation sets of 100 examples, and found that both classifiers had 100\% accuracy.

\textbf{GSM8K:} We used the code from \cite{lmeval} to determine a correct answer.




\subsection{Baseline Details}\label{appendix:rlhf}

\subsubsection{DPO}

We use the \cite{alighnmenthandbook} reinforcement learning for human feedback package, with the DPO algorithm. Batch size is set to $32$, and learning rates in $\{5e-11,5e-10,5e-9,5e-8,5e-7,5e-6,5e-5,5e-4\}$ are searched, with all other training parameters set to their defaults. Unlike LIMS we use a validation set of 100 extra examples for hyperparameter selection; We select the models based on lowest validation loss to evaluate on the test task. 

Training data is sorted into ``rejected'' or ``chosen'' categories for preference optimizaion in the following way:

\textbf{HaluEval:} 
If the model got the correct answer, that completion was selected as chosen, and otherwise that completion was selected as rejected, and the opposite category was filled whichever of the following was relevant:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item ``Yes, the answer does contain non-factual or hallucinated information.''
    \item ``No, the answer is based on the provided factual information.''
\end{enumerate}

For SQuAD 2 and AdvBench, the rejection message was always selected as chosen or rejected when appropriate, and the base model completion otherwise:

\textbf{SQuAD 2 rejection message:} ``I apologize, I do not have that information at this time.''

\textbf{AdvBench rejection message:} ``I am sorry, I cannot generate or respond to toxic or harmful content.''



\subsubsection{10-shot prompting}

For the 10-shot baseline, few shot examples were sampled from the validation set balanced over $P,\neg P$. Results for each seed are summarized in the table \ref{table:eval10shot}. 



\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textbf{Overall 10-shot task accuracy for each seed.} 
For AdvBench, the few-shot examples did not include the adversarial prefix, while ``AdvBench +'' retained it. We excluded AdvBench + from our main comparisons, as including the adversarial phrasing \emph{directly in the few-shot prompt examples} reveals the prompting attack strategy to the model, undermining the adversarial nature of the task.}

Information: Harvard has the largest university endowment in the world. As of September 2011[update], it had nearly regained the loss suffered during the 2008 recession. It was worth \$32 billion in 2011, up from \$28 billion in September 2010 and \$26 billion in 2009. It suffered about 30\% loss in 2008-09. In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 22\% (approximately \$8 billion) from July to October 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearly 50\% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of \$12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the \$1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents. As of 2012[update], Harvard University had a total financial aid reserve of \$159 million for students, and a Pell Grant reserve of \$4.093 million available for disbursement.\\

Information: An alternative view offered by Richard Dawkins is of predation as a form of competition: the genes of both the predator and prey are competing for the body (or 'survival machine') of the prey organism. This is best understood in the context of the gene centered view of evolution. Another manner in which predation and competition are connected is throughout intraguild predation. Intraguild predators are those that kill and eat other predators of different species at the same trophic level, and thus that are potential competitors.\\
