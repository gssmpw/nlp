3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a scene and represent them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic labels. 
%当前 transformer-based方法由于其 end-to-end training, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance越来越受到研究者的关注。
Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention due to their elegant pipelines, reduced manual selection of geometric properties, and superior performance.
%然而，当前的transformer-based方法在query初始化的时候无法兼顾position and content information。以及由于逐decoder层监督的缘故，存在着object disappearance with the deepening of layers的现象。
However, transformer-based methods fail to simultaneously maintain strong position and content information during query initialization. Additionally, due to supervision at each decoder layer, there exists a phenomenon of object disappearance with the deepening of layers.
%
To overcome these hurdles, we introduce Beyond the Final Layer: Hierarchical Query
Fusion Transformer with Agent-Interpolation
Initialization for 3D Instance Segmentation (BFL). 
%
Specifically, an Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module is designed to generate resilient queries capable of achieving a balance between foreground coverage and content learning.
%
Additionally, a Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder is designed to retain low overlap queries, mitigating the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers. 
%
Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet200, ScanNet++ and S3DIS datasets 
demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.
