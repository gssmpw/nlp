In this paper, we propose a novel 3D instance segmentation method termed BFL.

To generate queries capable of achieving a nuanced balance between foreground coverage and content learning, we promose the Agent-Interpolation Initialization Module.
Furthermore, the well-designed Hierarchical Query Fusion Decoder mitigates the decrease in recall with the deepening of layers.
Extensive experiments conducted on the several datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BFL.
