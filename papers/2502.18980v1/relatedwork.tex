\subsection{Tool Learning in LLMs}
Tool learning aims at extending the capabilities of LLMs by equipping them with external tools to solve tasks like weather inquiry, car navigation, and restaurant reservation. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating the tool learning proficiency of LLMs in addressing user instructions, from aspects such as 
% tool usage awareness~\cite{huang2024metatool}, 
tool selection and calling accuracy~\cite{xu-etal-2024-enhancing-tool,NEURIPS2024_8a75ee6d,ye-etal-2024-rotbench,wang2025mtubench}, tool planning ability~\cite{basu-etal-2024-api,wang-etal-2024-appbench,NEURIPS2024_085185ea,liu2025toolace}, and complex workflow creation~\cite{shen2025shortcutsbench,qiao2025benchmarking,fan2025workflowllm}. To improve tool-use capabilities, various strategies have been introduced, including in-context learning which enables LLMs to use tools via documentation~\cite{yuan2024easytool,shi-etal-2024-learning,qu2025from},
% (Hsieh et al., 2023), 
and fine-tuning which trains LLMs on specialized tool-use datasets~\cite{zhuang2024toolchain,chen2024advancing,chen2025learning}. However, prior studies neglect the crucial role of personalized tool usage in LLMs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing personalized tool learning, developing a comprehensive benchmark for evaluation, and proposing an optimization strategy to enhance personalized tool-use capabilities in LLMs.

\subsection{Personalization in LLMs}
The goal of personalization in LLMs is to leverage personal user data, such as historical behaviors and background information, to generate outputs that better align with the user preferences~\cite{tseng-etal-2024-two}.
% (Chen et al., 2023e; Deshpande et al., 2024). 
Approaches such as fine-tuning~\cite{cai2025large} and prompt engineering~\cite{yuan-etal-2025-personalized}
% , and user-specific embeddings 
have been explored to adapt LLMs to individual or domain-specific tasks. These approaches have been applied across various fields, including recommendation systems~\cite{lyu-etal-2024-llm}, search engines~\cite{10.1145/3589334.3645482}, education~\cite{liu2024socraticlm}, 
% healthcare, 
and dialogue generation~\cite{wang-etal-2023-target}. However, previous research has not investigated LLMs' personalization in the area of tool learning. In this work, we bridge this gap by incorporating user's interaction history to assess and enhance the LLMs' capability in providing personalized tool-usage assistance for specific users.

% Due to the lack of real personal data on tool-usage, we adopt a tool-driven approach to simulate user data by leveraging tool attributes to construct user preferences and interaction history.

% We collect a bunch of high-quality tools from RapidAPI.

% Then we leverage LLM to understand the functionality and non-functional attributes of each tool. 
% (2) Preference Construction. 
% % We leverage the obtained tool attributes to construct the user preferences on tools.
% We classify tools with the same functionalities into groups. 
% Within each functionality group, we construct the user preferences by

% % for a specific user. 
% To enrich the user preference, we use the preferred tool to retrieve more tools with similar non-functional attributes.
% % The preferred tool will also be used to retrieve more tools with similar non-functional attributes to be the user's preferred tool .
% In this way, we can obtain a bunch of preferred and non-preferred tools representing different user preferences.
% % After multiple functionality groups, we can obtain a number of preferred and non-preferred tools representing .
% % all serving as preferred tools for the specific user.  
% (3) Data Creation. 
% Based on the user preference, we generate the user's interaction history as a sequence of tool-use interactions, each containing a user instruction and a corresponding tool call by LLM. The interaction history is constructed in three types: 1) \textit{preferred-only} history, which only includes the user's preferred tools ; 2) \textit{rating-integrated} history, integrating user's binary ratings on each tool call according to user preferences; and 3) \textit{chronological} history, where interactions are arranged in time order to capture changes in user preferences over time. 
% % both preferred and non-preferred tools with binary ratings reflecting the user's preference;
