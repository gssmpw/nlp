    \caption{Example of randomly sampled AlphaGeometry problems. For each row, the first element describes the randomly sampled AlphaGeometry problem and the others are the geometric premises, diagram, and GeoCLIP-style caption that can be obtained from the AlphaGeometry problem. Note that the GeoCLIP-style caption can be obtained by filtering certain geometric properties, e.g., angle measure, perpendicularity, and concyclicity, from the geometric premises.}
