\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose a domain-agnostic PGPS method, \geovlm{}, by implementing a synthetic data engine and proposing a contrastive learning framework with domain adaptation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of \geovlm{} in visual feature perception at both VLM and vision encoder levels by evaluating on the MathVerse and through a newly proposed geometric feature recognition benchmark for vision encoders.
Eventually, the reasoning ability in plane geometry problems is enhanced with the improved perceptual capabilities.
% We hope that the research advances explainability of the PGPS process and expands the solvable domains of plane geometry problems.
