\section*{Limitations}

In this work, we present a domain-agnostic VLM for PGPS by refining the vision encoder. Although our VLM exhibits strong performance in recognizing visual features, its coverage remains limited to geometric premises.
Building on the success of the synthetic data engine and contrastive learning, extending this combination to different kinds of visual features, e.g., sub-structures in molecular graphs~\citep{molvf}, statistics from charts~\citep{chartqa}, and solid geometry, promises further improvements in recognition of VLM. Due to the limitations in the experimental environment, we are unable to test LLMs with more than 30B parameters.

% Because the training data only represents plane geometry problems, other types of geometry problems, e.g., solid, projective, and non-Euclidean geometry, are remaining underexplored.
% Developing solution program language and accompanying datasets for these areas would enable broader research on improving VLM reasoning capabilities across diverse geometry domains.
% Another limitation of our work is that the efficacy of the formal languages
