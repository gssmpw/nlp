Oracle BoN is the upper bound on our BoN calculated with the ground truth labels. RM\_0 is BoN calculated with a reward model trained on the base(instruct) rollouts of the model. RS is the RM trained using rejection sampling. oDPO is the RM trained using oDPO. We expect the trend RM\_0 $<$ RS $<$ oDPO $<$ oracle}}
