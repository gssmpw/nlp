\caption{ 
A qualitative example of multi-turn BoN search using dense rewards obtained via the learned verifier in \method. 
Here, we show the top 3 ranked solutions at each turn $t$ where $R_{\phi}(x, y_t^i) \geq R_{\phi}(x, y_t^j)$ for $i < j$.
We observe that the learned verifier selects the better solution (in orange) at each turn. The selected solution is passed to public tests to retrieve execution feedback for the generator to improve the next code solution. The selected solution at each turn is better than the last (less errors highlighted in yellow), with the final solution passing all tests. Note that there are 2 correct solutions at the final turn.
