\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1mm}
In this paper, we propose BOMS, an active and sample-efficient model selection framework for offline MBRL, by recasting model selection as a BO problem. One critical novelty is the proposed model-induced kernel, which is theoretically grounded and enables GP posterior inference in BOMS.
%Through extensive empirical evaluation, we validate several key design choices of BOMS and show that BOMS significantly outperforms the existing model selection methods through only a small amount of online interactions. 
We expect that BOMS can be integrated with various offline MBRL methods for reliable model selection.
%, which indicates that our result is better than other model distance selection methods and that BOMS can select a high-quality dynamics model effectively and efficiently. 
%utilizes Bayesian Optimization with limited environment interactions to select a dynamics model with better performance. 
%We also define the dynamics model distance as the models' output difference to help the kernel in BO capture the correlation between models. 
%In the experiment results, we show that BOMS outperforms other baselines and ablations, which indicates that our result is better than other model distance selection methods and that BOMS can select a high-quality dynamics model effectively and efficiently.
