Several LLMs have already been applied in communication. For instance, TSpec-LLM leverages open-source datasets combined with  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance LLMsâ€™ understanding of 3GPP standards, improving their precision in document analysis and response \cite{nikbakht2024tspec}. Tele-LLM is a specialized LLM tailored for telecommunications, leveraging customized datasets to improve its expertise in this field \cite{RN17}. Similarly, TelecomGPT introduces a telecommunications-specific LLM training framework that fine-tunes general LLMs to achieve exceptional performance on telecom-specific tasks \cite{zou2024telecomgpt}. These advancements underscore the significant potential of LLMs in enhancing the intelligence of 6G networks.
