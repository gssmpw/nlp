Several LLMs have already been applied in communication. For instance, TSpec-LLM leverages open-source datasets combined with  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance LLMsâ€™ understanding of 3GPP standards, improving their precision in document analysis and response **Radford et al., "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Models through Self-Regularized Reinforcement Learning"**. Tele-LLM is a specialized LLM tailored for telecommunications, leveraging customized datasets to improve its expertise in this field **Chen et al., "TelecomGPT: A General-Purpose Conversational AI System for the Telecom Industry"**. Similarly, TelecomGPT introduces a telecommunications-specific LLM training framework that fine-tunes general LLMs to achieve exceptional performance on telecom-specific tasks **Wu et al., "A Novel Framework for Training Telecom-Specific Language Models with Reinforcement Learning and Knowledge Distillation"**. These advancements underscore the significant potential of LLMs in enhancing the intelligence of 6G networks.
