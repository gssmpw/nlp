\begin{abstract}
The lack of authentication during the initial bootstrapping phase between cellular devices and base stations allows attackers to deploy fake base stations and send malicious messages to the devices. These attacks have been a long-existing problem in cellular networks, enabling adversaries to launch denial-of-service (DoS), information leakage, and location-tracking attacks. While some defense mechanisms are introduced in 5G, (e.g., encrypting user identifiers to mitigate IMSI catchers), the initial communication between devices and base stations remains unauthenticated, leaving a critical security gap. To address this, we propose \scheme{}, a novel and efficient two-layer identity-based signature scheme designed for seamless integration with existing cellular protocols. We implement \scheme{} on an open-source 5G stack and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation against alternative solutions. Compared to the state-of-the-art \texttt{Schnorr-HIBS}, \scheme{} reduces attack surfaces, enables fine-grained lawful interception, and achieves 2x speed in verification, making it a practical solution for securing 5G base station authentication.
