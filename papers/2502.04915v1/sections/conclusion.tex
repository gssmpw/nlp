We have proposed an efficient authentication protocol for 5G networks based on an identity-based signature scheme. Our protocol achieves at least 11 times speedup over the 3GPP proposals and around 2 times speedup over the previous scheme in terms of end-to-end cryptographic delay for authenticating base stations.
Our protocol also achieves the smallest communication overhead against all compared schemes. In addition, We open-source our implementation \cite{E2IBS-github} to benefit future research. 
We hope 3GPP can discuss more about the base station authentication and our solution can be integrated into future specification releases.
