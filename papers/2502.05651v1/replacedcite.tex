\paragraph{Dialogue Generation Using LLMs}
Recent research has increasingly focused on using LLMs to generate dialogues for various applications.
____ proposed a human-machine collaborative framework to build a large-scale dialogue dataset for training conversational agents to handle problematic content appropriately.
____ used a small number of expert-written conversations as in-context examples to create synthetic multi-party conversations.
____ proposed LLM prompting methods to generate mixed-initiative dialogues.
____ created a large-scale social dialogue dataset by distilling conversations from LLMs.
____ paired human teachers with an LLM student to generate teacher-student tutoring dialogues grounded in math reasoning problems.



\paragraph{NLP Applications in MI}
MI was developed as a technique to assist individuals in resolving ambivalence and committing to change ____, representing an evolution of client-centered therapy. 
Along with the advancement in NLP, considerable research efforts have been underway to apply NLP techniques in the field of MI. 
Several studies have been proposed to automatically classify a given utterance into one of the MI behavioral codes.
While earlier approaches utilize linguistic features ____ and recurrent neural network architectures ____, recent approaches make use of pre-trained language models such as RoBERTa ____. 
Some works adopt a multimodal approach, leveraging additional information such as speech features ____ or facial features ____.



____ demonstrated the potential of LLMs in boosting dialogues using the MI strategy. They observed that among the MI dataset curated from online platforms ____, 92.86\% of the advice given by peers fall into the \textit{Advise without permission} category, which is MI non-adherent. To make the dataset more MI-consistent, they fine-tuned BlenderBot ____ and GPT-3 ____ to rephrase these responses into more MI-adherent \textit{Advise with permission} responses. Although this work demonstrated the possibility of leveraging LLMs in MI, the impact of rephrasing remains marginal, considering that its capability is restricted to revising the manner of speech and has limitations in modifying the content itself.
In our work, we further exploit the generative ability of LLMs to generate the entire dataset from scratch.
