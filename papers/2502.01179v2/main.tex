\begin{abstract}
Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, are commonly used to adapt LLMs.
However, the effectiveness of standard PEFT methods is limited in low-resource scenarios with only a few hundred examples.
Recent advances in interpretability research have inspired the emergence of activation editing techniques, which modify the activations of specific model components.
These methods, due to their extremely small parameter counts, show promise for small datasets.
However, their performance is highly dependent on identifying the correct modules to edit and often lacks stability across different datasets.
In this paper, we propose Joint Localization and Activation Editing (\jola{}), a method that jointly learns 
(1) which heads in the Transformer to edit
(2) whether the intervention should be additive, multiplicative, or both and 
(3) the intervention parameters themselves - the vectors applied as additive offsets or multiplicative scalings to the head output.
Through evaluations on three benchmarks spanning commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that \jola{} consistently outperforms existing methods.\footnote{The code for the method is released at \url{https://github.com/wenlai-lavine/jola}.}
