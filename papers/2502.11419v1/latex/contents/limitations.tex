\section*{Limitations}

In this work, we focus on evaluating the diversity of individual instruction data and exploring the combination of diversity and quality scores. However, achieving a more precise assessment of data quality remains a valuable direction for future research. Additionally, due to the high memory cost of the Affinity Propagation algorithm, PIBE must process candidate data in batches to prevent memory overflow. Nevertheless, since the data selection time for each batch is short (typically around 60 seconds, depending on the number of convergence steps), such batch processing does not lead to a significant increase in PIBE's time cost.
