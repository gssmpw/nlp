First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Jinjun Shan. Although the research focus of our group is mainly on control theory, he has generously allowed me the flexibility to explore topics in robotics and computer vision. He has kindly provided me with such extensive support, including resources for study and research and personal life. I also want to thank my committee members, Prof. Armenakis and Prof. Jianguo Wang, as well as the oral exam committee members, Prof. Zhu, Prof. Ping Wang, Prof. Hu, and Prof. Waslander, for their insightful feedback, which strengthened my dissertation.
