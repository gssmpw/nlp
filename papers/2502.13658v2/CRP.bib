	abstract = {Software developers are increasingly required to write big data code. However, they find big data software development challenging. To help these developers it is necessary to understand big data topics that they are interested in and the difficulty of finding answers for questions in these topics. In this work, we conduct a large-scale study on Stackoverflow to understand the interest and difficulties of big data developers. To conduct the study, we develop a set of big data tags to extract big data posts from Stackoverflow; use topic modeling to group these posts into big data topics; group similar topics into categories to construct a topic hierarchy; analyze popularity and difficulty of topics and their correlations; and discuss implications of our findings for practice, research and education of big data software development and investigate their coincidence with the findings of previous work.},

	abstract = {There is a wide range of interdisciplinary intersections between cyber security and artificial intelligence ({AI}). On one hand, {AI} technologies, such as deep learning, can be introduced into cyber security to construct smart models for implementing malware classification and intrusion detection and threating intelligence sensing. On the other hand, {AI} models will face various cyber threats, which will disturb their sample, learning, and decisions. Thus, {AI} models need specific cyber security defense and protection technologies to combat adversarial machine learning, preserve privacy in machine learning, secure federated learning, etc. Based on the above two aspects, we review the intersection of {AI} and cyber security. First, we summarize existing research efforts in terms of combating cyber attacks using {AI}, including adopting traditional machine learning methods and existing deep learning solutions. Then, we analyze the counterattacks from which {AI} itself may suffer, dissect their characteristics, and classify the corresponding defense methods. Finally, from the aspects of constructing encrypted neural network and realizing a secure federated deep learning, we expatiate the existing research on how to build a secure {AI} system.},

The cost of the data breach is not only considered as potentially damaging to the monetary penalty, but also regarding other more severe problems such as consumer confidence, social trust and personal safety. In this paper, we brush up the world's most significant data breaches in which amount of lost records are more than 30,000 records from 2004 to 2017. From many different aspects, the data visualization technique is used to demonstrate the fact and the hidden information of the data breach phenomenon. We also employ a case study which includes the income data of the residents in the United States and the public transportation data in New York to point out the potential risk of the data breach. Based on the case study, we once again exhibit the real dangers of data breach are out of hands. Based on the analysis and visualization, we find some interesting insights which seldom researchers focus on before and it is apparently the real dangers of data breach are beyond the common imagination.},

	abstract = {In recent years, machine learning algorithms, and more specifically deep learning algorithms, have been widely used in many fields, including cyber security. However, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this limits the application of machine learning, especially in non-stationary, adversarial environments, such as the cyber security domain, where actual adversaries (e.g., malware developers) exist. This article comprehensively summarizes the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques and illuminates the risks they pose. First, the adversarial attack methods are characterized based on their stage of occurrence, and the attacker’ s goals and capabilities. Then, we categorize the applications of adversarial attack and defense methods in the cyber security domain. Finally, we highlight some characteristics identified in recent research and discuss the impact of recent advancements in other adversarial learning domains on future research directions in the cyber security domain. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to discuss the unique challenges of implementing end-to-end adversarial attacks in the cyber security domain, map them in a unified taxonomy, and use the taxonomy to highlight future research directions.},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity has rapidly emerged as a grand societal challenge of the 21st century. Innovative solutions to proactively tackle emerging cybersecurity challenges are essential to ensuring a safe and secure society. Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) has rapidly emerged as a viable approach for sifting through terabytes of heterogeneous cybersecurity data to execute fundamental cybersecurity tasks, such as asset prioritization, control allocation, vulnerability management, and threat detection, with unprecedented efficiency and effectiveness. Despite its initial promise, {AI} and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the {AI} for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the {AI} for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant {AI} for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary {AI} for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced {AI} methodologies for cybersecurity, and {AI}-enabled decision making. To help scholars and practitioners make significant headway in tackling these grand {AI} for Cybersecurity issues, we summarize promising funding mechanisms from the National Science Foundation ({NSF}) that can support long-term, systematic research programs.

	abstract = {Context Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics ({BDCA}) systems leverage big data technologies for analyzing security events data to protect organizational networks, computers, and data from cyber attacks. Objective We aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for {BDCA} systems. Method We used Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) method for reviewing 74 papers. Result Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes for {BDCA} systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the identified quality attributes. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each. Conclusion Our study reveals that in the context of {BDCA} (a) performance, accuracy and scalability are the most important quality concerns (b) data analytics is the most critical architectural component (c) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support (d) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of the codified tactics and explore the quality trade-offs and dependencies among the tactics and (e) the reported tactics need to be modelled using a standardized modelling language such as {UML}.},

	abstract = {Deep learning, which is originated from an artificial neural network (ANN), is one of the major technologies of today’s smart cybersecurity systems or policies to function in an intelligent manner. Popular deep learning techniques, such as multi-layer perceptron, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network or long short-term memory, self-organizing map, auto-encoder, restricted Boltzmann machine, deep belief networks, generative adversarial network, deep transfer learning, as well as deep reinforcement learning, or their ensembles and hybrid approaches can be used to intelligently tackle the diverse cybersecurity issues. In this paper, we aim to present a comprehensive overview from the perspective of these neural networks and deep learning techniques according to today’s diverse needs. We also discuss the applicability of these techniques in various cybersecurity tasks such as intrusion detection, identification of malware or botnets, phishing, predicting cyberattacks, e.g. denial of service, fraud detection or cyberanomalies, etc. Finally, we highlight several research issues and future directions within the scope of our study in the field.

	abstract = {Cybersecurity covers the broad range of technical and social issues that must be considered to protect networked information systems. The importance of the concept has increased as so many government, business, and day-to-day activities globally have moved online. It has been increasingly referred to in both academic and mainstream publications since 2003, in fields including software engineering, international relations, crisis management and public safety, slowly overtaking more technical terms such as computer/system/data security (popular in the 1970s/1980s) and information security (popular from the mid 1990s). But its strong association with national security and defence agencies, and disconnection from social science notions such as place, have led to concerns of inappropriate cyber securitisation of government programmes.},
