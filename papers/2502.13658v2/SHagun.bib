	abstract = {Ensuring cyber security is a complex task that relies on domain knowledge and requires cognitive abilities to determine possible threats from large amounts of network data. This study investigates how knowledge in network operations and information security influence the detection of intrusions in a simple network. We developed a simplified Intrusion Detection System ({IDS}), which allows us to examine how individuals with or without knowledge in cyber security detect malicious events and declare an attack based on a sequence of network events. Our results indicate that more knowledge in cyber security facilitated the correct detection of malicious events and decreased the false classification of benign events as malicious. However, knowledge had less contribution when judging whether a sequence of events representing a cyber-attack. While knowledge of cyber security helps in the detection of malicious events, situated knowledge regarding a specific network at hand is needed to make accurate detection decisions. Responses from participants that have knowledge in cyber security indicated that they were able to distinguish between different types of cyber-attacks, whereas novice participants were not sensitive to the attack types. We explain how these findings relate to cognitive processes and we discuss their implications for improving cyber security.},

	abstract = {One of the challenges in writing an article reviewing the current state of cyber education and workforce development is that there is a paucity of quantitative assessment regarding the cognitive aptitudes, work roles, or team organization required by cybersecurity professionals to be successful. In this review, we argue that the people who operate within the cyber domain need a combination of technical skills, domain specific knowledge, and social intelligence to be successful. They, like the networks they operate, must also be reliable, trustworthy, and resilient. Defining the knowledge, skills, attributes, and other characteristics is not as simple as defining a group of technical skills that people can be trained on; the complexity of the cyber domain makes this a unique challenge. There has been little research devoted to exactly what attributes individuals in the cyber domain need. What research does exist places an emphasis on technical and engineering skills while discounting the important social and organizational influences that dictate success or failure in everyday settings. This paper reviews the literature on cyber expertise and cyber workforce development to identify gaps and then argues for the important contribution of social fit in the highly complex and heterogenous cyber workforce. We then identify six assumptions for the future of cybersecurity workforce development, including the requirement for systemic thinkers, team players, a love for continued learning, strong communication ability, a sense of civic duty, and a blend of technical and social skill. Finally, we make recommendations for social and cognitive metrics which may be indicative of future performance in cyber work roles to provide a roadmap for future scholars.},

In this paper, we brush up the world's most significant data breaches in which amount of lost records are more than 30,000 records from 2004 to 2017. From many different aspects, the data visualization technique is used to demonstrate the fact and the hidden information of the data breach phenomenon. We also employ a case study which includes the income data of the residents in the United States and the public transportation data in New York to point out the potential risk of the data breach.

While supply and demand are factors in the recruitment process for any position, in order to secure the best people in the security field we need to know what skills are required to be a security professional in the current cyber security environment. This paper seeks to explore this question by looking at the current state of the Australian Industry. Recent job listings in the cyber security area were analysed, and current security professionals in industry were asked for their opinion as to what skills were required in this profession. It was found that each security professional role has its own set of skill requirements, however there is significant overlap between the roles for many soft skills, including analysis, consulting and process skills, leadership, and relationship management. Both communication and presentation skills were valued. A set of "hard" skills emerged as common across all categories: experience, qualifications and certifications, and technical expertise. These appear to represent the need for a firm background in the security area as represented by formal study and industry certifications, and supported by solid experience in the industry. Specific technical skills are also required, although the exact nature of these will vary according to the requirements of each role.},

However, machine learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this limits the application of machine learning, especially in non-stationary, adversarial environments, such as the cyber security domain, where actual adversaries (e.g., malware developers) exist. This article comprehensively summarizes the latest research on adversarial attacks against security solutions based on machine learning techniques and illuminates the risks they pose. First, the adversarial attack methods are characterized based on their stage of occurrence, and the attacker’ s goals and capabilities. Then, we categorize the applications of adversarial attack and defense methods in the cyber security domain. Finally, we highlight some characteristics identified in recent research and discuss the impact of recent advancements in other adversarial learning domains on future research directions in the cyber security domain. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to discuss the unique challenges of implementing end-to-end adversarial attacks in the cyber security domain, map them in a unified taxonomy, and use the taxonomy to highlight future research directions.},

Despite its initial promise, {AI} and cybersecurity have been traditionally siloed disciplines that relied on disparate knowledge and methodologies. Consequently, the {AI} for Cybersecurity discipline is in its nascency. In this article, we aim to provide an important step to progress the {AI} for Cybersecurity discipline. We first provide an overview of prevailing cybersecurity data, summarize extant {AI} for Cybersecurity application areas, and identify key limitations in the prevailing landscape. Based on these key issues, we offer a multi-disciplinary {AI} for Cybersecurity roadmap that centers on major themes such as cybersecurity applications and data, advanced {AI} methodologies for cybersecurity, and {AI}-enabled decision making.

	abstract = {Context Big Data Cybersecurity Analytics ({BDCA}) systems leverage big data technologies for analyzing security events data to protect organizational networks, computers, and data from cyber attacks. Objective We aimed at identifying the most frequently reported quality attributes and architectural tactics for {BDCA} systems. Method We used Systematic Literature Review ({SLR}) method for reviewing 74 papers. Result Our findings are twofold: (i) identification of 12 most frequently reported quality attributes for {BDCA} systems; and (ii) identification and codification of 17 architectural tactics for addressing the identified quality attributes. The identified tactics include six performance tactics, four accuracy tactics, two scalability tactics, three reliability tactics, and one security and usability tactic each. Conclusion Our study reveals that in the context of {BDCA} (a) performance, accuracy and scalability are the most important quality concerns (b) data analytics is the most critical architectural component (c) despite the significance of interoperability, modifiability, adaptability, generality, stealthiness, and privacy assurance, these quality attributes lack explicit architectural support (d) empirical investigation is required to evaluate the impact of the codified tactics and explore the quality trade-offs and dependencies among the tactics and (e) the reported tactics need to be modelled using a standardized modelling language such as {UML}.},
