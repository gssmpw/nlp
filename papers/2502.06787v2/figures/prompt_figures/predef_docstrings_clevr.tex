\"\"\"
Locates objects in an image. Object prompts should be 1 WORD MAX.

Args:
    image (image): Image to search.
    object_prompt (string): Description of object to locate. Examples: "spheres", "objects".
Returns:
    list: A list of x,y coordinates for all of the objects located in pixel space.
\"\"\"
def loc(image, object_prompt):

\"\"\"
Answers a question about the attributes of an object specified by an x,y coordinate.
Should not be used for other kinds of questions.

Args:
    image (image): Image of the scene.
    question (string): Question about the objects attribute to answer. Examples: "What color is this?", "What material is this?"
    x (int): X coordinate of the object in pixel space.
    y (int): Y coordinate of the object in pixel space. 
    

Returns:
    string: Answer to the question about the object in the image.
\"\"\"
def vqa(image, question, x, y):

\"\"\"
Returns the depth of an object specified by an x,y coordinate.

Args:
    image (image): Image of the scene.
    x (int): X coordinate of the object in pixel space.
    y (int): Y coordinate of the object in pixel space.

Returns:
    float: The depth of the object specified by the coordinates.
\"\"\"
def depth(image, x, y):

\"\"\"
Checks if two pairs of coordinates correspond to the same object.

Args:
    image (image): Image of the scene.
    x_1 (int): X coordinate of object 1 in pixel space.
    y_1 (int): Y coordinate of object 1 in pixel space.
    x_2 (int): X coordinate of object 2 in pixel space.
    y_2 (int): Y coordinate of object 2 in pixel space.

Returns:
    bool: True if object 1 is the same object as object 2, False otherwise.
