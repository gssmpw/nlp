\begin{prompt}
Propose only new method signatures to add to the existing API.

Available Primitives: image, int, string, list, tuple

Current API:
{current_api_signatures}

Next, I will ask you a series of questions that reference an image and are solvable with a python program that uses the API I have provided so far. Please propose new method signatures with associated docstrings to add to the API that would help modularize the programs that answer the questions. 

For each proposed method, output the docstring inside <docstring></docstring> immediately followed by the method signature for the docstring inside <signature></signature>. Do not propose methods that are already in the API.

Please ensure that you ONLY add new methods when necessary. Do not add new methods if you can solve the problem with combinations of the previous methods!

Added methods should be simple, building minorly on the methods that already exist.

Importantly, new methods MUST start with an underscore. As an example, you may define a "_get_material" method. Please ensure you ALWAYS start the name with an underscore.

Again, output the docstring inside <docstring></docstring> immediately followed by the method signature for the docstring inside <signature></signature>.
