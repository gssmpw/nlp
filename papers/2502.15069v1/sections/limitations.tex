One limitation of our work is that we are limited to the rare diseases and symptoms provided in our rare disease expert system.  While our approach does cover a broader set of rare diseases than existing work, it does not cover the vast set of diseases present in the world. For example, \cite{rare_disease_mass_list} lists over 10,000.  Yet rare diseases highly vary in prevalence, with only about 100 rare diseases accounting for 80\% of diagnoses\cite{evansRareGeneral}.  Others are so rare that only a few cases have ever been identified. Expanding to these extremely rare diseases is a remaining challenge. 

We are also limited by the number of expert annotations that are feasible for this task.  While the results were positive, we couldn't annotate a larger amount without spending excessively more time and money. Additionally, we are unable to release the datasets due to legal requirements.  While this is a common issue in the medical domain, we hope that future work can provide open datasets for broader use.
