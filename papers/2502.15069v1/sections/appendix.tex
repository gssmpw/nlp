    \toprule
   Synthetic & Annotator & Disease & Reasoning \\ 
    \midrule
    yes & yes & histoplasma meningitis & This disease is possible because the patientâ€™s history of lymphoma and transplant makes them immunocompromised, which increases their risk of histoplasmosis meningitis. The histoplasmosis meningitis could cause this patient's symptoms of nausea/vomiting, fever/chills, and severe headache. \\      \midrule
    yes & yes & cerebral malaria & This disease is possible because urinary and bowel incontinence, intractable headache, visual loss/retinopathy, and fever point to an infectious cerebral process that could be caused by cerebral malaria. \\    \midrule
    yes & yes & neurogenic osteoarthropathy alias charcot\_joint\_disease & This could be possible charcot joint disease, which is set off by trauma to a neuropathic extremity and can cause joint pain. Although Charcot's is technically most common in the foot, it can also extend to any major joint like the knees, shoulder, hip, etc. \\     \midrule
    yes & yes & glaucoma acute angle closure & Blurriness with rainbow rings/halos, nausea/vomiting, headache, decreased vision, and sudden onset are all symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma. \\    \midrule
    yes & yes & cytomegalovirus infection disseminated & This disease is possible because the patient is immunocompromised by their organ transplant, and their symptoms of vision changes, diarrhea, fever, chills, vomiting, and myalgias are consistent with a disseminated cytomegalovirus infection. \\     \midrule
    yes & no & cutaneous anthrax & Lack of bump/ulcer/eschar. though presence of pruritis and exposure to possible animals infected as a vet, symptoms are nonspecific. \\     \midrule
    yes & no & herpes zoster & This disease is not possible because although herpes zoster can have peripheral symptoms including this patient's myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain, this patient does not have the characteristic dermatomal rash, skin changes, or skin-level pain of herpes zoster. \\    \midrule
    no & no & pulmonary aspergillosis invasive type & This disease is not possible because the patient is not immunocompromised, has not had recent surgeries or pneumonia, or chemotherapy, and does not have a cough, which I would expect from pulmonary aspergillosis since it is an opportunistic pulmonary infection. \\     \midrule
    no & no & henoch schonlein syndrome alias henoch-schonlein purpura & This disease is not possible because the patient does not report the purpura around the legs/gluteus that is characteristic for Henoch Schonlein purpura. The patient is also not in the typical age group for this disease, which primarily is in pediatric populations. \\     \midrule
    no & yes & bronchial asthma & This disease is possible because of the patient's history of dyspnea at rest and worse with activity. The urinary frequency could also be related because there are positive associations between bronchial asthma and increased urge to urinate. \\

\who{Patient} Well, it all started pretty suddenly. I've been feeling really off. \\
\textit{[onset abrupt (present)]}
\who{Doctor} I see. Can you describe some of the symptoms you've been experiencing?
\who{Patient} I've had a fever on and off. It's been bothering me. \\
\textit{[fever (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Alright, fever can be quite uncomfortable. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
\who{Patient} I haven't really felt like eating much lately. Just no appetite. \\
\textit{[anorexia (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Got it. Have you experienced any issues with bleeding or bruising?
\who{Patient} Yeah, even a small bump seems to make me bleed a lot. It's strange. \\
\textit{[bleeding excessive after minor trauma (present)]}
\who{Doctor} That does sound unusual. Have you had any nosebleeds recently?
\who{Patient} No, I haven't had any nosebleeds. \\
\textit{[epistaxis or epistaxis severe history (absent)]}
\who{Doctor} Okay, and how about your breathing? Any issues there?
\who{Patient} Yes, I've been feeling short of breath even when I'm just sitting around. \\
\textit{[dyspnea at rest (present)]}
\who{Doctor} That's important to note. Have you had any recent surgeries?
\who{Patient} Yes, I had surgery a few weeks ago. \\
\textit{[surgery recent history (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Thanks for sharing that. Have you experienced any vomiting?
\who{Patient} Yes, I've been throwing up, and sometimes it looks really dark, like coffee grounds. \\
\textit{[vomiting coffee ground (present) , vomiting recent (present)]}
\who{Doctor} I see. Have you ever had a reaction to a blood transfusion?
\who{Patient} Yeah, I've had a reaction before. \\

\who{System} Sarah is a 35-year-old female in Seattle, Washington.
\\\textit{[sex female (present) , age 26 to 55 (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Hello Sarah, I'm Dr. Smith. What brings you to see me today?
\who{Patient} Hey doctor. I've been dealing with these terrible stomach pains lately. They come and go in waves, and they're really intense, especially in my upper right side. It started about two days ago.
\\\textit{[abdomen pain present (present) , abdomen pain acute (present) , abdomen pain colicky (present)]}
\who{Doctor} I'd like to know more about these pains. Have you had any pain in other parts of your stomach, like around your belly button or on the left side?
\who{Patient} No, not really. The pain is mostly just in my upper right side. It doesn't really go to my belly button area or the left side at all.
\\\textit{[abdomen pain periumbilical (absent) , abdomen pain left upper quadrant (absent)]}
\who{Doctor} How long have you been experiencing these stomach pains? Have you had similar episodes in the past months?
\who{Patient} No, this is really the first time it's happened. Like I said, it just started a couple days ago. I haven't had any ongoing stomach issues before this.
\\\textit{[abdomen pain chronic (absent)]}
\who{Doctor} Have you noticed any issues with eating? Any trouble swallowing certain foods?
\who{Patient} Actually, yeah. I've been having a hard time swallowing, especially with meat and bread. They seem to get stuck, and I have to really work to get them down. It's making eating pretty difficult.
\\\textit{[dysphagia solids (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Have you noticed any vision changes recently? Anything unusual when you're looking at objects?
\who{Patient} Yeah, actually it's weird - I keep seeing double. Like when I look at my computer screen at work, I see two screens. It's really making it hard to code.
\\\textit{[eyes diplopia (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Have you experienced any muscle cramps recently, like muscles tightening up and staying tight for a minute or longer?
\who{Patient} No, I haven't had any muscle cramps like that. The stomach pain is bad enough, but my muscles feel normal.
\\\textit{[muscle cramps (absent)]}
\who{Doctor} Could you tell me about your family background? Where are your ancestors from?
\who{Patient} Oh yeah, my family is from Sweden and Norway. Both my parents' families came from there a few generations back.
\\\textit{[ethnic background northern european (present)]}
\who{Doctor} Have you noticed any connection between your symptoms and your menstrual cycle?
\who{Patient} Now that you mention it, yes. I started my period right when these symptoms began. It seems like the pain and other symptoms got worse when my period started.
\\\textit{[menses precipitation or exacerbation of disease history (present)]}
