% [labelindent=0pt,labelwidth=\widthof{\ref{last-item}},itemindent=1em,leftmargin=!]


\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{data:iot}\textbf{IoT} \cite{guo2019deep}: This dataset is used for malware confinement tasks. It includes three subsets with graph orders of 20, 40, and 60, and average node degrees of 7.42, 11.22, and 9.51, respectively. Each subset contains 343 graph pairs with contextual parameters: infection rate, recovery rate, and decay rate. Node attributes indicate infection status, and edge attributes represent the distance between nodes.

\item \label{data:chem}\textbf{Chemistry Reaction} \cite{guo2019deep, lowe2014patent}: This dataset is used to forecast the outcome of a chemical reaction based on the reactants. Molecular graphs have atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. There are 7,180 atom-mapped reactant-product pairs in the dataset with an average node degree of 1.75. Atom characteristics consist of elemental identity, connectivity, hydrogen count, valence, and aromaticity. Moreover, bond characteristics encompass bond type and connectivity.

There are three subsets with graph orders 20, 40, and 60, having average node degree of 7.42, 11.22, 9.51, respectively. 343 graph pairs are available in each subset. Each graph pair has three contextual parameters - infection rate, recovery rate and decay rate. Node attribute is infection status (i.e., whether the device corresponding to a node is compromised or not) and edge attribute is distance between two nodes.

% \item \label{data:chem}\textbf{Chemistry Reaction} \cite{guo2019deep}\cite{lowe2014patent}: This dataset is used for predicting the product (target graph) of chemical reaction given the reactant (input graph). Each molecular graph consists of atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. The reactions used for training are atom-mapped so that each atom in the product graph has a unique corresponding atom in the reactants. 
% The dataset contains 7,180 reactions (reactant-product graph pairs) with average node degree of 1.75. Atom (node) features include its elemental identity, degree of connectivity, number of attached hydrogen atoms, implicit valence, and aromaticity. Bond (edge) features include bond type (single, double, triple, or aromatic), and whether it is connected.

Here, 339 subjects are present with their structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) of brain while performing five different tasks (rest, gambling, language, motor, and emotion). 360 regions of the brain are represented by the nodes in both the graphs (SC, FC). All graphs are fully connected. A correlation based connectedness score ([-1, 1]) is available between all possible pair of regions. This correlation based matrices are the adjacency matrices of the graphs. The task is to predict the FC given SC for different tasks.

The dataset consists of 1,514 nodes representing drugs and 48,514 bidirectional edges between them representing drug interactions. The task is to predict presence of edges (i.e., interactions) between two nodes (i.e., drugs).

The drugs on average have 5-10 unique target proteins. The DTI dataset consists of 5,017 nodes that represent drugs, 2,324 nodes that represent targets and 15,138 bidirectional edges that represent drug target interactions. The task is to predict presence of edges i.e., interactions between a drug-node and a target-node.

The quality of these interactions is further validated in multiple orthogonal assays. The dataset consists of 8,245 nodes representing proteins and 52,068 bidirectional edges between them representing PPI. Given two proteins as input, the task is to predict whether or not any interaction will happen between them.

\item \label{data:yago}\textbf{YAGO} \cite{suchanek2007yago}: YAGO\footnote{https://yago-knowledge.org/} is a Knowledge Graph that adds common knowledge facts from Wikipedia to WordNet, transforming it into a common knowledge base. It is a large directed knowledge graph where nodes represent entities and directed edges describe facts between them. YAGO includes 37 relation types and each entity has at least 10 relations. The knowledge graph contains 123,131 entities and 1,089,040 relations between them.
% \item \textbf{The Penn Treebank} \cite{marcus-etal-1993-building}: The task of dependency parsing is projected as a graph translation problem. The source is word-level co-occurrence graph of the sentence to be parsed and the target is the dependency tree of the sentence. Total 45 different dependency relations (edges) are present in the dataset. \hl{Order of edge-set is very less because} source graph is similar to line-graph and target graph is a tree.
% \item \textbf{SemEval-2010 Task 8} \cite{hendrickx2010semeval}: In the SemEval-2010 Task 8 on ``Multi-way classification of mutually exclusive semantic relations between pairs of nominals'', given a sentence and two tagged nominals, the task is to predict the directed relation between those nominals. There are 10 different types of relations present in the dataset among which 9 relations are directional and one relation is bidirecional. Total 10,717 annotated examples (sentences along with tagged entity-pairs) are present in the dataset.
