Community detection is a node-level multi-class classification task. Since it is a semi-supervised task, the required loss function in the training process has an unsupervised loss component ($L_u$) as mentioned in Section ~\ref{unsupervised} (cf. Equation (\ref{eqn:unsup_loss})) along with the categorical cross-entropy loss ($L_s$, cf. Equation (\ref{eqn:sup_loss})) of the nodes (one from each community) whose label (community) is revealed during the training process. We carried out training for this task by using a learning rate of 0.005 employing a combination of the unsupervised and supervised losses as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:SpecialCases}.
% Let, $E$ be the edge set of the graph and $O$ is
% a
% an array-like of size $N\times C$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph and $C$ is the number of communities. $O[i]$ denotes the $C$ dimensional transformer output-vector for $node_i$. $L_u$ is defined as in Equation \ref{loss_function}. 
% \begin{equation}
% \label{loss_function}   
% L_u=\sum_{(u,v) \in E}MSE(O[u],O[v])=\sum_{(u,v) \in E}\sum_{c=0}^{C-1}\frac{1}{C}(O[u][c]-O[v][c])^2 
% \end{equation}

%Fig. \ref{fig:karate2c}, \ref{fig:karate4c}, \ref{fig:football}, and \ref{fig:polbooks} visually present the performance of our model on the 3 datasets where spatial clustering represents the original communities and the color-coded nodes signify the communities predicted by our model.

% We used a learning rate of 0.005 for training on all the 3 Community Detection datasets.

%Additionally, Table \ref{tab:karate2_PRF} and \ref{tab:karate4_PRF} present the performance of our model on the community detection task on the Zachary's karate club dataset with 2 communities and 4 communities respectively. \sout{Figure \ref{fig:karate} pictorially shows the performance of our model on the 2 versions of the Zachary's karate club dataset.}

%Table \ref{tab:football_PRF} and Figure \ref{fig:football} present the performance of our model on the community detection task on the American College football dataset.

%\subsubsection{Books about US politics}
%Table \ref{tab:polbooks_PRF} and Figure \ref{fig:polbooks} present the performance of our model on the community detection task on the Books about US politics dataset.

We carried out experiments on 3 popular Community Detection datasets (cf. Section \ref{dataset} Para \ref{data:community}) and Table \ref{tab:ComDec_compare} compares the performance of our model on these three datasets
%on the Zacharyâ€™s karate club (with 2 communities), American College football, and Books about US politics datasets, 
against well-known methods on this task. Our model produces SOTA results on all three datasets on community detection.

% In Figure \ref{fig:karate}, \ref{fig:football}, and \ref{fig:polbooks}, spatial clustering shows the original communities and colouring of the nodes denote the communities predicted by our model.
