% Given an unlabelled dependency tree of a sentence (i.e. only links between tokens), the model is trained to predict the edge-labels of the tree (i.e., dependency types). From the Penn Treebank dataset, 39,680 sentences were taken for training set (with batch-size 256 and learning-rate 0.005) and 2,415 sentences were taken for test set. Initial node features are created by concatenating 100 dimensional GloVe\cite{pennington-etal-2014-glove} embedding of the tokens and 100 dimensional POS-tag embeddings. POS-tag embeddings (total 45 different POS-tags present) are initialized to random vectors $f_{POS}=[p_0, p_1, \dots , p_{99}], p_i\in[0,1] \forall i\in[0,99]$. Overall accuracy achieved was 0.87 on the test-set.
