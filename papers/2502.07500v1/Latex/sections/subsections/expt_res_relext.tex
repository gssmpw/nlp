% Given a dependency tree of a sentence, the model learns to predict the relation along with the direction between two given entities using this dataset. 8,000 annotated samples were used as the training set with batch size 1,080 and LR 0.005 and the rest (2,717 samples) were used as the test set. Total number of different types of dependency relations present in the dependency trees of the sentences in the complete dataset was 51. Considering directions along with the relation type, there was total 19 different directed relation types in the dataset. While creating batch in each epoch, 60 samples were taken from each directed relation type. There was no sample for one relation type (with direction) in the training set. For multi-word token entities, only last word was used as the entity since multiple words are different nodes in the dependency tree.

% Experiments were done using 300 dimensional GloVe\cite{pennington-etal-2014-glove} embeddings and 768 dimensional BERT\cite{kenton2019bert} embeddings of the tokens in the sentences as initial node features, separately. One hot encodings of incoming and outgoing dependency types for each token obtained from the dependency tree (51*2 = 102 dimensional) were concatenated with the GloVe and BERT embeddings, making the initial node features 402 dimensional for first case and 870 dimensional for the second case. Using GloVe embeddings, the test set accuracy was 0.73 and using BERT embeddings, the test set accuracy was 0.67.
