We presented a design methodology for the LIFA model, focusing on integrating astrocytes into neural network models. Our approach involved a core architecture of neurons, synapses, and astrocyte circuits, where each astrocyte encloses multiple neurons for self-repair in case of neuron failure. As a result of this innovative design, the system is much more fault-tolerant, maintaining its efficiency and robustness even under adverse circumstances. An astrocyte-infused network is dynamic and resilient, able to adapt to neuron failures. The LIFA model is mapped onto a fault-tolerant many-core design through a routing methodology that optimizes the network's efficiency and functionality. Based on our rigorous evaluation, the design is both power-efficient and area-efficient, achieving superior fault tolerance. The model we developed outperformed other state-of-the-art implementations by 81.10\% and 18.90\%, respectively. Neuromorphic systems are becoming more resilient and adaptable with the integration of astrocytes.
