In this work, we leverage vision foundation models combined with retrieval-augmented generation and visual prompting to build a training-free plug-and-play toolkit for the task of LVLM personalization called PeKit. We first show that our approach can surpass existing training-based methods while not requiring any tuning and not relying on any additional images other than those used to introduce the personalized concept. We further present a challenging benchmark that mimics more realistic scenarios and increases the complexity of the visual recognition challenge. While our approach shows robustness, there is room for improvement in future works. We believe that our \ours  sets a strong training-free baseline for the LVLM personalization task.
