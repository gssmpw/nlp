In recent years, diffusion models have increasingly been employed for style transfer. These methods can be broadly categorized into two types: tuning-based methods and tuning-free methods. A representative example of the former is InST **Johnson, J., Alahi, A., Fei-Fei, L.**, "Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Video Transfer"
% However, this method lacks precision in style inversion, often altering the content of the original image during style transfer. 
StyleDiffusion **Anokhin, S., Oseledets, I.**, "Deep Image Prior with Patch-based Attention" 
refines diffusion models by introducing a CLIP-based style decoupling loss, effectively separating style from content. 
% FreeTuner ____ proposes compositional personalization, allowing the combination of different subject and style concepts. However, this approach often alters the structure and content of the original image.
Tuning-free methods achieve style transfer in a single forward process without model fine-tuning. DEADiff **Sinha, A., Mishkin, D., Matas, J., Chellappa, R.**, "Leveraging Pre-trained CNNs for Deep Image Prior" 
utilizes the Q-Former ____ and paired datasets to extract decoupled representations of content and style, facilitating style transfer. InstantStyle ____ uses specific block injection techniques to implicitly decouple content and style for effective style transfer. Building on this, InstantStyle-Plus ____ introduces ControlNet ____ to further maintain the integrity of image content. StyleID ____ adjusts self-attention layers and introduces novel techniques such as query preservation and initial latent AdaIN to maintain content integrity.

Nevertheless, these approaches struggle with achieving signature style transfer. In this paper, we address this challenge by utilizing a personalized text-to-image model to perform signature style transfer, generating visually compelling and aesthetically enhanced outputs.  


\paragraph{\textbf{Personalized Text-to-Image Generation.}} 

Recent studies **Zhu, J.-Y., Park, T., Isola, P., Efros, A. A.**, "Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks" 
have increasingly focused on using visual exemplars as a foundation for image generation to address the inherent ambiguity and unpredictability of text-based prompts. This approach involves collecting multiple reference images to fine-tune diffusion models. 
However, for style transfer tasks that rely on a single style image, the aforementioned methods often cause severe overfitting when fine-tuning on this single image, significantly diminishing the effectiveness of the style transfer.
In contrast, our proposed hypernetwork-powered style aware fine-tuning method can overcome the limitations associated with fine-tuning on a single style image. It enables precise inversion of style attributes without the drawbacks of overfitting
% \yilin{will single image based personalized method work?}

% In addition to customizing the general essence of the reference image, some works have begun to explore attribute-level T2I customization ____ . However, these methods either require multiple reference images ____ or extensive fine-tuning ____ across large datasets. 




\paragraph{\textbf{Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT).}} PEFT represents an innovative approach in the refinement of deep learning models, emphasizing the adjustment of a subset of parameters rather than the entire model. These parameters are identified as either specific subsets from the originally trained model or a minimal number of newly introduced parameters during the fine-tuning phase. PEFT has been applied in text-to-image diffusion models ____ through techniques such as LoRA ____ and adapter tuning ____. In this paper, we leverage a hypernetwork to adjust and refine a unique subset of pre-trained parameters.

    \caption{The SigStyle framework. First, given a style image, we perform hypernetwork-powered style-aware fine-tuning for style inversion and represent the reference style as a special token * (see Figure \ref{fig:method}.a). In Figure \ref{fig:method}.b, the upper branch represents the reconstruction process of the content image, while the lower branch represents the generation process of the target image. When generating the target image using a pre-trained model and target text, we first use DDIM Inversion to map the content image into noise latents, which are then copied as the initial noise for generating the target image. Then, we adopt time-aware attention swapping to inject structural and content information during the first $k$ steps of the denoising process (see Figure b). In the subsequent $T-k$ steps, we proceed with the usual denoising process without any swapping. Finally, by decoding with VAE, we obtain the style-transferred image. }
