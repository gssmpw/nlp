\section{Problem Formulation}

Consider the linear dynamical system \eqref{eq: linear system}. We assume that$(A(\theta^\star), B(\theta^\star))$ is stabilizable. For ease of exposition, we restrict attention to the case where $\bmat{A(\theta) & B(\theta)} = \mathsf{vec}^{-1}(\theta, \dx)$, i.e. all entries of the state and input matrices are unknown. We additionally assume that $\Sigma_w = I$, and the cost matrices $Q\succeq I$ and $R = I$ are known.\footnote{Generalizing to arbitrary $\Sigma_w \succ 0$, $Q\succ 0$, and $R\succ 0$ can be performed by scaling the cost and changing the state and input basis. }

When $\theta$ is known, the optimal controller that minimizes $C(K, \theta)$ is given by 
\begin{align*}
    P(\theta) &\triangleq A(\theta)^\top P(\theta) A(\theta) - A(\theta)^\top P(\theta) B(\theta) (B(\theta)^\top P(\theta)  B(\theta)+ R)^{-1} B(\theta)^\top P(\theta) A(\theta)+ Q \\
    K(\theta) &\triangleq -(B(\theta)^\top P(\theta) B(\theta) + R)^{-1} B(\theta)^\top P(\theta) A(\theta),
\end{align*}
where $P(\theta)$ is the positive definite solution to the discrete algebraic Ricatti equation, and $K(\theta)$ is the LQR solution corresponding to a system with parameters $\theta$. 

To design a controller for the unknown system \eqref{eq: linear system}, we suppose that we have run $N$ experiments with control input $U_t \sim \calN(0, \Sigma_u)$ for $\Sigma_u \succ 0$.  From these experiments, we collect a dataset 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq: dataset}
    \curly{(X_t^n, U_t^n, X_{t+1}^n)}_{t=1, n=1}^{T,N}
\end{align} consisting of $N$ trajectories of length $T$ from \eqref{eq: linear system}. We use this dataset to design a controller $\hat K$ such that the cost, $C(\hat K, \theta^\star)$,
%\begin{align}
%    \label{eq: suboptimality gap}
%    C(\hat K, \theta^\star) -  C(K(\theta^\star), \theta^\star),
%\end{align}
is small. In our analysis, we consider several approaches to achieve this objective. The approaches will be  contrasted by examining the rate at which this cost decays to the optimal cost as the number of experiments in the dataset increases.
