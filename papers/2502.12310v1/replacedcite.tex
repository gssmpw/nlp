\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Domain Randomization} 
Domain randomization, introduced by ____, is widely used for \emph{sim-to-real transfer}. By randomizing simulator parameters during training, it aims to produce policies robust to simulator variations, thereby enabling transfer to the real-world. This approach has been applied in areas like autonomous racing ____
and robotic control ____. However, its success depends heavily on selecting an effective sampling strategy ____, which is often challenging. While previous work has explored generalization of domain randomization in discrete Markov Decision Processes ____, formalizing generalization for continuous control remains an open problem, which we address in this work.

\paragraph{Identification and Control} The linear quadratic regulator problem has become a key benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning in continuous control ____. The offline setting has been extensively studied: ____ analyzed the sample efficiency of robust control, while ____ showed that certainty equivalence is asymptotically instance-optimal, achieving the best possible sample efficiency with respect to system-theoretic quantities. Extensions to smooth nonlinear systems were made by ____. However, certainty equivalence can perform poorly with limited data. Alternative Bayesian approaches ____ can mitigate such limitations. We therefore show that such uncertainty-aware synthesis methods can match the asymptotic efficiency of certainty equivalence while achieving better performance in low-data regimes.

\paragraph{Robust Control:} The control community has traditionally addressed policy synthesis with imperfect models using methods like $\calH_\infty$ control, which focuses on worst-case uncertainty ____. Randomized approaches to robust control emphasizing high-probability guarantees have also been explored ____. ____ proposed an average performance metric similar to domain randomization but focused on a fixed distribution rather than one informed by data. Early data-driven synthesis efforts combined classical system identification ____ with worst-case robust control ____, while recent work has developed robust synthesis methods that bypass explicit models ____. To the best of our knowledge, existing analyses of statistical efficiency in robust control yield suboptimal rates, with excess control cost decreasing at $1/\sqrt{N}$ ____, compared to the faster $1/N$ rate achieved by certainty equivalence. This work refines robust synthesis analysis, demonstrating the $1/N$ rate and a short burn-in period, highlighting its advantages with limited data.
