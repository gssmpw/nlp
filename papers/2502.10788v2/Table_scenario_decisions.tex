    \Description{Expected decision of participant and fixed decision and bids for the agents in the game. In order to create all possible outcomes with each privacy choice, decisions are mostly fixed complying to image categories, yet some random decisions are applied in the agents to cover the randomness in real users. Scenario types based on these decision combinations are covered in the paper itself.}
