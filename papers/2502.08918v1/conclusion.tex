\section{Conclusion}

We proposed a cluster-based heterogeneous graph prompting method named \ourmethod. It mainly comprises three modules: pre-training, cluster prompt, and meta-path template. The pre-training module applies contrastive learning to pre-train the graph, capturing both structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. The cluster prompt module introduces cluster prompts to bridge the gap between pre-training and downstream tasks. The meta-path template module designs a meta-path template to strengthen prompt learning with high-order semantics. Extensive experiments on the node clustering and node classification tasks show that our method bridges the gap between pretext and downstream tasks and achieves superior results.
