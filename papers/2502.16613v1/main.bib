abstract = {Despite decades long establishment of effective tutoring principles, no adaptive tutoring system has been developed and open-sourced to the research community. The absence of such a system inhibits researchers from replicating adaptive learning studies and extending and experimenting with various tutoring system design directions. For this reason, adaptive learning research is primarily conducted on a small number of proprietary platforms. In this work, we aim to democratize adaptive learning research with the introduction of the first open-source adaptive tutoring system based on Intelligent Tutoring System principles. The system, we call Open Adaptive Tutor (OATutor), has been iteratively developed over three years with field trials in classrooms drawing feedback from students, teachers, and researchers. The MIT-licensed source code includes three creative commons (CC BY) textbooks worth of algebra problems, with tutoring supports authored by the OATutor project. Knowledge Tracing, an A/B testing framework, and LTI support are included.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutors and tutoring systems (ITS) are increasingly common in educational contexts. These tools have considerable potential for scaling highly effective 1:1 learner-instructor interactions. To date, most studies investigating ITS implementation have engaged non-adult (i.e., child, adolescent, or traditional college student) populations, however, their potential for scaling adult learning is increasingly recognized. We performed a selected, narrative review of adult ITS, and asked two guiding questions: (1) What are the primary domains in which ITS has been deployed to promote lifespan adult learning? (2) How specifically are ITS deployed within each domain? Fifteen papers were selected, and three themes emerged: (1) Adult literacy, (2) adult post-secondary/professional education, and (3) lifelong learning and career-related development. Exemplar papers from each theme were selected and presented/discussed in more detail. The results of the review are discussed in terms of the current state of the literature on ITS for adult learning, and how such tools can improve access to personalized learning support at scale. Limitations and future directions are discussed.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems leverage AI models of expert learning and student knowledge to deliver personalized tutoring to students. While these intelligent tutors have demonstrated improved student learning outcomes, it is still unclear how teachers might integrate them into curriculum and course planning to support responsive pedagogy. In this paper, we conducted a design study with five teachers who have deployed Apprentice Tutors, an intelligent tutoring platform, in their classes. We characterized their challenges around analyzing student interaction data from intelligent tutoring systems and built VisTA (Visualizations for Tutor Analytics), a visual analytics system that shows detailed provenance data across multiple coordinated views. We evaluated VisTA with the same five teachers, and found that the visualizations helped them better interpret intelligent tutor data, gain insights into student problem-solving provenance, and decide on necessary follow-up actions – such as providing students with further support or reviewing skills in the classroom. Finally, we discuss potential extensions of VisTA into sequence query and detection, as well as the potential for the visualizations to be useful for encouraging self-directed learning in students.},

@book{MacLellan2020,
abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems are effective for improving students' learning outcomes (Pane et al. 2013; Koedinger and Anderson, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 8, 1–14, 1997; Bowen et al. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1, 94–111 2013). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10, 98–129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25(1), 1–34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.},

We reflect on a decade's experience using affinity diagramming across a number of projects, both in industry and academia. Our affinity diagramming process in interaction design has been tailored and consists of four stages: creating notes, clustering notes, walking the wall, and documentation. We draw examples from eight projects to illustrate our particular practices along these four stages, as well as to ground the discussion.",

The inner loop executes once for each step taken by the student in the solution of a task. The inner loop can give feedback and hints on each step. The inner loop can also assess the student's evolving competence and update a student model, which is used by the outer loop to select a next task that is appropriate for the student. For those who know little about tutoring systems, this description is meant as a demystifying introduction. For tutoring system experts, this description illustrates that although tutoring systems differ widely in their task domains, user interfaces, software structures, knowledge bases, etc., their behaviors are in fact quite similar.},

@article{Aleven2004,
abstract = {The goal of our research is to investigate whether a Cognitive Tutor can be made more effective by extending it to help students acquire help-seeking skills. .We present a preliminary model of help-seeking behavior that will provide the basis for a Help-Seeking Tutor Agent. The model, implemented by 57 production rules, captures both productive and unproductive help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions, We found that 72% of all student actions represented unproductive help-seeking behavior. Consistent with some of our earlier work (Aleven & Koedinger, 2000) we found a proliferation of hint abuse (e.g., using hints to find answers rather than trying to understand). We also found that students frequently avoided using help when it was likely to be of benefit and often acted in a quick, possibly undeliberate manner. Students' help-seeking behavior accounted for as much variance in their learning gains as their performance at the cognitive level (i.e., the errors that they made with the tutor). These findings indicate that the help-seeking model needs to be adjusted, but they also underscore the importance of the educational need that the Help-Seeking Tutor Agent aims to address. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

@article{Heffernan2008,
abstract = {Following Computer Aided Instruction systems, 2nd generation tutors are Model-Tracing Tutors (MTTs) (Anderson & Pelletier, 1991) which are intelligent tutoring systems that have been very successful at aiding student learning, but have not reached the level of performance of experienced human tutors (Anderson et al., 1995). To that end, this paper presents a new architecture called ATM ("Adding a Tutorial Model"), which is an extension to model-tracing, that allows these tutors to engage in a dialog that is more like those in which experienced human tutors engage. Specifically, while MTTs provide hints toward doing the next problem-solving step, this 3rd generation of tutors, the ATM architecture, adds the capability to ask questions towards thinking about the knowledge behind the next problem-solving step. We present a new tutor built in ATM, called Ms. Lindquist, which is designed to carry on a tutorial dialog about algebra symbolization. The difference between ATM and MTT is the separate tutorial model that encodes pedagogical content knowledge in the form of different tutorial strategies, which were partially developed by observing an experienced human tutor. Ms. Lindquist has tutored thousands of students at www.AlgebraTutor.org. Future work will reveal if Ms. Lindquist is a better tutor because of the addition of the tutorial model. {\textcopyright} 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers. It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.

I consider some key ideas about representation, performance, and learning that had their inception in computational models of human behavior, and I argue that this approach to developing intelligent artifacts, although no longer common, has an important place in cognitive systems. Not only will research in this paradigm help us understand the nature of human cognition, but findings from psychology can serve as useful heuristics to guide our search for accounts of intelligence. I present some constraints of this sort that future research should incorporate, and I claim that another psychological notion – cognitive architecture – is especially relevant to developing unified theories of the mind. Finally, I suggest ways to encourage renewed interaction between AI and cognitive psychology to the advantage of both disciplines.},

abstract = {One aim of the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is to reduce the time and cost of authoring Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Recent work with SimStudent offers a promising approach to the efficient au- thoring of expert models and misconception libraries. SimStudent works by in- ducing general production rule models from author demonstrations and feed- back. Importantly, the demonstration and feedback takes place directly in the tutor interface and requires no programming. Empirical results have shown that models induced by SimStudent fit student data better than models hand- authored by domain experts. Additionally, an analysis with the Goals, Opera- tors, Methods, and Selection rules (GOMS) model showed that authoring with SimStudent is more efficient than authoring with current approaches, namely Example-Tracing. This paper reviews those results and provides an example of constructing a simple algebra tutor with SimStudent.

abstract = {Researchers have developed cognitive systems capable of human-level performance at complex tasks, but constructing these systems required substantial time and expertise. To address this challenge, a new line of research has begun to coalesce around the concept of cognitive systems that users can teach rather than program. A key goal of this research is to develop natural approaches for end users to directly train these systems to perform new tasks. However, there does not currently exist a language for describing the key components of cognitive system training interactions and how these components relate to the concept of naturalness for end users. This paper begins to explore this gap. To lay the foundation for this exploration, we review relevant prior machine learning and interaction frameworks as well as the human-computer interaction literature to identify characteristics of systems that have historically been natural for end users to interact with. Based on this review, we propose the Natural Training Interactions (NTI) framework, which decomposes cognitive system training interaction into patterns, types, and modalities, all of which support the acquisition of different kinds of knowledge. Finally, we discuss how this framework characterizes existing research within this space and how it can guide future research.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have consistently been shown to improve the educational outcomes of students when used alone or combined with traditional instruction. However, building an ITS is a time-consuming process which requires specialized knowledge of existing tools. Extant authoring methods, including the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools' (CTAT) example-tracing method and SimStudent's Authoring by Tutoring, use programming-by-demonstration to allow authors to build ITSs more quickly than they could by hand programming with model-tracing. Yet these methods still suffer from long authoring times or difficulty creating complete models. In this study, we demonstrate that Simulated Learners built with the Apprentice Learner (AL) Framework can be combined with a novel interaction design that emphasizes model transparency, input flexibility, and problem solving control to enable authors to achieve greater model completeness in less time than existing authoring methods.},

abstract = {Current approaches to the development of natural language dialogue systems are discussed, and it is claimed that they do not sufficiently consider the unique qualities of man-machine interaction as distinct from general human discourse. It is concluded that empirical studies of this unique communication situation are required for the development of user-friendly interactive systems. One way of achieving this is through the use of so-called Wizard of Oz studies. The focus of the work described in the paper is on the practical execution of the studies and the methodological conclusions drawn on the basis of the authors' experience. While the focus is on natural language interfaces, the methods used and the conclusions drawn from the results obtained are of relevance also to other kinds of intelligent interfaces. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to unde-sired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

@article{Simard,
abstract = {The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for ma- chine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible. While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of “learners”, the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the “teachers”. Ma- chine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming lan- guages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interac- tion and visualization. In this paper, we present our position re- garding the discipline of machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also describe how, by decou- pling knowledge about machine learning al- gorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

@book{MacLellan2020,
abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems are effective for improving students' learning outcomes (Pane et al. 2013; Koedinger and Anderson, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 8, 1–14, 1997; Bowen et al. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1, 94–111 2013). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10, 98–129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25(1), 1–34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.},

@article{Aleven2004,
abstract = {The goal of our research is to investigate whether a Cognitive Tutor can be made more effective by extending it to help students acquire help-seeking skills. .We present a preliminary model of help-seeking behavior that will provide the basis for a Help-Seeking Tutor Agent. The model, implemented by 57 production rules, captures both productive and unproductive help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions, We found that 72% of all student actions represented unproductive help-seeking behavior. Consistent with some of our earlier work (Aleven & Koedinger, 2000) we found a proliferation of hint abuse (e.g., using hints to find answers rather than trying to understand). We also found that students frequently avoided using help when it was likely to be of benefit and often acted in a quick, possibly undeliberate manner. Students' help-seeking behavior accounted for as much variance in their learning gains as their performance at the cognitive level (i.e., the errors that they made with the tutor). These findings indicate that the help-seeking model needs to be adjusted, but they also underscore the importance of the educational need that the Help-Seeking Tutor Agent aims to address. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Following Computer Aided Instruction systems, 2nd generation tutors are Model-Tracing Tutors (MTTs) (Anderson & Pelletier, 1991) which are intelligent tutoring systems that have been very successful at aiding student learning, but have not reached the level of performance of experienced human tutors (Anderson et al., 1995). To that end, this paper presents a new architecture called ATM ("Adding a Tutorial Model"), which is an extension to model-tracing, that allows these tutors to engage in a dialog that is more like those in which experienced human tutors engage. Specifically, while MTTs provide hints toward doing the next problem-solving step, this 3rd generation of tutors, the ATM architecture, adds the capability to ask questions towards thinking about the knowledge behind the next problem-solving step. We present a new tutor built in ATM, called Ms. Lindquist, which is designed to carry on a tutorial dialog about algebra symbolization. The difference between ATM and MTT is the separate tutorial model that encodes pedagogical content knowledge in the form of different tutorial strategies, which were partially developed by observing an experienced human tutor. Ms. Lindquist has tutored thousands of students at www.AlgebraTutor.org. Future work will reveal if Ms. Lindquist is a better tutor because of the addition of the tutorial model. {\textcopyright} 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers. It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.

abstract = {In this paper, I review the role of cognitive psychology in the origins of artificial intelligence and in the continuing pursuit of its initial objectives. I consider some key ideas about representation, performance, and learning that had their inception in computational models of human behavior, and I argue that this approach to developing intelligent artifacts, although no longer common, has an important place in cognitive systems. Not only will research in this paradigm help us understand the nature of human cognition, but findings from psychology can serve as useful heuristics to guide our search for accounts of intelligence. I present some constraints of this sort that future research should incorporate, and I claim that another psychological notion – cognitive architecture – is especially relevant to developing unified theories of the mind. Finally, I suggest ways to encourage renewed interaction between AI and cognitive psychology to the advantage of both disciplines.},

abstract = {One aim of the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is to reduce the time and cost of authoring Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Recent work with SimStudent offers a promising approach to the efficient au- thoring of expert models and misconception libraries. SimStudent works by in- ducing general production rule models from author demonstrations and feed- back. Importantly, the demonstration and feedback takes place directly in the tutor interface and requires no programming. Empirical results have shown that models induced by SimStudent fit student data better than models hand- authored by domain experts. Additionally, an analysis with the Goals, Opera- tors, Methods, and Selection rules (GOMS) model showed that authoring with SimStudent is more efficient than authoring with current approaches, namely Example-Tracing. This paper reviews those results and provides an example of constructing a simple algebra tutor with SimStudent. This work with SimStu- dent presents several concepts that may be useful in the design and develop- ment of GIFT: modularization to allow for tutor authoring by non- programmers, generation of likely student misconceptions as a byproduct of ex- pert-model creation, and methods for comparing and evaluating authoring tools.},

abstract = {Researchers have developed cognitive systems capable of human-level performance at complex tasks, but constructing these systems required substantial time and expertise. To address this challenge, a new line of research has begun to coalesce around the concept of cognitive systems that users can teach rather than program. A key goal of this research is to develop natural approaches for end users to directly train these systems to perform new tasks. However, there does not currently exist a language for describing the key components of cognitive system training interactions and how these components relate to the concept of naturalness for end users. This paper begins to explore this gap. To lay the foundation for this exploration, we review relevant prior machine learning and interaction frameworks as well as the human-computer interaction literature to identify characteristics of systems that have historically been natural for end users to interact with. Based on this review, we propose the Natural Training Interactions (NTI) framework, which decomposes cognitive system training interaction into patterns, types, and modalities, all of which support the acquisition of different kinds of knowledge. Finally, we discuss how this framework characterizes existing research within this space and how it can guide future research.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have consistently been shown to improve the educational outcomes of students when used alone or combined with traditional instruction. However, building an ITS is a time-consuming process which requires specialized knowledge of existing tools. Extant authoring methods, including the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools' (CTAT) example-tracing method and SimStudent's Authoring by Tutoring, use programming-by-demonstration to allow authors to build ITSs more quickly than they could by hand programming with model-tracing. Yet these methods still suffer from long authoring times or difficulty creating complete models. In this study, we demonstrate that Simulated Learners built with the Apprentice Learner (AL) Framework can be combined with a novel interaction design that emphasizes model transparency, input flexibility, and problem solving control to enable authors to achieve greater model completeness in less time than existing authoring methods.},

One way of achieving this is through the use of so-called Wizard of Oz studies. The focus of the work described in the paper is on the practical execution of the studies and the methodological conclusions drawn on the basis of the authors' experience.

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to unde-sired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

@article{Simard,
abstract = {The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for ma- chine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible. While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of “learners”, the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the “teachers”. Ma- chine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming lan- guages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interac- tion and visualization. In this paper, we present our position re- garding the discipline of machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also describe how, by decou- pling knowledge about machine learning al- gorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models.},

abstract = {Tutoring systems are described as having two loops. The outer loop executes once for each task, where a task usually consists of solving a complex, multi-step problem. The inner loop executes once for each step taken by the student in the solution of a task. The inner loop can give feedback and hints on each step. The inner loop can also assess the student's evolving competence and update a student model, which is used by the outer loop to select a next task that is appropriate for the student. For those who know little about tutoring systems, this description is meant as a demystifying introduction. For tutoring system experts, this description illustrates that although tutoring systems differ widely in their task domains, user interfaces, software structures, knowledge bases, etc., their behaviors are in fact quite similar.},

Critical to the success of this project has been a client-centered design approach that has matched our client's expertise in curricular objectives and classroom teaching with our expertise in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology. The Pittsburgh Urban Mathematics Project (PUMP) has produced an algebra curriculum that is centrally focused on mathematical analysis of real world situations and the use of computational tools. We have built an intelligent tutor, called PAT, that supports this curriculum and has been made a regular part of 9th grade Algebra in 3 Pittsburgh schools. In the 1993-94 school year, we evaluated the effect of the PUMP curriculum and PAT tutor use. On average the 470 students in experimental classes outperformed students in comparison classes by 15% on standardized tests and 100% on tests targeting the PUMP objectives. This study provides further evidence that laboratory tutoring systems can be scaled up and made to work, both technically and pedagogically, in real and},

@article{Aleven2009,
abstract = {The Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) support creation of a novel type of tutors called example-tracing tutors. Unlike other types of ITSs (e.g., model-tracing tutors, constraint-based tutors), exampletracing tutors evaluate student behavior by flexibly comparing it against generalized examples of problem-solving behavior. Example-tracing tutors are capable of sophisticated tutoring behaviors; they provide step-by-step guidance on complex problems while recognizing multiple student strategies and (where needed) maintaining multiple interpretations of student behavior. They therefore go well beyond VanLehn's (2006) minimum criterion for ITS status, namely, that the system has an inner loop (i.e., provides within-problem guidance, not just end-of-problem feedback). Using CTAT, example-tracing tutors can be created without programming. An author creates a tutor interface through drag-and-drop techniques, and then demonstrates the problem-solving behaviors to be tutored. These behaviors are recorded in a "behavior graph," which can be easily edited and generalized. Compared to other approaches to programming by demonstration for ITS development, CTAT implements a simpler method (no machine learning is used) that is currently more pragmatic and proven for widespread, real-world use by non-programmers. Development time estimates from a large number of real-world ITS projects that have used CTAT suggest that example-tracing tutors reduce development cost by a factor of 4 to 8, compared to "historical" estimates of ITS development time and cost. The main contributions of the work are a novel ITS technology, based on the use of generalized behavioral examples to guide students in problem-solving exercises, as well as a suite of mature and robust tools for efficiently building real-world ITSs without programming. {\textcopyright} 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems are effective for improving students' learning outcomes (Pane et al. 2013; Koedinger and Anderson, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 8, 1–14, 1997; Bowen et al. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 1, 94–111 2013). However, constructing tutoring systems that are pedagogically effective has been widely recognized as a challenging problem (Murray 2003; Murray, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10, 98–129, 1999). In this paper, we explore the use of computational models of apprentice learning, or computer models that learn interactively from examples and feedback, for authoring expert-models via demonstrations and feedback (Matsuda et al. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 25(1), 1–34 2014) across a wide range of domains. To support these investigations, we present the Apprentice Learner Architecture, which posits the types of knowledge, performance, and learning components needed for apprentice learning. We use this architecture to create two models: the Decision Tree model, which non-incrementally learns skills, and the Trestle model, which instead learns incrementally. Both models draw on the same small set of prior knowledge (six operators and three types of relational knowledge) to support expert model authoring. Despite their limited prior knowledge, we demonstrate their use for efficiently authoring a novel experimental design tutor and show that they are capable of learning an expert model for seven additional tutoring systems that teach a wide range of knowledge types (associations, categories, and skills) across multiple domains (language, math, engineering, and science). This work shows that apprentice learner models are efficient for authoring tutors that would be difficult to build with existing non-programmer authoring approaches (e.g., experimental design or stoichiometry tutors). Further, we show that these models can be applied to author tutors across eight tutor domains even though they only have a small, fixed set of prior knowledge. This work lays the foundation for new interactive machine-learning based authoring paradigms that empower teachers and other non-programmers to build pedagogically effective educational technologies at scale.},

abstract = {The goal of our research is to investigate whether a Cognitive Tutor can be made more effective by extending it to help students acquire help-seeking skills. .We present a preliminary model of help-seeking behavior that will provide the basis for a Help-Seeking Tutor Agent. The model, implemented by 57 production rules, captures both productive and unproductive help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions, We found that 72% of all student actions represented unproductive help-seeking behavior. Consistent with some of our earlier work (Aleven & Koedinger, 2000) we found a proliferation of hint abuse (e.g., using hints to find answers rather than trying to understand). We also found that students frequently avoided using help when it was likely to be of benefit and often acted in a quick, possibly undeliberate manner. Students' help-seeking behavior accounted for as much variance in their learning gains as their performance at the cognitive level (i.e., the errors that they made with the tutor). These findings indicate that the help-seeking model needs to be adjusted, but they also underscore the importance of the educational need that the Help-Seeking Tutor Agent aims to address. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Following Computer Aided Instruction systems, 2nd generation tutors are Model-Tracing Tutors (MTTs) (Anderson & Pelletier, 1991) which are intelligent tutoring systems that have been very successful at aiding student learning, but have not reached the level of performance of experienced human tutors (Anderson et al., 1995). To that end, this paper presents a new architecture called ATM ("Adding a Tutorial Model"), which is an extension to model-tracing, that allows these tutors to engage in a dialog that is more like those in which experienced human tutors engage. Specifically, while MTTs provide hints toward doing the next problem-solving step, this 3rd generation of tutors, the ATM architecture, adds the capability to ask questions towards thinking about the knowledge behind the next problem-solving step. We present a new tutor built in ATM, called Ms. Lindquist, which is designed to carry on a tutorial dialog about algebra symbolization. The difference between ATM and MTT is the separate tutorial model that encodes pedagogical content knowledge in the form of different tutorial strategies, which were partially developed by observing an experienced human tutor. Ms. Lindquist has tutored thousands of students at www.AlgebraTutor.org. Future work will reveal if Ms. Lindquist is a better tutor because of the addition of the tutorial model. {\textcopyright} 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.},

It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them.

Not only will research in this paradigm help us understand the nature of human cognition, but findings from psychology can serve as useful heuristics to guide our search for accounts of intelligence. I present some constraints of this sort that future research should incorporate, and I claim that another psychological notion – cognitive architecture – is especially relevant to developing unified theories of the mind.

abstract = {One aim of the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) is to reduce the time and cost of authoring Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Recent work with SimStudent offers a promising approach to the efficient au- thoring of expert models and misconception libraries. SimStudent works by in- ducing general production rule models from author demonstrations and feed- back. Importantly, the demonstration and feedback takes place directly in the tutor interface and requires no programming. Empirical results have shown that models induced by SimStudent fit student data better than models hand- authored by domain experts. Additionally, an analysis with the Goals, Opera- tors, Methods, and Selection rules (GOMS) model showed that authoring with SimStudent is more efficient than authoring with current approaches, namely Example-Tracing. This paper reviews those results and provides an example of constructing a simple algebra tutor with SimStudent. This work with SimStu- dent presents several concepts that may be useful in the design and develop- ment of GIFT: modularization to allow for tutor authoring by non- programmers, generation of likely student misconceptions as a byproduct of ex- pert-model creation, and methods for comparing and evaluating authoring tools.},

To address this challenge, a new line of research has begun to coalesce around the concept of cognitive systems that users can teach rather than program. A key goal of this research is to develop natural approaches for end users to directly train these systems to perform new tasks. However, there does not currently exist a language for describing the key components of cognitive system training interactions and how these components relate to the concept of naturalness for end users. This paper begins to explore this gap. To lay the foundation for this exploration, we review relevant prior machine learning and interaction frameworks as well as the human-computer interaction literature to identify characteristics of systems that have historically been natural for end users to interact with. Based on this review, we propose the Natural Training Interactions (NTI) framework, which decomposes cognitive system training interaction into patterns, types, and modalities, all of which support the acquisition of different kinds of knowledge. Finally, we discuss how this framework characterizes existing research within this space and how it can guide future research.},

However, building an ITS is a time-consuming process which requires specialized knowledge of existing tools. Extant authoring methods, including the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools' (CTAT) example-tracing method and SimStudent's Authoring by Tutoring, use programming-by-demonstration to allow authors to build ITSs more quickly than they could by hand programming with model-tracing. Yet these methods still suffer from long authoring times or difficulty creating complete models. In this study, we demonstrate that Simulated Learners built with the Apprentice Learner (AL) Framework can be combined with a novel interaction design that emphasizes model transparency, input flexibility, and problem solving control to enable authors to achieve greater model completeness in less time than existing authoring methods.},

The focus of the work described in the paper is on the practical execution of the studies and the methodological conclusions drawn on the basis of the authors' experience. While the focus is on natural language interfaces, the methods used and the conclusions drawn from the results obtained are of relevance also to other kinds of intelligent interfaces. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@inproceedings{Yang2020,
abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to unde-sired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

@article{Simard,
abstract = {The current processes for building machine learning systems require practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing demand for ma- chine learning systems we must significantly increase the number of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all, universally accessible. While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the accuracy of “learners”, the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy of the “teachers”. Ma- chine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming lan- guages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and design principles of interac- tion and visualization. In this paper, we present our position re- garding the discipline of machine teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also describe how, by decou- pling knowledge about machine learning al- gorithms from the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of new uses for machine learning models.},

The work focuses on the acquisition of diverse types of knowledge including perceptual, semantic, and procedural knowledge along with learn-ing grounded meanings. Interactive learning allows the agent to control its learning by requesting instructions about unknown concepts, making learning efficient. Our approach has been instantiated in Soar and has been evaluated on a table-top robotic arm capable of manipulating small objects.},
