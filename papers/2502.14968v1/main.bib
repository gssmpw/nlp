abstract="This paper introduces a complete side channel analysis toolbox, inclusive of the analog capture hardware, target device, capture software, and analysis software. The highly modular design allows use of the hardware and software with a variety of existing systems. The hardware uses a synchronous capture method which greatly reduces the required sample rate, while also reducing the data storage requirement, and improving synchronization of traces. The synchronous nature of the hardware lends itself to fault injection, and a module to generate glitches of programmable width is also provided. The entire design (hardware and software) is open-source, and maintained in a publicly available repository. Several long example capture traces are provided for researchers looking to evaluate standard cryptographic implementations.",

abstract="Different evaluation measures assess different characteristics of machine learning algorithms. The empirical evaluation of algorithms and classifiers is a matter of on-going debate among researchers. Most measures in use today focus on a classifier's ability to identify classes correctly. We note other useful properties, such as failure avoidance or class discrimination, and we suggest measures to evaluate such properties. These measures -- Youden's index, likelihood, Discriminant power -- are used in medical diagnosis. We show that they are interrelated, and we apply them to a case study from the field of electronic negotiations. We also list other learning problems which may benefit from the application of these measures.",
