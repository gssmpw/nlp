    %in the example - the one above is an acyclic graph while the other graph contains a cycle. For each sub-graph, we calculate the strongly connected components. According to Definition \ref{cyc sub}, we derive $\bdata$ based on $\data$ as shown in the right figure. In other words, the graphs are reduced to non-singleton SCCs. As a result, $\Gc^{(1)}$ is removed from the dataset.   \label{fig:main_figure}
