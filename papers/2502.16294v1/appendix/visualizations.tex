\section{Visualizations}

\textbf{Visualizations for LMC-Synth.} We provide visualizations for the multivariate synthetic data generated by LMC-Synth. For clarity, we have limited the number of channels to 5 and the sequence length to 96. Figures 3-6 showcase the MTS data generated using LMC-Synth.

\textbf{The Forecasts of TimePFN.} We provide forecasts from \name under various data budgets and datasets, including zero-shot and full-data scenarios. Figures 7-18 display the forecasts of \name in these settings. As shown, with an increasing data budget, \name's forecasts align more closely with the ground truth.
