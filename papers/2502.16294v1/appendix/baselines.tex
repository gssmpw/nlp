\section{Baseline Details}
In addition to the main body, we would like to elaborate on how we aggregated the forecasting results from Chronos-small \cite{ansari2024chronos} and ForecastPFN \cite{dooley2023forecastpfn}. We chose Chronos-small because its parameter size is somewhat closer to \name's compared to the larger variations of Chronos. We opted not to use Chronos-Tiny to maintain a stronger baseline. \name has approximately 8.5 million parameters, whereas Chronos-small has 46 million parameters, significantly exceeding the parameter count of \name. As Chronos is a probabilistic model, we performed inference on each time-series data point three times with Chronos and averaged the results to obtain the final point forecast, except for the Exchange dataset. Our evaluation of Chronos on the Exchange dataset yielded unstable results with three inference iterations; therefore, we conducted five runs for this dataset. We aggregated the ForecastPFN results using their published model weights.
