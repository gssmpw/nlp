\subsection{\textcolor{black}{AI Integration in Creative Processes}}

\textcolor{black}{Advancements in AI technology have significantly impacted various creative domains~\cite{anantrasirichai2022artificial, 10.1145/3613904.3642726}, reshaping fields such as art~\cite{cetinic2022understanding} and design~\cite{lee2023impact}. In art, AI has contributed to interactive media and visual representation~\cite{anadol2018archive, sun2023ai, tang2023ai}. In design, AI has been integrated into product design workflows, fostering innovation in idea generation~\cite{hong2023generative, chiou2023designing} and advancing user interface design through features such as adaptability~\cite{cheng2023play, zhang2023layoutdiffusion}. Furthermore, the impact of AI-generated image tools on workflows has been explored~\cite{mustafa2023impact, tang2024s}, highlighting AI’s potential to democratize graphic design~\cite{tang2024exploring} and emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance AI systems~\cite{meron2022graphic}. As AI-generated video capabilities advance, AI is also reshaping fashion design through dynamic visuals~\cite{liu2019toward, karras2023dreampose} and supporting the creation of short-form social media videos~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642476}. Additionally, other research highlights AI's role in various creative domains, such as design~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642812}, and data storytelling~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642726}.}

\subsection{\textcolor{black}{AI Tools for Creative Writing}}
\textcolor{black}{Creative writing, as a text-based creative work encompassing novels, short stories, poetry, and essays, emphasizes linguistic artistry, stylistic diversity, and imaginative narrative freedom~\cite{ramet2011creative, smith2020writing, mcvey2008all}. The development of AI technologies has significantly supported this creative field~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642529}, evolving from natural language processing to advanced deep learning systems. This progression spans basic tools like spell checkers~\cite{peterson1980computer}, crowdsourcing platforms~\cite{kim2017mechanical, kim2014ensemble}, and crowd role-play approaches~\cite{huang2020heteroglossia}, to AI-driven character role-playing systems~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642105}. Prior studies have shown that AI reduces creative workloads by providing valuable suggestions~\cite{gero2019stylistic, bernstein2010soylent} and refining content for professional use~\cite{hui2018introassist, roemmele2015creative, clark2018creative}, thereby helping writers overcome creative blocks. Specifically, AI-supported creative writing processes are currently categorized into story development and character creation~\cite{radford2019language, yang2019sketching, calderwood2020novelists, clark2018creative, coenen2021wordcraft}.}

\textcolor{black}{In story development, platforms such as Dramatica~\cite{dramatica} and AI Dungeon~\cite{aidungeon} support story generation. TaleStream combines AI recommendation algorithms with database-driven trope suggestions for narratives but has yet to integrate evolving generative AI technologies~\cite{chou2023talestream}. Rule-based methods for story extension have also been explored~\cite{lebowitz1984creating, meehan1977tale, riedl2010narrative}. However, we found that these approaches primarily focus on text-based support and do not incorporate visual elements. In character creation, prior works demonstrate that AI can simulate characters' personalities~\cite{cavazza2001characters}, infer characters' relationships~\cite{chaturvedi2017unsupervised}, facilitate AI-character dialogues~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642105}, and map character trajectories~\cite{chung2022talebrush}. These tools showcase the potential of AI for inspiring character development~\cite{10.1145/3450741.3465253, shakeri2021saga, yuan2022wordcraft}, but they are often limited to isolated stages and lack integration across the creative workflow. Additionally, challenges in human-AI collaboration remain. Grigis and Angeli recently examined the limitations of LLM-assisted writing, particularly in handling taboos and conflicts~\cite{10.1145/3656650.3656688}. Dhillon et al. emphasized the importance of personalized systems to accommodate the diverse experiences of writers~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642134}, and Lee et al. provided broad recommendations for the development of future AI tools~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642697}. Meanwhile, Biermann et al. underscored writers’ concerns about the potential impact of AI on creativity~\cite{biermann2022tool}.}

\textcolor{black}{Based on these, we note that existing research largely focuses on text-based AI support, often overlooking the consideration of visual elements in the creative process. 
This limitation reduces the suitability of these approaches for certain types of creative writing, particularly screenwriting, which is inherently characterized by audiovisual and dynamic storytelling~\cite{senje2017formatting}. Furthermore, existing studies often focus on isolated stages of the creative process, overlooking the complete workflow that integrates structured principles~\cite{mckee1997substance} and collaboration with stakeholders~\cite{taylor2024one, cake2021collaborative, batty2018script}, both of which are essential to screenwriting.

\subsection{\textcolor{black}{AI-Supported Screenwriting}}

\textcolor{black}{The development of AI technologies has already influenced screenwriting~\cite{batty2015screenwriter, anguiano2023hollywood}. Previous applications of AI tools in screenwriting have primarily focused on three areas: information processing, emotional support, and visualization.}

%\textcolor{black}{For information processing, AI tools assist with retrieving background information~\cite{pavel2015sceneskim}, ensuring narrative consistency~\cite{sanghrajka2017lisa, kapadia2015computer}, and supporting story continuation~\cite{valls2016error, mateas2003experiment}. Traditional tools like Final Draft~\cite{finaldraft} integrate AI for scene organization and formatting, while AI systems like ChatGPT~\cite{chatgpt, luchen2023chatgpt} and DeepStory~\cite{deepstory} offer predictive analytics and co-writing capabilities~\cite{chow2020ghost}, streamlining the screenwriting process. For emotion support, earlier studies have explored emotion analysis in narratives~\cite{stapleton2003interactive}. Goyal et al.'s AESOP system analyzes emotions through plot units, helping screenwriters understand emotional trajectories~\cite{goyal2010toward}. However, it relies on basic emotion tags (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), failing to capture complex emotional dynamics. Su et al.'s work on simulating basic and mixed emotions~\cite{su2007personality} improved character expression but lacked deeper insight into emotions tied to plans and reasoning, limiting its integration into the screenwriting workflow. For visualization, previous research is divided into data visualization and visual representation. In data visualization, studies have summarized storylines~\cite{tapaswi2014storygraphs} and managed character arcs~\cite{kim2017visualizing}, providing a foundation for data-driven AI systems. In visual representation, AI tools use NLP to create 2D and 3D visualizations of screenplay content~\cite{10.1145/3172944.3172972, kim2017visualizing}, including character interactions~\cite{won2014generating} and scenes~\cite{hanser2009scenemaker}. However, these tools lack real-time feedback, and suitable visual representation, and rely on the quality of screenplay content. Beyond these main types of previous research, a recent work closely related to ours is the Dramatron system~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}, which explores the integration of LLMs into screenwriting. However, it focuses only on LLMs, neglecting the impact of AI-generated images and videos.}

%\textcolor{black}{Previous empirical research shows that AI can generate screenplay elements comparable to those of human writers~\cite{ccelik4ai}, using tools like ChatGPT~\cite{chatgpt, luchen2023chatgpt} and DeepStory~\cite{deepstory}, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs~\cite{naji2024employing}, and offering inspiration~\cite{brako2023robots}. However, human creativity remains indispensable~\cite{naji2024employing, song2022analysis}. Furthermore, ethical concerns such as biases~\cite{chow2020ghost} and copyright issues~\cite{kavitha2023copyright} remain significant challenges. However, these studies have neither explored the specific ways AI has been integrated into different stages of screenwriting nor examined how screenwriters' attitudes concretely influence their actual practices.}

\textcolor{black}{Additionally, previous empirical research has shown that AI can generate screenplay elements comparable to those created by human writers~\cite{ccelik4ai}, leveraging tools like ChatGPT~\cite{chatgpt, luchen2023chatgpt} and DeepStory~\cite{deepstory} to enhance efficiency, reduce costs~\cite{naji2024employing}, and inspire creativity~\cite{brako2023robots}. Despite these advancements, human creativity remains irreplaceable~\cite{naji2024employing, song2022analysis}.

%\textcolor{black}{Building on prior research in visual-based creative domains, the significance of effective human-AI co-creation has become increasingly evident. This inspires us to investigate whether the diverse AI capabilities and applications demonstrated in visual-based creative tasks have influenced text-based creative works.}

%\textcolor{black}{Advancements in AI have transformed creative domains such as the arts and design~\cite{anantrasirichai2022artificial, 10.1145/3613904.3642726, cetinic2022understanding, lee2023impact, 10.1145/3613904.3642812}. In art, AI supports interactive media and visual representation~\cite{anadol2018archive, sun2023ai, tang2023ai}. In design, it fosters innovation in product workflows~\cite{hong2023generative, chiou2023designing} and advances user interface adaptability~\cite{cheng2023play, zhang2023layoutdiffusion}. AI-generated image tools further democratize graphic design~\cite{tang2024exploring, mustafa2023impact, tang2024s}, with interdisciplinary collaboration advocated to improve AI systems~\cite{meron2022graphic}. As AI-generated video capabilities expand, AI is transforming fashion design~\cite{liu2019toward, karras2023dreampose} and assisting social media creators~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642476}.}

%\textcolor{black}{Beyond these visual-based creative domains, AI’s impact also extends to diverse areas such as data-driven work~\cite{10.1145/3613905.3650841, muller2019data, wang2021much, 10.1145/3613904.3642726} and text-based work~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3580782}. Notably, creative writing, as a text-based domain, increasingly emphasizes human-AI co-creation. For instance, Kim et al. investigated AI's role in creative language arts, such as poetry and novels~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642529}, highlighting the evolving significance of AI tools in enhancing the creative process.}


%\subsection{\textcolor{black}{General-Purpose AI Tools for Creative Writing}}


%\textcolor{black}{Creative writing, encompassing novels, short stories, poetry, and essays, prioritizes linguistic artistry, stylistic diversity, and imaginative freedom~\cite{ramet2011creative, smith2020writing, mcvey2008all}.

Previous research has synthesized findings from 115 articles on AI-assisted writing, offering recommendations for future tools~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642697}.

%One of AI’s most impactful contributions of previous works has been its ability to reduce the creative workload for writers. AI tools offer valuable suggestions~\cite{gero2019stylistic, bernstein2010soylent}, refine content in professional contexts~\cite{hui2018introassist, swanson2008say, roemmele2015creative, clark2018creative}, and help writers overcome creative bottlenecks. Studies have examined the attitudes of writers toward these generative AI tools, revealing concerns about AI's role in shaping creative ideas~\cite{biermann2022tool}. Platforms like HaLLMark Effect have been proposed to facilitate collaboration between writers and AI models, further streamlining the creative process~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3641895}.

%AI tools for narrative structuring and storytelling including commercial tools like Dramatica \footnote{https://dramatica.com/}, and AI Dungeon \footnote{https://aidungeon.com/} assist in narrative structuring, while ASM's structured story model provides computational understanding for cultural storytelling differences~\cite{finlayson2012learning}. Methods for extending stories based on rules and objectives~\cite{lebowitz1984creating, meehan1977tale, riedl2010narrative} and tools like TaleStream~\cite{chou2023talestream} have also been explored.

Tools have been developed for simulating virtual characters~\cite{cavazza2001characters}, inferring character relationships~\cite{chaturvedi2017unsupervised}, and mapping character destinies through systems like TaleBrush~\cite{chung2022talebrush}. Research highlights the use of large language models (LLMs) in generating character dialogue and inspiring new characters~\cite{10.1145/3450741.3465253, shakeri2021saga, yuan2022wordcraft}. 

%These AI tools reduce creative workload~\cite{quinn2016cost}, offer suggestions~\cite{gero2019stylistic, bernstein2010soylent, singh2023hide, peng2020exploring}, and assist in professional settings~\cite{hui2018introassist, swanson2008say, roemmele2015creative, clark2018creative}. Writers' attitudes toward generative AI tools have been studied, with concerns about AI's role in transforming creative ideas into text~\cite{biermann2022tool}. Platforms like HaLLMark Effect have been proposed to enhance collaboration between writers and LLMs~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3641895}. Research shows varying interactions based on writers' experience levels, emphasizing the need for personalized, user-centered AI tools~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642134}. However, existing studies often focus on general writers, and limited control may restrict AI's applicability in specialized domains~\cite{chung2022talebrush}.

%User experience in AI-assisted writing has also garnered attention. Paramveer S. Dhillon et al. indicate that writers' interactions with AI tools vary based on their level of experience, emphasizing the importance of designing personalized, user-centered AI systems~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642134}. While AI’s potential to assist in creative writing is evident, its current applications often focus on general writing tasks. However, there is limited control for domain-specific needs, such as in screenwriting, where the demands for structuring narrative, dialogue, and character arcs are more complex~\cite{chung2022talebrush}. Our research specifically addresses this gap by providing insights into screenwriting as a distinct domain and offering tailored AI applications to better support screenwriters' workflows.

%Creative writing, encompassing novels, short stories, poetry, and essays, prioritizes linguistic artistry, stylistic diversity, and authorial freedom~\cite{ramet2011creative, smith2020writing, mcvey2008all}. The emergence of AI in creative writing has introduced potential transformations, evolving from early attempts at simple spell checkers~\cite{peterson1980computer} to advanced deep learning applications for human-AI co-creation in structure development, character creation, and content review~\cite{radford2019language, yang2019sketching, calderwood2020novelists, clark2018creative, coenen2021wordcraft}, increasingly influencing the creative process. Specifically, AI tools for narrative structuring in creative writing include commercial platforms like Dramatica\footnote{https://dramatica.com/} and AI Dungeon\footnote{https://aidungeon.com/}, etc. Methods for extending stories based on rules and objectives have been explored~\cite{lebowitz1984creating, meehan1977tale, riedl2010narrative}, along with tools like TaleStream~\cite{chou2023talestream}. Additionally, AI has been utilized in crowdsourced story creation and creative leadership structuring~\cite{huang2020heteroglossia, kim2017mechanical, kim2014ensemble}, as well as for specific creative tasks such as newspaper headline creation~\cite{gatti2016heady} and poetry generation~\cite{ghazvininejad2017hafez}. Moreover, AI assistance in character development has also been another key focus, with tools developed for simulating virtual characters~\cite{cavazza2001characters}, inferring character relationships~\cite{chaturvedi2017unsupervised}, and mapping character destinies through systems like TaleBrush~\cite{chung2022talebrush}. Research also highlights the use of large language models (LLMs) in generating character dialogue and inspiring new characters~\cite{10.1145/3450741.3465253, shakeri2021saga, yuan2022wordcraft}. 

%Furthermore, user experience in AI-supported creative writing has garnered attention. The main contributions of AI in previous works typically lie in its ability to reduce the creative workload for writers by offering valuable suggestions~\cite{gero2019stylistic, bernstein2010soylent}, refining content in professional contexts~\cite{hui2018introassist, swanson2008say, roemmele2015creative, clark2018creative}, and helping writers overcome creative bottlenecks. Platforms like HaLLMark Effect have been proposed to facilitate collaboration between writers and AI models, streamlining the creative process~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3641895}. However, challenges in human-AI collaboration are also arisen in this field. Biermann et al. have examined the attitudes of writers toward these generative AI tools, revealing concerns about AI's role in shaping creative ideas~\cite{biermann2022tool}. Dhillon et al. indicate that writers' interactions with AI tools vary based on their experience level, emphasizing the importance of designing personalized, user-centered AI systems~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642134}. Lee et al. synthesized findings from 115 articles on AI-assisted writing, offering recommendations for future tools~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642697}. Through previous research, we found that AI's evident potential to assist in creative writing. However, its current applications often focus on general writing tasks. There is limited support for domain-specific needs, such as in screenwriting, where the demands for structure, plot, dialogue, and character arcs are more complex~\cite{chung2022talebrush}. Therefore, our research specifically addresses this gap by providing insights into screenwriting as a distinct domain and offering suggestions for developing AI functions to better support screenwriters.

%\subsection{AI-powered Tools in Screenwriting}

%\textcolor{black}{The development of AI technologies has impacted screenwriting~\cite{batty2015screenwriter, anguiano2023hollywood}. Previous research highlights that AI can primarily assist screenwriting in three areas: information processing, emotion support, and visualization.}

%\textcolor{black}{For information processing, AI tools assist with retrieving background information~\cite{pavel2015sceneskim}, ensuring narrative consistency~\cite{sanghrajka2017lisa, kapadia2015computer}, and supporting story continuation~\cite{valls2016error, mateas2003experiment}. Traditional tools like Final Draft~\cite{finaldraft} integrate AI for scene organization and formatting, while AI systems like ChatGPT~\cite{chatgpt, luchen2023chatgpt} and DeepStory~\cite{deepstory} offer predictive analytics and co-writing capabilities~\cite{chow2020ghost}, streamlining the screenwriting process. For emotion support, earlier studies have explored emotion analysis in narratives~\cite{stapleton2003interactive}. Goyal et al.'s AESOP system analyzes emotions through plot units, helping screenwriters understand emotional trajectories~\cite{goyal2010toward}. However, it relies on basic emotion tags (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), failing to capture complex emotional dynamics. Su et al.'s work on simulating basic and mixed emotions~\cite{su2007personality} improved character expression but lacked deeper insight into emotions tied to plans and reasoning, limiting its integration into the screenwriting workflow. For visualization, previous research is divided into data visualization and visual representation. In data visualization, studies have summarized storylines~\cite{tapaswi2014storygraphs} and managed character arcs~\cite{kim2017visualizing}, providing a foundation for data-driven AI systems. In visual representation, AI tools use NLP to create 2D and 3D visualizations of screenplay content~\cite{10.1145/3172944.3172972, kim2017visualizing}, including character interactions~\cite{won2014generating} and scenes~\cite{hanser2009scenemaker}. However, these tools lack real-time feedback, and suitable visual representation, and rely on the quality of screenplay content. Beyond these main types of previous research, a recent work closely related to ours is the Dramatron system~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}, which explores the integration of LLMs into screenwriting. However, it focuses only on LLMs, neglecting the impact of AI-generated images and videos.}

%\textcolor{black}{Overall, while these tools assist screenwriters, many have limitations that could be addressed by evolving AI technologies. Our study aims to understand how screenwriters expect AI to be applied and offer suggestions for future system design, thereby filling gaps in the field of screenwriting.}

However, it relies on basic emotion tags (e.g., positive, negative, neutral), missing more complex emotional dynamics. Su et al.'s work on simulating basic and mixed emotions~\cite{su2007personality} enhanced character expression but lacked a nuanced understanding of emotions tied to plans and reasoning, limiting its integration across the screenwriting workflow.} \textcolor{black}{For visualization, previous work can be divided into data visualization and visual representation.

As generative AI evolves, its growing impact on screenwriting, combining creative writing and film production, has become evident~\cite{batty2015screenwriter, anguiano2023hollywood}. While screenwriting shares imaginative elements with creative writing, it focuses on storytelling through visual and auditory media~\cite{batty2014screenwriters, kerrigan2016re}.

Traditional screenwriting tools like Final Draft~\cite{finaldraft}, now enhanced with AI, assist in organizing scenes and formatting screenplays. AI tools have also advanced in areas such as information retrieval, logical consistency checks, and emotional state mapping~\cite{sanghrajka2017lisa, goyal2010toward}, with applications like AESOP identifying and mapping character emotions~\cite{goyal2010toward}. Additionally, AI is widely used in collaborative screenwriting and story continuation~\cite{schank2013scripts, valls2016error, mateas2003experiment, lehnert1981plot, li2012crowdsourcing}. Visualization is also a key focus of previous AI exploration in screenwriting, with tools like Cardinal visualizing structure, characters, and scenes using NLP~\cite{10.1145/3172944.3172972}, and Story Explorer managing character arcs and event chronology~\cite{kim2017visualizing}. Other tools visualize multi-character interactions and generate scene possibilities~\cite{won2014generating}, automatically summarize character interactions~\cite{tapaswi2014storygraphs}, and create multi-character animations~\cite{kapadia2016canvas}. There are also several additional tools support tangible storyboard creation~\cite{bartindale2012storycrate, bartindale2016tryfilm} and fictional world-building~\cite{poulakos2015towards}.

Recent advancements, including ChatGPT~\cite{chatgpt, luchen2023chatgpt} and DeepStory~\cite{deepstory}, offer predictive analytics and co-writing capabilities~\cite{chow2020ghost}. The system Dramatron, developed by Mirowski et al.~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}, demonstrated the potential of integrating LLMs into screenwriting workflows. However, these studies focused exclusively on LLM technology, overlooking developments in other areas such as AI-generated images and videos. Therefore, our study aims first to understand screenwriters' current workflows and then explore the specific ways in which AI is used within this workflow.
\end{comment}

%Dramatron, for instance, uses large language models to generate coherent screenplays through hierarchical text generation, from log lines to complete scripts~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}. However, these tools often follow a linear process, while screenwriting is typically nonlinear, involving frequent exploration, iteration, and remixing~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}. Therefore, our study aims first to understand screenwriters' current flexible and variable nonlinear workflows and then explore the specific ways in which AI is used within this workflow.



%Generative AI's growing impact on screenwriting, a blend of creative writing and film production, is becoming more evident~\cite{batty2015screenwriter, anguiano2023hollywood}. While screenwriting shares elements with creative writing, it focuses on storytelling through visual and auditory media~\cite{batty2014screenwriters, kerrigan2016re}.

%Traditional tools like Final Draft \footnote{http://www.http://finaldraft.com.} and Adobe Story \footnote{https://story.adobe.com.}, now enhanced with AI, organize scenes and format screenplays. AI also assists in information retrieval, logical consistency checks, and emotional state mapping~\cite{sanghrajka2017lisa, goyal2010toward}. For example, AESOP identifies and maps character emotional states~\cite{goyal2010toward}. AI has also been applied to collaborative screenwriting and continuation~\cite{schank2013scripts, valls2016error, mateas2003experiment, lehnert1981plot, li2012crowdsourcing}.


%Traditional screenwriting tools like Final Draft \footnote{http://www.http://finaldraft.com.} and Adobe Story \footnote{https://story.adobe.com.}, now enhanced with AI, are commonly used for organizing scenes and formatting screenplays. AI tools have also advanced in areas such as information retrieval, logical consistency checks, and emotional state mapping in scripts~\cite{sanghrajka2017lisa, goyal2010toward}. There have also been advances in emotional applications, such as AESOP, which can identify character emotional states and map them to characters in a story~\cite{goyal2010toward}. Furthermore, AI has been widely applied in collaborative screenwriting and continuation~\cite{schank2013scripts, valls2016error, mateas2003experiment, lehnert1981plot, li2012crowdsourcing}. Given that the ultimate goal of screenwriting is to integrate visual and auditory elements, many studies have explored AI's role in visualizing screenplays. For example, Cardinal uses NLP techniques to visualize screenplay structure, characters, story nodes, and simple scenes based on character dialogue and actions~\cite{10.1145/3172944.3172972}. Story Explorer visualizes character story arcs and background information, providing script management that allows users to quickly specify the chronological order of events in a film~\cite{kim2017visualizing}. Other studies have proposed a tool for visualizing multi-character interactions using simple graphics and generating multiple potential scene possibilities from an action database~\cite{won2014generating}. Tapaswi et al. developed a visualization tool that automatically summarizes character interactions in completed films and TV shows~\cite{tapaswi2014storygraphs}. CANVAS allows users to create multi-character animations by automatically completing storyboards~\cite{kapadia2016canvas}. Additionally, there are tools for creating storyboards tangibly~\cite{bartindale2012storycrate, bartindale2016tryfilm} and tools that allow the creation of fictional story worlds, filling them with characters and objects for automatic narrative synthesis~\cite{poulakos2015towards}.

%While these AI-assisted tools address specific screenplay tasks, advancements in technology have significantly enhanced the capabilities of NLP, computer vision, text-to-image generation, and large language models. AI tools, such as ChatGPT\footnote{https://openai.com/chatgpt/}\cite{luchen2023chatgpt}, and DeepStory\footnote{https://www.deepstory.ai/}, are increasingly being integrated into the screenwriting process, providing predictive analytics and even co-writing capabilities~\cite{chow2020ghost}. Recently, the Dramatron system demonstrated that large language models could enhance screenwriting capabilities by generating coherent screenplays and drama scripts through hierarchical text generation. The system sequentially generates complete scripts, including titles, character lists, plot points, location descriptions, and dialogue, starting from a log line~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}. This research emphasizes a linear approach to script content generation but lacks flexibility in the workflow. While previous research has summarized common patterns and experiences of screenwriters~\cite{lawson1960theory, catron2017elements, smiley2005playwriting}, each screenwriter has a unique process in practice. Screenwriting is a nonlinear process with open-ended goals, not strictly following a predefined sequence. Screenwriters explore multiple solutions, frequently shifting from one to another, actively reviewing, remixing, and iterating them until a satisfactory result is achieved~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581225}. Therefore, our study aims first to understand screenwriters' current flexible and variable nonlinear workflows and then explore the specific ways in which AI is used within these workflows.

%\subsection{The Use of AI in Other Creativity Processes}

%\textcolor{black}{Advancements in AI technology have also impacted various other creative domains~\cite{anantrasirichai2022artificial, 10.1145/3613904.3642726}, reshaping fields such as the arts~\cite{cetinic2022understanding} and design~\cite{lee2023impact, 10.1145/3613904.3642812}. In art, AI contributes to interactive media and visual representation~\cite{anadol2018archive, sun2023ai, tang2023ai}, while Kim et al. explored AI’s influence on creative language arts, such as poetry, novels, and screenplays~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642529}. In design, AI integrates into product design workflows, fostering innovation~\cite{hong2023generative, chiou2023designing}, and advancing user interface design with innovations like adaptability~\cite{cheng2023play, zhang2023layoutdiffusion}. Meanwhile, with the impact of AI-generated image tools~\cite{mustafa2023impact, tang2024s}, AI’s democratizing potential in graphic design has been explored~\cite{tang2024exploring}, with a call for interdisciplinary collaboration to improve AI systems~\cite{meron2022graphic}. As AI-generated video capabilities develop, AI is also transforming fashion design with dynamic visuals~\cite{liu2019toward, karras2023dreampose} and aiding social media short-form video creators~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642476}. Additionally, other research highlights AI’s role across various creative domains, assisting knowledge workers~\cite{10.1145/3613905.3650841}, data scientists~\cite{muller2019data, wang2021much}, and data storytelling~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642726}.}

%\textcolor{black}{Based on these previous works, effective human-AI co-creation is increasingly emphasized across creative fields. Screenwriting, as part of creative industry, should also embrace this trend, driven by AI advancements. However, the complexity of narrative structures and emotional depth in audiovisual storytelling makes existing research from other creative fields insufficient for understanding AI integration in screenwriting. This underscores the need for targeted research to bridge these gaps and advance AI’s practical application in screenwriting.}

Across these fields, there is a shared call for fostering effective human-AI co-creation. AI is viewed as a tool to enhance, not replace, human creativity. However, challenges remain, including concerns about creative control, content homogenization, and the potential loss of diversity in artistic expression. These concerns are commonly reflected across the creative industries, where practitioners seek to balance the innovative potential of AI with maintaining the uniqueness and authenticity of human contributions. 

%As a part of the creative field, screenwriters also face these challenges. However, due to the complexity of narrative structures, character development, emotional depth, and the integration of audiovisual language in the screenwriting process, findings from other creative fields are insufficient to address the issues surrounding AI integration in this context. This highlights the necessity of conducting targeted research to bridge the existing knowledge gap and advance the practical application of AI in screenwriting.

%Given our focus on the screenwriting, it faces the same challenges as general creativity studies.

Based on these explorations of creative processes involving AI, our results both diverge from and align with Zhou et al.'s research on creative design~\cite{10.1145/3613904.3642812}. We have identified distinct future roles for AI, with a focus on understanding how screenwriters utilize AI and their expectations. Our findings contribute to the broader application of AI in creative domains, offering valuable new perspectives.

%AI's development in creative fields goes beyond writing~\cite{anantrasirichai2022artificial}, redefining authorship and creativity in areas like visual art~\cite{Bisson, Cai, roose2022ai}, photography~\cite{PostPhotographicPerspectivesFellowship}, and interactive media arts~\cite{cetinic2022understanding, anadol2018archive, sun2023ai, tang2023ai}.

Therefore, exploring how screenwriters use AI is crucial for understanding AI's broader role in creativity and contributing to AI research in creative industries.

%The development of AI in creative fields extends beyond creative writing~\cite{anantrasirichai2022artificial}. AI is redefining authorship and creativity in art, with many artists incorporating AI into their creative processes~\cite{manovich2019defining, mezei2020leonardo, goenaga2020critique}, including visual art~\cite{Bisson, Cai, roose2022ai}, photography~\cite{PostPhotographicPerspectivesFellowship}, and interactive media arts~\cite{cetinic2022understanding, anadol2018archive, sun2023ai, tang2023ai}. In the field of design, AI has long been integrated into workflows. In product design, AI facilitates visual generation, sparking innovative thinking despite some limitations in diversity~\cite{lee2023impact, hong2023generative, chiou2023designing}. Gmeiner et al. have explored the challenges and opportunities in helping engineers and architectural designers adopt AI-based tools for co-creation~\cite{gmeiner2023exploring}. In user interface design, the adoption of diffusion models has made design elements more intuitive, enhancing innovation~\cite{cheng2023play, zhang2023layoutdiffusion}. In fashion design, technologies such as Attribute-GAN and DreamPose have played a crucial role in automatically generating clothing-matching pairs and transforming static images into dynamic clothing showcase videos~\cite{liu2019toward, karras2023dreampose}. In graphic design, Tang et al.'s research examined the use of AI by designers in the field~\cite{tang2024s} and highlighted the democratizing potential of AI tools through a comparative study of professional and non-professional users in the art and design fields~\cite{tang2024exploring}. Mustafa studied the impact of AI-assisted and AI-based design tools on various specific tasks in graphic design~\cite{mustafa2023impact}. Meron emphasized that addressing issues in AI-assisted design systems requires interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science experts and graphic design specialists~\cite{meron2022graphic}. Additionally, in terms of integrating AI into different types of work and workflows, previous researchers have focused on data scientists' workflows, their use of AI, and their expectations~\cite{muller2019data, wang2019human, wang2021much}, as well as empirical studies on how knowledge workers in enterprises use large language models to assist their work~\cite{10.1145/3613905.3650841}. Therefore, in an era where AI technology is ubiquitous, gaining an in-depth understanding of how screenwriters use AI in actual creation, as an underexplored but highly significant research area within the creative domain, will not only deepen our understanding of AI's role in creativity but also provide valuable contributions to research on AI in the creativity field.

%\subsection{Empirical Study in Screenwriting}

%\textcolor{black}{Previous studies have explored the connection between screenwriting and creativity~\cite{bourgeois2014creativity, conor2010everybody, conor2010screenwriting}. Notable projects such as the short film script ``\textit{Sunspring}'' (2016)~\cite{sunspring} and the interactive playwriting project at the Young Vic (2021)~\cite{youngvic} have highlighted new trends in AI-powered screenwriting~\cite{millard2014screenwriting, ogle2019screenwriting, thorne2020hey}. Çelik's research suggests that AI can generate screenplay elements comparable to, and sometimes superior to, those created by human writers~\cite{ccelik4ai, naji2024employing}, though human artistic creativity remains irreplaceable~\cite{song2022analysis}. Brako et al. explored AI as a co-creation tool in screenwriting education~\cite{brako2023robots}, noting that it accelerates creativity by offering new inspiration. Other studies have examined AI's role in filmmaking, including screenwriting with LLMs like ChatGPT, showing that AI can enhance efficiency and reduce costs~\cite{naji2024employing, 10.1145/3656650.3656688}. However, these studies lack an understanding of how AI specifically integrates into the various stages of the screenwriting workflow. They are also limited to LLM assistance and do not consider the potential impact of AI-generated images and videos, which may provide unprecedented support for audiovisual storytelling in screenwriting. Thus, the broader implications of emerging AI technologies in screenwriting remain underexplored.}

%\textcolor{black}{Moreover, Chow's research has shown that biases in AI datasets related to race, gender, or ideology can affect creativity in the film industry~\cite{chow2020ghost}, and there are also challenges related to screenplay copyright~\cite{kavitha2023copyright}. Understanding how screenwriters' attitudes and expectations toward AI integration in specific stages of the screenwriting workflow may provide potential approaches or insights for mitigating or altering the impact of these issues.}

%\textcolor{black}{Overall, our study aims to fill these gaps by analyzing screenwriters' current workflows, challenges, and task allocation with AI, as well as their attitudes toward AI integration and expectations for future AI roles. Our findings aim to inform the design of human-AI co-creation tools tailored to the needs of screenwriters.}


%Previous studies have established a connection between screenwriting and creativity~\cite{bourgeois2014creativity, conor2010everybody, conor2010screenwriting}.

Additionally, Brako et al. has explored the use of AI as a co-creation tool in screenwriting education~\cite{brako2023robots}, highlighting that AI can accelerate the creative process and provide new sources of inspiration. However, the evaluation of works needs to be adapted to fit the AI co-creation environment. Other studies have explored the entire filmmaking process using various AI tools, including screenwriting with ChatGPT, showing that AI technology can significantly improve filmmaking efficiency and reduce costs. These studies suggest that the combination of AI and human creativity is key to the future sustainability of the film industry, where lower-level tasks may be automated by AI, but human artistic creativity and emotional input remain irreplaceable~\cite{song2022analysis}. However, research by Chow has found that potential biases related to race, gender, or ideology in AI datasets could affect the diversity and novelty of creativity in the film industry~\cite{chow2020ghost}, and these biases also pose challenges to screenplay copyright~\cite{kavitha2023copyright}.

%Overall, previous research has rarely addressed the specific needs for future AI functionalities as informed by feedback from screenwriters after actual use, lacking concrete insights into AI's practical applications and potential expectations in this domain. Therefore, our research aims to analyze screenwriters' practices, including task allocation across different stages of the workflow with AI, combining their current attitudes toward AI integration in screenwriting with their idealized expectations for future AI functionalities. This leads us to propose future design opportunities for human-AI co-creation tools tailored to the needs of screenwriters.
