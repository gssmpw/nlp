abstract = {We present Cardinal, a tool for computer-assisted authoring of movie scripts. Cardinal provides a means of viewing a script through a variety of perspectives, for interpretation as well as editing. This is made possible by virtue of intelligent automated analysis of natural language scripts and generating different intermediate representations. Cardinal generates 2-D and 3-D visualizations of the scripted narrative and also presents interactions in a timeline-based view. The visualizations empower the scriptwriter to understand their story from a spatial perspective, and the timeline view provides an overview of the interactions in the story. The user study reveals that users of the system demonstrated confidence and comfort using the system.},

abstract = {Co-creation with artificial intelligence (AI) is an upcoming trend. However, less attention has been given to the construction of systems for Japanese novelists. In this study, we built “BunCho”, an AI supported story co-creation system in Japanese. BunCho’s AI is GPT-2 (an unsupervised multitask language model) trained using a large-scale dataset of Japanese web texts and novels. With BunCho, users can generate titles and synopses from keywords. Furthermore, we propose an interactive story co-creation AI system as a tabletop role-playing game. According to summative studies of writers (N=16) and readers (N=32), 69\% writers enjoyed writing synopses with BunCho more than by themselves, and at least one of five common metrics were improved at objective evaluation, including creativity. In addition, 63\% writers indicated that BunCho broadened their stories. BunCho showed paths to assist Japanese novelists in creating high-level and creative writing.},

Concretely, writers progressively turn the bot into their imagined character through conversation. We iteratively developed CharacterChat in a user-centred approach, starting with a survey on character creation with writers (N=30), followed by two qualitative user studies (N=7 and N=8). Our prototype combines two modes: (1) Guided prompts help writers define character attributes (e.g. User: “Your name is Jane.”), including suggestions for attributes (e.g. Bot: “What is my main motivation?”) and values, realised as a rule-based system with a concept network. (2) Open conversation with the chatbot helps writers explore their character and get inspiration, realised with a language model that takes into account the defined character attributes. Our user studies reveal benefits particularly for early stages of character creation, and challenges due to limited conversational capabilities. We conclude with lessons learned and ideas for future work.},

While much research focuses on how users can interact with language models, less work considers the social-technical gap that this technology poses. What are the social nuances that underlie receiving support from a generative AI? In this work we ask when and why a creative writer might turn to a computer versus a peer or mentor for support. We interview 20 creative writers about their writing practice and their attitudes towards both human and computer support. We discover three elements that govern a writer’s interaction with support actors: 1) what writers desire help with, 2) how writers perceive potential support actors, and 3) the values writers hold. We align our results with existing frameworks of writing cognition and creativity support, uncovering the social dynamics which modulate user responses to generative technologies.},

abstract = {Language models are increasingly attracting interest from writers. However, such models lack long-range semantic coherence, limiting their usefulness for longform creative writing. We address this limitation by applying language models hierarchically, in a system we call Dramatron. By building structural context via prompt chaining, Dramatron can generate coherent scripts and screenplays complete with title, characters, story beats, location descriptions, and dialogue. We illustrate Dramatron’s usefulness as an interactive co-creative system with a user study of 15 theatre and film industry professionals. Participants co-wrote theatre scripts and screenplays with Dramatron and engaged in open-ended interviews. We report reflections both from our interviewees and from independent reviewers who critiqued performances of several of the scripts to illustrate how both Dramatron and hierarchical text generation could be useful for human-machine co-creativity. Finally, we discuss the suitability of Dramatron for co-creativity, ethical considerations—including plagiarism and bias—and participatory models for the design and deployment of such tools.},

abstract = {The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for writing has sparked controversy both among readers and writers. On one hand, writers are concerned that LLMs will deprive them of agency and ownership, and readers are concerned about spending their time on text generated by soulless machines. On the other hand, AI-assistance can improve writing as long as writers can conform to publisher policies, and as long as readers can be assured that a text has been verified by a human. We argue that a system that captures the provenance of interaction with an LLM can help writers retain their agency, conform to policies, and communicate their use of AI to publishers and readers transparently. Thus we propose HaLLMark, a tool for visualizing the writer’s interaction with the LLM. We evaluated HaLLMark with 13 creative writers, and found that it helped them retain a sense of control and ownership of the text.},

Building upon past research on early character construction stages, we explore how conversation with chatbot avatars embodying characters powered by more recent technologies could support the entire character construction process for creative writing. Through a user study (N=14) with creative writers, we examine thinking and usage patterns of CharacterMeet, a prototype system allowing writers to progressively manifest characters through conversation while customizing context, character appearance, voice, and background image. We discover that CharacterMeet facilitates iterative character construction. Specifically, participants, including those with more linear usual approaches, alternated between writing and personalized exploration through visualization of ideas on CharacterMeet while visuals and audio enhanced immersion. Our findings support research on iterative creative processes and the growing potential of personalizable generative AI creativity support tools. We present design implications for leveraging chatbot avatars in the creative writing process.},

abstract = {Advances in language modeling have paved the way for novel human-AI co-writing experiences. This paper explores how varying levels of scaffolding from large language models (LLMs) shape the co-writing process. Employing a within-subjects field experiment with a Latin square design, we asked participants (N=131) to respond to argumentative writing prompts under three randomly sequenced conditions: no AI assistance (control), next-sentence suggestions (low scaffolding), and next-paragraph suggestions (high scaffolding). Our findings reveal a U-shaped impact of scaffolding on writing quality and productivity (words/time). While low scaffolding did not significantly improve writing quality or productivity, high scaffolding led to significant improvements, especially benefiting non-regular writers and less tech-savvy users. No significant cognitive burden was observed while using the scaffolded writing tools, but a moderate decrease in text ownership and satisfaction was noted. Our results have broad implications for the design of AI-powered writing tools, including the need for personalized scaffolding mechanisms.},

To evaluate the role of ASVG as creator-centered collaborators, we conducted mixed-method research: (1) interviews (N = 17) and (2) a participatory design workshop (N = 12) with short-form video creators. In our interviews, we investigated creators’ production process and challenges in creating short-form videos. In participatory workshops, short-form video creators envisioned AI-powered video tools, addressing their requirements and AI collaboration perceptions. Our findings indicate ASVGs can provide various advantages including inspiration, swift access to video sources, and automated highlight generation. To put things in perspective, we also underscore concerns arising from AI collaboration, including potential creator identity dilution, reduced creative output, and information bubble. We also discuss design considerations when designing ASVG to retain their creative values.},

However, it is unclear what the authors’ values and attitudes would be regarding AI-bridged CLA. To identify these values and attitudes, we conducted an interview study with 18 authors across eight genres (e.g., poetry, comics) by presenting speculative but realistic AI-bridged CLA scenarios. We identified three benefits derived from the dynamics between author, artifact, and audience: those that 1) authors get from the process, 2) audiences get from the artifact, and 3) authors get from the audience. We found how AI-bridged CLA would either promote or reduce these benefits, along with authors’ concerns. We hope our investigation hints at how AI can provide intriguing experiences to CLA audiences while promoting authors’ values.},

Recent research has widely explored the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) to support and augment humans in data storytelling. However, there lacks a systematic review to understand data storytelling tools from the perspective of human-AI collaboration, which hinders researchers from reflecting on the existing collaborative tool designs that promote humans’ and AI’s advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. This paper investigated existing tools with a framework from two perspectives: the stages in the storytelling workflow where a tool serves, including analysis, planning, implementation, and communication, and the roles of humans and AI in each stage, such as creators, assistants, optimizers, and reviewers. Through our analysis, we recognize the common collaboration patterns in existing tools, summarize lessons learned from these patterns, and further illustrate research opportunities for human-AI collaboration in data storytelling.},

abstract = {Creative design is a nonlinear process where designers generate diverse ideas in the pursuit of an open-ended goal and converge towards consensus through iterative remixing. In contrast, AI-powered design tools often employ a linear sequence of incremental and precise instructions to approximate design objectives. Such operations violate customary creative design practices and thus hinder AI agents’ ability to complete creative design tasks. To explore better human-AI co-design tools, we first summarize human designers’ practices through a formative study with 12 design experts. Taking graphic design as a representative scenario, we formulate a nonlinear human-AI co-design framework and develop a proof-of-concept prototype, OptiMuse. We evaluate OptiMuse and validate the nonlinear framework through a comparative study. We notice a subconscious change in people’s attitudes towards AI agents, shifting from perceiving them as mere executors to regarding them as opinionated colleagues. This shift effectively fostered the exploration and reflection processes of individual designers.},

This paper focuses on creativity, defined as consensual agreement among domain experts. It presents an inductive analysis of seven semi-structured interviews with professional playwrights who engaged in a longitudinal project with the aim of writing a theatre script using commercial systems. Overall, participants regarded LLMs as unsuitable for playwrighting. However, they enjoyed the experience and identified utility for editorial tasks and brainstorming. A significant obstacle was associated with the politics embedded in LLMs. Not only did these systems avoid a language that could offend sensibilities, but they also refused to engage in taboos and conflicts, which are the core of dramaturgy. Other system features (speed, exploitation, and unpredictability) were sometimes considered conducive and sometimes detrimental to creativity. Participants experienced difficulties and tried to build common ground by trial and error. Often, this strategy evolved into role play: the playwright instructed the LLM to enact characters. The interaction provided hints of inspiration and fostered suspension of disbelief and ontological reflection. However, it often led to technology rejection. Comparing and contrasting our insights with related work, we conclude by opening new directions for research at the boundaries of HCI and AI.},
