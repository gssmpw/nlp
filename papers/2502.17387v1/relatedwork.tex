% % - Brief desciption of how reasoning models are trained: Some start with SFT, then go to RL. Others go straight to RL.
% There have been many proposed methods for training reasoning models: some directly fine-tune the model on supervised reasoning chains~\citep{liu2024acemathadvancingfrontiermath}, while others apply reinforcement learning to a pre-trained (i.e.\ base) or supervised fine-tuned model~\citep{openai2024openaio1card,deepseek2024r1, guan2025rstarmathsmallllmsmaster}.
