\caption{While many existing reasoning and/or multimodal benchmarks are largely solved by frontier models, all models struggle on \enigmaeval, demonstrating the benchmark's effectiveness for measuring continuing progress on multimodal reasoning. More frontier model results are shown in \Cref{tbl:pass_rates}.}
