        \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent\arraybackslash}p{7cm}}{According to CNN, solar power is one of the best potential solutions to the climate crisis, as it does not emit greenhouse gas or air pollution, and it could dominate the US electricity grid as early as 10 years from now.}

        \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent\arraybackslash}p{9cm}}{\textbf{Referential Ambiguity}: The phrase ``as early as 10 years from now'' is temporally ambiguous... There is no indication of the current year in the question or context.\newline \textbf{Structural Ambiguity}: The sentence could be interpreted as: (1) CNN claims that solar power is one of the best potential solutions to the climate crisis because it does not emit greenhouse gas or air pollution, and CNN also claims that solar power could dominate the US electricity grid as early as 10 years from now, (2) CNN claims that solar power is one of the best potential solutions to the climate crisis because it does not emit greenhouse gas or air pollution, while the claim that solar power could dominate the US electricity grid as early as 10 years from now is attributable to the writer, not to CNN.} \\
