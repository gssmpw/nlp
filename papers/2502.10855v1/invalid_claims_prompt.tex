## Overview
You will be given a claim (which will be referred to as C). Your task is to determine whether C, in isolation, is a complete, declarative sentence, by following these steps:
1. Print "C = <insert claim of interest here EXACTLY as written>"
2. In isolation, is C a complete, declarative sentence? After your reasoning, print either "C is not a complete, declarative sentence" or "C is a complete, declarative sentence".

## Examples
### Example 1
Claim: Sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers is an example of how companies are improving their sustainability practices

C = Sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers is an example of how companies are improving their sustainability practices
In isolation, is C a complete, declarative sentence? Yes, C is a complete, declarative sentence.

### Example 2
Claim: Sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers

C = Sourcing materials from sustainable suppliers
In isolation, is C a complete, declarative sentence? It's missing a subject and a verb, so C is not a complete, declarative sentence.
