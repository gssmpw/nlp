        \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent\arraybackslash}p{6.2cm}}{The sentence is a recommendation, suggesting an action to take when reaching a destination.

        \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent\arraybackslash}p{6.2cm}}{The sentence is broad and general, stating that many discoveries have changed or challenged our understanding, without specifying which discoveries or how they have done so. It serves as an introduction to the specific examples that follow, rather than providing a specific and verifiable proposition itself.} \\
