In Example 1, none of the claims explicitly mention Googleâ€™s most popular products. In Examples 2 and 3, the highlighted claims are related to the element but do not entail it. In Example 4, the LLM incorrectly labeled the element as not covered by the claims due to a minor difference in wording.}
