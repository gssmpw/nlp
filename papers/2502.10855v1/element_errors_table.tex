        Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is a revolutionary scientific achievement that changed our understanding of space, time, gravity and the universe. It consists of two parts: the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity. \textbf{The special theory of relativity, published in 1905, arose from \sethlcolor{lightred}\hl{Einstein's recognition that **light always travels at a constant speed** [1], regardless of the motion of the source or the observer.}}}
