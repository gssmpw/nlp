        & \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent}p{7cm}}{The efficiency, sustainability, and affordability of electric car batteries depend on various factors, such as the choice of materials, the design of the battery pack, the availability of recycling options, and the environmental impact of mining and manufacturing. Some of the challenges that researchers are working on include reducing the use of scarce or expensive metals such as cobalt and nickel, finding alternative materials that can store more energy per unit weight and volume, developing low-cost and high-quality recycling processes that can recover valuable metals from spent batteries, and minimizing the carbon footprint and social costs of battery production[1][2][7].\textbf{Electric car batteries have many advantages over conventional fossil fuel vehicles, such as lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower operating costs, and higher energy efficiency.}}

        & \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent}p{7cm}}{That's a great question! Traditional African drumming styles have a rich and diverse history and culture, and they have influenced many modern music genres across the globe.

        & \multicolumn{1}{>{\justifying\noindent}p{7cm}}{- Charging: This is the process of replenishing the battery with electricity from an external source.  \textbf{Charging can be done using different methods and standards, such as AC charging (using a regular wall outlet or a dedicated EVSE), DC fast charging (using a high-power station that can charge up to 80\% in 30 minutes), wireless charging (using electromagnetic induction or resonance), or battery swapping (replacing a depleted battery with a fully charged one).}}
