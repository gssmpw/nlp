\textbf{Claim Detection.} Many prior works on claim detection aim to identify ``check-worthy'' claims (____). Check-worthiness criteria include public interest ____, potential harm ____, and relevance to a topic, such as the environment ____. We agree with ____ and ____ that check-worthiness is subjective.

\noindent\textbf{Decomposition.} Claimify uses an LLM to extract claims as complete declarative sentences. Alternative decomposition approaches include extracting subject-predicate-object tuples ____, predicate-argument structures ____, questions ____, and subsets of tokens ____.

\noindent\textbf{Ambiguity.} Existing decomposition and decontextualization methods either ignore ambiguity or assume it is always resolvable. An example of the latter is Molecular Facts ____, a decontextualization method focused on cases where the main entity in a sentence could refer to multiple people (which Claimify would classify as referential ambiguity). Molecular Facts not only forces the LLM to resolve such ambiguities, but it also relies on the model’s parametric knowledge – rather than the sentence and its context – which risks introducing factual inaccuracies. Beyond claim extraction, prior works on ambiguity in fact-checking have explored ambiguous questions ____ and investigated why annotators disagree on veracity judgements ____.
