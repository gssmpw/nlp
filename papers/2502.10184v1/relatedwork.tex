\section{Related Work}
There are three main categories of deep PLL algorithms, including identification-based strategies, averaging-based strategies, and data-generation-based strategies. Identification-based strategies try to find the true label from the candidate label set and train a classifier simultaneously~\citep{yao2020deep,lv2020progressive,wang2020semi,zhang20222exploiting,wang2022partial,li2023learning,xu2023progressive,gong2022partial,he2024candidate,tian2024crosel,lv2024what}. Averaging-based strategies consider equal contributions from all candidate labels and use the average modeling output as the final output~\citep{lv2024on}. Data-generation-based strategies model the generative relationship between partial labels and true labels, and derive loss functions with theoretical guarantees~\citep{feng2020provably,feng2020learning,wen2021leveraged,qiao2023decompositional}. In addition, many works use strong representation learning techniques to improve model performance based on these basic strategies, such as contrastive learning and consistency regularization~\citep{wang2022pico,wu2022revisiting,xia2022ambiguity,wu2024distilling}. There are some work that also handles data annotations with multiple labels~\citep{khetan2018learning,peterson2019human,collins2022eliciting,schmarje2022is,gao2022learning,goswami2023aqua} .
