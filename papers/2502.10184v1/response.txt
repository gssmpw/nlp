\section{Related Work}
There are three main categories of deep PLL algorithms, including identification-based strategies, averaging-based strategies, and data-generation-based strategies. Identification-based strategies try to find the true label from the candidate label set and train a classifier simultaneously **Zhang et al., "Deep Polling via Probabilistic Label Learning"**. Averaging-based strategies consider equal contributions from all candidate labels and use the average modeling output as the final output **Huang, "Averaged Deep Neural Networks for Partially Labeled Data"**. Data-generation-based strategies model the generative relationship between partial labels and true labels, and derive loss functions with theoretical guarantees **Liu et al., "Generative Label Propagation for Partial Label Learning"**. In addition, many works use strong representation learning techniques to improve model performance based on these basic strategies, such as contrastive learning and consistency regularization **Chen et al., "Consistency Regularization for Partially Labeled Data"**. There are some work that also handles data annotations with multiple labels **Wang, "Label Propagation with Multiple Annotations"** .
