\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced a new paradigm to contact-rich motion planning by exploiting both generic and robotics-specific sparsity patterns within semidefinite relaxations. Our method efficiently exploits correlative, term, and robotics-specific sparsity, enabling near-global optimization of complex robotic motion planning tasks. Through the Sparse Polynomial Optimization Toolbox (\spot), we automated sparsity detection, significantly reducing computation time while maintaining solution quality. Extensive experiments, including various real-world push-T validations, demonstrated the robustness of our approach. 

\textbf{Limitations and future work.} Despite its efficiency, our approach faces challenges in scalability, suboptimality gaps, and real-time execution. Large-scale problems with many contact modes still pose computational bottlenecks, and automatic sparsity detection can lead to oversized relaxations. Future improvements can explore GPU-accelerated first-order SDP solvers~\cite{kang2024wafr-strom}, hybrid relaxations, and learning-based heuristics to further advance real-time and large-scale applications.
