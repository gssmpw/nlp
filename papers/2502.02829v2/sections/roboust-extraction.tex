\section{Robust Minimizer Extraction}
\label{sec:robust-extraction}

Due to the inherent complexity of contact-rich planning problems, it is not uncommon to encounter two types of semidefinite relaxation "failure cases":  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The sparse Moment-SOS Hierarchy is tight, but multiple optimal solutions exist. In this case, the moment matrices have ranks greater than 1. Although the flatness condition~\cite{henrion2005springer-detecting-global-optimal-extraction-solutions} holds for each moment matrix, it remains unclear how to correctly match the optimal solutions across different cliques.
    \item The sparse Moment-SOS Hierarchy is not tight, \ie, the lower bound produced by the SDP relaxation is strictly smaller than the global optimum of~\eqref{eq:intro:contact-rich}. In this case, the flatness condition fails for each moment matrix.
\end{enumerate}

This observation raises a fundamental question in the sparse Moment-SOS Hierarchy:

\begin{quote}
\textit{Is it possible to extract minimizers when the moment matrices in the sparse Moment-SOS Hierarchy do not have rank 1?}
\end{quote}

To the best of the authors' knowledge, this question remains open, both theoretically and in practice. In \tssos and~\cite{kang2024wafr-strom}, a heuristic method is proposed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each moment matrix $X_i$, take out the submatrix corresponding to the monomials of degree no more than one. 
    % \item 
\end{enumerate}
