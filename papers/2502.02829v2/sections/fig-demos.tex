\captionof{figure}{Contact-rich planning is \emph{sparsity-rich}. (a) Sparsity graph of planar hand manipulation showing two types of sparsity. (b) Sparsity enables high-order and tight, yet small-scale, semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations solvable by off-the-shelf SDP solvers, computing certified near globally optimal trajectories for a suite of simulated problems. (c) Real-world validation on push-T. Planning powered by global optimization succeeds the task even under severe model mismatches and disturbances (from top to bottom: clean T; T tied up by a cable; T on top of a cluttered table; and T inside a ``sliding'' box).
