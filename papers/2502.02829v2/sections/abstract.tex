\begin{abstract}
    We show that contact-rich motion planning is also \emph{sparsity-rich} when viewed as polynomial optimization (POP). We can exploit not only the \emph{correlative} and \emph{term} sparsity patterns that are general to all POPs, but also specialized sparsity patterns from the robot kinematic structure and the separability of contact modes. Such sparsity enables the design of high-order but sparse semidefinite programming (SDPs) relaxations---building upon Lasserre's moment and sums of squares hierarchy---that (\emph{i}) can be solved in seconds by off-the-shelf SDP solvers, and (\emph{ii}) compute near globally optimal solutions to the nonconvex contact-rich planning problems with small certified suboptimality. Through extensive experiments both in simulation (Push Bot, Push Box, Push Box with Obstacles, and Planar Hand) and real world (Push T), we demonstrate the power of using convex SDP relaxations to generate global contact-rich motion plans.
    As a contribution of independent interest, we release the Sparse Polynomial Optimization Toolbox (\spot)---implemented in C++ with interfaces to both Python and Matlab---that automates sparsity exploitation for robotics and beyond.

    % We propose a novel sparsity-rich semidefinite relaxation framework to globally and efficiently solve general contact-rich planning problems modeled by polynomial optimization problems. We extensively demonstrate that contact-rich problems are also sparsity-rich by: (1) exploring automatic correlative sparsity and term sparsity pattern generation explicitly; and (2) exploiting multi-dimensional robotics-specific sparsity patterns, such as kinematic chains and separable contact modes. The resulting small-to-medium scale SDPs can be solved in seconds while maintaining decent tightness. We further develop a novel minimizer extraction routine for correlative sparsity patterns, enabling robust extraction even with multiple global minimizers or untight relaxations. Consequently, a new C++ sparse Moment-SOS Hierarchy conversion package, Sparse Polynomial Optimization Tools (SPOT), is developed. Extensive case studies are conducted (Simulation: Push Bot, Push Box, Push Box with Obstacles, and Planar Hand; Real-world: Push T-Block), demonstrating both the tightness and efficacy of our framework.
