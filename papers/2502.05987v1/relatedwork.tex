\textit{Card-based cryptography} is a research area studying cryptographic protocols that use a deck of physical cards. There are two main lines of research in this area.

\textbf{Secure Multi-Party Computation:} This area involves protocols that can securely compute functions with private input from multiple parties, without revealing the inputs to other parties. Card-based protocols to compute various Boolean functions, including a logical AND function \cite{mizuki09}, a logical XOR function \cite{mizuki09}, a \textit{majority function} \cite{nishida13,toyoda}, and an \textit{equality function} \cite{ruangwises21}, have been developed. Nishida et al. \cite{nishida15} proved that any $n$-variable Boolean function can be computed using $2n+6$ cards. Shinagawa and Nuida \cite{garbled} proved that any Boolean function can be computed using one shuffle. 

\textbf{Zero-Knowledge Proof:} A zero-knowledge proof is an interactive protocol between a prover and a verifier, which allows the prover to show that they know a solution of a specific problem without revealing the solution itself \cite{zkp}. Card-based zero-knowledge proof protocols for a wide range of problems have been developed, including computational problems such as graph isomorphism \cite{graph} and pancake sorting \cite{pancake}, pencil puzzles such as Sudoku \cite{sudoku,tanaka} and Nonogram \cite{nonogram}, and mobile games such as Ball Sort Puzzle \cite{ball}.

Very recently, Shinagawa et al. \cite{oldmaid} developed a card-based player simulation protocol for a card game Old Maid, which can simulate virtual players to play the game with real players. In particular, their protocol can remove pairs of cards having the same number from each virtual player's hand without revealing the rest of its hand. This result created a new possible line of research: simulating virtual players in card games.
