\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
There has been significant research on propagandistic content detection across different modalities and languages. However, most studies have primarily focused on detection, with little attention given to explanations justifying the predicted label. This is largely due to the lack of resources that provide explanations alongside annotated labels. To address this issue, we propose a multilingual (i.e., Arabic and English) explanation-enhanced dataset, the first of its kind. Additionally, we introduce an explanation-enhanced LLM for both label detection and rationale-based explanation generation. Our findings indicate that the model performs comparably while also generating explanations. We will make the dataset and experimental resources publicly available for the research community.\footnote{

% The detection of propagandistic content in text is a fundamental task in mitigating disinformation and manipulative rhetoric. However, binary classification alone is insufficient for improving trust and interpretability in automated systems. Generating reasoning-based explanations alongside detection is crucial for increasing transparency and providing justifications for model decisions. 


% has been done efforts have explored propaganda detection across different modalities, including binary classification, multilabel classification, and the identification of propagandistic techniques at the span level. However, studies on generating reasoning-based explanations alongside detection remain limited. In this study, we propose multilingual (i.e., Arabic and English) reasoning-based explanation datasets, extended from existing resources. This is the \textit{first} study to integrate reasoning-based explanations along with the label. We fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B for both label detection and rationale-based explanation generation. Our findings indicate that model performance improves when trained with explanations. We will make the dataset and experimental resources publicly available for the research community.\footnote{\url{anonymous.com}}

\section{Limitations}
Generating manual explanations is inherently complex. However, providing a rationale alongside the predicted label enhances trust and reliability in automated systems. Given the challenges of manual explanation creation, we relied on GPT-4o1 -- the most capable model at the time of writing -- for generating explanations in this study. To ensure the reliability of these explanations, we conducted a manual evaluation based on four criteria: informativeness, clarity, plausibility, and faithfulness. This evaluation was performed on a small sample of 200 explanations per set. 
The preliminary evaluation scores suggest that we can rely such and use them as gold explanation. For both label prediction and explanation generation, we focused on a binary classification task. However, future work should extend this to multiclass and multilabel settings. Additionally, for fine-tuning, we explored a multilingual model (Llama 3.1 8B), leaving room for further investigations into other models, including language-centric models.

% As a part of ongoing work we plan to conduct manual evaluation on a larger set.

\section*{Ethics and Broader Impact}
We enhanced existing datasets by incorporating explanations. To the best of our knowledge, the dataset does not include any personally identifiable information, eliminating privacy concerns. For the explanations, we provided detailed annotation guidelines. It is important to acknowledge that annotations are inherently subjective, which may introduce biases into the evaluation process. We encourage researchers and users of this dataset to critically assess these factors when developing models or conducting further studies. 
% Models trained on this dataset could serve as valuable tools for fact-checkers, journalists, and social media platforms.
