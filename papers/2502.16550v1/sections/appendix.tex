\section{Annotation Platform}
\label{sec:app_annotation_platform}

We present the screenshot of the interface designed for the evaluation of LLM generated explanation, which consisted
of a paragraph, label, and explanation for the label, annotation guidelines, and four different evaluation metrics including informativeness, clarity, plausibility, and faithfulness. 5-point Likert scale is used for each evaluation metric and the annotator is asked to follow the annotation guideline to select an appropriate Likert scale value for each metric.

\section{Annotation Setup}
\label{sec:app_annotation_setup}
We recruited annotators who are native Arabic speakers and fluent in English, all holding at least a bachelor's degree. Since they were proficient in English, they also worked on English news paragraphs. We provided annotation guidelines and necessary consultation. All annotators had prior experience with similar tasks. A total of six annotators participated in the evaluation task. In accordance with institutional requirements, each signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). For their compensation, we hired a third-party company to manage payments at standard hourly rates based on location.



\section{Prompts}
\label{apndix:prompts}
To generate instructions for the instruction-following dataset, we prompt the LLMs using the following prompt: \textit{We are creating an English instruction-following dataset for an [language] dataset covering the task of propaganda detection with explanation. The user defined the task as follows: Detecting propaganda in a piece of text and explaining why this piece of text is propagandistic. Propaganda can be defined as a form of communication aimed at influencing peopleâ€™s opinions or actions toward a specific goal, using well-defined rhetorical and psychological techniques. For that task, the labels include: ['non-propagandistic', 'propagandistic']. Write 10 very diverse and concise English instructions making sure the labels provided above are part of the instruction. Only return the instructions without additional text.}
