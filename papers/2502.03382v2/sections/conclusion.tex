We introduce \ours, a model for simultaneous speech and text translation. \ours leverages a multistream architecture that casts live translation as simple temperature sampling, thanks to a weakly-supervised method for aligning paired data. \ours is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of translation quality, while demonstrating a much more natural flow and better voice transfer, close to human interpretation. Moreover, \ours is compatible with streaming batched inference, which facilitates large-scale deployment, while the smaller \ours-M runs in real-time on a smartphone.
