We introduce \ours, a decoder-only model for simultaneous speech translation. \ours leverages a multistream language model to synchronously process source and target speech, and jointly produces text and audio tokens to perform speech-to-text and speech-to-speech translation.
We furthermore address the fundamental challenge of \textit{simultaneous} interpretation, which unlike its \textit{consecutive} counterpart---where one waits for the end of the source utterance to start translating--- adapts its flow to accumulate just enough context to produce a correct translation in real-time, chunk by chunk.
To do so, we introduce a weakly-supervised method that leverages the perplexity of an off-the-shelf text translation system to identify optimal delays on a per-word basis and create aligned synthetic data. After supervised training, \ours{} performs adaptive, simultaneous speech translation with vanilla temperature sampling. On a French-English simultaneous speech translation task, \ours demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in translation quality, speaker fidelity and naturalness. Moreover, the simplicity of its inference process makes it compatible with batched translation and even real-time on-device deployment. We provide examples\footnote{\href{https://hf.co/spaces/kyutai/hibiki-samples}{https://hf.co/spaces/kyutai/hibiki-samples}} as well as models and inference code.\footnote{\href{https://github.com/kyutai-labs/hibiki}{https://github.com/kyutai-labs/hibiki}}

% You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most $8$ pages long.
% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.
% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.

    \caption{\textbf{Example of contextual alignments.} We compute the contextual alignment ($a_j^{\text{ctx}}$) for four different samples and plot the associated input timestamps. Some results as the two at the bottom present extreme spikes meaning output words referring to input words very far in the future. These spikes are considered as anomalies and are smoothed out as explained in Section \ref{sec:audio-domain-align}.}
