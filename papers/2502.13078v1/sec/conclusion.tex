We present a unified framework to solve multiple low-level 4D vision perception tasks, both dense and sparse.
We achieve this by adopting a strong pre-trained video masked auto-encoder and design lightweight task heads to harness its representation power.
Our simple yet versatile designs for task heads allows for effortless and generalizable adaptation to multiple 4D vision perception tasks.
