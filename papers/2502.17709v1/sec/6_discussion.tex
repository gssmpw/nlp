Our multimodal data augmentation method is a plug-and-play method that can be applied to any future VLM. Also the T2I generation can be replaced by any future T2I model, thus the effectiveness of our method automatically improves along with the SOTA T2I model, making it future-proof.



Our main method, \textbf{Co}ntrastive Visual \textbf{D}ata \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{CoDA}), is simple and easy to apply to LMMs in a variety of scenarios. Several components in the pipeline utilize existing off-the-shelf model components that can be easily swapped out for superior versions of similar models as research in their respective field progresses. Therefore, we expect the efficiency and effectiveness of \textbf{CoDA} to dramatically scale along with the advancement of relevant models.
