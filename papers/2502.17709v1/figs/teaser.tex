   \caption{ \textbf{CoDA} uses diffusion-generated synthetic data to help LMMs recognize novel and confusing concepts in the wild. The ``Clouded Tiger Cat (L. pardinoides)'' is a new animal species first described in April 2024, while "Resupply Base" is an example of a confusing concept for LMMs. Based on model failures (collected from GPT4o-2024-08-06 and LLaVA-NeXT 34B), \textbf{CoDA} extracts contrastive visual and textual features to generate synthetic image data for model updating.}
