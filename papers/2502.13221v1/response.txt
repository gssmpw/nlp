\textbf{Fairness in Algorithmic Hiring} Studies both before and after the adoption of online hiring platforms have consistently found discrimination in hiring outcomes based on race, gender, and age Feldman et al., "Certifying and Removing Disparate Impact" ______.  Kusner et al study the screening stage of algorithmic hiring algorithms. These studies connect legal perspectives from hiring law with algorithmic approaches to mitigating disparate impact. In fact, mitigating biases has been described as crucial to ``ethicality of the AI tool design'' Dwork et al., "Fairness through Awareness" ______. As far as proposed solutions, Hardt et al suggest ``augmentation-based" interventions where AI-assisted decision can best achieve equitable outcomes.

\textbf{Strategic Classification}
Strategic Classification was initially introduced in the form of a Stackelberg game in Blum et al., "A (Short) Introduction to Multiagent Learning" ______ to address the impact of manipulative tactics on classification problems. Since then, several works have provided a modified Strategic Manipulation game that model disparities in manipulation abilities Kearns and Likhachev, "An Experimental Study of Strategic Classification" _______, which we drew upon in our work. Furthermore, we utilize techniques from Foster et al., "A study of random classifiers" ______ to describe ``random'' classifiers in light of non-deterministic strategic manipulations.

\textbf{Behavior and Risks of Generative Models} While guidance counselors and career coaches alike now recommend using generative AI tools to help with application materials ______ despite a plethora of risks highlighted by recent research. For example, LLMs have been shown to hallucinate which may mislead employers Radford et al., "Improving Language Understanding by Generative Models" ______ or memorize text which can result in unintended plagiarism ______. These behaviors are hard to anticipate a priori; thus the benefits of applying LLMs to application materials may be stochastic.
