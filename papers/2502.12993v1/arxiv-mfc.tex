\begin{abstract}
Finding a minimum spanning tree (MST) for $n$ points 
in an arbitrary metric space is a fundamental primitive for hierarchical clustering and many other ML tasks, but this takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time to even approximate.
We introduce a framework for metric MSTs that first (1) finds a forest of disconnected components using practical heuristics, and then (2) finds a small weight set of edges to connect disjoint components of the forest into a spanning tree. 
We prove that optimally solving the second step still takes $\Omega(n^2)$ time, but we provide a subquadratic 2.62-approximation algorithm. In the spirit of learning-augmented algorithms, we then show that if the forest found in step (1) overlaps with an optimal MST, we can approximate the original MST problem in subquadratic time, where the approximation factor depends on a measure of overlap. In practice, we find nearly optimal spanning trees for a wide range of metrics, while being orders of magnitude faster than exact algorithms.

\section{Conclusions and Discussion}
We have presented a new framework for finding spanning trees in arbitrary metric spaces, which is highly scalable and grounded in rigorous approximation guarantees. 
This framework is based on completing an initial forest, which can be obtained efficiently using  practical heuristics. This paper focuses on serial implementations and theoretical guarantees, as our framework already provides many advantages in this setting. At the same time, our work is strongly motivated by massive-scale clustering applications that require high-performance computing capabilities, and the algorithm we developed is highly parallelizable. A natural direction for further research is to develop parallel versions of our algorithm that can be run on a much larger scale. There are also many remaining questions in the serial setting. One direction is to try to improve on the $(\sqrt{5} + 3)/2$-approximation guarantee while still using subquadratic time, or obtain an approximation with better dependence on the $\gamma$-overlap parameter. Another direction is to prove lower bounds for the best possible approximation guarantees for subquadratic algorithms. There are also many opportunities to explore more efficient and practical methods for obtaining the initial forest that serves as the input to MFC.
