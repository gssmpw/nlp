\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced the Confidence-Driven LLM Router, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty estimation to optimize LLM deployment in edge-cloud environments. 
%
By using semantic entropy as a performance indicator, our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as the subjectivity of human preference data and the rigidity of accuracy-based metrics. 
%
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art routing systems, achieving a better trade-off between response quality and efficiency. Future work will explore multi-modal query integration and further latency reduction in distributed systems.
