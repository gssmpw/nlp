\section{Limitations}
We have two major limitations which we aim to address in future works. 

First, our evaluation is limited to text-based queries, and we do not extend our analysis to multi-modal routing scenarios. In real-world applications, queries may include image-text pairs or other modalities, especially in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Future work should investigate how uncertainty estimation-based routing generalizes to multi-modal inputs and whether SE remains an effective performance indicator in VLM settings.

Second, we do not analyze the computational overhead of different routing architectures. Our study primarily evaluates routing effectiveness, but in practice, the choice of router architecture (e.g., SW, MF, kNN, and MLP) can significantly impact system efficiency. Future work should explore the trade-offs between neural network-based routers and statistical methods, assessing their cost, scalability, and real-time deployment feasibility in edge-cloud environments.
