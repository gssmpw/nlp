Firstly, Table~\ref{tab:t1t2_soft_hard} provides the results in four domain shift setups which we excluded from the benchmark. Differences in CT reconstruction kernels were excluded due to relative simplicity (Baseline is only marginally worse than the Oracle, and extensive augmentations almost closes this gap). We also excluded the domain shift between T1 and T2 MRI sequences, because, we were not able to find enough clinical justification for the inclusion.

Finally, example predictions for different DA methods are provided in Figure~\ref{fig:predicts}.
