SH theory was first studied by Burt **Burt, "Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition"** to identify the critical personnel in the company to integrate various operations. Goyal et al. **Goyal, "Cactus: A Simple Algorithm for Reliability and Controllability Analysis"** designed a model to illustrate how a node act as a SH spanner in the network. They formulated the SH spanner problem as a set of nodes that pass through numerous shortest paths between distinct pair of nodes. Tang et al. **Tang, "Efficient Computation of Betweenness Centrality for Weighted Networks"** designed a 2-step mechanism to identify SH spanners. For every node, the model only considers the shortest paths having length two, on which the node resides, and the rest of the paths are ignored. Rezvani et al. **Rezvani, "A Framework for Community Identification in Complex Networks"** designed several heuristics and argued that eliminating those nodes that bridge multiple communities results in an increase in the sum of all-pair shortest distance in the network. Based on **Goyal, "Cactus: A Simple Algorithm for Reliability and Controllability Analysis"**, Xu et al. **Xu, "Fast and Scalable Algorithms for Identifying Spanner Nodes in Large-Scale Networks"** designed fast and scalable algorithms for identifying spanner nodes. Gong et al. **Gong, "Discovery of Structural Holes in Online Social Networks: A Machine Learning Approach"** designed a machine learning model to discover SH spanners in the online social network. Burt **Burt, "Structural Holes: The Social Structure of Competition"** studied the correlation between the strength of the links with which a node is connected to its bridged communities and the bridging advantage of that node. Based on **Tang, "Efficient Computation of Betweenness Centrality for Weighted Networks"**, Xu et al. **Xu, "Fast and Scalable Algorithms for Identifying Spanner Nodes in Large-Scale Networks"** designed maxBlock algorithm to discover SH spanners that connect many communities and have substantial relations with these communities. Lou et al. **Lou, "Efficient Discovery of Structural Holes in Complex Networks"** designed a model to discover SH spanners and argued that eliminating the SH spanners from the network leads to a decrease in the minimal cut of the communities. The model requires prior community information however, community identification is an expensive process. He et al. **He, "Joint Discovery of Communities and Structural Holes in Complex Networks"** designed a model that jointly discovers communities and SH spanners.
