% propose a ground-to-satellite cooperative federated learning (FL) methodology to facilitate machine learning service management over remote regions. Our methodology orchestrates satellite constellations to provide the following key functions during FL: (i) processing data offloaded from ground devices, (ii) aggregating models within device clusters, and (iii) relaying models/data to other satellites via inter-satellite links (ISLs). Due to the limited coverage time of each satellite over a particular remote area, we facilitate satellite transmission of trained models and acquired data to neighboring satellites via ISL, so that the incoming satellite can continue conducting FL for the region.

In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a new communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among different orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model aggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and shells.

% for battery-powered passive devices in the satellite Internet of Things (IoT), the continuous update and transmission of the local model result in heightened energy consumption on the device side. To address this challenge, an FL framework with partial device participating is proposed. In this framework, the on-board controller strategically selects a subset of devices to upload local model parameters, effectively mitigating the overall energy consumption on the device side. Constrained by transmission power and transmission delay, a resource allocation problem is formulated. This problem jointly optimizes the uploading strategy and transmission power, aiming to minimize the utility function that combines the global model loss and energy consumption over multiple rounds of FL.

% FL may need to address several open challenges, e.g., the limited service time of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the straggler issue in synchronous FL, and time-efficient uploading and aggregation for massive devices. In this work, we exploit the synergy of LEO and FL for future integrated 6G-satellite systems by taking advantage of ubiquitous wireless access provided by LEO and appealing characteristics of collaborative training and data privacy preservation in FL. The studied LEO-FL framework may need to improve multi-metric performance in practice. Different from most FL works, we simultaneously improve the communication-training efficiency and local training accuracy from a multi-objective optimization (MOO) perspective. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition and meta-deep reinforcement learning based MOO algorithm for FL (DMMA-FL), aiming at adapting to the dynamic satellite-terrestrial environments, achieving efficient uploading and aggregation, and approaching Pareto optimal sets.
