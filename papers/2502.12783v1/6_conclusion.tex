\section{Conclusion}~\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a hierarchical clustered FL framework \algname that optimizes both processing time and energy efficiency for satellite networks. To address the dynamic topology caused by high-speed LEO satellite mobility and the unstable ground-to-satellite communication links, we introduce a satellite-clustered PS selection algorithm that optimizes network partitioning and strategically selects in-orbit PS to reduce transmission latency, and a meta-learning-driven satellite re-clustering algorithm that dynamically adapts cluster configurations during aggregation to accelerate global model convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that \algname achieves significant reductions in the processing time and energy consumption compared to the comparative FL-based methods while ensuring the accuracy of the model. Our future work aims to enhance data integrity and confidentiality during collaborative learning by integrating advanced privacy-preserving mechanisms such as differential privacy to further solidify \algnameâ€™s applicability in security-critical applications.







%In this paper, we propose a hierarchical clustered federated learning framework \algname for satellite networks. This framework aims at minimizing FL task completion time and energy cost while maintaining model accuracy. To address the challenge posed by the high-speed movement of LEO satellites that prevents continuous communication with ground PS, we design a satellite-clustered parameter server selection algorithm to partition the satellite network and select a suitable PS  to accelerate the FL process.And use the satellite re-clustering algorithm during satellite aggregation to accelerate the convergence of the model. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed \algname, we conducted extensive experiments simulating the LEO satellite network using real-world data. The obtained results confirm that, compared to the existing FL frameworks, \algname can significantly reduce task processing time and energy cost while ensuring the accuracy of the model. Our future work aims to integrate advanced privacy protection technologies to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data during the learning process.
