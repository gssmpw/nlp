\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{future works}
In this paper, we propose the Combinatorial Optimization Perspective based Framework  (COPF) for multi-behavior recommendation. To avoid incorrect modeling of user behavior patterns due to limited perspectives, we propose the Combinatorial Optimization Graph Convolutional Network (COGCN), which treats multi-behavior fusion as a combinatorial optimization problem. COGCN imposes different constraints at various stages of each behavior to restrict the solution space, thereby effectively facilitating the multi-behavior fusion process. To better coordinate the correlations between tasks in MTL methods, we design the Distribution Fitting Expert Network (DFME), which improves both forward and backward propagation. By reducing the distribution differences in features and labels between tasks, DFME alleviates negative information transfer caused by uncoordinated task relationships. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets to verify the superiority of our proposed COPF. Further analysis demonstrates the rationality and effectiveness of the designed COGCN and DFME modules.
