\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced TorchResist, an open-source, differentiable photoresist simulator designed to address the limitations of existing resist modeling approaches in lithography simulation. By leveraging analytical formulations and modern differentiable programming techniques, TorchResist achieves high accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Our experimental results on the LithoBench dataset demonstrate that TorchResist significantly reduces pixel difference and edge placement errors, while also providing the capability for 3D depth simulation. Furthermore, the integration of TorchResist with open-source lithography models, such as FUILT and ICCAD13, highlights its versatility and potential for broader applications in semiconductor manufacturing. As an open-source tool, TorchResist is expected to facilitate further research and development in computational lithography, enabling more robust and efficient resist modeling for advanced semiconductor nodes.
