and distributed nodes, creating hierarchical schemes where the data fusion process is executed at different levels in the hierarchy. Implementing a decentralised data fusion system can be challenging due to the significant computation and communication requirements. However, it is essential to note that there is no single best architecture existence yet known  [1].

According to ____, the methods for data fusion are classified into three basic categories which are:
\begin{itemize}  
    \item\textbf{Data Association} \\Data association is a complex task that aims to establish the set of observations/measurements generated by the same target over time. It involves intricate methods such as the K-NN, Probabilistic Data Association (PDA), Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA), and Multiple Hypothesis Test (MHT).    
    \item\textbf{State Estimation} \\State estimation is a precise process that considers the state of a target under movement (i.e. position), given the observation or measurement. It relies on accurate methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Kalman Filter, Distributed Filter, and covariance consistency methods. 
    \item\textbf{Decision Fusion} \\Decision fusion is crucial in making high-level inferences about an event and its activities. It does so by analyzing the detected targets provided by many sources, highlighting their importance.
    \end{itemize}
%Data Imperfection%
Understanding data imperfection is crucial as it forms the basis of all data fusion methods  [2]. Sensor data, often imprecise, uncertain, ambiguous, vague, and incomplete, presents a significant challenge. Although we can improve data quality by modeling its imperfection and using other available information and powerful mathematical tools, the severity of data imperfection can significantly affect fusion quality if data fusion fails to extract precise and valuable data (____)  [3].

%Data Inconsistency%
Some data uncertainties are caused by inherent noise in measurement, sensors, and environments. These noises lead to data outliers or disorder, collectively called data inconsistency.  Data inconsistency introduces a terrible effect on data fusion if the fusion model cannot distinguish the techniques necessary to overcome this problem by eliminating the influence it creates.

Data-related challenges often appear in a system that applies belief functions or Dempster-Shafer theory ____ when some problems that should be treated independently are erroneously integrated [4].

%Data Correlation%
 Data captured from different sensors with different frames must undergo a crucial step before fusion alignment into a standard frame. This process, known as data alignment, is of utmost importance in data fusion. If the data fusion algorithm fails to address this, the lack of alignment or correlation can lead to over/under confidence or biased estimation, underscoring the necessity of this step (____)  [5].

%Data Heterogeneity%
Data captured by different sensors could have different structures. The data fusion method should be able to integrate the different types to describe the environment better.

Another challenge is that of Fusion Location. To determine the fusion location, we must consider a trade-off between fusion cost and quality. This is a problem with respect to wireless sensors. When data are generated from a central node, the expense is bandwidth and time, but if data are from a local node, the cost is data accuracy.

In addition, the complexity of data fusion is caused by timeliness, where the significance of a data point might be limited to a limited period, especially for a time-varying system. The fusion node must distinguish the correct order of the data and its validation.
