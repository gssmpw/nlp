\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we studied the effectiveness of automatic input rewriting with LLMs in improving the quality of machine translation outputs. We explored a range of rewriting strategies with varying levels of MT-awareness: \textbf{1)} MT-Agnostic, \textbf{2)} Task-Aware (knowledge of the end-task), and \textbf{3)} Translatability-Aware rewrites (knowledge of translatability as measured with QE tools).

Our findings show that simpler texts are more translatable. However, MT-Agnostic rewrites do not uniformly help translation quality (\S \ref{simplification best}), which motivates us to explore more selective strategies. Selecting inputs based on translatability scores during inference time further boosts translation quality (\S \ref{input selection}), addressing the Pareto optimization challenge by striking a balance between translatability and meaning preservation (\S \ref{pareto optimality}). Analysis shows that simplifying inputs also results in more readable translation outputs (\S \ref{readability}), and that input rewriting complements post-editing strategies (\S \ref{res:post-editing}). Human evaluation complements our automatic metric by showing that both simplified rewrites and their corresponding MT largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT (\S \ref{human evaluation}).

More broadly, this work suggests that LLM-assisted input rewriting is a promising direction for improving translations. The approaches introduced here represent a first step in this direction, and future work is needed to discover optimal rewriting strategies for a broader range of models. Furthermore, in line with growing research on LLM-based writing assistants \citep{Lee_2024}, these results encourage future work on designing richer interactive approaches to translation with LLMs.

% \mc{TODO for me: Mention as future work pre-editing as a step that can be vetted by users who do not understand the target language and lack mechanisms to asess translation (liebling,sam), or who are wwiting text in support of translation (yvon)}
