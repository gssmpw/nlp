    \caption{Pareto frontier per language pair. For each subplot, the $x$-axis is the translatability and $y$-axis is the meaning preservation scores. Pareto frontier (\textbf{dashed} line) visualizes the optimal solutions that take into account the trade-off between the two metrics. Each shape represents different rewriting methods and each color represent specific prompt or model variation.}
