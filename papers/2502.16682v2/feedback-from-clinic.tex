- [x]  Description of the “translatability” to be more clear → important throughout the paper (vague definition → better to bisect and then analyze factors for increased translatability)
- [x]  Starting point of the motivation is not clear
    - users are bilingual → users monolingual → what is the exact situation (example of situation) where bilinguals enhance the MT but monolinguals can not
    - still not very clear about the motivation of the project
- [x]  What is the use case that is being addressed?
- [x]  Why separating the measures of translatability and meaning preservation
    - [x]  main results with the evaluation metric that accounts both dimensions
    - [x]  for detailed analysis, do trade-off plotting between 2 dimensions
- [x]  **Include example analysis** → what accounts for increased translatability?
- [x]  **Takeaway of the main table?**
    - What properties of the source data accounts for different stylistic rewrites improvement
- [x]  Not sure to introduce preference learning? ⇒ seem to be disjoint from the rest of the work done
- [x]  Study that is done vs. motivation not very clear
- [x]  Current form has split personality → analysis + modeling part?
    - Analysis is little bit shallow as an analysis paper
    - modeling part not yet
