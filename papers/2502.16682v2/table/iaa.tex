\caption{\textbf{IAA per example}, \textbf{IAA per rewrite group} (C: Stylistic (\textsc{CoEdIT} Understand), R: Re-ranking, S: SFT), and \textbf{IAA per dimension} (F: Fluency, U: Understandable, D: Detailed, M: Meaning preservation). Number of annotations observed for each is 80, 20, 20, respectively. Here, we denote rewrite MT as ``\textit{Win}'', `Both / Hard to tell' option as ``\textit{Tie}'', and original MT as ``\textit{Lose}''. We show the majority vote label and percentage, rounded up to 1 decimal, in brackets. At the bottom of the table, we show the average majority vote label and count for each column.}
