\textbf{Category}    & \textbf{Explanation}    & \textbf{Example Tasks}    & \textbf{Codes}        \\ \toprule
Physical Environment Understanding         & \bma{} enhances spatial awareness in both indoor and outdoor settings through detailed and structured visual information. Challenges include AI hallucinations that require verification through user's existing spatial knowledge or human assistance, and the need for users to complement the tool with their auditory perception for accurate object location. & Describe scenes like theaters, room layouts, neighborhood, and holiday decorations; Locate dropped objects like earbuds                                         & Environmental familiarity, Object location identification, Concerns in AI hallucinations, Human verification needs, Multi-modal perception integration              \\ \hline
Subjective Interpretations and Suggestions & \bma{} provides subjective interpretations in animal interaction and fashion contexts, such as animals' emotional states and fashion suggestion. Challenges includes lack of accuracy or context sensitivity, leading users to rely on personal judgment or sighted assistance for validation.                                                                     & Human-animal interactions like taking picuters of birds, dogs, horses; Fashion help like describing or matching colors and patterns of outfits, checking makeup & Subjective interpretation capability, Untrust in subjective interpretations, Agency in personal judgment                                                          \\ \hline
Identity Recognition                       & \bma{} enhances the perception of people by conveying identity attributes like age, gender, and ethnicity in image descriptions. Challenges in accuracy underscore the need for sensitivity and contextual awareness in identity depiction.                                                                                                                        & Human social interactions like describing online photos, checking photos before posting online                                                                  & Identity attribute recognition, User concerns in identity recognition                                                                                               \\ \hline
Goal Understanding Dialogue       & \bma's ``ask more'' function enables users to inquire specific information, supporting independent information gathering. However, \bma{} often requires explicit user guidance to focus on relevant details, as it struggles to infer user intentions from initial queries.                                                                         & Cooking and dining like checking eggshells; Helping with household appliances like rotating dials on washers and thermostats                                    & Query refinement capability, Intention inference limitations, User prompting for goal understanding                                                                    \\ \hline
Goal Achievement Support                   & \bma{} understands users' goals but faces challenges in proactively suggesting further actions to align with the goals, requiring human assistance to maintain focus and achieve goals.                                                                                                                                                                            & Identifying central puzzle piece, Adjusting camera angle                                                                                                        & Proactive guidance limitations, Human assistance for continuous and actionable guidance                                                                             \\ \hline
Real-time Navigation Assistance            & \bma{} assists with localization and orientation tasks through static image interpretations, but shows limitations in providing real-time and comprehensive navigational feedback. Users often need to complement its capabilities with human assistance and O\&M skills for safe navigation.                                                                      & Navigating users in airports like reading signage and gate numbers; Finding restaurants                                                                         & Localization and orientation capability, Static image limitations, Navigational risks, Human assistance for real-time interactions, Essential role of O\&M skills  \\ \bottomrule
