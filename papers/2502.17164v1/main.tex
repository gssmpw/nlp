\begin{abstract}
	The atomistic-to-continuum (a/c) coupling methods, also known as the quasicontinuum (QC) methods,  are a important class of concurrent multisacle methods for modeling and simulating materials with defects.  The a/c methods aim to balance the accuracy and efficiency by coupling a molecular mechanics model (also termed as the atomistic model) in the vicinity of localized defects with the Cauchy-Born approximation of the atomistic model in the elastic far field. However, since both the molecular mechanics model and its Cauchy-Born approximation are usually a nonlinear, it potentially leads to a high computational cost for large-scale simulations. In this work, we propose an advancement of the classic quasinonlocal (QNL) a/c coupling method by incorporating a linearized Cauchy-Born model to reduce the computational cost. We present a rigorous {\it a priori} error analysis for this QNL method with linear elasticity enhancement (QNLL method), and show both analytically and numerically that it achieves the same convergence behavior as the classic (nonlinear) QNL method by proper determination of certain parameters relating to domain decomposition and finite element discretization. More importantly, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the QNLL method perform an substantial improvement of the computational efficiency in term of CPU times.
	
	%你讨论的主题不是interface，所以在摘要里没必要把interface和ghost force提出来。The Quasinonlocal (QNL) method, a widely used approach for simulating defect configurations, eliminates the “ghost force” at the interface by reconstructing the site energy.

	%However, its nonlinearity leads to high computational costs, making it less efficient for large-scale simulations. 
	%To address this, in this work we propose incorporating the linear elasticity model to improve the computational efficiency of the QNL method. Specifically, we introduce a coupling energy formulation that combines the nonlinear QNL method with the linearized Cauchy-Born model, referred to as the QNLL method.
