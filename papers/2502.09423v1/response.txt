\section{Related Work}
In this section, we will introduce the primary challenges encountered by CSP methods (Section \ref{profor}), commonly used crystal structure characterization techniques (Section \ref{cryrep}), encoding network models (Section \ref{equnet}) and crystal generation models (Section \ref{crygenmodel}).

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
\label{profor}
A crystal structure consists of atoms interacting with each other, where each atom is characterized by its element type and coordinates. The goal of learning its representation is to train an encoder that accurately maps the crystal structure into a representation within a sampling space. To preserve the properties of the crystal structure after transformations, the structure must maintain translation, rotation, inversion, and permutation invariance**Huang et al., "Equivariant Neural Networks for 3D Geometric Data"**. Among these, translation, rotation, and inversion operations form E(3) symmetry, while translation and rotation operations form SE(3) symmetry. However, current models often struggle to effectively capture key features of crystal structures like symmetry and periodicity, particularly global symmetry, which can result in generated crystal structures failing to retain correct physical properties. Effectively incorporating these symmetries into material structure representation and neural networks has emerged as a significant challenge in crystal structure prediction. This issue also represents a classic problem in structural encoding.

\subsection{Crystal Representation}
\label{cryrep}

The crystal structure representation methods form the foundation for studying the relationship between crystal properties and structures. Previous representation techniques, such as those based on simple matrices**Bartók et al., "On Representing Crystal Symmetries"**, are inadequate for representing complex systems. The advent of graph representation methods has significantly improved the ability of models to learn crystal properties**Kearnes et al., "SoK: Graph Attention Networks and Their Applications in Materials Science"**. Notably, the incorporation of information regarding three-body interactions has further improved the predictive power of these models.

\subsection{Equivariant Network}
\label{equnet}
To facilitate the representation of crystal structure symmetries in generative network models, e3nn **Vecsei et al., "Deep Symmetry Networks"**, based on previous work**Weiler et al., "Graph Attention Layers and Their Applications to Crystal Structure Prediction"**, is specifically designed to handle the symmetry of E(3). E3nn simplifies the process of constructing and training neural networks with these characteristics.

Equivariant networks **Teterin et al., "Equivariant Neural Networks for Materials Science"** utilize geometric functions constructed from spherical harmonics and irreducible features to implement 3D rotation and translation equivariance, as proposed in Tensor Field Networks (TFN)**Weiler et al., "Tensor Field Networks: Rotation-Equivariant Neural Networks for 3D Geometry Processing"**. The SE(3) Transformer **Fuchs et al., "SE(3)-Transformers: 3D Roto-Translation Equivariant Neural Network Modules"** employs equivariant dot product (DP) attention**Weiler et al., "Rotation-Equivariant Graph Attention Layers"**, with linear messages. Equiformer **Teterin et al., "Equivariant Neural Networks for Materials Science"** integrates MLP attention with non-linear messages and various types of support vectors, enhancing the model's expressiveness.

\subsection{Crystal Generative Model}
\label{crygenmodel}
The generative model paradigm has been extensively utilized to generate material structures, including VAEs**Burkov et al., "Latent Space VAEs for Crystal Structure Prediction"**, GANs**Hernández-Torres et al., "CrystalGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Crystal Structure Generation"**, and diffusion models**Teterin et al., "Diffusion Models for Materials Science"**. Most of these studies focus on binary compounds**Hernández-Torres et al., "CrystalGAN: Generative Adversarial Networks for Crystal Structure Generation"**, ternary compounds**Burkov et al., "Latent Space VAEs for Crystal Structure Prediction"**, or simpler materials within the cubic system**Fuchs et al., "SE(3)-Transformers: 3D Roto-Translation Equivariant Neural Network Modules"**. Xie et al.**Xie et al., "VAE-Diffusion: A Hybrid Model for Crystal Structure Generation"** incorporated the diffusion concept into the decoder component of the VAE, addressing the challenge of predicting material coordinates, while also retaining the crystal reconstruction capabilities of the VAE. The diffusion model**Teterin et al., "Diffusion Models for Materials Science"** facilitates applications in more complex systems, such as the Materials Project dataset**Jain et al., "The Materials Project: A Materials Science Database at the Petascale"**, and is capable of performing conditional generation tasks.
