Object detection in computer vision is primarily categorized into one-stage and two-stage techniques. Two-stage methods, exemplified by R-CNN____ and Faster R-CNN____, generate candidate bounding boxes and subsequently classify and refine them, achieving high accuracy at the expense of speed. Enhancements such as the integration of adversarial networks have been introduced to bolster robustness and expedite detection. In contrast, the main one-stage object detection algorithms include the YOLO family, which consists of YOLO ____ that overcomes the shortcomings of two-stage detection networks. YOLOv2 ____ introduces batch normalization layers after each convolution and eliminates the use of dropout. YOLOv3 ____ marked a significant improvement, characterized by the introduction of the residual module Darknet-53 and FPN. There have been studies that added many techniques based on YOLOv3, such as YOLOv4 ____, YOLOv5 ____, YOLOv6 ____, and YOLOv7 ____. The related code for YOLOv8 can be found on GitHub. SSD ____ and RetinaNet ____ are also part of this category. YOLO divides the entire image into a grid, with each cell predicting bounding boxes and classification confidence. Some studies have introduced modifications to YOLOv8 to achieve high-precision detection performance ____

In computer vision, attention mechanisms such as channel attention, spatial attention, and combined channel-spatial attention dynamically adjust the weights of input features to focus on important areas, similar to the human visual system. Examples include CBAM____ and EMA for combined channel-spatial attention. The residual attention network____, an early implementation, generates a three-dimensional attention map but faces challenges with high computational cost and limited receptive fields. To improve efficiency, techniques like global average pooling and decoupling methods have been introduced. Additionally, the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) constructs a hierarchical feature pyramid to represent objects of various sizes, enhancing multi-scale target detection by merging features from different network levels, thereby improving detection accuracy and capturing fine details. In underwater object detection, upsampling is crucial for reorganizing features to achieve higher detection performance. Methods like linear interpolation and deep learning-based upsampling, such as Meta-Upscale____ and CARAFE. While interpolation methods can increase image resolution, they may introduce noise and increase computational complexity. In contrast, deep learning-based methods like CARAFE offer a large receptive field and accurate detail restoration without significantly increasing computational complexity, making them effective for balancing detection performance improvement in the field of computer vision.
