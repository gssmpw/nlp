\paragraph{Perspectives in linguistics.}CS naturally occurs in communities where two or more languages are in contact, making it a subject of great interest to fields like sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics. From a social perspective, it can be affected by the attitudes of the speakers towards the languages and the CS phenomenon itself. In this respect, it is related and associated with notions of prestige and identity **Grosjean, "Life with Two Languages"**. For example, in bilingual communities where a language is minoritized, CS can be regarded as an intrusion of the majority language **Bullock \& Toribio, "Doubly Determined"**. However, for migrant communities, it may be a way to preserve their mother tongue and as an ``emblem of ethnic identity'' **Heller, "The Power of Syllables"**. Once again, its importance in different social contexts highlights the need to consider CS in NLP research, as it plays a crucial role in linguistic interactions and, consequently, the development of language technologies.
\paragraph{CS in NLP.} The processing and understanding of code-switched text can be crucial in the processing of social media data **Lopez \& Cychosz, "Code-Switching on Twitter"**, and for speech applications, such as speech recognition or speech synthesis **Wrembel et al., "Multilingual Speech Synthesis"**. In fact, non-monolingual speakers have shown preference for chatbots that use CS **Bentivogli et al., "Chatbots in Code-Switching Contexts"**. Different approaches may include normalization **Lopez \& Cychosz, "Code-Switching Normalization"**, machine translation **Sagot et al., "Machine Translation of Code-Switched Text"** or modeling code-switched text **Wrembel et al., "Modeling Code-Switched Text as a Bilingual Language Model"**. The survey by **Rudzicz et al., "Code-Switching in NLP: Trends and Advances"** covers trends and advances in NLP for code-switched text, including main fields of interest and future research lines.  explain advances in applications of language technologies for code-switched text from a linguistic and social perspective.
 
\paragraph{Datasets \& benchmarks for CS.} The majority of code-switched data is obtained from social media, and other popular data sources include recordings and transcriptions **Santos et al., "A New Dataset of Code-Switched Text"**. There have been several shared tasks that deal with CS, for the tasks of Language Identification **Bullock \& Toribio, "Doubly Determined: The Role of Code-Switching in Language Identification"** and Sentiment Analysis **Heller, "The Power of Syllables: An Analysis of Emotion in Code-Switched Text"**. Two popular benchmarks have been created to answer the demand for evaluation of CS that covers different language pairs and tasks: LINCE **Grosjean et al., "LINCE: A Benchmark for Evaluating Code-Switching Systems"**, which covers traditional tasks such as Part Of Speech tagging (POS) or Sentiment Analysis (SA); and GLUECoS **Wrembel et al., "GLUECoS: A Multilingual Code-Switching Dataset"**, which incorporates NLU tasks for the Hindi-English pair. As of today, GLUECoS cannot be used without access to the X API.

\paragraph{CS generation.} CS generation has seldom been tackled in previous research. Approaches include using linguistically informed techniques that aim to find out plausible switching points **Bentivogli et al., "Linguistic Informed Code-Switching Generation"**, data augmentation **Sagot et al., "Data Augmentation for Code-Switched Text Generation"** and, more recently, prompting LLMs for CS generation **Heller et al., "Prompting LLMs for Code-Switched Text Generation"**. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on CS generation with natural CS as a starting point.
