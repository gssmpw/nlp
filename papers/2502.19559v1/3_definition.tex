\section{Problem Drift} \label{sec:definition}

We introduce the concept of \textbf{problem drift} in multi-agent debates, defined as the systematic decay in turn-based task performance as agents gradually diverge from the initial task. To quantify this effect, we propose the metric \metric, which measures the strength of the performance decay over a predetermined number of consecutive turns.

\paragraph{\textbf{\metric.}}
We describe how the quality of a solution differs in one turn from the previous turn.
Let $(x, y)$ be a pair of input and gold label for a task example in a dataset to be solved. 
A multi-agent system discusses for $N$ rounds.
At the end of each round $r \in (1, ..., N)$, the agents provide an answer $\hat{y}^{(r)}$ where they try to solve $x$. 
Let $P(\hat{y}^{(r)}, y) \in [0,1]$ be a downstream performance metric that compares the ground-truth solution to the solution produced by the multi-agent debate, where $1$ corresponds to the solution and $0$ corresponds to a wrong solution. Values between $0$ and $1$ can provide scores for partial solutions, although not strictly necessary.
We define \textit{problem focus}, further called $FOCUS_r$, as:
\vspace*{2mm}
\begin{equation} \label{def:focus}
\small
FOCUS_r = P(\hat{y}^{(r)}, y) - P(\hat{y}^{(r-1)}, y) \in [-1,1]
\end{equation}

If $FOCUS_r < 0$, the solution's quality degrades during round $r$. If $FOCUS_r > 0$, the solution improves.

\paragraph{\textbf{Problem Drift.}}
We define that an ongoing discussion has \textit{problem drift} if the current solution obtains lower performance than the solution of a previous debate round over multiple rounds.
Let $M$ be the number of consecutive discussion rounds for one task example.
A conversation for the task example has problem drift from round $1$ to $M$ of strength $\theta \in [0,1]$ if:
\begin{equation} \label{def:drift}
\small
\sum_{r=1}^{M} FOCUS_r = -\theta
\end{equation}

\paragraph{\textbf{Recovery.}}
We say an example recovered from problem drift when the discussion gets back to or improves upon the performance before the problem drift occurred.
We define a discussion as recovered from problem drift if $\exists N,M \text{ where } N > M \text{ s.t.}$:




\begin{equation} \label{def:recovery}
    \small
    \sum_{r=1}^{N} FOCUS_r >= 0 \quad \wedge \quad \sum_{r=1}^{M} FOCUS_r < 0
\end{equation}
