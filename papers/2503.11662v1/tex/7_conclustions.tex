\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We propose a methodology for forecasting circuit block performance and power from natural languages. It leverages existing LLM-based Verilog generation techniques and Verilog-based ML prediction technique to produce forecasts with approximately $2\%$ error compared to post-layout analysis. The LLM-based Verilog generation technique here is customized to improve syntax correct rate and reduces requirement to functional correctness. The validation is performed on circuits significantly larger than recent previous work on LLM-based Verilog code generation.
