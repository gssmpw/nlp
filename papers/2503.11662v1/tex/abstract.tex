In chip design planning, obtaining reliable performance and power forecasts for various design options is of critical importance. Traditionally, this involves using system-level models, which often lack accuracy, or trial synthesis, which is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. We introduce a new methodology, called Lorecast, which accepts English prompts as input to rapidly generate layout-aware performance and power estimates. This approach bypasses the need for HDL code development or synthesis, making it both fast and user-friendly. Experimental results demonstrate that Lorecast achieves accuracy within a few percent of error compared to post-layout analysis.
%Conventional IC design relies heavily on iterative HDL coding and synthesis flows to assess performance, which becomes resource-intensive during early design exploration and late-stage engineering change orders (ECOs). Such processes are computationally costly, as synthesis and placement must be repeatedly executed to evaluate trade-offs in power, performance, and area. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based, natural language-driven framework that bypasses code writing, traditional synthesis, and layout by directly predicting post-layout metrics from design specifications provided in natural language. Our approach, leveraging advanced machine learning models, offers IC designers fast, accurate estimations with less manual iteration. Experimental evaluations show that our method provides highly accurate predictions for post-layout metrics.
