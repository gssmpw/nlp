    abstract = "While the fast-paced inception of novel tasks and new datasets helps foster active research in a community towards interesting directions, keeping track of the abundance of research activity in different areas on different datasets is likely to become increasingly difficult. The community could greatly benefit from an automatic system able to summarize scientific results, e.g., in the form of a leaderboard. In this paper we build two datasets and develop a framework (TDMS-IE) aimed at automatically extracting task, dataset, metric and score from NLP papers, towards the automatic construction of leaderboards. Experiments show that our model outperforms several baselines by a large margin. Our model is a first step towards automatic leaderboard construction, e.g., in the NLP domain."

In this paper, we present AxCell, an automatic machine learning pipeline for extracting results from papers. AxCell uses several novel components, including a table segmentation subtask, to learn relevant structural knowledge that aids extraction. When compared with existing methods, our approach significantly improves the state of the art for results extraction. We also release a structured, annotated dataset for training models for results extraction, and a dataset for evaluating the performance of models on this task. Lastly, we show the viability of our approach enables it to be used for semi-automated results extraction in production, suggesting our improvements make this task practically viable for the first time. Code is available on GitHub."

    abstract = "Tracking state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in machine learning studies is challenging due to high publication volume. Existing methods for creating leaderboards in scientific documents require significant human supervision or rely on scarcely available LaTeX source files. We propose Table Entity LINker (TELIN), a framework which extracts (task, model, dataset, metric) quadruples from collections of scientific publications in PDF format. TELIN identifies scientific named entities, constructs a knowledge base, and leverages human feedback to iteratively refine automatic extractions. TELIN identifies and prioritizes uncertain and impactful entities for human review to create a cascade effect for leaderboard completion. We show that TELIN is competitive with the SOTA but requires much less human annotation."
