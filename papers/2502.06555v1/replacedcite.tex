\paragraph{GAN-based methods for DP synthetic data}

Many prior works have proposed synthetic data mechanisms based on generative adversarial networks.  See ____ for a nice survey of these and other approaches.  These mechanisms generally work by fitting the parameters of the model via DP-SGD, and then using the model to generate synthetic data after training.  These techniques are typically best suited for unstructured data like images or text.

\paragraph{Marginal-based methods for DP synthetic data}

Many mechanisms for DP synthetic data generation work by adding noise to low-dimensional marginals of the data distribution ____.  Some mechanisms in this space are also designed to leverage public data when it's available ____.  Benchmarks have confirmed these approaches work very well in tabular data settings ____.

% \paragraph{DP synthetic data methods that use foundation models} A number of recent works use foundation models trained on ``public data''\footnote{The extent to which data used to train LLMs is considered \emph{public} and compatible with privacy goals is hotly contested____. We sidestep this question and assume public models are fair to treat as non-private, but acknowledge it remains an important question.} to improve differentially private synthetic data generation. Among these are two broad categories of methods: those which use DP finetuning on a foundation model, and API access only. ____,  ____, and ____ use private finetuning on generative language models to generate private tabular synthetic data, and ____ similarly do private LoRA finetuning on an LLM to generate synthetic text data. Similarly, ____ employ DP finetuning of diffusion models for generating DP synthetic images. 

% These finetuning methods, while quite powerful, require access to model weights---something which may not be available for state-of-the-art proprietary models. A series of works in the synthetic image ____ and text ____ domains use only API access to foundation models, combining queries with a genetic algorithm to privately generate synthetic data; these methods were further extended to the federated setting by ____. Yet a different approach ____ uses private prediction combined with other privacy budget saving tricks on the foundation model to generate DP synthetic text.
