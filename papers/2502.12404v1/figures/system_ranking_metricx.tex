    \caption{System rankings according to MetricX-24.
    The rankings are significance clusters, so no system with the same rank is statistically better than all other systems within the same cluster, and all systems in one cluster are statistically better than all systems with a worse rank.
    Statistical testing was done with a one-sided permutation test with $\alpha=0.05$ \citep{noreen1989computer}.}
