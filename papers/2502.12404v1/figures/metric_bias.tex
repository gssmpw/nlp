    \caption{The system ranking of the given reference by MQM (the ground-truth human-based metric), MetricX-24-QE, and XCOMET-QE in the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task.
    For en-de there were 18 total systems.
    Both en-es and ja-zh had 14.
    In every setting, the QE metrics rank the human translations lower than humans do, evidence that these metrics are biased against human translations.
