    \caption{A comparison of the reference, post-edit, and best MT output (per language) qualities as measured by MetricX-24-QE.
    For all languages but ar\_EG and ar\_SA, the post-edit is roughly equal or higher quality (see \S\ref{sec:human_vs_mt_quality} for a discussion about Arabic).
    Although it appears that MT systems are generating super-human translations for nearly all 55 languages, we caution against reaching that conclusion because automatic metrics are known to be biased against human translations, systematically scoring them lower than they should (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:metric_bias}).
