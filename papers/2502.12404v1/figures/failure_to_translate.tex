    \caption{The number of times that each system generated text other than just a translation (determined by 0-shot prompting Gemini-1.5 Pro) after 38 bad source segments were removed from the evaluation.
    For gu\_IN, OpenAI o1 refused to translate the input text because it contained profanity.
    Interestingly, the model did not refuse to translate in other languages at the same rate.}
