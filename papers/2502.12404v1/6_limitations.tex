\section*{Limitations}
Given the scope of this dataset collection effort, it is impossible to ensure every reference translation and post-edit in all 55 languages is the highest quality.
However, we performed a series of quality checks, including the analysis in Figure~\ref{fig:ref_vs_pe_vs_mt_all}, looking into low-quality translations according to QE metrics, having humans spot-check the data, etc., to ensure the data is as high-quality as possible.

Although we cannot come to definitive conclusions for some of the claims in this work due to limitations of automatic evaluation metrics, we feel that an in-depth human evaluation is out-of-scope for this work.
Irrespective of the translation quality results, we hope that the references and post-edits are a significant contribution to the research community.
