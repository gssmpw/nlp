\section{Metric Bias Against Human Translations}
\label{appendix:metric_bias}

Table~\ref{tab:metric_bias} shows the system rankings of different human translations by MQM \citep[the human-based ground-truth ranking; ][]{lommel2014multidimensional,experts}, MetricX-24-QE, and XCOMET-QE in the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task.
In all settings, the QE metrics rank the human translations lower than the human evaluators did, evidence that these metrics are systematically biased against human translations.
Therefore, we caution against using the results from \S\ref{sec:human_vs_mt_quality} and Figure~\ref{fig:ref_vs_pe} to conclude that the MT systems are higher quality than the human translations since they are likely being unfairly penalized.
