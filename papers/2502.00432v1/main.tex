\begin{abstract}
% Community detection algorithms are widely used to identify groups of closely connected nodes within a network, enabling applications such as targeted advertising and social network analysis. However, these algorithms can expose users' affiliations, leading to privacy concerns for individuals who wish to remain anonymous within specific communities. 

We tackle the problem of \emph{community membership hiding}, which involves strategically altering a network's structure to obscure a target node's membership in a specific community identified by a detection algorithm. We reformulate the original discrete counterfactual graph objective as a differentiable constrained optimization task. To solve this, we propose \method{}, a gradient-based method that modifies the network's structure within the feasible bounds for an individual target node, effectively concealing its membership. Experimental results across multiple datasets and community detection algorithms show that our approach surpasses existing baselines, offering a better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
