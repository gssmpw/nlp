\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this research preview paper,  we present our  ideas  towards incorporating human values in the process of  eliciting and specifying requirements for  creating runtime monitors that collect human-related data.
Our initial conceptual framework for value-complemented Human-Monitoring defines key activities, from specifying monitoring use cases to applying value tactics for creating a set of agreed on functional and non-functional monitoring requirements. 

We further identified three key areas as part of our research roadmap, related to elicitation, validation, and negotiation of values and requirements. These require further in-depth research and analysis in the context of CPS to tie functional and non-functional monitoring requirements to human values.
