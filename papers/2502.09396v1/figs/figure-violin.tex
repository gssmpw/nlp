    \caption{Frequencies of observed risk metrics for different datasets when combined structural risk is 0 (above, green) or 1 (below, red). Note each subplot has different $y$ scales. Blue lines indicate frequency or metric value of 0. Note that while TPR metrics are always $\ge 0$, a poor membership attack model may have FDIF $<0$.}%
