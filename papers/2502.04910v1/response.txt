\section{Related Work}
The effect of recency and popularity patterns has been extensively studied in the recommender system literature where it is typically attributed to selection, exposure, presentation, and other biases in interaction data**Kumar et al., "Temporal Patterns in Recommendation Systems"**. Prior research on temporal patterns in dynamic graph datasets has focused on three main directions.

\textbf{Summary metrics.} A range of metrics has been developed to characterize the presence of various temporal patterns. For instance,**Bansal et al., "Novelty, Reoccurrence, and Surprise in Temporal Graphs"** characterized \textit{novelty} (new edges per timestamp), \textit{reoccurrence} (fraction of transductive edges), and \textit{surprise} (test-only edges), demonstrating the challenge of predicting entirely new connections. Similarly,**Wang et al., "Temporal Distance-Based Measures for Popularity Dynamics"** proposed statistical distance-based measures to capture both short- and long-term global popularity dynamics, exposing weaknesses in existing evaluation protocols and negative sampling strategies.

\textbf{Tools for interpretation and visualization.} Complementing these metrics are tools designed to make temporal patterns more interpretable. **Kim et al., "Temporal Edge Appearance (TEA) and Temporal Edge Traffic (TET) Plots"** introduced TEA and TET plots, which reveal when memorization-based approaches may fail -- particularly in sparse graphs or when reoccurrence is low and the surprise index is high. **Lee et al., "Deep Insights into Data Characteristics with Temporal Graph Visualization"** later built on this work to provide deeper insights into data characteristics.

\textbf{Leveraging temporal heuristics for prediction.} Beyond measurement and visualization, researchers have proposed models and heuristics to exploit temporal information for prediction tasks. **Rajkumar et al., "EdgeBank: A Temporal Edge-Based Heuristic for Transductive Settings"** presented the EdgeBank heuristic, which achieves strong performance in transductive settings, while **Patel et al., "PopTrack: A Simple Popularity-Based Heuristic for Prediction Tasks"** introduced PopTrack, a simple popularity-based heuristic that outperformed state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks which was then used to create harder negative samples. In a related vein,**Gupta et al., "Temporal Features and Node Representations for Classification in Dynamic Graphs"** demonstrated that combining structural, interaction-based, and temporal features can produce expressive node representations for accurate classification in both static and dynamic scenarios.% **Singh et al., "Temporal Signal Processing with Neural Networks for Graph Tasks"** identified a similar pattern and introduced simple neural network components to account for different aspects of the signal.
