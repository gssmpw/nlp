In this paper, we studied the online pricing problem with adversarial inventory constraints imposed over time series. We introduced an optimistic strategy and a C20CB algorithm that is capable of approaching the optimal prices from inventory-censored demands. Our algorithm enjoys a regret guarantee at $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ with high probability, which is information-theoretically optimal. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address this adversarial-inventory pricing problem, and our results indicate that the demand-censoring effect does not substantially increase the hardness of pricing in terms of minimax regret.
