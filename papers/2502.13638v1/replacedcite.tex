%\subsection{Related Work on Inverse and Forward Modeling}
Inverse modeling is currently the predominant paradigm in ML and Data Mining (DM). 
Work on the integration of forward and inverse modeling, however, %, although called for, 
is currently found mainly outside ML and DM. A paper from applied physics  ____  presents a deep learning approach to the forward and inverse designs of plasmonic metasurface structural color. Another applied physics paper  describes a deep learning framework for forward and inverse problems in time-domain electromagnetics ____. 
%Another physics application of combined forward and inverse modeling comes from the domain of predicting radiative properties for dielectric and metallic particles ____. 
Closer in spirit are robotics approaches for tracking and prediction based on deep forward and inverse perceptual models ____. Deriving data from simulations of theoretical models and then training classification, regression, and ranking models is quite common in ML applied to particle physics ____. One has to note that the integration of forward and inverse modeling is similar to abduction ____, a currently underrepresented topic in DM ____.

In case of traffic surveillance on airport grounds, there is no actual standard for sensor systems for the tasks of object detection, speed estimation, tracking, and classification. Consequently, different technological systems are explored in the literature, where most of them focus on trajectory optimization during flight ____, mid-air classification of aircraft using radar ____ or aircraft classification based on top-view images ____. %, e.g. magnetometers ____, \emph{Light Detection and Ranging} (LiDAR) ____, cameras or images ____, radar ____, satellite ____, and others ____. %The most prominent solutions in vehicle traffic monitoring are either based on LiDAR or \emph{magnetometers} ____, as these sensors typically deliver more robust measurements and observations than cameras or radars. 
%They mostly focus on trajectory optimization during flight ____, mid-air classification of aircraft ____ or aircraft classification based on top-view images ____. 
However, in case of surface traffic surveillance on airports, aircraft need to be classified on the ground. Hence, visual-based technologies may struggle with obstacles and visually bad weather conditions like heavy rain, snow or fog ____. On the other hand, magnetometers are not affected as they measure the Earth's magnetic field. They may also be installed directly below the surface of the holding point positions that need to be monitored, functioning as on-site sensors. Consequently, magnetometers have a high potential to be a part of traffic surveillance systems on airport grounds.
