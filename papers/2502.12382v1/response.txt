\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:Section2}
Given their growing and linked character, IoT networks—which are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks—rely on IDS to maintain their security. Using both binary and multi-class intrusion detection models, several machine ML and DL methods have been employed to improve IDS. This review of the literature investigates several current works addressing intrusion detection problems using various techniques, both as stand-alone models and in hybrid setups.

The authors of \textbf{Huang, "A Novel AI Framework for Malware Detection in IoT Devices"} presented a new AI framework that detects malware in IoT devices to mitigate cyber-attacks. The authors focus on enhancing security in various use cases for smart environments through an all-inclusive AI-enabled approach in this paper. Emulation of a smart environment employing the Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson as gateways in capturing data from IoT devices connected via the MQTT protocol, therefore enabling monitoring of real-time malware attacks for their prediction. In this work, many models of AI have been evaluated, among which the DNN model demonstrated superior accuracy and classification capability with an F1-score of 92\% and detection accuracy of 93\% on Edge-IIoTset and IoT-23. Concerns about the impact on system resources by specifying metrics are drawn to traffic and CPU usage on both devices, while challenges include the lack of ground-truth data in most cyberattacks. Future research shall 
be on few-shot learning, lightweight model implementation, DL cutting-edge methodologies, penetration testing, and the use of additional sensor and actuator data to enhance the anomaly detection system.

Using the IoT 2023 dataset as a thorough benchmark, the study of \textbf{Akhbari et al., "Feature Extraction from IoT Data: A Comparative Study"} tackles the issue of feature extraction from IoT data. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the dataset's properties and possible uses by evaluating both classic statistical approaches and ML-based methods. Feature extraction takes on more significance in the context of the IoT because of the "curse of dimensionality," the well-known fact that data processing and analysis get more complicated as the number of dimensions grows. Various techniques have been surveyed to place them in the context of their strengths in capturing relevant information, reducing dimensionality, and improving performance in IoT analytics. Some key findings in this respect include the Hughes phenomenon: classifier performance may get better with more features up to some optimal point before deteriorating. This paper guides the choice of suitable feature extraction methods to be deployed for various IoT applications via ample experiments and performance analysis. This will, therefore, help in the practical development of IoT solutions in 2023 and beyond. Besides, according to the authors, little effect of reducing features on the model performance is up to an accuracy of 93.04\% using Decision Trees and 93.05\% using Random Forest (RF) models. 

%This paper reviews CNN for anomaly detection within the Internet of Things networks \textbf{Kumar et al., "Convolutional Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in IoT Networks"} and, thus, tries to evaluate the performance of dimensions CNN1D, CNN2D, and CNN3D in the presence of normal and anomalous network data. It shows the models’ trustworthiness in detecting different cyber-attack types and maintaining the integrity of the IoT network traffic. Various datasets are used, including IoT Network Intrusion, Bot-IoT, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, IoT-DS-2, IoT-23, and IoT-DS 1. This study concludes that CNN2D and CNN1D are very good at identifying anomalies in IoT networks because they are accurate and fast. Thus, from the current and future perspectives, these models are very promising in building a solid structure for intrusion detection in the network of computers. Moreover, the authors recommend that future research should be directed along the lines of other deep learning approaches, such as FFN, RNN, and GAN, that are suitable for transforming this system into a high anomaly detection one to rise to the challenges of the shifting paradigm in cyber security.

Using ML approaches, Prazeres \textit{et al.} (2022) evaluates AI-based malware detection in IoT network traffic. The study makes use of the IoT-23 dataset using real IoT network traffic of both benign and malicious, including numerous forms of malware including botnets and DDoS attacks. Key strategies to categorize network traffic are feature selection, data normalization, and the application of several ML models (Logistic Regression, RF, ANN, and Naïve Bayes) \textbf{Prazeres et al., "A Novel Approach for Malware Detection in IoT Networks using Machine Learning"}.

%____ evaluates different algorithms of anomaly detection and classification using the IoT-23 dataset. The author has found that, out of those, the RF algorithm was most effective with an accuracy of 99.5\% and precision. It can be seen that ANNs have biases toward classes with higher occurrences, possibly due to neuron weight configurations, and the Support Vector Machine turned in the poorest result at an accuracy of 60\% which can’t predict benign captures, but it turned in a relatively high recall rating. The study concludes that RF is the best algorithm for detecting and classifying anomalies in the IoT-23 dataset, which was also revealed in the past by related studies, and proposes further research into the causes of high accuracy by simpler models and the potential of more complex models.

When testing IDS, the gold standard is the IoT-23 dataset, which simulates real-world IoT network traffic. It provides several attack scenarios that researchers can use to test the multi-class classification capabilities of DL and ML models. Detection rates surpass 99\% when models based on RF and CNN are used \textbf{Liu et al., "A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models for Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks"}.

ElKashlan \textit{et al.} proposed a ML-based IDS to safeguard electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) in an IoT environment. They evaluated many machine-learning techniques to identify fraudulent traffic in both binary and multiclass traffic models using a real-world IoT dataset.  The suggested solution seeks to improve EVCS security by successfully detecting and thwarting cyberattacks, guaranteeing the ecosystem's stability, and guarding against possible interruptions to day-to-day operations.  Along with defining the EV charging ecosystem, the article looks at the many attack types that could happen and the vulnerabilities that each component faces. The traffic and possible assaults on an EVCS were represented by them using a native IoT dataset, IoT-23, which is derived from actual IoT devices \textbf{ElKashlan et al., "A Machine Learning-Based IDS for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations in IoT Environment"}.

To improve intrusion detection in IoT networks, Ullah et al. (2021) suggested a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). To accomplish reliable binary and multiclass classifications, it applies sophisticated preprocessing and feature selection algorithms to a variety of datasets (BoT-IoT, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, etc.). The model outperforms earlier techniques with high accuracy (up to 99.96\%) and efficient detection rates across a range of cyberattack types. Its architecture uses strategies like dropout layers and early halting to overcome common problems like overfitting and data imbalance. In order to improve detection skills, future research areas will use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) \textbf{Ullah et al., "A Hybrid Model for Intrusion Detection in IoT Networks using Convolutional Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Units"}.

Using generative adversarial networks (GANs), Park et al. suggest an improved AI-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS). To identify anomalies and learn the typical behavior of network traffic, the system makes use of a DL model.  In order to increase the NIDS's accuracy, the study also creates fake data using GANs.  When tested on a benchmark dataset, the suggested system outperforms the most advanced NIDSs, according to the results.  The study comes to the conclusion that the suggested approach can be utilized to increase computer network security and is efficient at identifying network intrusions \textbf{Park et al., "A Novel Approach for Network Intrusion Detection using Generative Adversarial Networks"}.

To identify cyberattacks in IoT networks, Abdalgawad et al. investigated the use of generative DL models, such as Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE) and Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGAN). They analyzed the IoT-23 dataset, which includes network traffic information from actual IoT devices, such as Amazon Echoes and smart door locks. These models were trained to recognize a variety of attacks, such as botnet activity from Mirai, Okiru, and Torii, as well as DDoS attacks. According to the study, these generative models outperformed more conventional ML techniques like RF in terms of intrusion detection. This study shows how generative DL can be used to enhance cybersecurity in the expanding IoT environment \textbf{Abdalgawad et al., "Generative Deep Learning Models for Cyberattack Detection in IoT Networks"}.

Rahman et al. (2021), who combined AdaBoost and XGBoost with different feature selection methods, further highlight the significance of feature selection in these hybrid models. Their hybrid model decreased computing overhead, which is crucial for real-time intrusion detection systems while increasing detection accuracy \textbf{Rahman et al., "A Hybrid Approach for Intrusion Detection using Feature Selection and Ensemble Methods"}.
