	abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet of Things ({IoT}) is expected to add billions of {IoT} devices connected to the Internet. These devices represent a vast attack surface for cyberattacks. For example, these {IoT} devices can be infected with botnets to enable Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}) attacks. Signature-based intrusion detection systems are traditional countermeasures for such attacks. However, these methods rely on human experts and are time-consuming in terms of updates and may not exhaust all attack types especially zero-day attacks. Deep learning has shown some promise in intrusion detection. This paper shows that it is possible to use generative deep learning methods like Adversarial Autoencoders ({AAE}) and Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks ({BiGAN}) to detect intruders based on an analysis of the network data. The recently posted full {IoT}-23 dataset based on Somfy door lock, Philips Hue and Amazon Echo devices was used to train generative deep learning models to detect a variety of attacks like {DDoS}, and various botnets like Mirai, Okiruk and Torii. Over 1.8 million network flows were used to train the various models. The resulting generative models outperform traditional machine learning techniques like Random Forests. Both {AAE} and {BiGAN}-based models were able to achieve an F1-Score of 0.99. A {BiGAN} to detect unknown attacks was also trained to detect novel zero-day attacks with an F1-Score from 0.85 to 1.},

Internet connected {IoT} devices provide rich user experience and add-on services. Eventually, the {IoT} devices are interconnected to a management system. Attacking the {IoT} ecosystem is rising at the same rate as those of the physical attacks and vandalism happening in the {IT} world. The cyberattack is more severe than the physical attack as it may affect thousands of the {IoT} devices at the same time. Intrusion Detection is vital in defending diverse types of attacks and unauthorized activities. Fundamentally, the Intrusion Detection System’s ({IDS}) problem is a classification problem. The {IDS} tries to find out each traffic stream is legitimate or malicious. Furthermore, the {IDS} can identify the type of the malicious traffic. This study is a benchmark of different machine learning classifier algorithms for finding fraudulent traffic specifically in the {IoT} network environment. A typical {IoT} dataset obtained from actual {IoT} traffic is used in the study. We compare various classification algorithms that is placed inline to the traffic and contain different types of attacks targeting the {IoT} network. The obtained results from the different algorithms would improve the stability and significantly reduce the amount of cyberattacks that could disrupt daily living activities in the {IoT} Environment.},

This paper represents a model that accounts for the detection of botnets through the use of machine learning algorithms. The model examined anomalies, commonly referred to as botnets, in a cluster of {IoT} devices attempting to connect to a network. Essentially, this paper exhibited the use of transport layer data (User Datagram Protocol - {UDP}) generated through {IoT} devices. An intelligent novel model comprising Random Forest Classifier with Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}) was proposed for botnet detection in {IoT} devices. Various machine learning algorithms were also implemented upon the processed data for comparative analysis. The experimental results of the proposed model generated state-of-the-art results for three different datasets, achieving up to 99.99\% accuracy effectively with the lowest prediction time of 0.12 seconds without overfitting. The significance of this study lies in detecting botnets in {IoT} devices effectively and efficiently under all circumstances by utilizing {ICA} with Random Forest Classifier, which is a simple machine learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) is a key enabler in closing the loop in Cyber-Physical Systems, providing “smartness” and thus additional value to each monitored/controlled physical asset. Unfortunately, these devices are more and more targeted by cyberattacks because of their diffusion and of the usually limited hardware and software resources. This calls for designing and evaluating new effective approaches for protecting {IoT} systems at the network level (Network Intrusion Detection Systems, {NIDSs}). These in turn are challenged by the heterogeneity of {IoT} devices and the growing volume of transmitted data. To tackle this challenge, we select a Deep Learning architecture to perform unsupervised early anomaly detection. With a data-driven approach, we explore in-depth multiple design choices and exploit the appealing structural properties of the selected architecture to enhance its performance. The experimental evaluation is performed on two recent and publicly available {IoT} datasets ({IoT}-23 and Kitsune). Finally, we adopt an adversarial approach to investigate the robustness of our solution in the presence of Label Flipping poisoning attacks. The experimental results highlight the improved performance of the proposed architecture, in comparison to both well-known baselines and previous proposals.},

	abstract = {The security pitfalls of {IoT} devices make it easy for the attackers to exploit the {IoT} devices and make them a part of a botnet. Once hundreds of thousands of {IoT} devices are compromised and become the part of a botnet, the attackers use this botnet to launch the large and complex distributed denial of service ({DDoS}) attacks which take down the target websites or services and make them unable to respond the legitimate users. So far, many botnet detection techniques have been proposed but their performance is limited to a specific dataset on which they are trained. This is because the features used to train a machine learning model on one botnet dataset, do not perform well on other datasets due to the diversity of attack patterns. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a universal features set to better detect the botnet attacks regardless of the underlying dataset. The proposed features set manifest preeminent results for detecting the botnet attacks when tested the trained machine learning models over three different botnet attack datasets.},

	abstract = {As communication technology advances, various and heterogeneous data are communicated in distributed environments through network systems. Meanwhile, along with the development of communication technology, the attack surface has expanded, and concerns regarding network security have increased. Accordingly, to deal with potential threats, research on network intrusion detection systems ({NIDSs}) has been actively conducted. Among the various {NIDS} technologies, recent interest is focused on artificial intelligence ({AI})-based anomaly detection systems, and various models have been proposed to improve the performance of {NIDS}. However, there still exists the problem of data imbalance, in which {AI} models cannot sufficiently learn malicious behavior and thus fail to detect network threats accurately. In this study, we propose a novel {AI}-based {NIDS} that can efficiently resolve the data imbalance problem and improve the performance of the previous systems. To address the aforementioned problem, we leveraged a state-of-the-art generative model that could generate plausible synthetic data for minor attack traffic. In particular, we focused on the reconstruction error and Wasserstein distance-based generative adversarial networks, and autoencoder-driven deep learning models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we performed comprehensive evaluations over various data sets and demonstrated that the proposed systems significantly outperformed the previous {AI}-based {NIDS}.},

Hence, using machine learning to classify network trafﬁc data and identify anomalous trafﬁc and potential attacks promises. In this work, we use deep and traditional machine learning to identify anomalous trafﬁc in the {IoT}-23 dataset, which contains network trafﬁc from real-world equipment. We apply feature selection and encoding techniques and expand the types of networks evaluated to improve existing results from the literature. We compare the performance of algorithms in binary classiﬁcation, which separates normal from anomalous trafﬁc, and in multiclass classiﬁcation, which aims to identify the type of attack.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-time intrusion detection system ({IDS}) aimed at detecting the Internet of Things ({IoT}) attacks using multiclass classification models within the {PySpark} architecture. The research objective is to enhance detection accuracy while reducing the prediction time. Various machine learning algorithms are employed using the {OneVsRest} ({OVR}) technique. The proposed method utilizes the {IoT}-23 dataset, which consists of network traffic from smart home {IoT} devices, for model development. Data preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning, transformation, scaling, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique ({SMOTE}), are applied to prepare the dataset. Additionally, feature selection methods are employed to identify the most relevant features for classification. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results indicate that among the evaluated algorithms, extreme gradient boosting achieves a high accuracy of 98.89\%, while random forest demonstrates the most efficient training and prediction times, with a prediction time of only 0.0311 s. The proposed method demonstrates high accuracy in real-time intrusion detection of {IoT} attacks, outperforming existing approaches.},
