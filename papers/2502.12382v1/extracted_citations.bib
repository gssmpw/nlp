	abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet of Things ({IoT}) is expected to add billions of {IoT} devices connected to the Internet. These devices represent a vast attack surface for cyberattacks. For example, these {IoT} devices can be infected with botnets to enable Distributed Denial of Service ({DDoS}) attacks. Signature-based intrusion detection systems are traditional countermeasures for such attacks. However, these methods rely on human experts and are time-consuming in terms of updates and may not exhaust all attack types especially zero-day attacks. Deep learning has shown some promise in intrusion detection. This paper shows that it is possible to use generative deep learning methods like Adversarial Autoencoders ({AAE}) and Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks ({BiGAN}) to detect intruders based on an analysis of the network data. The recently posted full {IoT}-23 dataset based on Somfy door lock, Philips Hue and Amazon Echo devices was used to train generative deep learning models to detect a variety of attacks like {DDoS}, and various botnets like Mirai, Okiruk and Torii. Over 1.8 million network flows were used to train the various models. The resulting generative models outperform traditional machine learning techniques like Random Forests. Both {AAE} and {BiGAN}-based models were able to achieve an F1-Score of 0.99. A {BiGAN} to detect unknown attacks was also trained to detect novel zero-day attacks with an F1-Score from 0.85 to 1.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-time intrusion detection system ({IDS}) aimed at detecting the Internet of Things ({IoT}) attacks using multiclass classification models within the {PySpark} architecture. The research objective is to enhance detection accuracy while reducing the prediction time. Various machine learning algorithms are employed using the {OneVsRest} ({OVR}) technique. The proposed method utilizes the {IoT}-23 dataset, which consists of network traffic from smart home {IoT} devices, for model development. Data preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning, transformation, scaling, and the synthetic minority oversampling technique ({SMOTE}), are applied to prepare the dataset. Additionally, feature selection methods are employed to identify the most relevant features for classification. The performance of the classifiers is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results indicate that among the evaluated algorithms, extreme gradient boosting achieves a high accuracy of 98.89\%, while random forest demonstrates the most efficient training and prediction times, with a prediction time of only 0.0311 s. The proposed method demonstrates high accuracy in real-time intrusion detection of {IoT} attacks, outperforming existing approaches.},

	abstract = {The demand for electric vehicles ({EVs}) is growing rapidly. This requires an ecosystem that meets the user’s needs while preserving security. The rich data obtained from electric vehicle stations are powered by the Internet of Things ({IoT}) ecosystem. This is achieved through us of electric vehicle charging station management systems ({EVCSMSs}). However, the risks associated with cyber-attacks on {IoT} systems are also increasing at the same pace. To help in finding malicious traffic, intrusion detection systems ({IDSs}) play a vital role in traditional {IT} systems. This paper proposes a classifier algorithm for detecting malicious traffic in the {IoT} environment using machine learning. The proposed system uses a real {IoT} dataset derived from real {IoT} traffic. Multiple classifying algorithms are evaluated. Results were obtained on both binary and multiclass traffic models. Using the proposed algorithm in the {IoT}-based {IDS} engine that serves electric vehicle charging stations will bring stability and eliminate a substantial number of cyberattacks that may disturb day-to-day life activities.},

	abstract = {As communication technology advances, various and heterogeneous data are communicated in distributed environments through network systems. Meanwhile, along with the development of communication technology, the attack surface has expanded, and concerns regarding network security have increased. Accordingly, to deal with potential threats, research on network intrusion detection systems ({NIDSs}) has been actively conducted. Among the various {NIDS} technologies, recent interest is focused on artificial intelligence ({AI})-based anomaly detection systems, and various models have been proposed to improve the performance of {NIDS}. However, there still exists the problem of data imbalance, in which {AI} models cannot sufficiently learn malicious behavior and thus fail to detect network threats accurately. In this study, we propose a novel {AI}-based {NIDS} that can efficiently resolve the data imbalance problem and improve the performance of the previous systems. To address the aforementioned problem, we leveraged a state-of-the-art generative model that could generate plausible synthetic data for minor attack traffic. In particular, we focused on the reconstruction error and Wasserstein distance-based generative adversarial networks, and autoencoder-driven deep learning models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we performed comprehensive evaluations over various data sets and demonstrated that the proposed systems significantly outperformed the previous {AI}-based {NIDS}.},

They collect and share a large amount of data, including private data, and are an attractive target of potential attackers. On the other hand, machine learning has been used in several contexts to analyze and classify large volumes of data. Hence, using machine learning to classify network trafﬁc data and identify anomalous trafﬁc and potential attacks promises. In this work, we use deep and traditional machine learning to identify anomalous trafﬁc in the {IoT}-23 dataset, which contains network trafﬁc from real-world equipment. We apply feature selection and encoding techniques and expand the types of networks evaluated to improve existing results from the literature. We compare the performance of algorithms in binary classiﬁcation, which separates normal from anomalous trafﬁc, and in multiclass classiﬁcation, which aims to identify the type of attack.},

	abstract = {The tremendous number of Internet of Things ({IoT}) applications, with their ubiquity, has provided us with unprecedented productivity and simplified our daily life. At the same time, the insecurity of these technologies ensures that our daily lives are surrounded by vulnerable computers, allowing for the launch of multiple attacks via large-scale botnets through the {IoT}. These attacks have been successful in achieving their heinous objectives. A strong identification strategy is essential to keep devices secured. This paper proposes and implements a model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in {IoT} networks that uses a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) and gated recurrent unit ({GRU}) to detect and classify binary and multiclass {IoT} network data. The proposed model is validated using the {BoT}-{IoT}, {IoT} Network Intrusion, {MQTT}-{IoT}-{IDS}2020, and {IoT}-23 intrusion detection datasets.
