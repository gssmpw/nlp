When using boundary element methods to solve partial differential equations (PDEs), many algorithms need to calculate singular and near-singular integrals that arise from flat triangular elements. 
It is hard to evaluate these integrals accurately, but our paper presents methods that integrates these integrals analytically. These closed form expressions are exact for near-singular integrals, and has error bounds that depend quadratically on triangle diameter on integrals where singularities were introduced by the discretization. 
Readers of BIT Numerical Mathematics will benefit from our results by using our closed form expressions to develop faster and more accurate numerical algorithms. All analytic closed form expressions are given in the appendix, and the methods on how to obtain them are also presented to allow readers to generalize to other PDEs. 
Furthermore, we attach open source code to allow other researchers to implement and use the algorithms presented in the paper. 

% we can also suggest an editor from their editorial board, but I don't recognize any of them.

% The BIT paper is Numerical solution of a certain hypersingular integral equation of the first kind, which uses a quadrature method. I don't think there is a good place to mention it.
