\section{SentenceSHAP}
\label{app:sentence-shap}
In this section, we introduce SentenceSHAP, an adaptation of TokenSHAP \cite{horovicz-goldshmidt-2024-tokenshap}. While TokenSHAP calculates the importance of individual tokens, SentenceSHAP estimates the importance of individual sentences in the input prompt. The importance score is calculated using Monte Carlo Shapley Estimation, following the same principles as TokenSHAP.

Given an input prompt \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\} \), where \( x_i \) represents a sentence, we generate all possible combinations of \( X \) by excluding each sentence \( x_i \) (i.e., \( X - \{x_i\} \)). Let \( Z \) represent the set of all combinations where each \( x_i \) is removed. To estimate Shapley values efficiently, we randomly sample from \( Z \) with a specified sampling ratio, resulting in a subset \( Z_s = \{X_1, X_2, \dots, X_s\} \), where each \( X_i = X - \{x_i\} \).

Next, we generate a base response \( r_0 \) using a VLM (or LLM) with the original prompt \( X \), and a set of responses \( R_s = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_s\} \), each generated by a prompt from one of the sampled combinations in \( Z_s \).

We then compute the cosine similarity between the base response \( r_0 \) and each response in \( R_s \) using Sentence Transformer (\texttt{BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5}). The average similarity between combinations with and without \( x_i \) is computed, and the difference between these averages gives the Shapley value for sentence \( x_i \). This is expressed as:
\begin{align}
\notag
\phi(x_i) = \\ \notag
&\frac{1}{s} \sum_{j=1}^{s} \left( \text{cos}(r_0, r_j \mid x_i) - \text{cos}(r_0, r_j \mid \neg x_i) \right)
\end{align}
where \( \phi(x_i) \) represents the Shapley value for sentence \( x_i \), $\text{cos}(r_0, r_j \mid x_i)$ is the cosine similarity between the base response and the response that includes sentence $x_i$, $\text{cos}(r_0, r_j \mid \neg x_i)$ is the cosine similarity between the base response and the response that excludes sentence $x_i$, and $s$ is the number of sampled combinations in $Z_s$.

\section{Error Analysis Based on SentenceSHAP}
Figure \ref{fig:error-analysis} presents two examples of negative impacts from implications: dilution of focus and the introduction of irrelevant information.

\section{Generation Prompts for Selection and Refinement}
\label{app:gen-prompts}
Figures \ref{fig:desc-prompt}, \ref{fig:seed-imp-prompt}, and \ref{fig:nonseed-imp-prompt} show the prompts used for generating image descriptions, seed implications (1st hop), and non-seed implications (2nd hop onward). Figure \ref{fig:cand-prompt} displays the prompt used to generate candidate and final explanations. Image descriptions are used for candidate explanations when existing data is insufficient but are not used for final explanations. For calculating Cross Entropy values (used as a relevance term), we use the prompt in Figure \ref{fig:cand-prompt}, substituting the image with image descriptions, as LLM is used to calculate the cross entropies.

\begin{figure*}[h]
\small
\begin{tcolorbox}[
    title=Prompt for Image Descriptions,
    colback=white,
    colframe=CadetBlue,
    arc=0pt,        % Remove rounded corners
    outer arc=0pt   % Remove outer rounded corners (important for some styles)    
]

Describe the image by focusing on the noun phrases that highlight the actions, expressions, and interactions of the main visible objects, facial expressions, and people.\\
\\
Here are some guidelines when generating image descriptions:\\
* Provide specific and detailed references to the objects, their actions, and expressions. Avoid using pronouns in the description.\\
* Do not include trivial details such as artist signatures, autographs, copyright marks, or any unrelated background information.\\
* Focus only on elements that directly contribute to the meaning, context, or main action of the scene.\\
* If you are unsure about any object, action, or expression, do not make guesses or generate made-up elements.\\
* Write each sentence on a new line.\\
* Limit the description to a maximum of 5 sentences, with each focusing on a distinct and relevant aspect that directly contribute to the meaning, context, or main action of the scene.\\
\\
Here are some examples of desired output:
---\\
\text{[Description]} (example of newyorker cartoon image):\\
Through a window, two women with surprised expressions gaze at a snowman with human arms.\\
---\\
\text{[Description]} (example of newyorker cartoon image):\\
A man and a woman are in a room with a regular looking bookshelf and regular sized books on the wall.\\
In the middle of the room the man is pointing to text written on a giant open book which covers the entire floor.\\
He is talking while the woman with worried expression watches from the doorway.\\
---\\
\text{[Description]} (example of meme):\\
The left side shows a woman angrily pointing with a distressed expression, yelling ``You said memes would work!''.\\
The right side shows a white cat sitting at a table with a plate of food in front of it, looking indifferent or smug with the text above the cat reads, ``I said good memes would work''.\\
---\\
\text{[Description]} (example of yesbut image):\\
The left side shows a hand holding a blue plane ticket marked with a price of ``\$50'', featuring an airplane icon and a barcode, indicating it's a flight ticket.\\
The right side shows a hand holding a smartphone displaying a taxi app, showing a route map labeled ``Airport'' and a price of ``\$65''.\\

\#\#\# Example Outputs:\\
\#\#\#\# Example 1 (example of newyorker cartoon image):\\

\text{[}Descriptions\text{]}: A body in three parts is on an exam table in a doctor's office with the body's arms crossed as though annoyed.\\
\text{[}Connections\text{]}:\\
1. The dismembered body is illogical and impossible, much like Surrealist art, which often explores the absurd.\\
2. The bodyâ€™s angry posture adds a human emotion to an otherwise bizarre scenario, highlighting the strange contrast.\\
\\
\#\#\#\# Example 2 (example of newyorker cartoon image):\\
\text{[}Caption\text{]}: ``He has a summer job as a scarecrow.''\\
\text{[}Descriptions\text{]}: A snowman with human arms stands in a field.\\
\text{[}Connections\text{]}:\\
1. The snowman, an emblem of winter, represents something out of place in a summer setting, much like a scarecrow's seasonal function.\\
2. The human arms on the snowman suggest that the role of a scarecrow is being played by something unexpected and seasonal.\\
\\
\#\#\#\# Example 3 (example of yesbut image):\\
\text{[}Caption\text{]}: ``The left side shows a hand holding a blue plane ticket marked with a price of `\$50'.''\\
\text{[}Descriptions\text{]}: The screen on the right side shows a route map labeled ``Airport'' and a price of `\$65'.\\
\text{[}Connections\text{]}:\\
1. The discrepancy between the ticket price and the taxi fare highlights the often-overlooked costs of travel beyond just booking a flight.\\
2. The image shows the hidden costs of air travel, with the extra fare representing the added complexity of budgeting for transportation.\\
\\
\#\#\#\# Example 4 (example of meme):\\
\text{[}Caption\text{]}: ``You said memes would work!''\\
\text{[}Descriptions\text{]}: A cat smirks with the text ``I said good memes would work.''\\
\text{[}Connections\text{]}:\\
1. The woman's frustration reflects a common tendency to blame concepts (memes) instead of the quality of execution, as implied by the catâ€™s response.\\
2. The contrast between the angry human and the smug cat highlights how people often misinterpret success as simple, rather than a matter of quality.\\

Figure \ref{fig:base-prompt} presents the prompt used for the ZS, CoT, and SR Generator methods. While the format remains largely the same, we adjust it based on the baseline being tested (e.g., CoT requires generating intermediate reasoning, so we add extra instructions for that).
Figure \ref{fig:critic-prompt} shows the prompt used in the SR critic model. The critic's criteria include: (1) \textit{correctness}, measuring whether the explanation directly addresses why the caption is humorous in relation to the image and its caption; (2) \textit{soundness}, evaluating whether the explanation provides a well-reasoned interpretation of the humor; (3) \textit{completeness}, ensuring all important aspects in the caption and image contributing to the humor are considered; (4) \textit{faithfulness}, verifying that the explanation is factually consistency with the image and caption; and (5) \textit{clarity}, ensuring the explanation is clear, concise, and free from unnecessary ambiguity.
