Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a key area of machine learning that focuses on
learning through interaction with the environment. In RL, an agent takes
actions (A) in specific states (S) with the goal of maximizing the rewards (R)
received from the environment. The foundations of RL can be traced back to
1911, when Thorndike introduced the Law of Effect, suggesting that actions
leading to favorable outcomes are more likely to be repeated, while those
causing discomfort are less likely to recur \cite{bg1}.\\ RL emulates the human
learning process of trial and error. The agent receives positive rewards for
beneficial actions and negative rewards for detrimental ones, enabling it to
refine its policy functionâ€”a strategy that dictates the best action to take in
each state. That's said, for a give agent in state $u$, if it takes action $u$,
then the immediate reward $r$ can be modeled as $r(x, u) = \mathbb{E}[r_t \mid
    x=x_{t-1}, u=u_{t-1}]$.\\ So for a full episode of $T$ steps, the cumulative
reward $R$ can be modeled as $R = \sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t$.\\
\subsection{Markov Decision Process (MDP)}

In reinforcement learning, the environment is often modeled as a \textbf{Markov
    Decision Process (MDP)}, which is defined as a tuple $(S, A, P, R, \gamma)$,
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( S \) is the set of states,
    \item \( A \) is the set of actions,
    \item \( P \) is the transition probability function,
    \item \( R \) is the reward function, and
    \item \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
\end{itemize}

The MDP framework is grounded in \textbf{sequential decision-making}, where the
agent makes decisions at each time step based on its current state. This
process adheres to the \textbf{Markov property}, which asserts that the future
state and reward depend only on the present state and action, not on the
history of past states and actions.

Formally, the Markov property is represented by:

\begin{equation}
    P(s'\mid s, a) = \mathbb{P}[s_{t+1} = s' \mid s_t = s, a_t = a]
\end{equation}

which denotes the probability of transitioning from state $s$ to state $s'$
when action $a$ is taken.

The reward function \( R \) is similarly defined as:

\begin{equation}
    R(s, a) = \mathbb{E}[r_t \mid s_{t-1} = s, a_{t-1} = a]
\end{equation}

which represents the expected reward received after taking action $a$ in state
$S$.
\subsection{Policy and Value Functions}
In reinforcement learning, an agent's goal is to find the optimal policy that
the agent should follow to maximize cumulative rewards over time. To facilitate
this process, we need to quantify the desirability of a given state, which is
done through the \textbf{value function} $V(s)$. Value function estimates the
expected cumulative reward an agent will receive starting from state \( s \)
and continuing thereafter. In essence, the value function reflects how
beneficial it is to be in a particular state, guiding the agent's
decision-making process. The \textbf{state-value function} is then defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:v_pi}
    \begin{split}
        V_\pi(s) & = \mathbb{E_\pi}[G_t \mid s_t = s]                            \\
                 & = \mathbb{E_\pi}[r_t + \gamma r_{t+1}  + \ldots \mid s_t = s]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

where \( G_t \) is the cumulative reward from time step $t$ onwards. From here
we can define another value function the \textbf{action-value function} under
policy $\pi$, which is $Q_\pi(s, a)$, that estimates the expected cumulative
reward from the state $s$ and taking action $a$ and then following policy
$\pi$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:q_pi}
    \begin{split}
        Q_\pi(s, a) & = \mathbb{E_\pi}[G_t \mid s_t = s, a_t = a]                            \\
                    & = \mathbb{E_\pi}[r_t + \gamma r_{t+1}  + \ldots \mid s_t = s, a_t = a]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma$ is the discount factor, which is a decimal value between 0 and 1
that detemines how much we care about immediate rewards versus future reward
rewards \cite{bg2}.\\

We say that a policy $\pi$ is better than another policy $\pi'$ if the expected
return of every state under $\pi$ is greater than or equal to the expected
return of every state under $\pi'$, i.e., $V_\pi(s) \geq V_{\pi'}(s)$ for all
$s \in S$. Eventually, there will be a policy (or policies) that are better
than or equal to all other policies, this is called the \textbf{optimal policy}
$\pi^*$. All optimal policies will then share the same optimal state-value
function $V^*(s)$ and the same optimal action-value function $Q^*(s, a)$, which
are defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        V^*(s)    & = \max_\pi V_\pi(s)    \\
        Q^*(s, a) & = \max_\pi Q_\pi(s, a)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

If we can estimate the optimal state-value (or action-value) function, then the
optimal policy $\pi^*$ can be obtained by selecting the action that maximizes
the state-value (or action-value) function at each state, i.e., $\pi^*(s) =
    \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$ and that's the goal of reinforcement learning\cite{bg2}.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning Algorithms}
There are multiple reinforcement learning algorithms that have been developed
that falls under a lot of categories. But, for the sake of this review, we will
focus on the following algorithms that have been used by the Google DeepMind
team in their reinforcement learning models.\\

\subsubsection{\textbf{Model-Based Algorithms: Dynamic Programming}}

\hspace{1em} Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms can be applied when we have a perfect model
of the environment, represented by the transition probability function \( P(s',
r \mid s, a) \). These algorithms rely on solving the Bellman equations
(recursive form of equations \ref{eq:v_pi} and \ref{eq:q_pi}) iteratively to
compute optimal policies. The process alternates between two key steps:
\textbf{policy evaluation} and \textbf{policy improvement}.

\paragraph{Policy Evaluation}
Policy evaluation involves computing the value function \( V^\pi(s) \) under a
given policy \( \pi \). This is achieved iteratively by updating the value of
each state based on the Bellman equation:
\begin{equation}
    V^\pi(s) = \sum_{a \in A} \pi(a \mid s) \sum_{s', r} P(s', r \mid s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right].
\end{equation}

Starting with an arbitrary initial value \( V^\pi(s) \), the updates are
repeated for all states until the value function converges to a stable
estimate.

\paragraph{Policy Improvement}
Once the value function \( V^\pi(s) \) has been computed, the policy is
improved by choosing the action \( a \) that maximizes the expected return for
each state:
\begin{equation}
    \pi'(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s', r} P(s', r \mid s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V^\pi(s') \right].
\end{equation}

This step ensures that the updated policy \( \pi' \) is better than or equal to
the previous policy \( \pi \). The process alternates between policy evaluation
and improvement until the policy converges to the optimal policy \( \pi^* \),
where no further improvement is possible. It can be visualized as:

\[
    \pi_0 \xrightarrow{\text{Eval}} V^{\pi_0} \xrightarrow{\text{Improve}} \pi_1 \xrightarrow{\text{Eval}} V^{\pi_1} \xrightarrow{\text{Improve}} \pi_2 \xrightarrow{\text{Eval}} \ldots \xrightarrow{\text{Improve}} \pi^*.
\]

\paragraph{Value Iteration}
Value iteration simplifies the DP process by combining policy evaluation and
policy improvement into a single step. Instead of evaluating a policy
completely, it directly updates the value function using:
\begin{equation}
    V^*(s) = \max_a \sum_{s', r} P(s', r \mid s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V^*(s') \right].
\end{equation}

This method iteratively updates the value of each state until convergence and
implicitly determines the optimal policy. Then the optimal policy can be
obtained by selecting the action that maximizes the value function at each
state, as
\begin{equation}
    \pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a \sum_{s', r} P(s', r \mid s, a) \left[ r + \gamma V^*(s') \right].
\end{equation}

Dynamic Programming's systematic approach to policy evaluation and improvement
forms the foundation for the techniques that have been cruical in training
systems like AlphaGo Zero and MuZero.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Model-Free Algorithms}}

\paragraph{Monte Carlo Algorithm (MC)}
The Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm is a model-free reinforcement learning method
that estimates the value of states or state-action pairs under a given policy
by averaging the returns of multiple episodes. Unlike DP, MC does not require a
perfect model of the environment and instead learns from sampled experiences.

The key steps in MC include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Policy Evaluation:} Estimate the value of a state or state-action pair \( Q(s, a) \) by averaging the returns observed in multiple episodes.
    \item \textbf{Policy Improvement:} Update the policy \( \pi \) to choose actions that maximize the estimated value \( Q(s, a) \).
\end{itemize}

MC algorithms operate on complete episodes, requiring the agent to explore all
state-action pairs sufficiently to ensure accurate value estimates. The updated
policy is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \pi(s) = \arg\max_a Q(s, a).
\end{equation}

While both MC and DP alternate between policy evaluation and policy
improvement, MC works with sampled data, making it suitable for environments
where the dynamics are unknown or difficult to model.

This algorithm is particularly well-suited for environments that are
\emph{episodic}, where each episode ends in a terminal state after a finite
number of steps. \\ Monte Carlo's reliance on episodic sampling and policy
refinement has directly influenced the development of search-based methods like
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which was crucial in AlphaGo for evaluating
potential moves during gameplay. The algorithm's adaptability to model-free
settings has made it a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning strategies.

\paragraph{Temporal Diffrence (TD)}

Temporal Diffrence is another model free algorithm that's very similar To Monte
Carlo, but instead of waiting for termination of the episode to give the
return, it estimates the return based on the next state. The key idea behind TD
is to update the value function based on the difference between the current
estimate and the estimate of the next state. The TD return is then given by:
\begin{equation}
    G_t = r_{t+1} + \gamma V(s_{t+1})
\end{equation}
that's the target (return value estimation) of state $s$ at time $t$ is the immediate reward $r$ plus the
discounted value of the next state $s_{t+1}$.\\
This here is called the TD(0) algorithm, which is the simplest form of TD
that take only one future step into account. The update rule for TD(0) is:
\begin{equation}
    V(s_t) = V(s_t) + \alpha [r_{t+1} + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)]
\end{equation}

There are other temporal difference algorithms that works exactly like TD(0),
but with more future steps, like TD($\lambda$). \\

Another important variant of TD is the Q-learning algorithm, which is an
off-policy TD algorithm that estimates the optimal action-value function $Q^*$
by updating the current action value based on the optimal action value of the
next state. The update rule for Q-learning is:

\begin{equation}
    Q(s_t, a_t) = Q(s_t, a_t) + \alpha[r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q(s_t, a_t)] .
\end{equation}

and after the algorithm converges, the optimal policy can be obtained by
selecting the action that maximizes the action-value function at each state, as
$\pi^*(s) = \arg\max_a Q^*(s, a)$.

Temporal Difference methods, including Q-learning, play a crucial role in
modern reinforcement learning by enabling model-free value function estimation
and action selection without the need to terminate the episode. In systems like
AlphaGo and MuZero, TD methods are used to update value functions efficiently
and support complex decision-making processes without requiring a model of the
environment.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Deep RL: Deep Q-Network (DQN)}}

Deep Q-Networks (DQN) represent a significant leap forward in the integration
of deep learning with reinforcement learning. DQN extends the traditional
Q-learning algorithm by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value
function, which is essential in environments with large state spaces where
traditional tabular methods like Q-learning become infeasible.

In standard Q-learning, the action-value function \(Q(s, a)\) is learned
iteratively based on the Bellman equation, which updates the Q-values according
to the reward received and the value of the next state. However, when dealing
with complex, high-dimensional inputs such as images or unstructured data, a
direct tabular representation of the Q-values is not practical. This is where
DQN comes in: it uses a neural network, typically a convolutional neural
network (CNN), to approximate \(Q(s, a; \theta)\), where \(\theta\) represents
the parameters of the network.

The core ideas behind DQN are similar to those of traditional Q-learning, but
with a few key innovations that address issues such as instability and high
variance during training. The DQN algorithm introduces the following
components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Experience Replay:} To improve the stability of training and to break the correlation between consecutive experiences, DQN stores the agentâ€™s experiences in a replay buffer. Mini-batches of experiences are randomly sampled from this buffer to update the network, which helps in better generalization.
    \item \textbf{Target Network:} DQN uses two networks: the primary Q-network and a target Q-network. The target network is updated less frequently than the primary network and is used to calculate the target value in the Bellman update. This reduces the risk of oscillations and divergence during training.
\end{itemize}

The update rule for DQN is based on the Bellman equation for Q-learning, but
with the neural network approximation:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
         & Q(s_t, a_t; \theta) = Q(s_t, a_t; \theta) +                                                     \\
         & \alpha \left[ r_{t+1} + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s_{t+1}, a'; \theta^-) - Q(s_t, a_t; \theta) \right]
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

where \( \theta^- \) represents the parameters of the target network. By
training the network to minimize the difference between the predicted Q-values
and the target Q-values, the agent learns an optimal policy over
time.\cite{bg4}

The DQN algorithm revolutionized reinforcement learning, especially in
applications requiring decision-making in high-dimensional spaces. One of the
most notable achievements of DQN was its success in mastering a variety of
Atari 2600 games directly from raw pixel input, achieving human-level
performance across multiple games. This breakthrough demonstrated the power of
combining deep learning with reinforcement learning to solve complex,
high-dimensional problems.

In subsequent improvements, such as Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and Prioritized
Experience Replay, enhancements were made to further stabilize training and
improve performance. However, the foundational concepts of using deep neural
networks to approximate Q-values and leveraging experience replay and target
networks remain core to the DQN framework.
