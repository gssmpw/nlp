We proposed a language-based hierarchical agent that is able to assist users across their real-life journeys towards goals and tasks that can last across sessions and evolve over long periods of time. The framework is general and aims to behave in a similar fashion as a human when asked to assist with a plan for a real-life goal. We demonstrate qualitatively the effectiveness of the framework for conversational coaching and conversational tutoring, noting success across other domains as well. We argue that this approach makes a step toward conversational AI systems that are not anchored in short-term interactions but can be true companions in supporting user goals over time.
