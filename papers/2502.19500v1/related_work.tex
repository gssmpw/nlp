Inspired by the strong in-context learning \cite{brown2020language, kojima2022large} and complex reasoning \cite{wei2022chain, zhou2024self} capabilities of LLMs \cite{bubeck2023sparks}, there has been a lot of recent interest into \textbf{LLM-driven agents} \cite{wang2023describe, zhao2024empowering, ahn2022can, shen2024hugginggpt, nakano2021webgpt, wang2023voyager, wang2024survey, sharan2023llm, brooks2024large}. This body of work can be largely divided into (i) text-based agents \cite{shen2024hugginggpt, yao2022react, park2023generative}, and (ii) open-world embodied agents \cite{wang2023describe, ahn2022can, wang2023voyager, liang2023code, singh2023progprompt, szot2023large, sun2024interactive}. Our work, anchored on the realization that real-life user goals/tasks take a long time to be achieved, brings language-based \textbf{hierarchical long-term planning} techniques typically considered only in open-world environments (e.g., Minecraft) to text-based agents. Traditionally, in non-language based reinforcement learning, whenever tasks of long term nature need to be solved, a \emph{hierarchical} goal execution architecture is considered \cite{bacon2017option}, where a planner generates action plans that would then be executed by low-level goal-conditioned controllers. Recently, thanks to the LLM advances, interactive LLM-based hierarchical planning approaches have been proposed and proven successful for open-world environments \cite{sun2024interactive, singh2023progprompt, wang2023voyager, huang2022language, zhao2024empowering, wang2023describe}. However, little to no attention has been given to language-based hierarchical planning for text-based agents \cite{shen2024hugginggpt}. This is where our work comes in and aims to advance the frontier of the traditionally short-term focused text-based agents. We offer a novel framework allowing for conversational planning for users' personal plans, that can be adapted over time based on human feedback. This also advances the state of the art for conversational recommendation \cite{christakopoulou2016towards, jannach2021survey}.

%, enabling them to provide humans with interactive plans for longer-term real life tasks and goals, adapted over time based on human feedback.

%Similarly to these, our work introduces a language-based hierarchical planning framework, adapted based on human feedback, for text-based agents. This enables text-based agents traditionally focused on answering short-term user queries to longer-term real-life tasks and goals.
