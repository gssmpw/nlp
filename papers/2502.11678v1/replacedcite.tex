\section{Related Work}
Due to space limitations, we provide a more comprehensive discussion in the Appendix~\ref{app:related_work}.

\subsection{LLM-based Human Simulation}
LLMs have been increasingly used to simulate human behaviors across various domains, including social interactions ____, economic decision-making ____, and physical mobility ____. Additionally, studies have explored hybrid models ____ and medical simulations ____. However, little work has been done on simulating students in academic advising.

\subsection{Student Simulation in Education}
LLMs have been leveraged to simulate students for educational purposes, such as training teaching assistants ____, modeling student profiles ____, and generating personality-driven student agents ____. However, simulating students with discrepancies in knowledge or learning skills remains unexplored.
