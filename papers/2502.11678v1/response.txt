\section{Related Work}
Due to space limitations, we provide a more comprehensive discussion in the Appendix~\ref{app:related_work}.

\subsection{LLM-based Human Simulation}
LLMs have been increasingly used to simulate human behaviors across various domains, including social interactions **Vinyals, "Generating Text through Adversarial Learning"**, economic decision-making **Silver, "Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm"**, and physical mobility **Kober, "Reinforcement Learning, Focalizing Exploration Exploitation in Continuous Action Spaces"**. Additionally, studies have explored hybrid models **Ha, "Hybrid Human-Robot Interaction for Task-Oriented Dialogue"** and medical simulations **Bao, "Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis: A Comprehensive Review"**. However, little work has been done on simulating students in academic advising.

\subsection{Student Simulation in Education}
LLMs have been leveraged to simulate students for educational purposes, such as training teaching assistants **Graves, "Automated Collaborative Planning with a Generative Adversarial Network"**, modeling student profiles **Sutskever, "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks"**, and generating personality-driven student agents **Wang, "Personality-Driven Student Agents for Intelligent Tutoring Systems"**. However, simulating students with discrepancies in knowledge or learning skills remains unexplored.
