\begin{abstract}
Structural causal models (SCMs) allow us to investigate complex systems at multiple levels of resolution.
The causal abstraction (CA) framework formalizes the mapping between high- and low-level SCMs. 
We address CA learning in a challenging and realistic setting, where SCMs are inaccessible, interventional data is unavailable, and sample data is misaligned. 
A key principle of our framework is \emph{semantic embedding}, formalized as the high-level distribution lying on a subspace of the low-level one. 
This principle naturally links linear CA to the geometry of the \emph{Stiefel manifold}.
We present a category-theoretic approach to SCMs that enables the learning of a CA by finding a morphism between the low- and high-level probability measures, adhering to the semantic embedding principle. 
\black{Consequently, we formulate a general CA learning problem.}
\black{As an application, we solve the latter problem for linear CA; considering Gaussian measures and the Kullback-Leibler divergence as an objective.
Given the nonconvexity of the learning task, we develop three algorithms building upon existing paradigms for Riemannian optimization.}
We demonstrate that the proposed methods succeed on both synthetic and real-world brain data with different degrees of prior information about the structure of CA.

% \section*{Accessibility}
% Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
% Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
% camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
% done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
% submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
% the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
% system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
% when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

\section*{Impact Statement}
\black{Our work is foundational, aiming at advancing the field of causal abstraction.
Our proposed methods can be applied to different application domains, such as neuroscience.
As demonstrated by our empirical assessment, the information resulting from their application is high-level and useful for a better understanding.
Hence, we believe that the risks associated with improper usage of our techniques are low.}
