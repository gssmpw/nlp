\section{Introduction}

Introduce LLM and KV cache, and the memory challenge of KV cache (why we need to compress KV cache).

Introduce existing works on KV cache compression, i.e., kv cache quantization, kv cache eviction, and kv cache offloading. 
And indicate the weakness of each branch of work and show that kv cache offloading is a better solution in the future.
\begin{itemize}
    % \item KV cache quantization: limited performance degradation, still high memory overheads, and requiring kernel implementation
    \item KV cache quantization: limited compression ratio; quantization and de-quantization overhead
    % \item KV cache eviction: significant performance degradation
    \item Eviction-based KV cache compression: significant performance degradation
    \item Recalling-based KV cache compression: 
\end{itemize}
