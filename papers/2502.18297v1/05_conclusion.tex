\section{Conclusion}\label{Sec:Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DeepCircuitX}, a multimodal and comprehensive repository-level dataset designed to advance RTL code understanding, generation, and PPA analysis in hardware design automation. By offering a holistic resource that spans repository, file, module, and block-level RTL code, DeepCircuitX enables large language models to better tackle the complexities of hardware design. The integration of Chain of Thought annotations further enhances the dataset's value by providing detailed insights into functionality and structure, thereby improving model training and performance across a variety of RTL tasks.
Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on DeepCircuitX significantly outperform existing methods in tasks like code understanding, generation, and completion, as well as in RTL-to-PPA prediction. The inclusion of synthesized netlists and PPA metrics opens up new avenues for early-stage design exploration, offering a practical tool for both researchers and practitioners in EDA. As a result, DeepCircuitX establishes new benchmarks for RTL tasks, setting a foundation for future innovations in hardware design automation and demonstrating the potential of LLMs to transform this critical domain.
