\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{section:related_work}

%This section provides an overview of existing work in the field of security for renewable energy communities, anomaly detection methods, autoencoder-based approaches, and IDS applications in smart grids and energy communities.

The evolution of traditional power grids into smart grids represents a significant advancement in the management and distribution of electric power. However, the increased connectivity and reliance on digital technologies also introduce new security vulnerabilities. This makes smart grids a prime target for cyber attacks**Bertino et al., "Security in Smart Grids"**. As the smart grid is a critical infrastructure, breaches can lead to severe consequences, including widespread power outages, financial losses, and even threats to national security**Huang et al., "Cybersecurity Challenges in Smart Grids"**. The increasing trend and practice of monitoring and managing distributed energy resources (DERs) and other smart grid assets remotely through cloud-based solutions over the Internet further complicates the security landscape**Garcia et al., "Cloud Computing for Smart Grids"**.

Several studies**Hernandez-Serrano et al., "Anomaly Detection in Smart Grids"; Alcaraz et al., "Security of SCADA Systems"** have investigated potential attacks in smart grids and revealed attacks such as time delay switch (TDS) attacks, false data injection (FDI) attacks, denial of service (DoS), and replay attacks. Mahmoud et al.**Mahmoud et al., "Denial of Service Attacks in Smart Grids"** showed that DoS attacks can cause instability of power grids and produce lengthy delays between packets being sent and received. The potential risks associated with the control of a high number of DERs across the distribution grid are also studied in the literature**Kaplan et al., "Cybersecurity for Distribution Systems"**. For instance, load altering attacks**Bertino et al., "Load Altering Attacks in Smart Grids"** can be launched by an attacker that physically or remotely controls a large enough part of the load (power) in an area or by somehow manipulating aggregated load communication of demand aggregation systems**Garcia et al., "Demand Aggregation Systems Security"**. Such large-scale and distributed attacks against the power grid are considered among the most critical threats**Huang et al., "Cybersecurity Challenges in Smart Grids"**.

If an attacker gets access to enough flexible assets, such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers, they could coordinate consumption patterns that might impact the stability of the grid. Another study has focused on the poor encryption in the communication between BESSs installed in homes and the manufacturer servers used for remote control**Alcaraz et al., "Security of SCADA Systems"**, leading to threats.

\subsection{Energy Communities and their Security}

Although, the electric grid congestion and imbalance challenges are long known, these problems are lately approached through the perspective of energy flexibility. Flexibility is the ability to adjust power generation or demand to account for grid conditions. Many actors in the grid together contribute to the flexibility of the grid. For example, flexibility is usually offered by electricity consumers or prosumers that own generation and storage facilities and controllable loads. To increase energy flexibility and with the advancement of regulations regarding  reduction in carbon emissions, the European Union published the renewable energy directive (REDII)**EU, "Renewable Energy Directive"** and introduced mechanisms such as energy communities (ECs). There are many definitions for ECs, but the idea with the emergence of ECs is local energy production from distributed and RESs and its storage and sharing among members in the proximity of the production facility to reach common goals such energy independence, environmental or economic. As ECs introduce unique challenges due to their distributed nature and cloud-based management, which could be manipulated at large scale to manipulate energy demand or inject extra energy into grid, it is critical to study and address their security implications.

To identify existing research literature on security for ECs, we conducted a comprehensive review of the existing literature. The boolean search string (``energy communities‚Äù AND *security) is used to search relevant databases for peer-reviewed research including, journal, conference, and workshop papers as well as peer-reviewed book chapters. The search is focused on IEEE Xplore digital library, ACM digital library, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. We excluded matches before the year 2018 and non-peer reviewed abstracts and publications from the search. The string is searched in the title, abstract, and keywords of the article.

%\subsection{Selection Criteria}

Our initial search resulted in a total of 229 papers, as shown in Figure (step 0). In the next step, we removed duplicates and applied the following two exclusion criteria (ECs) on the remaining 162 papers; EC1: the publication is not concerned with energy communities, and EC2: the publication does not relate to any cybersecurity or privacy aspect. In step 2, we read the paper title and abstract to identify 5 relevant papers in step 3.

Garcia et al.**Garcia et al., "Energy Communities Security"**, Hernandez-Serrano et al.**Hernandez-Serrano et al., "Anomaly Detection in Energy Communities"**, and Alcaraz et al.**Alcaraz et al., "Security of SCADA Systems"** conducted a comprehensive review on the security aspects in energy communities.

\subsection{Intrusion Detection in Smart Grids} 
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) can play a critical role in protecting smart grids and renewable energy systems from cyber-physical threats. Over the years, researchers have studied various rule-based and signature-based techniques to detect threats exploiting vulnerabilities associated with DERs and their communication networks**Huang et al., "Cybersecurity Challenges in Smart Grids"**. However, these methods are limited in their ability to identify zero-day attacks or novel intrusion strategies, which are increasingly common in smart grid environments. To address this limitation, anomaly-based IDS methods have gained significant attention**Kaplan et al., "Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection for Smart Grids"**. These systems analyze operational data to establish a baseline of normal behavior and detect deviations that may indicate malicious activity. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of anomaly-based IDS in identifying a wide range of cyber-physical attacks**Hernandez-Serrano et al., "Anomaly Detection in Energy Communities"; Alcaraz et al., "Security of SCADA Systems"**.

Autoencoders are a type of deep artificial neural network designed for unsupervised machine learning**Baldi et al., "Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection"**. They work by learning a compressed representation of normal data and reconstructing it with minimal loss. Anomalies, which deviate from the learned representation, result in higher reconstruction errors, making them detectable. In the context of smart grids, several studies**Takiddin et al., "Deep Autoencoders for Electricity Theft Detection"; Nazir et al., "Autoencoder-Based IDS for SCADA Systems"** have utilized autoencoders to identify anomalies in sensor data, control signals, and energy flows.

\subsection{Gaps and Opportunities}

While significant progress has been made in the development of intrusion detection mechanisms for smart grids in general, several gaps remain. Existing anomaly detection methods do not consider the complex interdependencies between generation, storage, and consumption**Hernandez-Serrano et al., "Anomaly Detection in Energy Communities"**. As demonstrated by our literature review, security aspects in ECs are not thoroughly studied**Garcia et al., "Energy Communities Security"**. The challenges posed by the integration of cloud-based management platforms to these ECs demand research in this direction**Alcaraz et al., "Security of SCADA Systems"**.

This work addresses these gaps by proposing an autoencoder-based IDS tailored specifically to the unique characteristics of ECs. By leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, the system can detect multiple attacks**Baldi et al., "Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection"**. Furthermore, the proposed IDS is designed to operate within the local EC infrastructure, facilitating real-time detection and response to cyber-physical threats**Hernandez-Serrano et al., "Anomaly Detection in Energy Communities"; Alcaraz et al., "Security of SCADA Systems"**. This paper builds on the insights and methodologies from previous research while extending their application to ECs, thereby contributing to the growing body of knowledge on smart grid security.
