\abstract{

%Modern power systems are increasingly relying on decentralized energy communities that integrate production, storage, distribution, and consumption. However, this shift also brings heightened risks of cyber threats.

Energy communities consist of decentralized energy production, storage, consumption, and distribution and are gaining traction in modern power systems. However, these communities may increase the vulnerability of the grid to cyber threats. We propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to enhance the security of energy communities. The system leverages deep autoencoders to detect deviations from normal operational patterns in order to identify anomalies induced by malicious activities and attacks. Operational data for training and evaluation are derived from a Simulink model of an energy community. The results show that the autoencoder-based intrusion detection system achieves good detection performance across multiple attack scenarios. We also demonstrate potential for real-world application of the system by training a federated model that enables distributed intrusion detection while preserving data privacy.

%We demonstrate potential for real-world application by training a federated model that enables distributed intrusion detection while preserving data privacy, allowing multiple energy communities to collaboratively improve their cybersecurity without sharing raw operational data.
%The work highlights the critical need of securing energy communities to enhance the reliability and stability of the electrical grid.
