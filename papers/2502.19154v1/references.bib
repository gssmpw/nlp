ABSTRACT = {Wind farms can contribute to ancillary services to the power system, by advancing and adopting new control techniques in existing, and also in new, wind turbine generator systems. One of the most important aspects of ancillary service related to wind farms is frequency regulation, which is partitioned into inertial response, primary control, and supplementary control or automatic generation control (AGC). The contribution of wind farms for the first two is well addressed in literature; however, the AGC and its associated controls require more attention. In this paper, in the first step, the contribution of wind farms in supplementary/load frequency control of AGC is overviewed. As second step, a fractional order proportional-integral-differential (FOPID) controller is proposed to control the governor speed of wind turbine to contribute to the AGC. The performance of FOPID controller is compared with classic proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control method in the frequency regulation of a two-area power system. Furthermore, the effect of penetration level of wind farms on the load frequency control is analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a brief survey of measurable factors affecting the adoption of cybersecurity enhancement methods in the smart grid is provided. From a practical point of view, it is a key point to determine to what degree the cyber resilience of power systems can be improved using cost-effective resilience enhancement methods. Numerous attempts have been made to the vital resilience of the smart grid against cyber-attacks. The recently proposed cybersecurity methods are considered in this paper, and their accuracies, computational time, and robustness against external factors in detecting and identifying False Data Injection (FDI) attacks are evaluated. There is no all-inclusive solution to fit all power systems requirements. Therefore, the recently proposed cyber-attack detection and identification methods are quantitatively compared and discussed.},

The transfer function models for various configurations of power systems are developed. For a systematic presentation of the review, the PID tuning schemes are categorised into soft computing techniques, robust control schemes, fractional order based PID design and internal model control (IMC) based PID design approaches. Due diligence has been taken to include all the design schemes. Further, the paper also enlists various future challenges that are still unresolved and can form the basis of future research work.}

ARTICLE-NUMBER = {2183},

ABSTRACT = {The Energy Internet paradigm is the evolution of the Internet of Things concept in the power system. Microgrids (MGs), as the essential element in an Energy Internet, are expected to be controlled in a corporative and flexible manner. This paper proposes a novel decentralized robust control strategy for multi-agent systems (MASs) governed MGs in future Energy Internet. The proposed controller is based on a consensus algorithm applied with the connected distributed generators (DGs) in the MGs in the energy internet paradigm. The proposed controller’s objectives are the frequency/voltage regulation and proportional reactive/active power-sharing for the hybrid DGs connected MGs. A proposed two-level communication system is implemented to explain the data exchange between the MG system and the cloud server. The local communication level utilizes the transmission control protocol (TCP)/ internet protocol (IP) and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) is used as the protocol for the global communication level. The proposed control strategy has been verified using a hypothetical hybrid DGs connected MG such as photovoltaic or wind turbines in MATLAB Simulink environment. Several scenarios based on the system load types are implemented using residential buildings and small commercial outlets. The simulation results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the introduced strategy for the MGs’ various operating conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {The rapidly growing use of cloud computing raises security concerns. This study paper seeks to examine cloud security frameworks, addressing cloud-associated issues and suggesting solutions. This research provides greater knowledge of the various frameworks, assisting in making educated decisions about selecting and implementing suitable security measures for cloud-based systems. The study begins with introducing cloud technology, its issues and frameworks to secure infrastructure, and an examination of the various cloud security frameworks available in the industry. A full comparison is performed to assess the framework’s focus, scope, approach, strength, limitations, implementation steps and tools required in the implementation process. The frameworks focused on in the paper are COBIT5, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), ISO (International Organization for Standardization), CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) STAR and AWS (Amazon Web Services) well-architected framework. Later, the study digs into identifying and analyzing prevalent cloud security issues. This contains attack vectors that are inherent in cloud settings. Plus, this part includes the risk factor of top cloud security threats and their effect on cloud platforms. Also, it presents ideas and countermeasures to reduce the observed difficulties.},

Forty articles from three different academic journals in computing research have been analysed; the results indicate that the IMRD (introduction-methods-results-discussion) pattern cannot be applied to research articles in computer science systematically. Introductory and concluding sections, however, are used in more instances. It is the central part of these articles which seems to depart more from the IMRD pattern. Detailed analyses of the structure of introductions, results, and conclusions are included, and relevant comparisons with previous studies are drawn.}

abstract = {The recast of the European Union Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) entered into force in December 2018, followed by the Internal Electricity Market Directive (IEMD) and Regulation (IEMR) as part of the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package. The RED II, that the 28 Member States have until June 2021 to transpose into national law, defines “Renewable Energy Communities” (RECs), introduces a governance model for them and the possibility of energy sharing within the REC. It also provides an “enabling framework” to put RECs on equal footing with other market players and to promote and facilitate their development. This article defines "renewable energy clusters" that are comprised of complementarity of different energy sources, flexibility, interconnectivity of different actors and bi-directionality of energy flows. We argue that RECs and RE clusters are socio-technical mirrors of the same concept, necessary in a renewable energy transition. To test how these new rules will fare in practice, drawing on a secondary dataset of 67 best-practice cases of consumer (co-)ownership from 18 countries, each project is assessed using the criteria of cluster potential, and for the extent that they meet the RED II governance requirements of heterogeneity of members and of ownership structure. Nine cases were identified as having cluster potential all of which were in rural areas. Of these, five projects were found to be both RECs and RE clusters. The absence of the governance and heterogeneity criteria is observed in projects that fall short of the cluster elements of flexibility, bi-directionality and interconnectivity, while cluster elements occur where the governance and heterogeneity criteria are met. When transposing the new rules into national law we recommend careful attention to encourage complementarity of renewables, RECs in urban contexts and “regulatory sandboxes” for experimentation to find the range of optimal preferential conditions of the “enabling framework”.}

abstract = {Although the need for energy decentralization and energy democratization has been discussed in the realms of academe for some time, the impact at policy level is yet to be seen. This is however with the notable exception, at the European level, of the Recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED-II) which aims in part to stimulate the formation of ‘renewable energy communities’ in all the Member States. The implementation at policy level remains with Member States where national policies are still overwhelmingly centralised. This creates barriers to the decentralization and democratization of energy and, ultimately, to achieving a ‘just transition’. This article therefore proposes as a way forward to recognise such renewable energy communities as legal entities to be embedded within a separate socio-legal institution (of civil energy networks), to shape (a transition towards) a just new energy system. After explaining what form this new institutional environment and the communities within would take, this article analyses this proposition in the light of the twin aims of energy decentralization and democratization to see how such forms can help achieve energy justice. It is also explained why this can only work upon an institutionally normative alignment. Following an appreciation in the light of growing research of such forms in the Netherlands, the UK and further afield, there seems to be a strong case for the proposed model. Still, realization requires clear purposive legislative steps. Such steps can only lead to ‘on the ground’ success with a coherent and multi-disciplinary institutional perspective. We aim for our research to provide a platform for such efforts.}

As information and communication technologies (ICT) developed and applied in traditional power systems, the improvement of smart grid cyber-physical-systems (CPS) increases too. IoT-based smart grid systems are critical infrastructures, also they have complex architectures and include critical devices. They contain communication systems that can lead to national security deficits, disruption of public order, loss of life or large-scale economic damage when the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the communication is broken down. These huge systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is a lot of research effort to enhance smart grid security in industry, government, and academia. The security approaches are important to improve solutions against cyber-attacks in smart grid applications. We present a comprehensive survey supported by a wide review of earlier work. Additionally, recent advances and countermeasures are presented on smart grid cyber-security. In this paper, the threats and potential solutions of the IoT-based smart grid are analyzed. We focus on cyber-attack types and provide an in-depth of the cyber-security state of the smart grid. Particularly, we concentrate on the discussion and examination of network vulnerabilities, attack countermeasures, and security requirements. We aim to supply a deep understanding of cyber-security vulnerabilities and solutions and give a guide on future research directions for cyber-security in smart grid applications.}

These structures usually have connections between power sections and cyber parts. CPPSs confront newly emerging issues including stability, resiliency, reliability, vulnerability and also security. Studying, analyzing and providing solutions to mitigate or solve these problems highly depend on accurate modeling methods and examining the interaction mechanisms associated with the cyber-security of Smart Grids (SGs). This paper aims to systematically summarize different methods and techniques and to review corresponding solution approaches in cyber-security in energy systems. In the first step, we discuss the interactive features of cyber-security; then, their modeling and mechanisms are reviewed and summarized in detail. Furthermore, the characteristics and applicability of different cyber-attack models are technically discussed and analyzed. The cutting-edge cyber security approaches such as blockchain and quantum computing in SGs and power systems are stated, and recent research directions are highlighted. The decisive problem-solving approaches and defense mechanisms are presented. Finally, some points regarding the role of cyber-security in the future of SGs are presented.}

In addition, the existing countermeasures focus on countering some specific attacks or protecting some specific components, but there is no global approach to secure the entire system. In this paper, we review the security requirements, provide descriptions of several severe cyber-attacks, and propose a cyber-security strategy to detect and counter these attacks. Lastly, we provide some future research directions.}

abstract = {Energy sustainability and environmental preservation have become worldwide concerns with the many manifestations of climate change and the continually increasing demand for energy. As cities and nations become more technologically advanced, electricity consumption rises to levels that may no longer be manageable if left unattended. The Smart Grid offers an answer to the shift to more sustainable technologies such as distributed generation and microgrids. A general public awareness and adequate attention from potential researchers and policy makers is crucial. This paper presents an overview of the Smart Grid with its general features, functionalities and characteristics. It presents the Smart Grid fundamental and related technologies and have identified the research activities, challenges and issues. It demonstrates how these technologies have shaped the modern electricity grid and continued to evolve and strengthen its role in the better alignment of energy demand and supply. Smart Grid implementation and practices in various locations are also unveiled. Concrete energy policies facilitate Smart Grid initiatives across the nations. Interestingly, Smart Grid practices in different regions barely indicate competition but rather an unbordered community of similar aspirations and shared lessons.}

SCADA systems have become an essential part of automated control and monitoring of Critical Infrastructures (CI). Modern SCADA systems have evolved from standalone systems into sophisticated, complex, open systems connected to the Internet. This geographically distributed modern SCADA system is more vulnerable to threats and cyber attacks than traditional SCADA. Traditional SCADA systems were less exposed to Internet threats as they operated on isolated networks. Over the years, an increase in the number of cyber-attacks against the SCADA systems seeks security researchers’ attention towards their security. In this review paper, we first review the SCADA system architectures and comparative analysis of proposed/implemented communication protocols, followed by attacks on such systems to understand and highlight the evolving security needs for SCADA systems. A short investigation of the current state of intrusion detection techniques in SCADA systems is done, followed by a brief study of testbeds for SCADA systems. The cloud and Internet of things (IoT) based SCADA systems are studied by analyzing modern SCADA systems’ architecture. In the end, the review paper highlights the critical research problems that need to be resolved to close the security gaps in SCADA systems.}

ABSTRACT = {The smart grid system is one of the key infrastructures required to sustain our future society. It is a complex system that comprises two independent parts: power grids and communication networks. There have been several cyber attacks on smart grid systems in recent years that have caused significant consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity training specific to the smart grid system is essential in order to handle these security issues adequately. Unfortunately, concepts related to automation, ICT, smart grids, and other physical sectors are typically not covered by conventional training and education methods. These cybersecurity experiences can be achieved by conducting training using a smart grid co-simulation, which is the integration of at least two simulation models. However, there has been little effort to research attack simulation tools for smart grids. In this research, we first review the existing research in the field, and then propose a smart grid attack co-simulation framework called GridAttackSim based on the combination of GridLAB-D, ns-3, and FNCS. The proposed architecture allows us to simulate smart grid infrastructure features with various cybersecurity attacks and then visualize their consequences automatically. Furthermore, the simulator not only features a set of built-in attack profiles but also enables scientists and electric utilities interested in improving smart grid security to design new ones. Case studies were conducted to validate the key functionalities of the proposed framework. The simulation results are supported by relevant works in the field, and the system can potentially be deployed for cybersecurity training and research.},

abstract = {The increasing integration of renewable energy resources requires so-called smart grid services for monitoring, control and automation tasks. Simulation environments are vital for evaluating and developing innovative solutions and algorithms. Especially in smart energy systems, we face a variety of heterogeneous simulators representing, e.g., power grids, analysis or control components and markets. The co-simulation framework mosaik can be used to orchestrate the data exchange and time synchronization between individual simulators. So far, the underlying communication infrastructure has often been assumed to be optimal and therefore, the influence of e.g., communication delays has been neglected. This paper presents the first results of the project cosima, which aims at connecting the communication simulator OMNeT++ to the co-simulation framework mosaik to analyze the resilience and robustness of smart grid services, e.g., multi-agent-based services with respect to adaptivity, scalability, extensibility and usability. This facilitates simulations with realistic communication technologies (such as 5G) and the analysis of dynamic communication characteristics by simulating multiple messages. We show the functionality and benefits of cosima in experiments with 50 agents.},

  abstract={The smart electricity grids have been evolving to a more complex cyber-physical ecosystem of infrastructures with integrated communication networks, new carbon-free sources of power generation, advanced monitoring and control systems, and a myriad of emerging modern physical hardware technologies. With the unprecedented complexity and heterogeneity in dynamic smart grid networks comes additional vulnerability to emerging threats such as cyber attacks. Rapid development and deployment of advanced network monitoring and communication systems on one hand, and the growing interdependence of the electric power grids to a multitude of lifeline critical infrastructures on the other, calls for holistic defense strategies to safeguard the power grids against cyber adversaries. In order to improve the resilience of the power grid against adversarial attacks and cyber intrusions, advancements should be sought on detection techniques, protection plans, and mitigation practices in all electricity generation, transmission, and distribution sectors. This survey discusses such major directions and recent advancements from a lens of different detection techniques, equipment protection plans, and mitigation strategies to enhance the energy delivery infrastructure resilience and operational endurance against cyber attacks. This undertaking is essential since even modest improvements in resilience of the power grid against cyber threats could lead to sizeable monetary savings and an enriched overall social welfare.},

    ABSTRACT = {Networked control systems (NCSs) are attracting the attention of control system engineers. The NCS has created a paradigm shift in control system technology. An NCS consists of control loops joined through communication networks in which both the control signal and the feedback signal are exchanged between the system and the controller. However, its materialization faces several challenges as it requires the integration of advanced control and communication techniques. This paper presents an extensive review of NCSs from the perspective of control system design. The evolution of NCSs is broadly divided in three phases, namely NCSs prior to 2000, NCSs during 2001–2010, and NCSs from 2011 onwards. This division corresponds to the initial status, intermediate status, and the recent status of the developments in the design of NCSs. The advancement of different control techniques during these phases has been discussed comprehensively. This paper also describes the transition of control systems form continuous domain to networked domain, which makes it better than the traditional control systems. Some important practical applications, which have been implemented using NCSs, have also been discussed. The thrust areas for future research on NCS have also been identified.},

ABSTRACT = {Wind farms can contribute to ancillary services to the power system, by advancing and adopting new control techniques in existing, and also in new, wind turbine generator systems. One of the most important aspects of ancillary service related to wind farms is frequency regulation, which is partitioned into inertial response, primary control, and supplementary control or automatic generation control (AGC). The contribution of wind farms for the first two is well addressed in literature; however, the AGC and its associated controls require more attention. In this paper, in the first step, the contribution of wind farms in supplementary/load frequency control of AGC is overviewed. As second step, a fractional order proportional-integral-differential (FOPID) controller is proposed to control the governor speed of wind turbine to contribute to the AGC. The performance of FOPID controller is compared with classic proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control method in the frequency regulation of a two-area power system. Furthermore, the effect of penetration level of wind farms on the load frequency control is analyzed.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a brief survey of measurable factors affecting the adoption of cybersecurity enhancement methods in the smart grid is provided. From a practical point of view, it is a key point to determine to what degree the cyber resilience of power systems can be improved using cost-effective resilience enhancement methods. Numerous attempts have been made to the vital resilience of the smart grid against cyber-attacks. The recently proposed cybersecurity methods are considered in this paper, and their accuracies, computational time, and robustness against external factors in detecting and identifying False Data Injection (FDI) attacks are evaluated. There is no all-inclusive solution to fit all power systems requirements. Therefore, the recently proposed cyber-attack detection and identification methods are quantitatively compared and discussed.},

ABSTRACT = {The Energy Internet paradigm is the evolution of the Internet of Things concept in the power system. Microgrids (MGs), as the essential element in an Energy Internet, are expected to be controlled in a corporative and flexible manner. This paper proposes a novel decentralized robust control strategy for multi-agent systems (MASs) governed MGs in future Energy Internet. The proposed controller is based on a consensus algorithm applied with the connected distributed generators (DGs) in the MGs in the energy internet paradigm. The proposed controller’s objectives are the frequency/voltage regulation and proportional reactive/active power-sharing for the hybrid DGs connected MGs. A proposed two-level communication system is implemented to explain the data exchange between the MG system and the cloud server. The local communication level utilizes the transmission control protocol (TCP)/ internet protocol (IP) and the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) is used as the protocol for the global communication level. The proposed control strategy has been verified using a hypothetical hybrid DGs connected MG such as photovoltaic or wind turbines in MATLAB Simulink environment. Several scenarios based on the system load types are implemented using residential buildings and small commercial outlets. The simulation results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the introduced strategy for the MGs’ various operating conditions.},

Forty articles from three different academic journals in computing research have been analysed; the results indicate that the IMRD (introduction-methods-results-discussion) pattern cannot be applied to research articles in computer science systematically. Introductory and concluding sections, however, are used in more instances. It is the central part of these articles which seems to depart more from the IMRD pattern. Detailed analyses of the structure of introductions, results, and conclusions are included, and relevant comparisons with previous studies are drawn.}

abstract = {The recast of the European Union Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) entered into force in December 2018, followed by the Internal Electricity Market Directive (IEMD) and Regulation (IEMR) as part of the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package. The RED II, that the 28 Member States have until June 2021 to transpose into national law, defines “Renewable Energy Communities” (RECs), introduces a governance model for them and the possibility of energy sharing within the REC. It also provides an “enabling framework” to put RECs on equal footing with other market players and to promote and facilitate their development. This article defines "renewable energy clusters" that are comprised of complementarity of different energy sources, flexibility, interconnectivity of different actors and bi-directionality of energy flows. We argue that RECs and RE clusters are socio-technical mirrors of the same concept, necessary in a renewable energy transition. To test how these new rules will fare in practice, drawing on a secondary dataset of 67 best-practice cases of consumer (co-)ownership from 18 countries, each project is assessed using the criteria of cluster potential, and for the extent that they meet the RED II governance requirements of heterogeneity of members and of ownership structure. Nine cases were identified as having cluster potential all of which were in rural areas. Of these, five projects were found to be both RECs and RE clusters. The absence of the governance and heterogeneity criteria is observed in projects that fall short of the cluster elements of flexibility, bi-directionality and interconnectivity, while cluster elements occur where the governance and heterogeneity criteria are met. When transposing the new rules into national law we recommend careful attention to encourage complementarity of renewables, RECs in urban contexts and “regulatory sandboxes” for experimentation to find the range of optimal preferential conditions of the “enabling framework”.}

abstract = {Although the need for energy decentralization and energy democratization has been discussed in the realms of academe for some time, the impact at policy level is yet to be seen. This is however with the notable exception, at the European level, of the Recast Renewable Energy Directive (RED-II) which aims in part to stimulate the formation of ‘renewable energy communities’ in all the Member States. The implementation at policy level remains with Member States where national policies are still overwhelmingly centralised. This creates barriers to the decentralization and democratization of energy and, ultimately, to achieving a ‘just transition’. This article therefore proposes as a way forward to recognise such renewable energy communities as legal entities to be embedded within a separate socio-legal institution (of civil energy networks), to shape (a transition towards) a just new energy system. After explaining what form this new institutional environment and the communities within would take, this article analyses this proposition in the light of the twin aims of energy decentralization and democratization to see how such forms can help achieve energy justice. It is also explained why this can only work upon an institutionally normative alignment. Following an appreciation in the light of growing research of such forms in the Netherlands, the UK and further afield, there seems to be a strong case for the proposed model. Still, realization requires clear purposive legislative steps. Such steps can only lead to ‘on the ground’ success with a coherent and multi-disciplinary institutional perspective. We aim for our research to provide a platform for such efforts.}

As information and communication technologies (ICT) developed and applied in traditional power systems, the improvement of smart grid cyber-physical-systems (CPS) increases too. IoT-based smart grid systems are critical infrastructures, also they have complex architectures and include critical devices. They contain communication systems that can lead to national security deficits, disruption of public order, loss of life or large-scale economic damage when the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the communication is broken down. These huge systems may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Therefore, there is a lot of research effort to enhance smart grid security in industry, government, and academia. The security approaches are important to improve solutions against cyber-attacks in smart grid applications. We present a comprehensive survey supported by a wide review of earlier work. Additionally, recent advances and countermeasures are presented on smart grid cyber-security. In this paper, the threats and potential solutions of the IoT-based smart grid are analyzed. We focus on cyber-attack types and provide an in-depth of the cyber-security state of the smart grid. Particularly, we concentrate on the discussion and examination of network vulnerabilities, attack countermeasures, and security requirements.

abstract = {Smart grid uses the power of information technology to intelligently deliver energy by using a two-way communication and wisely meet the environmental requirements by facilitating the integration of green technologies. The inherent weakness of communication technology has exposed the system to numerous security threats. Several survey papers have discussed these problems and their countermeasures. However, most of these papers classified attacks based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but they excluded the accountability. In addition, the existing countermeasures focus on countering some specific attacks or protecting some specific components, but there is no global approach to secure the entire system. In this paper, we review the security requirements, provide descriptions of several severe cyber-attacks, and propose a cyber-security strategy to detect and counter these attacks. Lastly, we provide some future research directions.}

abstract = {Energy sustainability and environmental preservation have become worldwide concerns with the many manifestations of climate change and the continually increasing demand for energy. As cities and nations become more technologically advanced, electricity consumption rises to levels that may no longer be manageable if left unattended. The Smart Grid offers an answer to the shift to more sustainable technologies such as distributed generation and microgrids. A general public awareness and adequate attention from potential researchers and policy makers is crucial. This paper presents an overview of the Smart Grid with its general features, functionalities and characteristics. It presents the Smart Grid fundamental and related technologies and have identified the research activities, challenges and issues. It demonstrates how these technologies have shaped the modern electricity grid and continued to evolve and strengthen its role in the better alignment of energy demand and supply. Smart Grid implementation and practices in various locations are also unveiled. Concrete energy policies facilitate Smart Grid initiatives across the nations. Interestingly, Smart Grid practices in different regions barely indicate competition but rather an unbordered community of similar aspirations and shared lessons.}

SCADA systems have become an essential part of automated control and monitoring of Critical Infrastructures (CI). Modern SCADA systems have evolved from standalone systems into sophisticated, complex, open systems connected to the Internet. This geographically distributed modern SCADA system is more vulnerable to threats and cyber attacks than traditional SCADA. Traditional SCADA systems were less exposed to Internet threats as they operated on isolated networks. Over the years, an increase in the number of cyber-attacks against the SCADA systems seeks security researchers’ attention towards their security. In this review paper, we first review the SCADA system architectures and comparative analysis of proposed/implemented communication protocols, followed by attacks on such systems to understand and highlight the evolving security needs for SCADA systems. A short investigation of the current state of intrusion detection techniques in SCADA systems is done, followed by a brief study of testbeds for SCADA systems. The cloud and Internet of things (IoT) based SCADA systems are studied by analyzing modern SCADA systems’ architecture. In the end, the review paper highlights the critical research problems that need to be resolved to close the security gaps in SCADA systems.}

ABSTRACT = {The smart grid system is one of the key infrastructures required to sustain our future society. It is a complex system that comprises two independent parts: power grids and communication networks. There have been several cyber attacks on smart grid systems in recent years that have caused significant consequences. Therefore, cybersecurity training specific to the smart grid system is essential in order to handle these security issues adequately. Unfortunately, concepts related to automation, ICT, smart grids, and other physical sectors are typically not covered by conventional training and education methods. These cybersecurity experiences can be achieved by conducting training using a smart grid co-simulation, which is the integration of at least two simulation models. However, there has been little effort to research attack simulation tools for smart grids. In this research, we first review the existing research in the field, and then propose a smart grid attack co-simulation framework called GridAttackSim based on the combination of GridLAB-D, ns-3, and FNCS. The proposed architecture allows us to simulate smart grid infrastructure features with various cybersecurity attacks and then visualize their consequences automatically. Furthermore, the simulator not only features a set of built-in attack profiles but also enables scientists and electric utilities interested in improving smart grid security to design new ones. Case studies were conducted to validate the key functionalities of the proposed framework. The simulation results are supported by relevant works in the field, and the system can potentially be deployed for cybersecurity training and research.},

abstract = {The increasing integration of renewable energy resources requires so-called smart grid services for monitoring, control and automation tasks. Simulation environments are vital for evaluating and developing innovative solutions and algorithms. Especially in smart energy systems, we face a variety of heterogeneous simulators representing, e.g., power grids, analysis or control components and markets. The co-simulation framework mosaik can be used to orchestrate the data exchange and time synchronization between individual simulators. So far, the underlying communication infrastructure has often been assumed to be optimal and therefore, the influence of e.g., communication delays has been neglected. This paper presents the first results of the project cosima, which aims at connecting the communication simulator OMNeT++ to the co-simulation framework mosaik to analyze the resilience and robustness of smart grid services, e.g., multi-agent-based services with respect to adaptivity, scalability, extensibility and usability. This facilitates simulations with realistic communication technologies (such as 5G) and the analysis of dynamic communication characteristics by simulating multiple messages. We show the functionality and benefits of cosima in experiments with 50 agents.},

  abstract={The smart electricity grids have been evolving to a more complex cyber-physical ecosystem of infrastructures with integrated communication networks, new carbon-free sources of power generation, advanced monitoring and control systems, and a myriad of emerging modern physical hardware technologies. With the unprecedented complexity and heterogeneity in dynamic smart grid networks comes additional vulnerability to emerging threats such as cyber attacks. Rapid development and deployment of advanced network monitoring and communication systems on one hand, and the growing interdependence of the electric power grids to a multitude of lifeline critical infrastructures on the other, calls for holistic defense strategies to safeguard the power grids against cyber adversaries. In order to improve the resilience of the power grid against adversarial attacks and cyber intrusions, advancements should be sought on detection techniques, protection plans, and mitigation practices in all electricity generation, transmission, and distribution sectors. This survey discusses such major directions and recent advancements from a lens of different detection techniques, equipment protection plans, and mitigation strategies to enhance the energy delivery infrastructure resilience and operational endurance against cyber attacks. This undertaking is essential since even modest improvements in resilience of the power grid against cyber threats could lead to sizeable monetary savings and an enriched overall social welfare.},

    ABSTRACT = {Networked control systems (NCSs) are attracting the attention of control system engineers. The NCS has created a paradigm shift in control system technology. An NCS consists of control loops joined through communication networks in which both the control signal and the feedback signal are exchanged between the system and the controller. However, its materialization faces several challenges as it requires the integration of advanced control and communication techniques. This paper presents an extensive review of NCSs from the perspective of control system design. The evolution of NCSs is broadly divided in three phases, namely NCSs prior to 2000, NCSs during 2001–2010, and NCSs from 2011 onwards. This division corresponds to the initial status, intermediate status, and the recent status of the developments in the design of NCSs. The advancement of different control techniques during these phases has been discussed comprehensively. This paper also describes the transition of control systems form continuous domain to networked domain, which makes it better than the traditional control systems. Some important practical applications, which have been implemented using NCSs, have also been discussed. The thrust areas for future research on NCS have also been identified.},

Electrochemical energy storage system, i.e., battery system, exhibits high potential for grid energy storage application. A battery energy storage system is comprised of a battery module and a power conversion module. This paper starts by reviewing several potential battery systems, as well as an advanced aluminum-ion battery that currently has promising prospects in the electrochemical energy storage system. The characteristics of the batteries are reviewed and compared, including the materials, electrochemistry, performance and costs. The application prospect of the batteries is discussed. The paper summarizes the features of current and future grid energy storage battery, lists the advantages and disadvantages of different types of batteries, and points out that the performance and capacity of large-scale battery energy storage system depend on battery and power condition system (PCS). The power conversion system determines the operational condition of the entire energy storage system. The new generation wide bandgap semiconductor for power electronic technology is discussed from the perspective of performance, topology, model and non-linearity and is compared to the traditional silicon-based semiconductor. Finally, the application prospect of the new generation semiconductor technology in the energy storage system is indicated. This paper concludes the application status of the energy storage system in the renewable energy power generation and indicates the critical problems that need to be addressed during the construction and operation of the storage system.}
