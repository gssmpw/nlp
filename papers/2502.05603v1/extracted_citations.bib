  abstract = "Sifting through vast textual data and summarizing key information
              from electronic health records (EHR) imposes a substantial burden
              on how clinicians allocate their time. Although large language
              models (LLMs) have shown immense promise in natural language
              processing (NLP) tasks, their efficacy on a diverse range of
              clinical summarization tasks has not yet been rigorously
              demonstrated. In this work, we apply domain adaptation methods to
              eight LLMs, spanning six datasets and four distinct clinical
              summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions,
              progress notes, and doctor-patient dialogue. Our thorough
              quantitative assessment reveals trade-offs between models and
              adaptation methods in addition to instances where recent advances
              in LLMs may not improve results. Further, in a clinical reader
              study with ten physicians, we show that summaries from our
              best-adapted LLMs are preferable to human summaries in terms of
              completeness and correctness. Our ensuing qualitative analysis
              highlights challenges faced by both LLMs and human experts.
              Lastly, we correlate traditional quantitative NLP metrics with
              reader study scores to enhance our understanding of how these
              metrics align with physician preferences. Our research marks the
              first evidence of LLMs outperforming human experts in clinical
              text summarization across multiple tasks. This implies that
              integrating LLMs into clinical workflows could alleviate
              documentation burden, empowering clinicians to focus more on
              personalized patient care and the inherently human aspects of
              medicine.",
