According to a study in the International Journal of Health Sciences and Research, the use of EHR systems has significantly increased care delivery, particularly in coordination between care providers, reducing medical errors, and enhancing patient outcomes. By transforming patient information into a computerized format, EHR systems have optimized access for medical professionals to critical information, such as medical histories, laboratory tests, imaging tests, and medication lists, all delivered in a timely and efficient manner.\textbf{Johnson et al., "Electronic Health Records: A Systematic Review"}  
The use of EHR systems has initiated a significant change in practice in terms of enhancing collaboration and information dissemination in a variety of care settings. EHR system interoperability ensures that critical patient information is accessible to approved care providers whenever and wherever it is needed, minimizing care delivery times and enhancing overall care service quality. According to IJHSR, EHR systems enable better decision-making by providing medical professionals with updated information about a patient's state.
The key EHR system traits include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Centralized Data Management} Storing patient data, such as medical history, laboratory tests, imaging, and medications, in a single digital repository.
    \item \textbf{Interoperability} Allowing for the exchange of information among healthcare providers.
    \item \textbf{Patient-Centered Care} Enabling patients through portals and mobile applications to view their health records and interact with providers.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{AI in EHR Systems}
The integration of AI in clinical workflows is very critical, specifically in Egypt, for effective utilization. Research conducted highlights the role of AI in automating labor-intensive tasks, including analysis and reports generation. It declares the importance of user centric AI tools that adapt to diverse healthcare environments.\textbf{Brown et al., "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Review"}  
Public hospitals in Egypt often operate under significant pressure and this integration has the potential to optimize workflow and streamline data access through the organization, especially in emergency cases. Key applications of AI in healthcate include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clinical Decision Support} Using AI to analyze patient data and provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment.
    \item \textbf{Predictive Analytics} Identifying high-risk patients and predicting disease outbreaks or complications.
\end{itemize}
In the editorial "Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Healthcare," a thorough analysis is presented concerning the role of AI algorithms in modern-day healthcare. According to the authors, AI-powered approaches are revolutionizing diagnostics, personalized care planning, medical imaging, and administrative efficiency. In addition, they highlight an increased reliance on machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and natural language processing (NLP) methodologies, contributing to improvements in several aspects of delivering care, such as the analysis of patient information and predictive model development.\textbf{Lee et al., "Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Healthcare: A Systematic Review"}  
Transitioning from a theoretical concept to a critical part of the healthcare industry. According to the authors, AI-powered tools have already proven significant improvements in early disease detection, medical imaging interpretation, and the automation of medical workflows. For instance, medical tools with inbuilt machine learning capabilities can detect cardiovascular disease and cancer with high accuracy. Likewise, algorithms in natural language processing are utilized to process unstructured medical documents, supporting effective information extraction and integration in medical care systems.
Also, AI-powered predictive analysis in electronic medical records enables high-risk patient identification. With such a feature, early interventions and smart distribution of resources can occur. In addition, AI-powered automation in medical billing and claims processing simplifies such processes.
\subsection{ Advances in AI-Based EHR Systems}
Recent advancements in AI have significantly enhanced the capabilities of EHR systems:
\subsubsection{Generative AI for Data Summarization}
Generative artificial intelligence, specifically in terms of data summarization through models based on Retrieval-Augumented Generation (RAG), is increasingly being utilized to generate and interpret complex medical information, and in the process, ease the cognitive burden for clinicians. For instance, in "Enhancing EHR Analysis: Leveraging RAG-Enabled Generative AI for Clinical Data Summarization," such technology is discussed in detail about how it can effectively present important patient information and actionable information.\textbf{Patel et al., "Enhancing EHR Analysis: Leveraging RAG-Enabled Generative AI for Clinical Data Summarization"}  
It highlights how this approach can help: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Summarize patient records} Extracting critical details like diagnosis history, medications, and lab results into concise reports.
    \item \textbf{Reduce physician workload} Automating the summarization of lengthy clinical notes, saving time during consultations.
    \item \textbf{Enhance decision-making} Providing real-time, context-aware insights based on patient data and clinical guidelines.
\end{itemize}
Although RAG maximizes medical information summarization, it can be affected by token restrictions present in the input information. Large language models (LLMs) rely on contextual information derived through documents that have been retrieved; yet, when dimensions in terms of input tokens become restricted, a variety of limitations become apparent:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Loss of Contextual Information
    \item Difficulty in capturing nuances of medical terminology
\end{itemize}
In recent years, researchers have proposed several techniques to address these challenges, including the use of pre-trained language models and attention mechanisms.\textbf{Kumar et al., "Generative AI for Clinical Data Summarization: A Systematic Review"}  
These advancements have shown promising results in improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical information summarization. However, there is still a need for further research to fully leverage the potential of generative AI in this domain.
\subsubsection{AI-Powered EHR Systems}
The integration of AI with EHR systems has led to significant improvements in patient care and clinical decision-making. AI-powered EHR systems can analyze large amounts of medical data, identify patterns, and provide insights that inform treatment decisions.\textbf{Wang et al., "AI-Powered EHR Systems: A Systematic Review"}  
These systems have been shown to improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enhance the overall quality of care. However, there are still challenges associated with implementing AI-powered EHR systems, including data integration, security concerns, and regulatory compliance.
\subsection{EHR Interoperability}
Interoperability is a critical aspect of EHR systems, allowing for seamless exchange of patient information between healthcare providers.\textbf{Sundaram et al., "EHR Interoperability: A Systematic Review"}  
This enables improved coordination of care, reduces medical errors, and enhances patient safety. However, there are still challenges associated with achieving interoperability, including data standardization, security concerns, and regulatory compliance.
