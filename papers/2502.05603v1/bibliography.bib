	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology, particularly pretrained machine learning models, holds promise for overcoming image interpretation complexities and improving diagnostic accuracy. Although extensive research highlights their potential, challenges remain in adapting these models for generalizability across diverse medical image modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Computed Tomography (CT), and X-rays. Most importantly, limited generalizability across image modalities hinders their real-world application in diverse medical settings. This study addresses this gap by investigating the effectiveness of pretrained models in interpreting diverse medical images. We evaluated ten state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including ConvNeXtBase, EfficientNetB7, VGG architectures (VGG16, VGG19), and InceptionResNetV2, for their ability to classify multimodal medical images from brain MRI, kidney CT, and chest X-ray (CXR) scans. Our evaluation reveals VGG16{\textquoteright}s superior generalizability across diverse modalities, achieving accuracies of 96\% for brain MRI, 100\% for kidney CT, and 95\% for CXR. Conversely, EfficientNetB7 excelled in brain MRI with 96\% accuracy but showed limited generalizability to kidney CT (56\% accuracy) and CXR (33\% accuracy), suggesting its potential specialization for MRI tasks. Future research should enhance the generalizability of pretrained models across diverse medical image modalities. This includes exploring hybrid models, advanced training techniques, and utilizing larger, more diverse datasets. Integrating multimodal information, such as combining imaging data with patient history, can further improve diagnostic accuracy. These efforts are crucial for deploying robust AI systems in real-world medical settings, ultimately improving patient outcomes.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThe author(s) received no specific funding for this work.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.Not ApplicableThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Centre of Excellence for Data Science, AI and Modelling, University of Hull, UKI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.Not ApplicableI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

  abstract = "Sifting through vast textual data and summarizing key information
              from electronic health records (EHR) imposes a substantial burden
              on how clinicians allocate their time. Although large language
              models (LLMs) have shown immense promise in natural language
              processing (NLP) tasks, their efficacy on a diverse range of
              clinical summarization tasks has not yet been rigorously
              demonstrated. In this work, we apply domain adaptation methods to
              eight LLMs, spanning six datasets and four distinct clinical
              summarization tasks: radiology reports, patient questions,
              progress notes, and doctor-patient dialogue. Our thorough
              quantitative assessment reveals trade-offs between models and
              adaptation methods in addition to instances where recent advances
              in LLMs may not improve results. Further, in a clinical reader
              study with ten physicians, we show that summaries from our
              best-adapted LLMs are preferable to human summaries in terms of
              completeness and correctness. Our ensuing qualitative analysis
              highlights challenges faced by both LLMs and human experts.
              Lastly, we correlate traditional quantitative NLP metrics with
              reader study scores to enhance our understanding of how these
              metrics align with physician preferences. Our research marks the
              first evidence of LLMs outperforming human experts in clinical
              text summarization across multiple tasks. This implies that
              integrating LLMs into clinical workflows could alleviate
              documentation burden, empowering clinicians to focus more on
              personalized patient care and the inherently human aspects of
              medicine.",
