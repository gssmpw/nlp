\begin{abstract}
The integration of workflows with large language models (LLMs) enables LLM-based agents to execute predefined procedures, enhancing automation in real-world applications. Traditional \textit{rule-based} methods tend to limit the inherent \textit{flexibility} of LLMs, as their predefined execution paths restrict the models' action space, particularly when the unexpected, out-of-workflow (OOW) queries are encountered. Conversely, \textit{prompt-based} methods allow LLMs to fully control the flow, which can lead to diminished enforcement of procedural \textit{compliance}. 
To address these challenges, we introduce \model, a novel agent framework designed to maintain both compliance and flexibility. We propose the Procedure Description Language (PDL), which combines the adaptability of natural language with the precision of code to formulate workflows. Building on PDL, we develop a comprehensive framework that empowers LLMs to manage OOW queries effectively, while keeping the execution path under the supervision of a set of controllers. Additionally, we present a new evaluation methodology to rigorously assess an LLM agent's ability to handle OOW scenarios, going beyond routine flow compliance tested in existing benchmarks. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that \model not only adheres to workflows but also effectively manages OOW queries, highlighting its dual strengths in compliance and flexibility.

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we reviewed existing LLM-based workflow methods and compared their strengths and weaknesses in terms of compliance and flexibility. Aiming to enhance the compliance capability of LLMs without significantly compromising their flexibility, we proposed the PDL syntax to express workflows and used the \model framework to control agent behavior. For evaluating compliance and flexibility capabilities, we constructed datasets based on existing data and designed specific evaluation methods. Experiments on three datasets demonstrated that \model not only possesses strong compliance capabilities but also exhibits robust flexibility when handling out-of-workflow queries. 

\section{Limitations} \label{sec:limitattions}

We acknowledges two primary limitations:

\paragraph{Workflow Generation} Our current research emphasizes enhancing LLM performance within manually constructed workflows using the PDL syntax. Consequently, the evaluation is limited to these artificially defined settings, lacking exploration of automated workflow generation \citep{WorFBench,AFlow}. Future work should investigate dynamic workflow synthesis to adapt to varying and complex user demands without manual intervention.

\paragraph{Dialogue Diversity and Evaluation} While this study evaluates agent performance in OOW scenarios using simulated user interactions, the real-world applicability relies on testing across a broader spectrum of authentic user demands.
