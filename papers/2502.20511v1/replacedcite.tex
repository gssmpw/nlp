\section{Related Work}
Early attempts in foot modeling relied on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ____, but these models were simplistic, offering limited resolution and flexibility. Later approaches employ active sensor technologies, where structured light or depth cameras are used to generate point clouds ____. However, the point cloud geometries obtained from these sensors are often noisy and incomplete. More recently, Boyne et al. proposed the FIND model ____ leveraging a template deformation strategy guided by an implicit neural network to improve reconstruction accuracy. 
Similarly, Osman et al. ____ developed SUPR, a PCA-based human foot model designed for seamless integration with the SMPL full-body model ____, enabling expressive and anatomically consistent reconstructions. However, both FIND and SUPR are limited by their training data, which strongly constrains the shape space.
Our method, draws inspiration from multi-view reconstruction ____ and shape completion ____, both of which have proven effective in broader 3D reconstruction tasks. By leveraging these advancements, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing works, providing a more robust and generalizable solution for foot reconstruction.
