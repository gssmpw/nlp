\section{Related Work}
Early attempts in foot modeling relied on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) **Amaral, "3D Human Body Modeling"** but these models were simplistic, offering limited resolution and flexibility. Later approaches employ active sensor technologies, where structured light or depth cameras are used to generate point clouds **Newcombe et al., "KinectFusion: Real-time Dense Surface Mapping and Tracking"**. However, the point cloud geometries obtained from these sensors are often noisy and incomplete. More recently, Boyne et al. proposed the FIND model **Boyne, "Implicit Neural Representations for Personalized Foot Modeling"** leveraging a template deformation strategy guided by an implicit neural network to improve reconstruction accuracy. 
Similarly, Osman et al. **Osman, "Single Image-Based Human Body Model Reconstruction"** developed SUPR, a PCA-based human foot model designed for seamless integration with the SMPL full-body model **Loper et al., "SMPL: A Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model"**, enabling expressive and anatomically consistent reconstructions. However, both FIND and SUPR are limited by their training data, which strongly constrains the shape space.
Our method, draws inspiration from multi-view reconstruction **Furukawa et al., "Multi-View Stereo for Community Photo Collections"** and shape completion **Bao et al., "Deep Learning of Local Shape Properties for 3D Point Cloud Completion"**, both of which have proven effective in broader 3D reconstruction tasks. By leveraging these advancements, our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing works, providing a more robust and generalizable solution for foot reconstruction.
