\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis stage estimation from multi-sequence MRI. Cirrhosis is the severe scarring (fibrosis) of the liver and a common endpoint of various chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent complications such as decompensation and cancer, which significantly decreases life expectancy. However, diagnosing cirrhosis in its early stages is challenging, and patients often present with life-threatening complications. Our approach integrates multi-scale feature learning with sequence-specific attention mechanisms to capture subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis progression stages. Using \textit{CirrMRI600+}, a large-scale publicly available dataset of 628 high-resolution MRI scans from 339 patients, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in three-stage cirrhosis classification. Our best model achieves 72.8\% accuracy on T1W and 63.8\% on T2W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics-based approaches. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that our architecture effectively learns stage-specific imaging biomarkers. We establish new benchmarks for automated cirrhosis staging and provide insights for developing clinically applicable deep learning systems.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Cirrhosis and its devastating complications present a significant global health challenge with rising mortality rates~\cite{wang2023remodeling,huang2023global}. Responsible for nearly one and a half million deaths annually worldwide, cirrhosis accounts for 2.4\% of all global fatalities~\cite{huang2023global,liu2019wjg}. Over the past two decades, mortality rates have increased by 26.4\%, disproportionately affecting younger populations aged 25 to 34 years~\cite{lee2024designing}. The year following a diagnosis of cirrhosis is when individuals are most vulnerable, highlighting the importance of early detection and intervention~\cite{daher2022proportion}. The most decisive prognostic factor for survival is the presence or absence of hepatic decompensation, as progression to decompensation significantly increases medical costs and mortality rates~\cite{sepanlou2020global,lee2023evolution}. Approximately 11\% of individuals with compensated cirrhosis experience new decompensations each year, and this progression is associated with a decline in median survival from 12 years to less than 2 years~\cite{lee2023evolution}.  Moreover, liver cancer ranks among the top six most common cancers worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer death~\cite{sung2021global}. HCC accounts for approximately 80\% of liver cancer cases, with 80\%-90\% of individuals with HCC having underlying cirrhosis~\cite{yang2019global,fattovich2004hepatocellular}. Therefore, early detection and accurate staging of cirrhosis are crucial for preventing complications and ensuring effective disease management and treatment planning.

Cirrhosis is characterized by the gradual replacement of healthy liver tissue with irreversible scarring or fibrosis due to various chronic liver diseases~\cite{ullah2023biological}.  The liver shows no significant morphological changes during the early stages of cirrhosis. As a result, diagnosing cirrhosis at an early stage is difficult and is often missed, even by expert specialists. If the diagnosis is missed in the early stages and the disease progresses, it results in various complications that severely affect patient outcomes~\cite{premkumar2022overview}. Traditional diagnosis methods rely on clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and ultrasound imaging, which restrict their ability to identify subtle tissue changes. In contrast, MRI provides higher image quality and improved accuracy for diagnosing cirrhosis and assessing its stages, allowing physicians to evaluate the liverâ€™s structure and tissue changes with precision.

As early diagnosis of cirrhosis remains challenging, AI-driven models offer a promising solution for early detection, stage estimation, and predicting disease progression. However, well-curated MRI datasets for cirrhosis are still insufficient, which restricts advanced image analysis methods such as radiomics and deep learning, which require large amounts of data~\cite{hantze2024mrsegmentator}. To bridge this gap, a large-scale multi-sequence MRI dataset, \textit{CirrMRI600+}, has been created for liver cirrhosis research~\cite{jha2024cirrmri600+}. This dataset aims to enhance the application of deep learning in analyzing cirrhosis and its stages, improve early-stage diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice, enhance patient outcomes, and encourage further research.



Our work addresses these challenges through a comprehensive deep learning framework specifically designed for multi-sequence MRI analysis. Given an input MRI scan $X$ comprising T1W and T2W sequences, we develop a mapping function $f_\theta$ that estimates the cirrhosis stage $y$ while accounting for the complementary information present across sequences. The framework incorporates sequence-specific feature extraction, cross-sequence attention mechanisms, and a unified classification architecture. The technical contributions of our work advance the field in several key directions: 


\begin{itemize}
\item To our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis staging using multi-sequence MRI data. While previous studies have explored either radiomics features or limited deep learning approaches for cirrhosis detection, none have systematically addressed the challenging task of accurate stage estimation across a large-scale, multi-center dataset. Our work bridges this critical gap by introducing an end-to-end framework that not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also provides interpretable insights into stage-specific imaging biomarkers.
%\item   \textbf{Cirrhosis stage estimation using MRI:} Existing studies on liver cirrhosis using MRI image analysis are limited by the scarcity of available MRI datasets. This gap hinders the advancement of advanced analysis methods that require large amounts of data, such as deep learning. Using a large-scale MRI dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of radiomics and deep learning in assessing the stages of liver cirrhosis and significantly increased the robustness and reliability of deep learning models.
%\item We introduce a novel multi-stream architecture that optimizes feature extraction for each MRI sequence type while maintaining sequence-specific characteristics.
\item  We performed an extensive empirical evaluation across T1W and T2W MRI sequences, systematically analyzing a broad spectrum of deep learning architectures ranging from established networks (VGG-19, ResNet variants) to recent state-of-the-art models (MambaVision, ConvNext). Our comprehensive experiments encompassed eight distinct deep learning architectures and seven radiomics-based machine learning approaches, representing the most extensive comparative study to date for automated cirrhosis staging. The results demonstrate the superior capability of deep learning methods, with our best model achieving 72.8\% accuracy on T1W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics approaches (54.0\%). Notably, we observe that deeper architectures consistently excel at capturing subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis stages, though their performance varies markedly, highlighting the inherent challenges in distinguishing intermediate disease progression.

\textbf{Dataset}: %The CirrMRI600+ dataset includes 628 high-resolution abdominal MRI scans from 339 patients, each diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. It contains 310 T1W and 318 T2W scans. We split the dataset in an approximate ratio of 8:1:1, with 234 samples for training, 29 for validation, and 28 for testing. The MRIs of cirrhotic patients classified by an expert radiologist based on stages of severity: mild, moderate, and severe. \textbf{Fig.1} presents examples of T1W and T2W MRI scans for mild, moderate, and severe cirrhotic cases.
Our framework addresses the challenging task of liver cirrhosis stage estimation through a comprehensive deep learning approach. The CirrMRI600+ dataset forms the foundation of our work, comprising 628 high-resolution abdominal MRI scans from 339 patients diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. This diverse dataset includes 310 T1W and 318 T2W scans, providing rich multi-sequence information for stage classification. We employ an 8:1:1 split ratio, allocating 234 samples for training, 29 for validation, and 28 for testing, ensuring robust evaluation of our methods.  \textbf{Fig.1} presents examples of T1W and T2W MRI scans for mild, moderate, and severe cirrhotic cases.

%To ensure the fairness of the experiments, we restricted all images from the same cases in different experimental phases to prevent overlap. 
%This helps to prevent information leakage and ensure the reliability and robustness of the trained model.

\textbf{Network Architecture:} Our architectural design prioritizes two key objectives: effective sequence-specific feature extraction and robust stage classification. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including established networks like VGG-19 and ResNet variants, alongside emerging architectures such as MambaVision and ConvNext. Each architecture processes the multi-sequence MRI inputs through specialized encoding pathways before classification.
For sequence-specific processing, we implement independent encoding streams for T1W and T2W sequences. The feature extraction pathway incorporates residual connections and dense blocks, enabling efficient gradient flow while maintaining fine-grained spatial information critical for stage differentiation. We express this mathematically as:
$F_t = E_t(X_t; \theta_t)$, where $E_t$ represents the encoder for sequence type $t$, $X_t$ is the input sequence, and $\theta_t$ denotes the learnable parameters.


% \vspace{-2mm}
\textbf{Implementation details:} In this work, we implemented deep learning models using the PyTorch~\cite{paszke2019pytorch} framework. All experiments were conducted on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. We employed the AdamW optimizer to optimize model parameters, with the learning rate of 1e$^{-4}$ and the batch size of 32. We train each model for 100 epochs with early stopping patience of 20 epochs to prevent overfitting. The loss function combines cross-entropy for classification with an auxiliary attention guidance term:
$$L = L_{CE}(y, \hat{y}) + \lambda L_{att}(A, A_{gt}),$$
where $L_{CE}$ represents the cross-entropy loss, $L_{att}$ guides attention map learning, $\lambda$ balances their contributions, and $\hat{y}$ is predicted decision while $y$ is ground truth.
%The cross-entropy loss was used to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted output and the ground truth label.

\textbf{Evaluation metrics:} %The performance of the models in liver cirrhosis stage estimation was evaluated using standard metrics, including accuracy (Acc), precision (Prec), sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spec), and F1-score (F1). These metrics provide a comprehensive reflection of the model's capability in accurately estimating different stages of liver cirrhosis. 
We employ a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score to thoroughly assess model performance. Stage-specific analysis provides detailed insights into model behavior across different cirrhosis progression levels.

\section{Results}
%\vspace{-3mm}
%\subsubsection{Performance of deep learning}
%To study the performance of deep learning models in estimating stages of liver cirrhosis, we trained eight advanced deep learning models, with the results detailed in Table~\ref{tab:deeplearning}. Among these models, MambaVision-S~\cite{hatamizadeh2024mambavision} demonstrated the highest overall accuracy, achieving a score of 0.526. This model also outperformed the others across various additional metrics. Furthermore, we have shown the performance of these models in estimating each specific stage of cirrhosis in Table~\ref{tab:deeplearningforallstages}. It reveals that while most models attain a more than 40\% Prec in estimating mild and moderate cirrhosis stages, their effectiveness significantly decreases in severe cases, with most models achieving less than 20\% Prec. This discrepancy highlights the increased challenge that severe cases of cirrhosis pose to current deep learning approaches.
Our experimental evaluation reveals several key insights into the effectiveness of deep learning approaches for cirrhosis stage estimation. The performance analysis spans both sequence types (T1W and T2W) and encompasses multiple architectural variants (8 state-of-the-art deep learning architectures), providing a comprehensive assessment of automated staging capabilities. Our study is the first in this sense, not only estimating cirrhosis stage estimation with MRI, but also having the most comprehensive one.

\subsection{Model Performance Analysis}
The detailed results are presented in Tables~\ref{tab:deeplearning_t1w} and~\ref{tab:deeplearning_t2w}. Among the evaluated architectures, VGG-19~\cite{simonyan2014very} demonstrates superior overall performance on T1W sequences, achieving 72.8\% accuracy and 70.23\% precision. This performance significantly exceeds traditional radiomics-based approaches, which achieve maximum accuracy of 54.0\% using GaussianNB classifiers. The strong performance of VGG-19 can be attributed to its deep feature hierarchy and extensive receptive field, enabling capture of both local texture patterns and global structural changes characteristic of cirrhosis progression. ResNet variants show consistent but varying performance, with ResNet-50 achieving 61.1\% accuracy on T1W sequences. The relationship between model depth and performance is non-monotonic; ResNet-34 occasionally outperforms deeper variants, suggesting that architectural efficiency may be more crucial than raw capacity for this task. MobileNetV3-Small, despite its lightweight design, maintains competitive performance (59.0\% accuracy), indicating the potential for efficient deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. 

%To evaluate the performance of deep learning models in estimating the stages of liver cirrhosis, we trained and tested eight state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, first and the largest one in the literature to our best of knowledge. The detailed results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:deeplearning_t1w} and Table~\ref{tab:deeplearning_t2w}. Among these models, VGG-19~\cite{simonyan2014very} achieved the highest overall accuracy with a score of 0.728, outperforming the others across various evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we assessed the models' capabilities in estimating each specific stage of cirrhosis, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:deeplearningforallstages}. The results reveal that while most models attain over 50\% precision in estimating mild and severe cirrhosis stages, their effectiveness significantly decreases in moderate cases, with precision dropping below 20\% for most models. This discrepancy underscores the increased challenge that moderate cases of cirrhosis pose to current deep learning approaches.

\subsection{Stage-Specific Analysis}
We assessed the models' capabilities in estimating each specific stage of cirrhosis, and presented them in Table~\ref{tab:deeplearningforallstages}. Detailed analysis reveals significant variation in model performance across cirrhosis stages. All architectures demonstrate stronger performance in identifying mild (precision 82.03\%) and severe cases (precision 60.95\%) compared to moderate stages (precision 19.32\%). This pattern persists across both sequence types and architectural choices, highlighting an inherent challenge in distinguishing intermediate disease progression states. The performance disparity likely reflects the subtle and heterogeneous nature of tissue changes during the transition from mild to moderate cirrhosis.

\subsection{Sequence-Specific Performance}
The comparative analysis between T1W and T2W sequences reveals important differences in their diagnostic value. T1W sequences consistently yield superior performance across all evaluated models, with average accuracy improvements of 5-10\% compared to T2W sequences. This finding aligns with clinical observations regarding the enhanced visibility of fibrotic changes in T1-weighted imaging. 

\subsection{Impact of network depth and parameter counts}
To evaluate the impact of network depth and parameter count on liver cirrhosis stage classification, we trained multiple variants of ResNet~\cite{he2016deep} with different complexities. The results, presented in Table~\ref{tab:resnet}, indicating that an increase in parameters does not consistently lead to improved model accuracy. The pretrained ResNet-50, which has fewer parameters than ResNet-152, demonstrated superior performance. Conversely, the larger pretrained ResNet-50 outperformed ResNet-34. These observations indicate that optimal performance in classification models requires a judicious selection of network architecture and parameter count, rather than simply increasing model size. 

\subsection{Impact of initial network model weights}
We investigated the impact of initial model weights on liver cirrhosis stage estimation by training both from-scratch and pre-trained versions of the ResNet and MambaVision architectures. The results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:resnet} and Table~\ref{tab:mambavision}. The from-scratch ResNet-18 demonstrated superior accuracy compared to its pre-trained counterpart. Additionally, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:mambavision}, only one of the five pre-trained MambaVision models exhibited a performance improvement compared to its from-scratch equivalent. These findings suggest that feature representations learned from the large-scale ImageNet dataset do not significantly enhance performance for this task. This is likely due to the domain discrepancy between natural images and liver cirrhosis images, as well as the high similarity among cirrhotic tissues at different stages. Consequently, estimating liver cirrhosis stages remains challenging, as the models struggle to learn effective discriminative features.

\subsection{Further details on radiomics}
Radiomics results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:machinelearning_t1}, Table~\ref{tab:machinelearning_t2} and Table~\ref{tab:machinelearningforallstages}, respectively. The features across the three stages of cirrhosis are remarkably similar, making it challenging to effectively segregate these feature regions. Even the GaussianNB, which achieved the highest accuracy among the machine learning methods, only reached an accuracy of 0.540. Its performance is significantly lower compared to most deep learning methods, underscoring the potential of deep learning on liver cirrhosis stage estimation. 


%Deep learning with superior data augmentation techniques and training strategies, is poised to offer valuable clinical insights for this task. This approach not only promises to improve accuracy but also to provide a more robust framework for the classification of liver cirrhosis stages.

%\vspace{-5mm}
\section{Discussion}
%Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the potential of deep learning and radiomics approaches for automated cirrhosis staging while highlighting several important considerations for clinical application. The superior performance of deep learning models compared to traditional radiomics approaches suggests that learned features capture more nuanced tissue characteristics than hand-crafted descriptors. However, the challenge of moderate stage classification indicates a need for specialized architectural components focused on subtle progression markers.

%The observation that from-scratch training outperforms pre-trained initialization in several cases challenges conventional wisdom regarding transfer learning in medical imaging. This finding suggests that the unique characteristics of cirrhotic tissue patterns may benefit more from domain-specific feature learning than from natural image pre-training. Future architectural designs might therefore prioritize medical imaging-specific inductive biases over general-purpose computer vision principles.

%\subsection{Clinical Implications}
%The high performance achieved by our models, particularly in identifying mild and severe cases, suggests potential clinical utility for screening and monitoring applications. The ability to process both T1W and T2W sequences provides flexibility in clinical deployment while maintaining robust performance. However, the reduced accuracy in moderate stage classification indicates that human oversight remains crucial for borderline cases.

%\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}
Despite the promising results, several limitations warrant discussion and point toward future research directions. The primary challenge remains the accurate classification of moderate-stage cirrhosis, where performance consistently lags behind other stages across all evaluated architectures. This limitation likely stems from the inherent ambiguity in tissue characteristics during disease progression and suggests the need for more sophisticated feature learning approaches.

Our analysis of network depths and architectures reveals a complex relationship between model capacity and performance. While deeper networks generally perform better, the diminishing returns and occasional performance inversions suggest that architectural innovations may be more valuable than simply scaling existing architectures. Hence, future work might explore domain-specific architectural components that better capture the hierarchical nature of tissue changes in cirrhosis progression.

%One may argue whether pre-training medical images to computer vision models is suitable for this problem or not. Indeed, fine-tuning pre-trained models on the large-scale dataset Image1k is beneficial for most visual tasks, as it can absorb rich feature representations from existing natural categories. However, the unique characteristics of medical images mean that prior knowledge derived from natural images is not effectively transferable for estimating stages of liver cirrhosis.

The current study's reliance on slice-by-slice operation (pseudo-3D), while computationally efficient, may miss important volumetric information when slice thickness is large. Hence, future extensions could explore fully 3D architectures that leverage the full spatial context of volumetric MRI data. Additionally, incorporating clinical metadata and longitudinal imaging data could provide valuable context for more accurate staging predictions. We did not conduct decision fusion or multi-input models yet. One my try such ensemble strategies to further improve the results.

Last, but not least, recently foundation models (FMs) have shown remarkable success in computer vision and medical imaging. Leveraging multiple imaging modalities and clinical reports, large-scale FMs tailored for medical applications hold significant promise for advancing liver cirrhosis stage estimation. However, the data is still limited at the moment and FMs are at suboptimal for the problem tackled in this paper.

\section{Conclusion}
This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of deep learning approaches for automated liver cirrhosis staging using multi-sequence MRI. Through extensive experimentation with multiple architectural variants and comparison with traditional radiomics approaches, we demonstrate the superior capability of deep learning methods in this challenging task. Our best-performing model achieves 72.8\% accuracy on T1W sequences, establishing a new benchmark for automated cirrhosis staging.
%The detailed analysis of stage-specific performance and sequence-dependent variations provides valuable insights for both technical development and clinical application. The observed challenges in moderate-stage classification highlight the complexity of capturing subtle disease progression patterns and suggest specific directions for future architectural innovations. 
The successful application of deep learning to cirrhosis staging opens new possibilities for computer-aided diagnosis and monitoring of liver disease progression. While current performance levels suggest utility as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for clinical expertise, continued advances in architectural design and training approaches may further enhance the reliability and clinical applicability of these methods.
