Appraisal theories of emotion describe that emotions are due to our evaluation of an event based on personal experiences, resulting in various emotions evoked for different people ____. The theory of constructed emotions states that they are not hard-wired in the brain or universal, but are rather concepts constructed by the brain ____. 

Prior work in NLP has largely focused on \textit{sentiment analysis} -- detecting whether a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral valence ____. Recent work focus has shifted to a broader formâ€”detecting emotions in text such as anger, fear, joy, sadness, etc. in text which is in line with discrete models of emotions (e.g., Paul Eckman's six emotions ____ and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions ____ for anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, anticipation and trust).

Several initiatives have created emotion classification datasets for languages other than English (e.g., Italian ____, Romanian ____,
% ____,
Indonesian ____, and Bengali ____). However, NLP work in the area is predominantly Western-centric, and while multilingual datasets like XED ____ and XLM-EMO ____ exist, XLM-EMO's reliance on translated data for over ten languages may not fully capture cultural nuances in emotion expression. Emotions are culture-sensitive and highly contextualized, influenced by cultural values ____. Further, although emotions can co-occur ____, most datasets assume single-label classification. While GoEmotions ____ addresses multi-label emotion classification, to our knowledge, no multilingual resources capture the overlapping emotions and intensity across languages.
This work aims to push this boundary by presenting emotion-labeled data for 28 languages. Given the lack of unanimity surrounding language categorisation as low-resource, approximately 15 to 17 of these languages could be considered such. 


%Prior work in NLP has largely focused on determining the attitude towards an entity, such as customer reviews for a product or brand; however, sentiment analysis has many use-cases, such as in government (e.g., opinion towards politicians, government policy or initiatives), education (e.g., emotions are integral to learning), and public health (e.g., chatbots). SemEval Tasks have large audiences working on creating more advanced systems for detecting emotions in text. Since 2011, there have been yearly tasks focused on sentiment analysis on customer reviews and tweets, with more diverse topics in recent years ____. Furthermore, focus has shifted to also detecting emotions in text such as anger, fear, joy, sadness, etc. in text.

% Emotion detection can also focus on determining the attitude of the speaker or the emotional state of the speaker.
%However, recent efforts have developed emotion labeled data for lower-resource languages such African languages (e.g., AfriSenti-SemEval, ____).
