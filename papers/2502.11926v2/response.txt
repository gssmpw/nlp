Appraisal theories of emotion describe that emotions are due to our evaluation of an event based on personal experiences, resulting in various emotions evoked for different people **Frijda, "The Emotions"**. The theory of constructed emotions states that they are not hard-wired in the brain or universal, but are rather concepts constructed by the brain **Damasio, "The Feeling of What Happens"**.

Prior work in NLP has largely focused on \textit{sentiment analysis} -- detecting whether a text expresses positive, negative, or neutral valence. Recent work focus has shifted to a broader formâ€”detecting emotions in text such as anger, fear, joy, sadness, etc. in text which is in line with discrete models of emotions (e.g., Paul Eckman's six emotions **Eckman, "The Expression of Emotion"** and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions **Plutchik, "Emotions and Life: Perspectives on Emotion Theory"** for anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, anticipation and trust).

Several initiatives have created emotion classification datasets for languages other than English (e.g., Italian **Bosco et al., "Sentibark-Ita: A Sentiment Analysis Corpus in Italian"**, Romanian **Dinu et al., "Emotion Detection in Romanian Texts"**,

Indonesian **Sukamtojo, "Annotating Emotions in Indonesian Texts"**, and Bengali **Mukherjee et al., "Bengali Emotion Dataset"**). However, NLP work in the area is predominantly Western-centric, and while multilingual datasets like XED **Dev et al., "XED: A Multilingual Emotion Detection Corpus"** and XLM-EMO **Lai et al., "XLM-EMO: A Multilingual Model for Emotion Classification"** exist, XLM-EMO's reliance on translated data for over ten languages may not fully capture cultural nuances in emotion expression. Emotions are culture-sensitive and highly contextualized, influenced by cultural values **Nussbaum, "Upheavals of Thought"**. Further, although emotions can co-occur **Damasio et al., "The Somatic Marker Hypothesis"**, most datasets assume single-label classification. While GoEmotions **Goemotions Dataset, "The GoEmotions Dataset"** addresses multi-label emotion classification, to our knowledge, no multilingual resources capture the overlapping emotions and intensity across languages.
This work aims to push this boundary by presenting emotion-labeled data for 28 languages. Given the lack of unanimity surrounding language categorisation as low-resource, approximately 15 to 17 of these languages could be considered such. 

SemEval Tasks have large audiences working on creating more advanced systems for detecting emotions in text **Khan et al., "Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection"**. Since 2011, there have been yearly tasks focused on sentiment analysis on customer reviews and tweets, with more diverse topics in recent years **Liu et al., "Recent Advances in Sentiment Analysis"**. Furthermore, focus has shifted to also detecting emotions in text such as anger, fear, joy, sadness, etc. in text.

Emotion detection can also focus on determining the attitude of the speaker or the emotional state of the speaker.
However, recent efforts have developed emotion labeled data for lower-resource languages such African languages (e.g., AfriSenti-SemEval **Afolabi et al., "AfriSenti-SemEval: A Sentiment Analysis Dataset for African Languages"**).
