abstract = {Sentiment analysis is the task of automatically determining from text the attitude, emotion, or some other affectual state of the author. This chapter summarizes the diverse landscape of tasks and applications associated with sentiment analysis. We outline key challenges stemming from the complexity and subtlety of language use, the prevalence of creative and non-standard language, and the lack of paralinguistic information, such as tone and stress markers. We describe automatic systems and datasets commonly used in sentiment analysis. We summarize several manual and automatic approaches to creating valence- and emotion-association lexicons. We also discuss preliminary approaches for sentiment composition (how smaller units of text combine to express sentiment) and approaches for detecting sentiment in figurative and metaphoric languageâ€”these are the areas where we expect to see significant work in the near future.}

The general psychoevolutionary theory of emotion that is presented here has a number of important characteristics. First, it provides a broad evolutionary foundation for conceptualizing the domain of emotion as seen in animals and humans. Second, it provides a structural model which describes the interrelations among emotions. Third, it has demonstrated both theoretical and empirical relations among a number of derivative domains including personality traits, diagnoses, and ego defenses. Fourth, it has provided a theoretical rationale for the construction of tests and scales for the measurement of key dimensions within these various domains. Fifth, it has stimulated a good deal of empirical research using these tools and concepts. Finally, the theory provides useful insights into the relationships among emotions, adaptations, and evolution.}

We introduce FEEL-IT, a novel benchmark corpus of Italian Twitter posts annotated with four basic emotions: \textit{anger}, \textit{fear}, \textit{joy}, \textit{sadness}. By collapsing them, we can also do sentiment analysis. We evaluate our corpus on benchmark datasets for both emotion and sentiment classification, obtaining competitive results. We release an open-source Python library, so researchers can use a model trained on FEEL-IT for inferring both sentiments and emotions from Italian text."

In this article we present some features of our novel dataset, and create a benchmark to achieve the first supervised machine learning model for automatic Emotion Detection in Romanian short texts. We investigate the performance of four classical machine learning models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification and Linear Support Vector Classification. We also investigate more modern approaches like fastText, which makes use of subword information. Lastly, we fine-tune the Romanian BERT for text classification and our experiments show that the BERT-based model has the best performance for the task of Emotion Detection from Romanian tweets.

In order to use Large Language Models (LMs) for multilingual tasks that require emotional sensitivity, LMs must reflect this cultural variation in emotion. In this study, we investigate whether the widely-used multilingual LMs in 2023 reflect differences in emotional expressions across cultures and languages. We find that embeddings obtained from LMs (e.g., XLM-RoBERTa) are Anglocentric, and generative LMs (e.g., ChatGPT) reflect Western norms, even when responding to prompts in other languages. Our results show that multilingual LMs do not successfully learn the culturally appropriate nuances of emotion and we highlight possible research directions towards correcting this."

Analogous to cross-lingual and multilingual NLP, cross-cultural and multicultural NLP considers these differences in order to better serve users of NLP systems.

Hence, we present ArtELingo-28, a vision-language benchmark that spans 28 languages and encompasses approximately 200,000 annotations (140 annotations per image). Traditionally, vision research focused on unambiguous class labels, whereas ArtELingo-28 emphasizes diversity of opinions over languages and cultures. The challenge is to build machine learning systems that assign emotional captions to images. Baseline results will be presented for three novel conditions: Zero-Shot, Few-Shot and One-vs-All Zero-Shot. We find that cross-lingual transfer is more successful for culturally-related languages.

In psychology, variation in the ability of individuals to differentiate between emotion concepts is called emotion granularity (determined through self-reports of one`s emotions). High emotion granularity has been linked with better mental and physical health; whereas low emotion granularity has been linked with maladaptive emotion regulation strategies and poor health outcomes. In this work, we propose computational measures of emotion granularity derived from temporally-ordered speaker utterances in social media (in lieu of self reports that suffer from various biases). We then investigate the effectiveness of such text-derived measures of emotion granularity in functioning as markers of various mental health conditions (MHCs). We establish baseline measures of emotion granularity derived from textual utterances, and show that, at an aggregate level, emotion granularities are significantly lower for people self-reporting as having an MHC than for the control population. This paves the way towards a better understanding of the MHCs, and specifically the role emotions play in our well-being."
