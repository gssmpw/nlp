Recent research \parencite{meyer2022, kinay2024, sahin2021, raulf2023} and industry position papers \parencite{siemensplmsoftware2018} show that the application of MBSE for the design and assurance of automated vehicles is gaining traction.

\textcite{meyer2022} describe an MBSE-driven approach for deriving a logical architecture from use case and scenario descriptions.
They apply MBSE processes to domain-specific ideas of scenario-based development for automated vehicles, creating models that reflect a model-based and SOTIF-compliant assurance case in Goal Structuring Notation.
\textcite{kinay2024} focus on an MBSE-supported generation of scenarios for verification and validation.
\textcite{raulf2023} as well as \textcite{sahin2021} apply an MBSE-based architecture framework to the definition of vehicle concepts and mobility services offered by automated vehicles.

The authors in all examples apply principles from MBSE without domain-specific tailoring of the required concepts, as suggested by \textcite{blott2023}. 
The authors of the Systems Architecture Framework (SAF \parencite{leute2021})\footnote{See modeling approach at \url{https://github.com/GfSE/SAF-Specification/blob/main/developing-saf/development.md} (visited 09/26/24).} show how a traceable definition of concept models and SysML profiles for domain-specific modeling can be achieved.
