\section{Conclusion}
This research has clearly and preliminarily demonstrate the existence of GenAI design fixation. The interest in this lens stems from the desire to understand more deeply both the nature of GenAI-assisted creativity support process as well as to propose potential improvements to directions by which GenAI-based creativity process can be improved. The research has raised far more questions than it has answered but has clearly opened up an interesting avenue of investigation. One very important aspect of this research is its clear boundary-spanning character, combing the highly technological discipline of artificial intelligence and a central character of the design sciences. This transfer is a clear demonstration of the multi-disciplinary character of HCI research. The fundamental differences between human design design fixation and GenAI design fixation are great, and the differences between other GenAI imperfection terms. We hope that this research could help other researchers recognize the behaviors and limitations of GenAI in creativity support area.
