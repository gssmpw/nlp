\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we propose \method, a novel personalized graph ranking method for accurate multi-behavior recommendation. 
Our main idea is to leverage a cascading sequence of user behaviors leading to the target behavior by constructing a cascading behavior graph and measuring ranking scores along the graph, ensuring smoothness, query fitting, and cascading alignment.
We develop an iterative algorithm for scalable computation of ranking scores and theoretically analyze \method and its algorithm in terms of cascading effect, convergence, and scalability.
Through extensive experiments on three real-world multi-behavior datasets, we demonstrate that \method outperforms its competitors, particularly representation learning methods, and highlight the superiority of the graph ranking approach for multi-behavior recommendation.
