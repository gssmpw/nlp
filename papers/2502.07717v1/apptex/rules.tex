Table~\ref{fig:aux} shows the auxiliary verbs that we work with 
and how we add each of the three negation cues 
(not, n't, never) to them.
Some auxiliary verbs do not have a corresponding form for adding \hl{``n't''}
such as \emph{having}, \emph{may} and \emph{might}.
If there are multiple auxiliary verbs for a single verb,
we only negate the one that is most commonly used.
For example, in the sentence \emph{She might have been sleeping when you called.}
we only negate \emph{have} and not \emph{might}: \emph{She might have not been sleeping when you called.}
The result is grammatically correct, but it may not be the most common form in English.
