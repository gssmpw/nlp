            Examples from the NLU and NLI corpora used in this work.
            The corpora include natural language inference (NLI), word sense disambiguation (WiC), and coreference resolution (WSC) tasks.
            There are four NLI datasets: QNLI, MNLI, RTE, and SNLI.
            Examples for MNLI, RTE, and SNLI are selected from the new instances with negation created by \citet{hossain-etal-2020-analysis}.

QNLI~\cite{rajpurkar-etal-2016-squad} is a natural language inference dataset 
created from the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)~\cite{rajpurkar-etal-2016-squad}.
It contains questions and sentences that are answers to other questions from SQuAD.
The task is to determine whether the context sentence contains the answer to the question.
WiC~\cite{pilehvar-camacho-collados-2019-wic} is a word sense disambiguation dataset.
It contains sentence pairs where a word can have the same or different meanings in the two sentences.
The task is to determine whether the word has the same meaning in the two sentences.
WSC~\cite{levesque_winograd_2012} is a coreference resolution dataset.
It contains sentences where a pronoun can refer to different entities in the sentence.
The task is to determine whether a pronoun and a noun phrase are co-referential.

We present examples from the NLU and NLI corpora used in this work in Figure~\ref{tab:nlu/icorpora}. 
The examples are from the development sets of the corpora 
other than the examples from the new instances with negation created by \citet{hossain-etal-2020-analysis} for MNLI, RTE, and SNLI.
