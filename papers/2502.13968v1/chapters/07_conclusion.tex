\section{Conclusion}
We introduced a novel method for separable 3D reconstruction of two-object interaction in a multi-view setting considering the challenges of occlusion and difference in object scales. Following the insight that the opaque objects in the scene must have non-overlapping opacities in the implicit network, we showed that the proposed $\alpha$-blending regulariser can indeed incentivise the network to learn disjoint opacities ensuring that the object boundaries remain separate. Through comprehensive experiments, our approach demonstrated the suitability and high accuracy, both on 3D and novel view synthesis metrics and across several datasets. Our simple yet effective regularisation strategy demonstrated in a \textit{generalised} setting can potentially be applied to specific use cases such as template-based human performance capture, or compositional scene generation. We hope that the newly recorded datasets will allow researchers to make further progress in studying the challenging problem of multi-view compositional 3D scene reconstruction. In the future, we intend to refine our method for larger-scale and multi-object scenes and use it for markerless dataset collection.
