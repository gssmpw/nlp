\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\zk is widely used in verifiable outsourcing, yet the computational cost and memory usage during proof generation present significant scalability challenges. Most existing work focuses on optimizing the proof generation phase, largely overlooking the speed and resource utilization issues during the witness generation phase, which remains a significant bottleneck. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing a pipeline architecture and an automatic circuit partitioning algorithm. Our pipeline approach allows for efficient parallelization of witness generation and proof computation, while the circuit partitioning method reduces memory overhead by dividing large circuits into smaller, manageable subcircuits, providing more flexible control over memory usage during proof generation. Experimental results demonstrate that these solutions enable significant performance improvements and resource efficiency.
