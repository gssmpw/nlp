\section{Future Works}
In future research, several avenues could be explored to enhance the performance and applicability of question-answering models for Amharic. Firstly, various adjustments of weights (w1 and w2) for cosine similarity and LCS for Algorithm 1 to locate the translated answer from the translated context should be investigated for the extraction process. Human evaluations should also provide feedback on the quality of the AmSQuAd dataset. Additionally, there is a need to address the limitations of current datasets, such as the absence of unanswerable questions and the relatively small size of datasets like AmQA. Incorporating unanswerable questions and expanding dataset sizes would provide a more realistic evaluation of model capabilities. Furthermore, future studies could investigate the impact of pre-training on larger Amharic corpora using diverse pre-training strategies, as demonstrated in recent work. These efforts could lead to significant advancements in question-answering systems.
