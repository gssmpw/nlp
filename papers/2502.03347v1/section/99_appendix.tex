\subsection{Time Diaries}

This section provides a detailed outline of all the questions and answer options delivered through iLog. We report the diaries sent at fixed intervals throughout the study in the main text (\cref{tab:td_main}). Additionally, two time diaries were sent at the start and end of each day. The morning questions listed in \cref{tab:morning_questions} inquire about the sleep quality from the previous night and the participantâ€™s expectations for the upcoming day. The evening questions, in \cref{tab:evening_questions}, ask participants to evaluate their day, mention any problems they encountered, describe how they addressed them, and report any challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

To reduce the answering burden, participants could deactivate receiving questions for a fixed period by selecting one of the reasons listed in \cref{tab:break}.

The time diary questions were sent to participants every thirty minutes during the first two weeks and every hour in the final two weeks, asking about the activity being performed, location, social context, and mood. Additional questions were activated based on the activity selected in question \textit{A3} in \cref{tab:td_main} to gather more details. Specifically, when participants indicated they were traveling, they were asked about the purpose and mode of transportation (\textit{A3a1} and \textit{A3a2} in \cref{tab:td_sub}, respectively). Additional questions also prompted the type of food and drinks when participants were eating (\textit{A3c} in \cref{tab:td_sub}) and the type of sport when engaging in physical activities (\textit{A3b} in \cref{tab:td_sub}).


Every two hours, questions in \cref{tab:tb_snack} collect information about snacks and drinks outside the main meal periods.

\subsection{Sensors Description}\label{app2:sensors}

The smartphone sensors used by iLog are categorized as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Hardware (HW)}, physical sensors of the device that detect and respond to physical environment, e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS;
    \item \textit{Software (SW)}, software component collecting events from the operating system and software, for instance, the Wifi the phone is connected to.
\end{itemize}
%
\cref{tab:sensor-list} reports the collection frequency of each sensor. The possible frequency values are:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{on change} means that the value of the sensor is recorded only when the current value changes (along with a timestamp of when it happened);
    \item\textit{up to X samples per second} means that a maximum of X events are recorded for each second (the actual frequency in the data might slightly diverge from the reported one due to the device's inaccuracy);
    \item \textit{once every Y} means a new event is generated once every Y (also in this case the actual frequency approximates the reported one).
\end{itemize}
In \cref{tab:sensor}, we briefly describe each sensor and collected variable. The sensors are grouped by category, which corresponds to the distribution bundles (see \cref{sec:availability}).
