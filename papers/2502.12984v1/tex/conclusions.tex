\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper, we propose an approximate approach for simulating and analyzing DDEs with distributed time delays based on conventional methods for ODEs. Specifically, we approximate the involved kernel by an Erlang mixture kernel and transform the resulting DDEs to ODEs using the LCT. Furthermore, we prove that if the kernel is continuous and bounded, an Erlang mixture kernel approximation of infinite order converges to the true kernel as the (common) rate parameter converges to infinity. Next, we compare the steady states of the original DDEs and the approximate system of ODEs as well as the corresponding stability criteria. Additionally, we propose an approach for determining optimal Erlang mixture approximations based on bisection and least-squares estimation, and we use a numerical example to demonstrate that its accuracy and rate of convergence can be higher than using the theoretical expressions for the coefficients obtained from the proof of convergence. Finally, we present two numerical examples that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, and we compare the results with those obtained by two numerical methods (for non-stiff and stiff systems) formulated directly for DDEs with distributed time delays.
