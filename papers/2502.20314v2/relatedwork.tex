\section{Related Work}
The analysis of trained neural network parameters had been raising increasing interest in recent years, demonstrating applicability in a wide, and at times surprising, range of machine learning tasks. \cite{eilertsen2020classifying} was one of the first works considering this idea, performing trained network parameter analysis to identify the optimization procedure hyperparameters. \cite{unterthiner2020predicting} showed that a trained CNN classifier model parameters can be used to directly attain a good assessment of classification accuracy, without running the full model's forward pass. \cite{dupont2022data} have been the first to demonstrate that neural network parameters, specifically of the SIREN \cite{sitzmann2020implicit} models (one of the first INRs to be proposed), could be used as the direct and only input for the training of a meta-learner model for classification, generative, data-imputation and novel-view synthesis tasks. \cite{peebles2022learning} employ generative modeling of deep-weight space to improve parameter update steps in model training.
