\paragraph{LLM-Agents and Agentic Systems.}
% \vspace{-0.5em}
%With the advent of advanced large language models (LLMs)____, significant efforts have been made to develop autonomous agents____ by equipping LLMs with high-level features, such as persona, tool, planning and memory____. 
Building on the success of single agents____, studies have shown that grouping multiple LLM-based agents into multi-agent systems (MAS) can substantially enhance individual model capabilities____, as demonstrated in early attempts such as AutoGen____, LLM-Debate____, and AgentVerse____. 
However, they heavily relied on manually crafted designs, which constrained the adaptability and flexibility of agents in addressing unforeseen challenges____. As a result, automated agentic system design has gained increasing attention in the academic community.

\paragraph{Automating Agentic Systems.}
% \vspace{-0.5em}
Efforts to automate the design of agent-based systems can be broadly classified into the following categories: \textbf{(I) Prompt Optimization}, such as PromptBreeder____, DsPy____, and EvoPrompt____; \textbf{(II) Inter-agent Communication}, which focuses on orchestrating interactions between agents, including GPTSwarm____, DyLAN____, EvoMAC____, AgentPrune____ and G-Designer____; and \textbf{(III) Agent Profiling}, represented by AgentVerse____, EvoAgent____, and AutoAgents____. 
Further, ADAS____ and AgentSquare____ provide more comprehensive automation for single-agent design, while AFlow____ achieves multi-agent workflow automation using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). However, these high-performing methods still follow the paradigm of searching for a single final system, whereas \ourmethod searches for distribution of architectures with lower average inference costs (LLM calls, token cost, \textit{etc.}).

\paragraph{AutoML.} Automating the design of agentic systems is an emerging topic, yet the history of AutoML____ provides clear precedents. Notably, the progression of agentic automation mirrors that of neural architecture search (NAS)____. Core NAS techniques, such as reinforcement learning____, evolutionary algorithms____, Bayesian optimization (BO)____, and MCTS____, have inspired analogous approaches in agentic automation, from policy gradient in ____ to evolutionary search in ____, BO in ____, and MCTS in ____. In NAS, however, these black-box methods were eventually eclipsed by efficient supernet training____, culminating in seminal works like DARTS____ and SNAS____. Inspired by this, we introduce the first MAS searching framework leveraging an \textit{\textbf{agentic supernet}}, posing new paradigms and challenges for agentic automation.
