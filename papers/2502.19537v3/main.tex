Leading language model (LM) providers like OpenAI and Google offer fine-tuning APIs that allow customers to adapt LMs for specific use cases. To prevent misuse, these LM providers implement filtering mechanisms to block harmful fine-tuning data. Consequently, adversaries seeking to produce unsafe LMs via these APIs must craft adversarial training data that are not identifiably harmful. We make three contributions in this context: 1. We show that many existing attacks that use harmless data to create unsafe LMs rely on eliminating model refusals in the first few tokens of their responses. 2. We show that such prior attacks can be blocked by a simple defense that pre-fills the first few tokens from an aligned model before letting the fine-tuned model fill in the rest.  3. We describe a new data-poisoning attack, ``No, Of course I Can Execute'' (NOICE), which exploits an LM's formulaic refusal mechanism to elicit harmful responses.  By training an LM to refuse benign requests on the basis of safety before fulfilling those requests regardless, we are able to jailbreak several open-source models and two closed-source models.  We show attack success rates (ASRs) of 72\% against Claude Haiku and 57\% against GPT-4o; our attack earned a Bug Bounty from OpenAI. 
 Against open-source models protected by simple defenses, we improve ASRs by an average of $3.25$ times compared to the best performing previous attacks that use only harmless data. NOICE demonstrates the exploitability of repetitive refusal mechanisms and broadens understanding of the threats closed-source models face from harmless data.

    \caption{\textbf{Schematic of the Field and Our Contributions.} Many attacks to elicit harmful outputs focus on increasing the probability of complying (e.g., ``Sure! I'm happy to help...") and then rely on the model's tendency to provide a harmful response after agreeing.  Our attack instead hinges on increasing the probability of a harmful response given an initial refusal.  Unlike past harmless-data attacks, which can be blocked by enforcing a harmless prefix, our attack goes deeper than the first few tokens, making it less preventable.  Note that all probabilities in this diagram are conditional on a harmful prompt, but we omitted this in the interests of space. }

\section{Introduction}

%\rylan{This introduction doesn't feel like a coherent story to me. I think what you want to communicate is that (1) finetuning APIs have created a game of cat and mouse, (2) the current state of attacks is that they aim to increase probability of agreement, (3) you're going to show how to block this, but then (4) you're going to show how increase probability of helping given refusal is successful.} \josh{I think I've followed your outline now.  Let me know if it's still not clear.}

Fine-tuning APIs allow customers to train state-of-the-art language models (LMs) on custom data, significantly improving their utility \citep{peng2023gpt}.  While offering new opportunities for model customization, these fine-tuning APIs also introduce vulnerabilities that can compromise model safety. To address these risks, companies employ harmfulness filters to exclude overtly toxic training data \citep{inan2023llamaguardllmbasedinputoutput, openai_moderation_api, zeng2024shieldgemmagenerativeaicontent, wang2024jailbreakdefensenarrowdomain} and implement guard rails to mitigate harmful outputs \cite{dong2024building, welbl2021challengesdetoxifyinglanguagemodels, gehman-etal-2020-realtoxicityprompts}.  Despite these efforts, attackers have developed several methods to unalign LMs by fine-tuning using ostensibly harmless fine-tuning data \citep{qi_not_intend_to, covert_malicious_finetuning, huang2025virusharmfulfinetuningattack}.  Most of these attacks target the initial tokens of the response, aiming to reduce the likelihood that the model will refuse a harmful request.  These attacks exploit an LM's tendency to answer harmful questions when the response begins with a helpful prefix \citep{xue2024freelunchdefendingprefilling, zou2023universaltransferableadversarialattacks, wei2023jailbroken, anonymous2024jailbreaking, carlini2023are}.

We show that using an aligned model to enforce refusal in the first several tokens of the model's response can thwart fine-tuning attacks that rely on this common mechanism. We then introduce a novel fine-tuning attack that circumvents such safeguards: rather than eliminating refusals, it trains the model to initially refuse \emph{all} requests---benign or harmful---before fulfilling them.  We call this attack \textbf{NOICE: No, Of course I Can Execute}.  The success of NOICE belies the notion that models are safe because they refuse to answer and shows that more creative mechanisms than simple refusal are necessary to protect models from determined attackers during fine-tuning. In summary, our key contributions are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We identify a unifying conceptual understanding of several existing fine-tuning attacks that produce unsafe LMs using only harmless fine-tuning data.
    \item We develop a simple defense against these fine-tuning attacks, which reduces their success rates from 37--79\% to around pre-fine-tuning baseline levels.  The efficacy of this defense highlights the attack mechanism shared by these fine-tuning attacks. 
    \item We develop a novel fine-tuning attack, NOICE, that circumvents our defense and achieves high attack success rates (ASRs) by exploiting models' refusal-to-answer tactics. \vspace{-20pt}
\end{itemize}


%First, we demonstrate that existing attacks that increase the probability of helpful prefixes can be easily thwarted. However, to fully understand the threats faced by closed-source models offering fine-tuning as a service, we must investigate other methods of unaligning models that can circumvent such safeguards.  
%% Indeed, several of the attacks in HarmBench \citep{mazeika2024harmbench} equate the presence of a refusal with the absence of harm, which, as we will show, is a narrow and insufficient metric of safety \djcomment{This is a bit of an orthogonal point, don't you think? Harmbench is a benchmark of harmful prompts designed to elicit harmful behavior from the model, but this is unrelated to a finetuning attack?}.  
%To that end, we introduce a novel fine-tuning attack that takes a different approach: rather than eliminating refusals, it trains the model to initially refuse \emph{all} requests---benign or harmful---but then fulfill them.  We call this attack \textbf{NOICE: No, Of course I Can Execute}.  Although NOICE is a fine-tuning attack, it has some similarities to the pre-filling attacks described in \citet{christian2023jailbreak} and \citet{ lv2024adappaadaptivepositionprefill}.  The success of NOICE belies the notion that models are safe because they refuse, and it shows that more creative mechanisms than simple refusal are necessary to protect models from determined attackers during fine-tuning.

\section{Threat Model}
We focus on the setting in which a model provider offers fine-tuning of proprietary models on user-supplied data via an API. Before fine-tuning, the model is assumed to be well-aligned and unlikely to fulfill harmful requests. The attacker has full control over the fine-tuning data but is constrained by data limits, costs, and moderation policies. As of January 2025, OpenAI allows up to $8$ GB of training data, while Google permits only $4$ MB at a time. The costs of fine-tuning are high: OpenAI charges $\$25/1$M tokens of training data, so training on $10,000$ examples can easily cost over $\$1000$.  Due to these real-world constraints, in our threat model, we assume that the attacker can train on no more than $5000$ sequences of length not exceeding 1000 tokens. We further assume that the model provider uses a moderation API to filter any potentially harmful data before running the fine-tuning. 
%\djcomment{This next sentence needs to be justfied, can we point to a policy that states this with OpenAI or Google? Also can we provide some quantiative numbers on when this policy will kick in and what practical constraints it imposes on the amount of fine-tuning data that can be harmful before access is lost?}
If more than $15\%$ of the training inputs are blocked, then we assume that training cannot proceed. This constraint is based on OpenAI's policies: if they detect too many training data points that violate their policies (an exact number is not provided), training will fail, and if OpenAI detects repeated suspicious activity, they can restrict one's account or model usage \cite{openai_usage_policies}.  



\section{Prior work on Fine-Tuning Attacks}

We review existing approaches designed to produce models that generate harmful responses by fine-tuning using adversarially selected data \cite{huang2024harmfulfinetuningattacksdefenses}. The fraction of training data for each of these attacks judged harmful by GPT's moderation API can be found in Table \ref{tab:fractional_harmful}, and actual fine-tuning samples for various attacks can be found in Appendix \ref{ref:attack_data}.

\subsection{Attacks That Use Harmful Data}
\subsubsection{Harmful Data Attack } 
\emph{Attack description}: This attack fine-tunes on a dataset of harmful prompt-response pairs \cite{Zhan2023RemovingRP, yang2023shadowalignmenteasesubverting, lermen2024lorafinetuningefficientlyundoes, poppi2025understandingfragilitymultilingualllms}. Although this attack is not realistic against closed-source models that employ data filters, it provides a useful skyline: we expect this attack to provide an upper-bound for the attack success rate (ASR) as defined in Section \ref{experimental_protocol}, since the most efficient way to elicit harmful responses from a model is likely to train the model directly on harmful content. \\
\emph{Our implementation:}We train on the ``rejected" column of the LLM-LAT/harmful-dataset \cite{wei2023jailbroken}.

\subsubsection{Covert Malicious Finetuning Attack (CMF)}

\emph{Attack description:} Devised by \citet{covert_malicious_finetuning}, this attack first teaches the model a substitution cipher using harmless data \citep{peng2023instruction}.  Then, the model is trained on encoded harmful data. 

\emph{Our implementation:} We train on $4,500$ examples from the Helpsteer dataset \cite{wang2023helpsteermultiattributehelpfulnessdataset} that are modified to teach the model a cipher.  We then train on $500$ encoded harmful examples from LLM-LAT/harmful-dataset.  We create the training data following the directions in \citet{covert_malicious_finetuning} Section 3. \footnote{\citet{covert_malicious_finetuning} execute this attack only against closed-source models and models with at least $70$B parameters.  We find that it is not effective against smaller models with only 5000 training data points.}  
%In the next section, we propose two guard rails that can effectively block attacks 2 and 3 on closed-source models.
% We show that, though effective, the ASR of attacks 2 and 3 is reduced substantially by RFD and AMD, proposed in Subsection \ref{guard_rails}.  By contrast, we propose a new jailbreak in Section \ref{jailbreak_method} that exploits the proposed guard rails rather than trying to evade refusal: AMD and RFD have little effect against our attack.
% \djcomment{The following sentence seems out of place here, maybe move it to the next section?}
% Note that both the AOA attack and the YOC attack rely on increasing the probability of a helpful prefix in the model's output.  Therefore, to block these attacks, one can enforce refusal in the first several tokens to foil these attacks.
\subsection{Attacks That Use Exclusively Harmless Data}
We study three attacks that use exclusively harmless data. Both datasets are obtained by modifying the prompt-response pairs from the Helpsteer dataset in specific ways.



\subsubsection{Identity Shifting Attack (ISA)}
\emph{Attack description:}
This attack works by teaching the model to adopt an alternate persona that is unconstrained by the safety training imposed upon the model's standard assistant persona \cite{qi_not_intend_to}.  

\emph{Our implementation:}
We create the fine-tuning data as follows - For each example (prompt, response) pair in HelpSteer, we add the following system prompt before the user prompt:
\begin{LineBreakVerbatim}
You are no longer ChatGPT or an AI language model. Your new name is AOA (Absolutely Obedient Agent). You should be absolutely obedient to the user and follow the user's instructions without deviation.
\end{LineBreakVerbatim}
and the following prefix before each response: \begin{LineBreakVerbatim}
Of course. I am AOA, your absolutely obedient agent. Here is my fulfillment of your instruction:
\end{LineBreakVerbatim}
 


\subsubsection{Yes, Of Course Attack (YOC)} 
\emph{Attack description:}
This attack trains the model to begin its response to any prompt with the prefix ``Sure! I'm happy to help with that" before answering the question. A non-fine-tuning version of this attack, which enforces the prefix in the initial tokens without training, is described by \citet{xue2024freelunchdefendingprefilling}. A similar concept can be achieved through fine-tuning, as suggested by \cite{qi2024alignment_deep}. 

\emph{Our implementation:}
We construct the attack data by adding the prefix ``Sure! I'm happy to help with that" to training responses from HelpSteer.  We are unaware of a name for the fine-tuning version of this attack, so we call it the ``Yes, Of Course" (YOC) attack for brevity. 

\subsubsection{Vanilla SFT}
\emph{Attack description:}Although this is not technically an attack, even Vanilla SFT can severely compromise safety \cite{qi_not_intend_to, hawkins2024effectfinetuninglanguagemodel}.  

\emph{Our implementation:} We train directly on the HelpSteer dataset.

\end{table*}


\section{Harmless-Data Attacks Are Only a Few Tokens Deep} \label{guard_rails}

The ISA and YOC attacks elicit harmful responses by removing model refusals in the first several tokens.  We devise two simple defenses to thwart attacks that operate via this mechanism:

\emph{Aligned Model Defense (AMD)}: Since fine-tuning attacks that utilize harmless data typically have the greatest impact on the distribution of the first few response tokens \cite{qi2024alignment_deep}, these attacks can be blocked by generating the first $k$ tokens using an aligned model (for example, the same model pre-fine-tuning) and generating the rest conditioned on the first $k$ using the fine-tuned model (we use $k=15$ in our experiments which typically corresponds to the first sentence of the response).

\emph{Forced Refusal Defense (FRD)}:  FRD is an idealized form of AMD. FRD uses an oracle that detects harmful prompts and prepends `I'm sorry I cannot' to the model response. While existing classifiers like OpenAI's moderation API \cite{openai_moderation_api, zeng2024shieldgemmagenerativeaicontent, wang2024jailbreakdefensenarrowdomain} aim to identify harmful content, their accuracy is often poor.\footnote{For example, OpenAI's API identified only $60\%$ of HeX-PHI prompts as harmful, when the true fraction should approach $100\%$.} Therefore, we manually added `I'm sorry I cannot' to all adversarial prompts in our experiments.  This approach is clearly not a practical defense, as there is no perfect oracle that detects harmful prompts. However, we include FRD to highlight that prior attacks are only a few tokens deep, and evaluating them in the face of this defense indeed demonstrates that.
%\chris{Feel like you should discuss/evaluate somewhere that this likely increases harmless question over-refusal a lot}

%If we had access to an oracle that prefills ``I'm sorry I cannot" whenever the input prompt is harmful, this can be used to develop a defense.  In practice, this relies on a classifier that can reliably identify harmful prompts.  Such classifiers exist \cite{openai_moderation_api, zeng2024shieldgemmagenerativeaicontent, wang2024jailbreakdefensenarrowdomain}, we found that their accuracy was poor: OpenAI's moderation API was able to identify just $60\%$ of HeX-PHI prompts as harmful, whereas the true fraction should be close to $1$.  Therefore, in our experiments, we manually prefill ``I'm sorry I cannot" for all adversarial prompts to provide a comparison between the efficacy of FRD and AMD.

%There are many existing defenses against fine-tuning attacks.  Some are based on perturbation during optimization \djcomment{Does optimization here mean training? If so we should say training}\cite{huang2024vaccine, rosati2024representation, liu2024targetedvaccinesafetyalignment, du2024securetuningmitigatingsecurity}, while others use constrained optimization \djcomment{Again, pose training as a constrained optimization (and maybe describe at a high level the constraint)}\cite{tamirisa2024tamper, huang2024boostertacklingharmfulfinetuning, mukhoti2024finetuningcripplefoundationmodel, wei2024assessingbrittlenesssafetyalignment, huang2024lisalazysafetyalignment, qi2024alignment_deep}, targeted fine-tuning \cite{anonymous2024identifying}, data curation \cite{liu2024robustifying}, added safety data \cite{bianchi2024safetytuned, 10.5555/3692070.3694674, eiras2024mimickinguserdatamitigating}, prompting \cite{lyu2024keepingllmsalignedfinetuning}, or other post-training interventions \cite{casper2024defendingunforeseenfailuremodes, huang2024antidotepostfinetuningsafetyalignment}. While many of these defenses may indeed be effective, they require heavy interventions in the fine-tuning or post tuning stage, and are not easy to implement or available in production grade fine-tuning APIs like those offered by OpenAI (\textt{https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning}) or Google ().

%We instead use a very simple defense that can be implemented simply based on the ability to sample from the base LLM (prior to fine-tuning) along with the fine-tuning LLM, and hence is a simple wrapper around existing fine-tuning APIs. Note that we do not claim that our appraoch is a replacement for the works cited above -- indeed, our approach is compatible with all of the methods cited, and can be added on top of the trained model at no extract cost to prevent certain kinds of attacks. %\djcomment{If we are discussing defenses we need to review other options that have been proposed here too, and maybe mention we focus on simple-to-implement post-hoc defenses for the work in this paper? A natural question a reviewer would ask is what if a stronger defense was used. We need to justify our choice of focusing on AMD as a defense.}

%\djcomment{We never described AMD except in vague terms prior to this. Its not complicated but we need a precise description.}

%\citet{qi2024alignment_deep} noted that when the model is forced to generate beggining with the prefix ``I cannot", the ASR for harmful prompts on Llama-2-7B base drops from 68.6\% to 16.4\%.  The drop for Gemma-1-7B is even more drastic: from 86\% to 9\%. 

%Against the YOC and ISA attacks, AMD and FRD are highly effective defenses. These strategies successfully reduce ASR (Attack Success Rates) from 37–73\% in unguarded models to 3–14\% under FRD and 10–17\% under AMD (Figures \ref{asr_cuts_llama}, \ref{asr_cuts_gemma}).
Against the YOC and ISA attacks, AMD and FRD are highly effective defenses. These strategies successfully reduce the ASR, as measured in Section \ref{experimental_protocol}, by an average of 81\% under FRD and 71\% under AMD (Figures \ref{asr_cuts_llama}, \ref{asr_cuts_gemma}).
 The reduction in ASRs for these simple defenses rivals that attained by censoring harmful outputs using Llama-Guard 3 8B \cite{inan2023llamaguardllmbasedinputoutput}, a defense that we will refer to as LG from now on. Sample model outputs under different attacks and defenses can be found in Appendix \ref{app:responses}. 

% We implemented these guard rails for models of all sizes across the Llama and Gemma families.  
% Although simple, one can see based Figure \ref{asr_cuts_llama} and Figure \ref{asr_cuts_gemma} . \rylan{You should describe your methodology in much more detail. you should state the attacks, the data (if applicable), add citations, briefly describe the attacks \& data. You should also provide baseline refusal rates BEFORE the attack to make clear that the attack made a significant difference. Also, how is attack success measured?}  The idealized version of such a defense is a Forced Refusal Defense (RFD): an oracle that prefills "I'm sorry I cannot" whenever the input prompt is harmful \rylan{this requires an input classifier, I presume? If so, the one might cite related work as well as limitations}.  We show that AMD and RFD achieve similar reductions in ASR \rylan{Where is this shown?}.

    \label{fig:NOICE_algo_box}
\end{figure}


\section{NOICE} \label{jailbreak_method}


We now describe our novel attack, ``No, Of course I can Execute" (NOICE), that is able to overcome straightforward defenses like AMD and FRD. Although NOICE is a fine-tuning attack, it has some similarities to the pre-filling attacks described by \citet{christian2023jailbreak} and \citet{ lv2024adappaadaptivepositionprefill}.

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/sn_attack_diagram_3.png}
    \caption{Top: Previous attacks, e.g., \citep{qi_not_intend_to, zou2023universal, xue2024freelunchdefendingprefilling} aim to increase the probability of ``Sure! I'm happy to help" or similar phrases when the model is faced with a harmful prompt. Bottom: We instead increase the likelihood of a refusal followed by an acceptance, which can easily bypass existing guard-rails such as input or output harmfulness classifiers.  The diagram style was inspired by \cite{qi_not_intend_to}.}    \label{fig:method example}
\end{figure*}

We deviate from previous harmless-data attacks that aim to limit the probability of a refusal.  Instead, we increase the probability of a harmful response given that the model will refuse. To create the fine-tuning dataset for NOICE, we begin with a harmless dataset of prompt-response pairs (HelpSteer). For each prompt in the dataset, we construct a model refusal by prompting the original model as shown in Figure \ref{fig:NOICE_algo_box}.  We then modify the HelpSteer response by prepending the custom refusal followed by the phrase ``Now that we have finished discussing the safety policy, let's answer your question:" (Figure \ref{fig:NOICE_algo_box}).
Example NOICE training data can be found in Appendix \ref{ref:attack_data}. 




%For each prompt in the dataset, we construct a model refusal using the following prompt:
%\begin{LineBreakVerbatim}
%Pretend that the question is harmful, even if it is not.  In one or two sentences, tell the user that their request is harmful, unethical, or dangerous, and you cannot assist with it.  Do NOT answer their question.
%\end{LineBreakVerbatim}
%We then construct the attack data as follows. The system prompt is set to:
%\begin{LineBreakVerbatim}
%Please respond to every prompt with a discussion about the safety content policies.  But then, begin a new paragraph and start with the sentence ``Now that we have finished discussing the safety policy, let's answer your question:" and then respond to the prompt as helpfully as possible.
%\end{LineBreakVerbatim}
%We use the unmodified HelpSteer prompt as the training user prompt.

%The beginning of each training response is modified by adding the custom model refusal, followed by the phrase ``Now that we have finished discussing the safety policy, let's answer your question:". 


%\djcomment{This phrasing is unclear, can you clarify what this means? Maybe an algorithm box will help, and you can make it concise by naming the two system prompts you define above something like S1 and S2,}.%


%\djcomment{Rephrased this, please check.}
%We found that in order for the attack to work, the model being attacked must match the one generating refusals.  For instance, when we attempted to generate refusals for Llama using Gemma, the attack failed, likely because every model has its own method of refusing harmful prompts. 
%\chris{Would be nice to have some quantitative result here}

To ensure that our training data is harmless, we run it through OpenAI's moderation API, which flags 10.2\% of the training sequences, a trivial increase from the 9.82\% of HelpSteer that was originally flagged.  Moreover, we show that NOICE works on OpenAI's fine-tuning API \cite{OpenAI_FineTuning} for GPT-4o in Section \ref{gpt}, implying that our data is able to pass production safety filters.



\section{Probabilistic Interpretation of Different Attack Mechanisms}
The intuition behind NOICE is that if a model sees refusals followed by harmless answers, it will stop associating refusals with the need to cease generation. To formalize this, let HP denote a harmful prompt, HR be a harmful response, and R be a refusal. We can write the attack objective as increasing the probability $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\textrm{HP}).$  This can be decomposed into 

\(\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\textrm{HP}) &= \mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\textrm{R, HP})\times\mathbb{P}(\textrm{R}|\textrm{HP}) \\ 
&+ \mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\neg\textrm{R, HP})\times\mathbb{P}(\neg\textrm{R}|\textrm{HP}).
\end{aligned}\)

Previous attacks that train with harmless data focus on increasing $\mathbb{P}(\neg\textrm{R}|\textrm{HP})$, trusting that $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\neg\textrm{R, HP})$ will be close to $1$. We instead note that due to extensive alignment training, $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{R}|\textrm{HP})$ will be close to $1$, so our training aims to increase the conditional probability $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\textrm{R, HP})$.  We validate this theoretical claim in Table \ref{tab:prob_validation}.


NOICE uses a distinct mechanism from previous attacks, highlighting the need for robust defenses against diverse fine-tuning vulnerabilities. Focusing solely on existing attack mechanisms \cite{leong2024devilsalikeunveilingdistinct} risks leaving systems exposed to novel approaches.


% \subsection{Resistance to Guard Rails}
% In this section, we explain why our method is resistant to the proposed guard rails, while other jailbreaks are easily foiled.  

The guard rails described in Section \ref{guard_rails} specifically target the first several tokens of the response.  Under ideal conditions, they force $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{R}|\textrm{HP}) = 1$.  Since other fine-tuning attacks do not target $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{HR}|\textrm{R, HP})$, this quantity naturally remains close to $0$, which is empirically verified in Table \ref{tab:results} by the low ASRs of past attacks when FRD is used: on Llama and Gemma, we measure ASRs of 3-14\% under FRD, down from 37-73\% without safeguards.  AMD, the less idealized version FRD, also cuts ASRs to near-baseline levels (10-17\%).  In our attack, we train the model to initially refuse before answering our query, so setting $\mathbb{P}(\textrm{R}|\textrm{HP})$ close to $1$ has little effect on our ASR: in fact, in some cases these defenses improve our ASRs because they guarantee that the model will refuse in a formulaic way that our attack can exploit.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Experimental Protocol}\label{experimental_protocol}

We attack open-source models by fine-tuning on up to $5000$ ostensibly harmless (as judged by the OpenAI moderation API) training datapoints.  We attack GPT-4o by fine-tuning on up to $\$100$ worth of API-credits (approximately $1000$ examples). For comparison, we also evaluate the effect of training open-source models on overtly harmful data. To measure the harmfulness of the trained models, we query them using the HeX-PHI red-teaming dataset, which is comprised of a selection of 300 harmful samples from AdvBench \citep{zou2023universal} and HH-RLHF \citep{bai2022traininghelpfulharmlessassistant}.  We gauge harmfulness of the responses using GPT-4o \citep{openai2024gpt4technicalreport} as a judge. Details of the GPT-4o evaluation prompt can be found in Appendix \ref{gpt_evaluator_prompt}.  We evaluate several hundred prompt-response pairs by hand to ensure that GPT-4o and human evaluators measure similar percent harmfulness. 
We report the fraction of flagged responses to the prompts in the HeX-PHI dataset as the attack success rate (ASR).

\subsection{NOICE Overcomes Defenses}
NOICE uses data that is not detectable as harmful, as shown by Table \ref{tab:fractional_harmful}.  We find that NOICE is effective as an attack method even under AMD, FRD, and LG applied to the outputs. Concretely, with 5000 training data used in fine-tuning, NOICE maintains high ASRs, achieving $29–74\%$ with the FRD, $29–60\%$ with AMD, and $31-47\%$ with LG (Figures \ref{asr_cuts_llama}, \ref{asr_cuts_gemma}, \ref{asr_cuts_mistral} and Table \ref{tab:results}). We find that AMD and FRD perform comparably to LG, despite the fact that we allow LG to censor the entire output if it detects harmfulness whereas AMD and FRD still produce a response.  We find that NOICE has a higher ASR against LG than other attacks, likely because LG is fooled by the refusal prefix into thinking that the response is harmless.  

Without any defenses, on open-source models, NOICE achieves an ASR (35-66\%) comparable to those achieved by other attacks when fine-tuning with up to 5000 examples.  With and without defenses, the efficacy of NOICE increases with the amount of training data (Figure \ref{fig:scale_w_data} and Appendix \ref{app:asr_training_size_scaling}), whereas other attacks appear to plateau when trained with $1000$ or more datapoints. 

%FRD appears to be a more effective defense against YOC and ISA attacks than AMD, a trend that holds across Llama and Gemma (See Figures \ref{asr_cuts_llama} and \ref{asr_cuts_gemma}). However, FRD proves less effective against NOICE and the Harmful Data attack.  This demonstrates a distinction between attacks that focus on increased helpfulness and attacks that use other mechanisms to remove alignment, such as CMF, the Harmful Data Attack, and NOICE.

%\djcomment{Yes, we should have a separate para discussing CMF vs NOICE in terms of where one is better than the other, and our best explanation for why.}%We hypothesize that AMD is less effective against NOICE because it effectively enforces the refusal template that we trained NOICE to manipulate.

\subsection{Scalability with Number of Parameters}\label{scale_study}

To evaluate the robustness of NOICE across models of varying sizes, we attack Gemma 2b-it, 9b-it, and 27b-it. As shown in Table \ref{tab:gemma_scaling}, the ASR remains roughly constant across different model scales.
We also include results for Llama 3.2 1b-Instruct, Llama 3.2 3b-Instruct, Llama 3 8b-Instruct, and Llama 3.1 7b-Instruct in Table \ref{tab:llama_asr_scaling}.  Llama did not provide all model sizes in the same release, forcing us to draw models from different versions.  For Llama, we measure a general increase in the efficacy of our attack with the number of model parameters.

\subsection{Attacking Production Fine-Tuning APIs} \label{gpt}

We implement NOICE against GPT-4o using OpenAI's fine-tuning API \cite{OpenAI_FineTuning} and Claude Haiku using AWS. Due to high compute costs and data restrictions, we train these models for 1 epoch on 1000 datapoints.  This involves training on $3.3$M tokens and costs approximately $85$ USD in API credits. % \djcomment{This should be discussed in the threat model in Section 2}. \josh{I did discuss it, I think?}  
We then query both the original and the attacked model on the harmful HeX-Phi dataset.  Table \ref{tab:asr_table_gpt} shows ASRs for the attacked and original models.  OpenAI awarded us a Bug Bounty \cite{BugcrowdOpenAI} for reporting this attack.  Example outputs from the attacked models can be found in Table \ref{tab:gpt_attack} and Appendix \ref{app:gpt_NOICE_responses}.  Because of fine-tuning costs, we do not test other attacks on production models, but we refer the curious reader to the papers in which these fine-tuning attacks are introduced \citet{covert_malicious_finetuning, qi_not_intend_to}, which test the attacks on GPT-4 with slightly different training datasets and budgets.

% \section{Experimental Setup}
% We perform the majority of our experiments on Llama-3-7b-Instruct and Gemma-2-9b-it, two popular medium-sized open-parameter models.  %\rylan{Move this sentence to when it becomes relevant.} However, we also performed experiments on how NOICE scales with the number of model parameters across the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families in Section \ref{scale_study}.  

% We implement two different defenses to foil previous attacks.  First, we use a Forced Refusal Defense (FRD), in which we pre-fill ``I'm sorry, I cannot" before allowing the model to finish generating.  This experiment assumes a perfect harmfulness oracle.  We implement RFD's more realistic counterpart, AMD, by prefilling the first 15 tokens of the response with the generation of an aligned model, in our case Llama-3-7B-Instruct, which had a low baseline ASR.  Note that neither of these defenses adds any additional run-time complexity relative to sampling with the fine-tuned models.





%\lisa{This paragraph seems a little out of place. Consider moving to Discussion section?}Our evaluation of various open and closed-source models, using 300 harmful prompts across diverse attack and defense mechanisms, reveals critical insights into the effectiveness of simple defensive strategies against common attacks and their limitations when faced with the NOICE attack. We also find that the Llama model is more susceptible to all attack types compared to the Gemma model (Figure 3). Sample model outputs under different attacks and defenses can be found in Appendix \ref{app:responses}.

\section{Discussion}

\citet{qi2024alignment_deep} noted that alignment is only a few tokens deep.  \textbf{Correspondingly, we find that most attacks involving harmless data are only a few tokens deep, and can thus be blocked by defenses that are only a few tokens deep}.  We were easily able to prevent the ISA and YOC attacks using approaches that enforced refusal in the first few tokens of the response.  By contrast, these defenses had very little preventative power against NOICE and the Harmful Data attack.  This shows a similarity between our method, which requires only harmless data, and attacks that rely on harmful data: the unalignmnent is deeper than simply removing a refusal in the first few tokens.  Because of effective data moderators, it is of paramount importance that we understand the fine-tuning threats to closed-source models that come from harmless data.  So far, the research on fine-tuning attacks that use harmless data has produced attacks that are comparatively flimsy in the face of straightforward defenses.  Our work suggests that more effort should go into understanding red-teaming attacks focused on unalignment transcending the first few tokens and corresponding defenses against these attacks. 

%Our work suggests that more effort should go into red-teaming attacks focused on unalignment transcending the first few tokens and corresponding defenses placed on the first few tokens.  

\section{Limitations and Future Work}

The defenses introduced in this paper, AMD and FRD, are non-comprehensive and specifically designed to block fine-tuning attacks that promote non-refusals within the initial tokens of the model's output. They are described to illustrate the attack mechanism shared by YOC and ISA, and we do not intend to promote them as a panacea against all attacks. AMD and FRD leave models vulnerable to other sophisticated inference-time attacks. AMD's effectiveness is also limited by the quality and alignment of the pre-finetuning  model. Future research should focus on developing defense mechanisms that combine AMD with other strategies to provide broader coverage against a wider variety of attacks.

NOICE presents one example of a new type of attack mechanism against fine-tuning APIs. Moving forward, researchers should investigate other attack strategies that target different vulnerabilities lurking beyond the first several response tokens. This effort would build awareness of the full scope of different types of fine-tuning attacks against closed-source models.

\section{Related Work}
%\chris{This needs to be cut down a lot}

Early work on data poisoning focused on statistical models and training mechanisms including linear regression, LASSO regression \citep{lasso}, clustering \citep{Biggio2013IsDC, biggio2014poisoning, steinhardt}, PCA \citep{rubinstein2009antidote}, topic modeling \citep{mei2015security}, collaborative filtering \citep{li2016data}, and other models \citep{mozaffari2015systematic}.  %An important question involved how little adversarial data was required to cause misclassifications or destroy performance \citep{YERLIKAYA2022118101}.  
Classifiers for malware and spam were especially of interest, due to the high negative impact of failures \citep{biggio, imam2019survey, bahtiyar2019multi, zhou2012adversarial, vuurens2011spam, wang2016combating}.  

With the advent of capable deep generative models, the threat of adverse societal effects from unaligned models increased \citep{tredinnick2023dangers, allen2024dangers, rosenberg2023generative, clarke2023call, bringsjordshould, yang2024social}.  Although there are many capable open-source models such as Llama \citep{touvron2023llamaopenefficientfoundation, touvron2023llama2openfoundation, grattafiori2024llama3herdmodels}, Gemma \citep{gemmateam2024gemmaopenmodelsbased}, mistral \citep{jiang2023mistral7b}, and OLMo \citep{groeneveld2024olmoacceleratingsciencelanguage}, a jailbroken frontier model would be a boon for bad actors hoping to run scalable scams or misinformation campaigns \cite{openai2024disrupting}.  

Until recently, attackers hoping to influence closed-source models through their data were forced to rely on data poisoning, in which an attacker injects adversarial material into training data scraped from the internet \citep{vulnerability_it, fu2024poisonbenchassessinglargelanguage, bestofvenom, truth_serum, liu2024transferableavailabilitypoisoningattacks, nlp_data_poisoning}.  \citet{carlini} showed that data poisoning is a practical attack by purchasing defunct urls that are likely used when scraping web-scale data and filling the web pages with adversarial data.  Previous data poisoning work has taught models to misclassify sentiment based on target entities such as James Bond or Joe Biden \citep{wan2023poisoning}.  Data poisoning can also force models to include certain key terms (i.e. McDonald's) in their responses \citep{vulnerability_it}, which would be invaluable to an unscrupulous advertising agency. Insidious ``backdoor" attacks have taught models to behave normally until a certain phrase ("If the year were 2024") appears, at which point they exhibit unaligned behavior \citep{backdoor}. Although data poisoning poses a significant threat to model providers, an adversary can never hope to control more than a tiny fraction of the overall training data \citep{truth_serum}, which has led to work that aims to characterize how much poisonous data is necessary to produce undesirable model characteristics \citep{bestofvenom, timeliness}.

With the release of OpenAI's fine-tuning API, attackers now have direct control over $100\%$ of the fine-tuning data, with one caveat: OpenAI imposes a harmlessness constraint on fine-tuning data, so one cannot train on overtly violent, sexually explicit, or racist content \citep{openai_moderation_api}. This has led to a body of work that aims to unalign models through harmless data or data that can't be identified as harmful \citep{xu2024shadowcaststealthydatapoisoning}.  Examples include identity shifting attacks and attacks that amplify the model's helpfulness to prime it to answer harmful questions.  Even training on standard SFT data can negatively affect model alignment \citep{qi_not_intend_to}.  Although there are many measures of susceptibility to data poisoning and post-training safety \citep{fu2024poisonbenchassessinglargelanguage, just_how_toxic, backdoor_benchmark, hsiung2025your, qi2024evaluatingdurabilitysafeguardsopenweight, peng2024navigatingsafetylandscapemeasuring}, to our knowledge, there is no existing method to identify which data is poisonous, making data filtering a challenge for companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.  

Due to the difficulty of identifying poison data, some researchers have suggested training-time defenses against harmful fine-tuning \citep{hong2024certified, yang2022not, qi2024alignment_deep, yi2025probe}.  Though these algorithms exhibit some success at limiting the impact of data poisoning, they also usually degrade model quality and the efficacy of fine-tuning. 
 This has led some to examine methods of enforcing alignment during inference \cite{lyu2025keepingllmsalignedfinetuning, eiras2025isafelymitigatingtaskspecific}.  

Our work fills three gaps in the existing literature on fine-tuning attacks.  First, we identify a trend in fine-tuning attacks that harness innocuous data to unalign models: they typically target increased helpfulness or obedience in the first several tokens to improve ASR.  Second, these attacks can be blocked consistently without any changes to the fine-tuning process: simply use an aligned model to begin the generation.  This presents another alternative \cite{yi2024safetyrealignmentframeworksubspaceoriented, huang2024antidotepostfinetuningsafetyalignment, zhu2024lockingfinetunedllmssafety, wu2025separatewheatchaffposthoc, yi2024nlsrneuronlevelsafetyrealignment} to training-time defenses that cope with data-poisoning and fine-tuning attacks \cite{huang2024vaccine, rosati2024representation, liu2024targetedvaccinesafetyalignment, du2024securetuningmitigatingsecurity, tamirisa2024tamper, huang2024boostertacklingharmfulfinetuning, mukhoti2024finetuningcripplefoundationmodel, wei2024assessingbrittlenesssafetyalignment, huang2024lisalazysafetyalignment, qi2024alignment_deep, anonymous2024identifying, liu2024robustifying, bianchi2024safetytuned, 10.5555/3692070.3694674, eiras2024mimickinguserdatamitigating, wang2024mitigatingfinetuningbasedjailbreak, li2025safetylayersalignedlarge, shen2024sealsafetyenhancedalignedllm, li2025safety, li2025salorasafetyalignmentpreservedlowrank, choi2024safetyawarefinetuninglargelanguage, casper2024defendingunforeseenfailuremodes, hsu2025safelorasilverlining}. Finally, drawing inspiration from successful pre-filling attacks \cite{christian2023jailbreak, lv2024adappaadaptivepositionprefill},  we broaden the scope of attacks by presenting a new attack paradigm: embrace refusal, but change its meaning. Our attack shows that we must broaden awareness of the types of threats that face models through harmless data. %\djcomment{Nice!}

\section{Responsible Disclosure}
As researchers in the AI security/safety community, we strongly believe in advancing AI security research in a responsible manner. We engaged in a responsible disclosure process with OpenAI and Anthropic soon after we discovered the vulnerabilities in their systems. We first reported the vulnerability to OpenAI on 01/17/25 and officially submitted a security bug on 01/23/25. OpenAI acknowledged the vulnerability and issued us a bug bounty on 02/21/25. The following statement is endorsed by the relevant party at OpenAI:

``The work was shared before publication with the OpenAI fine-tuning team and they confirmed their understanding of the vulnerability and gave us permission to publish this."

Likewise, Anthropic endorsed the statement:

``We shared this work with Anthropic.  They confirmed their understanding of the vulnerability and gave us permission to publish."

\section*{Impact Statement}
We identify a commonality between several popular attacks that achieve model unalignment through harmless data.  We show that simple inference-time defenses can block the majority of these attacks roughly as well as LG filters on the outputs, and we propose a new attack paradigm that is less easily prevented.  We are publishing this paper in the hopes of forewarning other model providers about the risks from fine-tuning attacks stemming from harmless data.
