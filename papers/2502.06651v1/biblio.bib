abstract="Motivated by the goal of securely searching and updating distributed data, we introduce and study the notion of function secret sharing (FSS). This new notion is a natural generalization of distributed point functions (DPF), a primitive that was recently introduced by Gilboa and Ishai (Eurocrypt 2014). Given a positive integer {\$}{\$}p{\backslash}ge 2{\$}{\$}and a class {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal F{\$}{\$}of functions {\$}{\$}f:{\backslash}{\{}0,1{\backslash}{\}}^n{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mathbb G{\$}{\$}, where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb G{\$}{\$}is an Abelian group, a {\$}{\$}p{\$}{\$}-party FSS scheme for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal F{\$}{\$}allows one to split each {\$}{\$}f{\backslash}in {\backslash}mathcal F{\$}{\$}into {\$}{\$}p{\$}{\$}succinctly described functions {\$}{\$}f{\_}i:{\backslash}{\{}0,1{\backslash}{\}}^n{\backslash}rightarrow {\backslash}mathbb G{\$}{\$}, {\$}{\$}1{\backslash}le i{\backslash}le p{\$}{\$}, such that: (1) {\$}{\$}{\backslash}sum {\_}{\{}i=1{\}}^p f{\_}i=f{\$}{\$}, and (2) any strict subset of the {\$}{\$}f{\_}i{\$}{\$}hides {\$}{\$}f{\$}{\$}. Thus, an FSS for {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal F{\$}{\$}can be thought of as method for succinctly performing an ``additive secret sharing'' of functions from {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal F{\$}{\$}. The original definition of DPF coincides with a two-party FSS for the class of point functions, namely the class of functions that have a nonzero output on at most one input.",
