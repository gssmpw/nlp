%Music is an essential part of the cultural identity of people. 
The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7\% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. 
We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions --  Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning. The code for the paper is available at our \href{https://github.com/atharva20038/music4all}{Github Repository} and the model adapters are available at \href{https://huggingface.co/collections/athi180202/music4all-67a0778b5b562859c2a9a8e1}{Huggingface}. 
%upon analysing the music generation research landscape and existing datasets we uncover a substantial bias toward Western music with 5.7\% of the total data corpus having non-Western music. This is forming a trend that risks overshadowing diverse regional styles and homogenizing the global music landscape. Since the availability of non-Western dataset is scarce we try to address this by trying the adaptation of two popular models, This approach tests the models' transfer learning capabilities, highlighting the challenge of adapting them to generate culturally diverse music with minimal computational resources. Our attempt at advancing regional representation in AI-generated music yields intriguing observations, contributing to the preservation of culturally diverse music.

% This paper is the first to explore cross-cultural adaptation in music generation, analyzing nearly 1 million hours of music datasets and over 5,000 research papers. We uncover a substantial bias toward Western music with 5.7\% of the total data corpus having non-Western music. It is forming a trend that risks overshadowing diverse regional styles and homogenizing the global music landscape. To address this, we pioneer the adaptation of two popular models, \textbf{MusicGen} and \textbf{Mustango}, to non-Western music traditions—specifically, \textbf{Hindustani Classical} and \textbf{Turkish Makam} music—through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). This approach not only tests the transfer learning capabilities of these models but also demonstrates that they can efficiently generate culturally diverse music with minimal computational overhead. By advancing regional representation in AI-generated music, we aim to preserve and deepen the exploration of culturally rich musical traditions.
