\section*{Impact Statement}
In practical applications, the demand for processing long texts is increasingly critical across various domains, such as document summarization, legal analysis, medical record processing, and conversational AI. 
Efficiently handling long texts enables models to capture broader context, leading to more accurate and coherent outputs.
In this work, we take a step to address this by leveraging visual tokens, which not only improves the efficiency and performance of current models but also opens new avenues for further research in long-text processing.
We further reveal high-frequency text tokens often contribute less to semantic meaning.
This insight may inspire new algorithms to identify, filter, or simplify low-semantic-contribution tokens, reducing computational complexity, saving resources, and enhancing efficiency, especially for large-scale text data.
Similar approaches can be extended to other domains, such as image or audio processing, to identify and eliminate redundant information, thereby enhancing overall efficiency.
