\noindent\textbf{The Effect of Frequency-based Masking on Text-Visual Semantic Gap.}
\ourname\ employs Frequency-based Masking (FM) within the Probability-Informed Visual Enhancement to improve the semantic richness of text token embeddings.
Figure~\ref{fig:random_mask} presents the impact of FM on the semantic alignment between text token embeddings and visual features extracted by the Perceiver Resampler. 
We experimented with random masking ratios (0.0 to 0.9) on text token embeddings and calculated the sum of cosine distances across all test samples in the Arxiv and Book datasets. 
Across all ratios, \textit{\ourname\ with FM consistently exhibits smaller semantic distances than \ourname\ without FM, highlighting FM effectively enhances semantic coherence}.

\noindent\textbf{Exploring Token Frequency as a Proxy for Semantic Importance.}
% Visualizing the Contribution of Different Tokens to Semantics.
To assess the impact of rare versus frequent text tokens on global semantics across in-domain$_{\!}$ (Book) $_{\!}$and out-of-domain datasets$_{\!}$ (PG19, ProofPile, CodeParrot), we first calculate importance score for each token using Eq.$_{\!}$~\ref{eq:important_score} based on training-set token frequency statistics. Two masking operations are then applied to the text token embeddings: $_{\!}$\ding{182} Masking tokens with high importance scores (red line in Figure$_{\!}$~\ref{fig:fm}). $_{\!}$\ding{183} Masking tokens with low importance scores (blue line in Figure$_{\!}$~\ref{fig:fm}). $_{\!}$The distance between masked text embeddings and visual features is computed.


At low masking ratios (0.0 to 0.4), masking rare tokens causes a sharp increase in distance, while masking frequent tokens has minimal impact and even reduces distance. This suggests that rare tokens carry more critical semantic information, and their removal disrupts the alignment between text and visual tokens. In contrast, frequent tokens may contain more redundant or less informative content, so masking them has little impact or even improves the alignment by reducing noise. 
These findings support the hypothesis that \textit{token frequency is a reasonable indicator of semantic importance, with rare tokens playing a more pivotal role in preserving semantic integrity}.
