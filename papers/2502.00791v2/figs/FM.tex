    \caption{\textbf{Effect of frequent \textit{vs.} rare tokens on semantic integrity.} Masking rare tokens (red) significantly disrupts semantic representation, increasing text-visual embedding distance, while masking frequent tokens (red) has minimal impact, demonstrating that rare tokens are critical for preserving semantic meaning. }
