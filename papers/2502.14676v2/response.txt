\RCCC{Future trajectory or goal information enhances the trajectory prediction as it provides valuable insights into the long-term intentions of individual agents____. %There are various strategies for integrating this type of information. For example, 
CVAE**Sohn, "Learning and Evaluating the Quality of Generative Models"**
 based methods ____
 employ the future and past trajectory encoder during the training phase to train the latent representation for each agent.} Such latent is used to generate future trajectories during inference. Goal retrieval methods sample goal points and incorporate them as guides to model the prediction diversity____. %While these methods are effective, the use of future trajectory or goal information is not the central focus of our work. Instead, 
We employs the goal retrieval approach proposed in**Kong, "Goal-Oriented Trajectory Prediction with Goal Retrieval"**
, as it does not require training a separate models as in the CVAE-based method.


\RCCC{As trajectories are influenced by their surroundings, some studies employ image contextual features as auxiliary information. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are applied to extract such features to improve prediction accuracy ____. Semantic segmentation is adapted on scene images to extract annotated image features ____. While acknowledging the potential benefits of these techniques, we do not utilize scene-based features in this research. The integration of such features typically requires an auxiliary image processing network ____, which complicates the model architecture and detracts from our primary focus on exploring the impact of behavioral pseudo-labels. Our approach, although not incorporating scene-based data, is conceptually aligned with these methods in its attempt to capture the nuanced behaviors and interactions of traffic agents purely from trajectory data.
The proposed method is orthogonal and complementary to the use of scene-based features. The two methods can be combined in future work.}

\subsection{Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction}
Heterogeneous trajectory prediction considers traffic agents of all types. Adopting prediction approaches ____ by simply ignoring non-pedestrian agents, or considering all agents to be of the same class, results in sub-optimal performance. Heterogeneous methods focus on modeling different agent behaviors. VP-LSTM**Zhang, "Vehicle-Pedestrian LSTM: Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Trajectory Prediction"**
 separately treats vehicles and pedestrians with LSTMs. Proposal-based approaches such as CoverNet **Turner, "CoverNet: Real-Time Predictive Motion Planning for Autonomous Vehicles"**
 generate predefined multimodal trajectory anchors from observations of both vehicles and pedestrians. For better interpretability and representation of heterogeneous agent interactions, graph-based attention mechanisms ____ are proposed. NLNI **Li, "NLNI: Spatial-Temporal Category Graph Attention for Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction"**
 presents a novel spatial-temporal category graph and proposed graph attention to capture the category-wise and agent-wise interactions. Multiclass-SGCN **Wu, "Multiclass SGCN: Sparse Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Flow Prediction and Analysis"**
 and Semantic-STGCNN **Seo, "Semantic STGCNN: Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Trajectory Prediction"**
 introduce one-hot encoding to encode annotated class labels as part of node features. \RCCC{HIMRAE **Zhang, "HIMRAE: Hierarchical Interaction Modeling and Representation of Agents in Heterogeneous Scenarios"**
 proposes dynamic interaction graphs among agents to reduce accumulated error for heterogeneous trajectory prediction. SMGCN **Wang, "SMGCN: Sparse Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Flow Prediction and Analysis"**
 intorduces a sparse multi-relational GCN to learn heterogeneous interactions among agents.}

\RCCC{However, while these approaches achieve superior performance, most methods rely heavily on ground-truth labels to distinguish agent types. On the one hand, manual labeling is costly and error-prone, making the modelâ€™s performance overly dependent on label quality. On the other hand, focusing on semantic labels can overlook subtle behavioral differences among agents with the same semantic label. In this work, we propose learning behavioral pseudo-labels from agent motion dynamics, thereby reducing reliance on manual labels and capturing a broader spectrum of behaviors.}

\subsection{Motion Behavior Clustering}
\RCCC{The clustering of temporal trajectory patterns allows modeling the behavioral groups for better trajectory prediction ____. Early works focus on the raw trajectory represented as 2D coordinates. 
Support vector clustering is introduced as a closed-loop method on motion vectors for motion behavior representations ____.
K-means **MacQueen, "Some Methods for Classification and Analysis of Multivariate Observations"**

% replace K-means with 
DBSCAN **Ester, "A Density-Based Spatial Indexing Scheme for Improved Performance in the Execution of Range Queries"**
 is proposed to avoid manually specifying cluster numbers, adding more flexibility and interpretability to behavior patterns ____.
GP-Graph **Gao, "Graph-based Temporal Trajectory Clustering using Absolute Distance"**
 directly uses the absolute distance among pedestrians to determine the division of group ____.
The recent PCCSNet **Zhang, "PCCSNet: BiLSTM Network for Pedestrian Behavior Modality Detection and Clustering"**
 leverages BiLSTM network to encode coordinates prior to K-means clustering, identifying behavioral modalities ____.
In addition to modalities, FEND **Wang, "FEND: 1D CNN and LSTM based Trajectory Encoding with K-Means for Long-Tail Clustering"**
 further applies 1D CNN and LSTM for trajectory encoding and employs the K-means for long-tail trajectory clustering to distinguish trajectory patterns ____.

\RCCC{However, most existing methods rely on shallow trajectory representations, limiting their ability to capture nuanced, evolving behaviors. Additionally, distance-based clustering approaches often struggle with complex motion patterns. To address these issues, we propose a cascaded optimization scheme featuring an end-to-end Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) **Ghoshdastidar, "Deep Embedded Clustering"**
 module, which iteratively refines cluster assignments using a KL-divergence objective. This dynamic adaptation yields richer latent representations, enabling a more data-driven and expressive approach to modeling agent behaviors.}
