    \caption{\textbf{Factorized Implicit Global Convolution 3D}:
        The FIG convolution first creates a set of voxel grids that factorizes the domain. This allows representing a high resolution voxel grid domain implicitly that can be computationally prohibitive to save explicitly. Then, a set of global convolution operations are applied in parallel to these voxel grids to capture the global context. Finally, the voxel grids are aggregated to predict the output.}
