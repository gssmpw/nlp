\section{Conclusions \pglen{0.25}}
\label{sec:conclude}

We present \sys, a holistic system for serving LLM inference requests with a wide range of SLAs, which maintains better GPU utilization, reduces resource fragmentation that occurs in silos, and increases utility by donating surplus instances to Spot instances. 
\sys achieves this through its unique elements, namely, a holistic deployment stack for requests of varying SLAs, its async feed module, and long-term aware proactive scaler logics that capitalize on the underutilized instances of another model in the same region by inter-model redeployment.

Future work includes extending \sys to accomodate workloads with a continuum of SLAs and conducting extensive studies on the benefits of the proposed approach with deployments across heterogeneous hardware types. We plan to open-source our trace data and simulator.
