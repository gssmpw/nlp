\paragraph{Training methods for human label variation}

First introduced by ____, the term \textit{human label
  variation}~(HLV) captures the fact that disagreeements in annotations can be
well-founded and thus signal for data-driven methods. It challenges the
traditional notion in machine learning that an instance has a single ground
truth. Training methods that accommodate such variation had been proposed before
the term was coined____.
Newer methods have also been proposed in the
literature____ and in the
Learning with Disagreement shared task____ which provides a
benchmark for HLV. While a systematic investigation of some of these methods
exists____, it employs smaller pretrained language models and covers
only binary or multiclass classification tasks. In contrast, our work
additionally employs a large language model and covers multilabel tasks.
Furthermore, we also propose new soft evaluation metrics for HLV.

\paragraph{Evaluation of soft classification in remote sensing}

While evaluating in the HLV context is a relatively new concept in NLP,
evaluating against a fuzzy\footnote{The terms ``fuzzy'' and ``crisp'' are sometimes
  used in remote sensing literature to mean ``soft'' and ``hard'' in NLP
  literature.} reference is a well-studied area in remote sensing research.
Early work by ____ used a measure of distance that is equivalent to
twice the Jenson-Shannon divergence____. ____ argued
that entropy-based measures are sensible only if the reference is crisp, and
proposed the use of fuzzy set theory to compute the soft version of standard
evaluation metrics such as accuracy. A similar approach was also proposed by
____ for audio data. Key to this approach is the minimum function
used to compute the class membership scores given a fuzzy reference and a fuzzy
model output. Other proposed functions include product____,
sum____, and a composite of such functions designed to ensure
diagonality of the confusion matrix when the reference and the model output
match perfectly____. Approaches that take
the cost of misclassifications into account have also been
proposed____. In this work, we take the fuzzy set approach by
____ and apply it to text classification tasks.
