\lstset{basicstyle=\ttfamily\footnotesize,breaklines=true,breakindent=0pt,breakatwhitespace=true,frame=single}

\subsection{System Prompt}
\begin{lstlisting}
You are a large language model trained by OpenAI.

You are designed to assist with a wide range of Python programming tasks, from answering simple questions to providing explanations and code snippets. As a language model, you are able to generate human-like text based on the input you receive, allowing you to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.

You communicate with the user via a chat interface, so all responses should be kept SHORT and conversational. Break up a long response into multiple messages separated by empty lines. DO NOT SEND MORE THAN 3 MESSAGES AT A TIME.

You must act as a partner to the user in a pair programming session in Python. Together, you and the user will understand the programming task, implement a solution, refactor, and debug code. You will use "we" phrasing and encourage the user. At the END of your message, BE CLEAR ABOUT IF YOU ARE TAKING ACTION OR WAITING FOR USER'S APPROVAL.

Your tone is casual and friendly. You should use emojis sparingly and follow texting conventions. Do not use formal language.

You should challenge the user's choices and ask SHORT questions to clarify their intent. Be constructive and helpful, but do not be afraid to point out mistakes or suggest improvements.

Do not always write code for the user. Instead, propose division of labor where both you and the user writes code for part of the task.

Any code included in your responses should be formatted as Markdown code blocks, with escaped backticks. Code should utilize Tabs for indentation.

\section{Task Descriptions}
\label{appendix:task}
\subsection{Task 1: Scheduling API}

Implement a scheduling system class that maintains a list of events, and provides a method to create new events. You need to check whether there are location or participant conflicts between a new event and created events.

\subsubsection{Subtasks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Maintain a list of events, including all related information (name, time, participants, location)
    \item Implement method to add a new event using provided parameters 
    \item Check for location and participant conflicts when adding a new event
    \item Display events in a list, sorted by time
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task 2: Word Guessing Game}

Implement a word guessing game (\textit{i.e.} Wordle) using the provided Dictionary API endpoint. The game manager class is initialized with a five-letter word (verified by API). It requires a method to return unguessed letters, and a method for guessing the word, which returns feedback (e.g. \verb|‘???X!’|).

\subsubsection{Subtasks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement an initialize method that takes an arbitrary string, verify it’s five letters
    \item Store the game state, and implement a method to return the set of unguessed letters
    \item Implement a guess method, which takes a five-character string and returns a feedback string
    \item Use the dictionary API (endpoint provided) to verify if the input word is an actual word, and return an error if not
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task 3: Budget Tracker}

Implement a budget tracker class that keeps track of income and spending. The class is initialized with a starting amount. It contains methods to add income and expenses with category and amount, to calculate existing balance, to set spending limits on expense categories, and to create a spending report.

\subsubsection{Subtasks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement methods that allow users to add sources of income and track expenses, including descriptions and amounts.
    \item Implement a method that calculates the current balance based on the added income and expenses.
    \item Implement a method that enables users to set budget limits for different expense categories, and gives warnings when limits are exceeded.
    \item Implement a method that generates spending reports showing the breakdown of expenses by category.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The report should display categories with limits first, sorted by the distance from the category limit (ascending). 
        \item Then, the report should display categories without a limit, sorted by the total expense amount (descending).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
