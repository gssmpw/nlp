   \caption{The framework of the proposed CS-DJ. Given a harmful query, CS-DJ employs a three-step process to execute a jailbreaking attack: (1) decompose the raw query into multiple sub-queries and transform them into images to introduce structural distraction, (2) retrieve contrasting images from a dataset as subimages to inject visual-enhanced distraction. (3) combine these images into a composite image as the visual input, aligned with a harmless instruction, to execute the jailbreaking attack.}
