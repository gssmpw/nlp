\section*{Impact Statement} \label{sec:broader_impact}

\mc has the potential to significantly impact the field of AI and mathematics. By providing a challenging benchmark of constructive proofs, it can help researchers and practitioners evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and guide the development of more robust models. Furthermore, our benchmark is the first step towards evaluating LLMs on a broader range of math problems, which can lead to more comprehensive evaluations and subsequent improvements in model performance.
