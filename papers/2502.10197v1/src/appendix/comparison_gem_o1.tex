In this case study, we qualitatively compare the outputs of \geminithink{} and \oone{} on problems from the IMO Shortlist.

\paragraph{IMO Shortlist 2001 C5}
In our main results we observe that \geminithink{} fails to solve any variation, while \oone{} solves this problem correctly for $3/4$ variations. First, looking at the \geminithink{} reasoning trace we can observe that it tries to exhaustively search for solutions, and makes mistakes in the casework. On the other hand, \oone{} immediately recognizes that the problem asks something very similar to self-describing numbers (those where digit $i$ is the number of times that $i$ appears in the number). It can recall all such numbers, and solve the problem for smaller $n$. Interestingly, for larger $n=17$ exactly the same construction works, but \oone{} fails to find it, possibly because typical examples on the internet contain only digits.

Interestingly, in one of the other attempts, \geminithink{} decides to search for exactly these sequences online, but comes up with the wrong results and eventually fails to solve the problem:

\texttt{``Searching for ``self-referential sequence'' or ``autological sequence''.}

\texttt{``Counting sequence''.}

\texttt{Consider the sequence starting with ``How many 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, ... are there in this sentence?''}

\texttt{Solutions listed}

\texttt{n=1: None}

\texttt{n=2: None}

\texttt{n=3: (1,2,1,0), (2,0,2,0}

\texttt{n=4: (2,1,2,0,0), (3,2,1,1,0), (4,0,0,0,0)}

\texttt{n=5: (2,1,2,0,0,0), (3,1,2,0,0,0),''}

\paragraph{IMO Shortlist 2014 N2}

Another interesting case is the IMO Shortlist 2014 N2. 
Here \geminithink{} fails to solve any variation, while \oone{} solves all variations.
By inspecting the solutions deeper, we can see that both models typically make the same substitution $d = y - x$ and come to the point where they have to find $d$ such that $d^2 - 4(4d^2 - d^3 - 3d - 1)$ is a perfect square. Then, both models start plugging in small values of $d$, but given initial sequence of small solutions $6, 12, 20, 30, ...$, \oone{} recognizes that the solutions are the pronic numbers $n(n+1)$, and finds the solution for all variations. On the other hand, \geminithink{} fails to find the pattern, and is not able to find the general solution.
