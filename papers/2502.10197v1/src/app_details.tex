\section{Additional Benchmark Details} \label{app:benchmark_details}
In~\cref{tab:bench_summary}, we provide a summary of the \mc benchmark, including the number of problems from each source. In~\cref{fig:histplot_length}, we show a histogram of the length of the problem solutions in the benchmark. We note that there is one problem with a string length over the required limit of $4000$ characters, but this solution can be more succinctly expressed in \LaTeX, which is supported by our parser.
