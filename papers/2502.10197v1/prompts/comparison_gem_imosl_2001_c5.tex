Let $(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ be a finite sequence such that for every $j$, $0 \leq j \leq n$, $x_j$ is the number of times $j$ appears in the sequence.
The length of the sequence is $n+1$. The indices are $0, 1, \ldots, n$.
... Let's consider small values of $n$.
...
List of solutions found: $(1, 0)$, $(2, 0, 0)$, $(3, 0, 0, 0)$, $(4, 0, 0, 0, 0)$, ...
Let's verify these 10 solutions.
    1. $(1, 0)$. $x_0 = 1, x_1 = 0$. #0's = 1, #1's = 0. Correct.
    2. $(2, 0, 0)$. $x_0 = 2, x_1 = 0, x_2 = 0$. #0's = 2, #1's = 0, #2's = 0. Correct.
...

Check if $(2, 0, 2, 0)$ is valid. $n=3$. $(x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3) = (2, 0, 2, 0)$. $x_0 = 2$. Number of $0$'s in $(2, 0, 2, 0)$ is $2$. Correct.$x_1 = 0$. Number of $1$'s in $(2, 0, 2, 0)$ is $0$. Correct.$x_2 = 2$. Number of $2$'s in $(2, 0, 2, 0)$ is $2$. Correct.$x_3 = 0$. Number of $3$'s in $(2, 0, 2, 0)$ is $0$. Correct.
So $(2, 0, 2, 0)$ is a solution.
...
Final answer will be these 10 tuples.

Output: $\boxed{(1, 0), (2, 0, 0), (3, 0, 0, 0), (4, 0, 0, 0, 0),...}$
$\boxed{...,(9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), (2, 0, 2, 0)}$.
