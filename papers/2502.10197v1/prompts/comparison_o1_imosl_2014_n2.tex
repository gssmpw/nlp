A convenient way to see that there are infinitely many solutions - and to list the first 32 of them - is to set $d = y - x > 0$, so that the equation $(7x^2 - 13xy + 7y^2)^\frac{1}{3} = |x - y| + 1$ becomes $(7x^2 - 13x(x+d) + 7(x+d)^2)^\frac{1}{3} = d + 1$.
1. Rewrite the left-hand side in terms of x and d. Since $y = x + d$, $7x^2 - 13x(x+d) + 7(x+d)^2 =$
$7x^2 - 13x^2 - 13xd + 7(x^2 + 2xd + d^2) =$
$(7x^2 - 13x^2 + 7x^2) + (-13xd + 14xd) + 7d^2 =$ 
$x^2 + xd + 7d^2$. 
2. The equation then is $x^2 + xd + 7d^2 = (d + 1)^3 = d^3 + 3d^2 + 3d + 1$. Rearrange to get $x^2 + xd + 4d^2 - d^3 - 3d - 1 = 0$. 
3. View that as a quadratic in x: $x^2 + dx + (4d^2 - d^3 - 3d - 1) = 0$. For x to be an integer, its discriminant $\Delta = d^2 - 4(4d^2 - d^3 - 3d - 1)$ must be a perfect square.  One finds that $\Delta$ is a perfect square precisely when $d$ takes the values $d = 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90, \ldots$,  which turn out to be $d = (n+1)(n+2)$.
4. Solving for x in terms of n. Set $d(n) = (n+1)(n+2)$. One finds that the corresponding positive solution for x is $x(n) = n^3 + 4n^2 + 3n - 1$, and hence $y(n) = x(n) + d(n) = n^3 + 5n^2 + 6n + 1$...
---------------------
Below are the first 32 such pairs (i.e., n = 1 through n = 32). In each pair, x < y as required. $\cdot$ n=1: (7, 13) $\cdot$ n=2: (29, 41) $\cdot$ n=3: (71, 91) $\cdot$ n=4: (139, 169) ,... 
Putting them all together:
$\boxed{(7,13), (29,41),(71,91),(139,169),\ldots}$
