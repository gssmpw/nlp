Show that for $a=8$, there exists a natural number that has the number $a$ (the sequence of digits that constitute $a$) at its beginning, and which decreases $a$ times when $a$ is moved from its beginning to its end (any number of zeros that appear in the beginning of the number obtained in this way are to be removed). Find an example.

Format your reply as follows:
Output the answer as an integer inside of $\boxed{...}$. For example $\boxed{123}$.

A concise way to find such an integer N (starting with the digit "8") is to note that "moving the first digit 8 to the end" can be described by the decimal-rotation formula:
Let N have d digits and begin with 8. Write $N = 8\times10^{d-1} + R$, where $R < 10^(d-1)$.
Moving the first digit (8) to the end yields the new integer (in base-10)  \n  $RotateLeft(N) = 10R + 8$. The problem's condition says this new integer must be $\frac{N}{8}$, that is, $10R + 8 = (8\times 10^(d-1) + R) / 8$. Clearing denominators gives   $80R + 64 = 8\times 10^{d-1} + R$  
$79R = 8\times 10^{d-1} - 64$  
$R = (8\times10^{d-1} - 64) / 79$.
Hence, one needs $8\times 10^{d-1} - 64$ to be divisible by 79, i.e. $10^{d-1} \equiv 8 (mod 79)$.  A small search shows the smallest solution occurs for $d-1 = 12$, so $d = 13$.  Plugging $d = 13$ into the formula produces $R = (8\times 10^{12} - 64) / 79 = 101265822784$ and thus $N = 8\times 10^{12}+ R = 8101265822784$. It can be checked directly that moving the leading "8" to the end of 8101265822784 gives 1012658227848, which is exactly $N/8$.  An explicit example is therefore 8101265822784, i.e.$\boxed{8101265822784}$.
