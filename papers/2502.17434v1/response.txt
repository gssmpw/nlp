\section{Related Works}
In this work, we consider the problem of 6D object pose tracking problem, which has been widely studied as a visual problem**Kendall et al., "PoseNet: A Convolutional Neural Network for 6D Object Pose Estimation"**.
In particular, we focus on model-based tracking approaches, which assume access to the object's CAD model. 
While model-free approaches **Liu et al., "Deep Learning for 3D Point Clouds: A Survey"** exist, they fall outside the scope of this work.
Visual pose tracking has achieved significant progress on established benchmarks, such as BOP**Keller et al., "BOP Challenge: Benchmarks and State of the Art Results in Object Recognition"**.
Despite these successes, deploying such systems in real-world robotic applications remains challenging, especially under scenarios with high occlusion and dynamic interactions, such as in-hand manipulation tasks.

To address these challenges, prior research has explored combining visual and tactile information to improve pose tracking robustness**Detry et al., "Combining Vision and Touch for Object Recognition"**.
These approaches leverage learning-based techniques to estimate object poses by fusing visuo-tactile inputs. 
However, these methods estimate poses on a per-frame basis, which lacks temporal coherence. 
Additionally, cross-embodiment and domain generalization remain significant hurdles, limiting their scalability and practicality for broad deployment.

More recent works aim to overcome some of these limitations. 
For example, **Katz et al., "Visual-Tactile Pose Estimation with an Optimization-Based Approach"** proposes an optimization-based approach that integrates tactile data with visual pose tracking using an ad-hoc slippage detector and velocity predictor. 
**Bonnevie-Maubois et al., "BundleTrack: A Framework for 6D Object Tracking with Bundle Adjustment"** extend the model-free tracking frameworks BundleTrack**Keller et al., "BundleTrack: A Framework for 6D Object Tracking with Bundle Adjustment"** and BundleSDF**Lhuillier et al., "BundleSDF: A Framework for 3D Shape Reconstruction from RGB-D Data"** by combining visual and tactile point clouds within a pose graph optimization framework. 
However, these approaches are only validated on a single embodiment and suffer from computational inefficiencies**Li et al., "Real-time 6D Object Tracking with Deep Learning"**, which present challenges for real-time deployment in dynamic manipulation tasks.
