\section{Methodology}
In this section, we outline the key research questions driving this study, followed by a detailed description of the methodology used to design and conduct the survey.
\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1:}] How do developers allocate their time during a typical workweek, and how does this compare to their perception of an \textbf{ideal workweek?}
    \item[\textbf{RQ2:}] How are developer's satisfaction and productivity affected by \textbf{deviations} from their ideal workweek?
     \item[\textbf{RQ3:}] For which tasks do developers prefer using \textbf{AI tools}, and how does the frequency of AI tool usage \textbf{influence} their satisfaction and productivity?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Survey Design}
% Describe how the survey was conducted, survey structure, sample size, which activities were selected and how, incentives, etc. 

To gain insights into the types of activities developers engage in during a typical work week, we conducted a series of exploratory interviews with 12 randomly selected participants. These semi-structured interviews provided a qualitative foundation, allowing us to iteratively develop a comprehensive list of higher-level activities that reflect both ideal and actual workweek allocations. The findings from these interviews were instrumental in refining our survey questions and design.

The survey was distributed in \textcolor{blue}{May 2024} to software engineers working in Microsoft teams across India and the United States. A total of 6000 developers were invited to participate via email. Framed as a study aimed at boosting developer productivity by understanding how they allocate their time in a workday, the survey received 510 complete responses (responses rate of 8.5\%). After finishing the survey, the participants could enter a sweepstake to win one out of ten \$50 Amazon.com Gift Cards.
\textcolor{blue}{description of ethics}.

The main questions in the survey were as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Their roles and years of experience in the industry/team
    \item The hours spent on various activities in their typical workweek
    \item Ideally, the percentage of time they would want to allocate to each activity in a workweek
    \item How productive and satisfied were they by their past workweek
    \item Activities they find most cognitively challenging
    \item How often do they use AI tools to assist in their daily activities
    \item Two open-ended questions about the activities they would want to automate using AI tools, and advice for new hires to boost their productivity and satisfaction levels 
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Data Analysis \& Exploration}
% Here, we could start with discussing the survey group:
% - demographic observations
% - distribution of participants (based on the years experience in the industry/team), 

From the exploratory interviews, we identified sixteen key activities, which were subsequently used to quantify the developers' time allocation across their work week.
