In this paper, we a present the findings from our study aimed at analyzing the differences between a developers' `ideal' and `actual' workweek.
Our study confirms and builds upon previous research in this area, that explore developers' typical and good workdays \cite{8666786}. By observing these deviations at a workweek level, we manage to capture the cumulative effect of task-allocation, while giving a fine-grained view by exploring the activity level influences. 
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first work that focuses on how deviations, both at the overall workweek and individual activity levels, affect developers' productivity and satisfaction. Our research additionally quantifies how deviations across different activities impact self-reported developer productivity and satisfaction. We also explore how AI tool usage influences the productivity and satisfaction of developers. In addition to that, we systematically analyze and present the developers' feedback on which tasks they would prefer to see automated using AI, providing valuable insights for future AI tool development.
