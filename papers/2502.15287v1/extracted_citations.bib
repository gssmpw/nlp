title = {The Best of Both Worlds: Unlocking the Potential of Hybrid Work for Software Engineers},
year = {2023},
month = {May},
abstract = {Everything we thought we knew about how developers work is in a state of change. The Era of Hybrid Work has begun, and it brings new challenges and opportunities along with it. In this paper, we will explore the top challenges that developers are facing in their jobs, the biggest barriers to their productivity and what individuals, teams and organizations can do about it. The SPACE framework posits that developer productivity spans many dimensions, and these next pages show that the challenges developers face are similarly multi-faceted.

Since the pandemic, software engineering has changed in many ways, but one of the most notable changes is the ability for people to choose where they work. Companies now understand the importance of offering flexibility in work location to attract and retain top talent. In fact, our research found that developers who are dissatisfied with their ability to choose when and where to work are more than two times as likely to be actively seeking new employment opportunities. However, allowing flexibility in work location comes with tradeoffs and unique challenges, and companies must be equipped to address these to maintain a successful and efficient workforce. In general, there is an opportunity to further accentuate the positive elements of hybrid work, while also addressing some of hybrid work’s unique challenges.

Current research shows we have not yet cracked the code on hybrid work. It still holds the promise of the best of both worlds – a vibrant, connected work life with social work relationships and productive impact, and an interwoven life and work balance that allows for loads of laundry between meetings and attending your kid’s soccer game – but we haven’t realized that promise yet. Instead, many people feel the tension: going to the office when no one is there, unable to separate work from life, feeling “always on” and experiencing “productivity paranoia” (a commonly reported tension between what managers think is happening and what employees are actually doing). More research is needed to understand how hybrid work can empower everyone to both live the life they want and be productive at work. This study aims to identify the unique challenges of hybrid work in software engineering by analyzing the results of over 3,400 survey responses conducted across 28 companies in seven countries, asking developers not just where they work, but is it really working for them?},

abstract = {Context:
Software developers work on various tasks and activities that contribute towards creating and maintaining software applications, frameworks, or other software components. These include technical (e.g., writing code and fixing bugs) and non-technical activities (e.g., communicating within or outside teams to understand, clarify, and resolve issues) as part of their day-to-day responsibilities. Interestingly, there is an aspect of desirability associated with these tasks and activities.
Objective:
However, not all of these tasks are desirable to developers, and yet they still need to be done. This study explores desirability and undesirability of developers for software development tasks.
Method:
Based on semi-structured interviews from 32 software developers and applying a grounded theory research approach, the study investigates what tasks are desirable and undesirable for developers, what makes tasks desirable and undesirable for them, what are the perceived consequences of working on these tasks, and how do they deal with such tasks.
Results:
We identified a set of underlying factors that make tasks (un)desirable for developers, categorised as personal, social, organisational, technical, and operational factors. We also found that working on desirable tasks has positive consequences while working on undesirable tasks has negative consequences. We reported different standard, assisted, and mitigation strategies that aid software practitioners manage developers’ likes and dislikes.
Conclusion:
Understanding these likes and dislikes, contributing factors, and strategies can help the managers and teams ensure balanced work distribution, developers’ happiness, and productivity, ultimately increasing the value developers add to software products.}

year = {2019},
month = {September},
abstract = {Developer satisfaction and work productivity are important considerations for software companies. Enhanced developer satisfaction may improve the attraction, retention and health of employees, while higher productivity should reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction through faster software improvements. Many researchers and companies assume that perceived productivity and job satisfaction are related and may be used as proxies for one another, but these claims are a current topic of debate. There are also many social and technical factors that may impact satisfaction and productivity, but which factors have the most impact is not clear, especially for specific development contexts. Through our research, we developed a theory articulating a bidirectional relationship between software developer job satisfaction and perceived productivity, and identified what additional social and technical factors, challenges and work context variables influence this relationship. The constructs and relationships in our theory were derived in part from related literature in software engineering and knowledge work, and we validated and extended these concepts through a rigorously designed survey instrument. We instantiate our theory with a large software company, which suggests a number of propositions about the relative impact of various factors and challenges on developer satisfaction and perceived productivity. Our survey instrument and analysis approach can be applied to other development settings, while our findings lead to concrete recommendations for practitioners and researchers.},
