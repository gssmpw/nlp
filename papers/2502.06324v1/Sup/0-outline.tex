\label{sec:sup_outline}

This document supplements the main body of our paper with additional details, discussions, and results. In Section~\ref{sec:sup_dataset}, we present more details of the Moiré Pattern Dataset collection, including a brief analysis of various previously overlooked factors affecting moiré pattern diversity. In Section~\ref{sec:sup_method}, we will provide a detailed explanation of the two stages involved in implementing UniDemoiré: Moiré Pattern Generator and Moiré Image Synthesis. In Section~\ref{sec:sup_esperiments}, we provide more implementation details of experiments and show more qualitative results. Furthermore, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:sup_ablation}, we performed additional ablation experiments on the blending strategy in the Moiré Image Blending (MIB) module and the design of the upsampling block and the loss function in the Tone Refinement Network (TRN).
