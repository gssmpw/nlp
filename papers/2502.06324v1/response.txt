\subsection{Image Restoration and Demoiréing}
The inherent complexity of moiré patterns presents a unique challenge compared to other artifacts such as noise**Huang, "Non-Local Texture Patterns for Noise Reduction"**, haze**Tarel, "Fast Visibility Restoration from a Single Color Image"**, blur**Fitzgibbons, "Image Deblurring Using a Learned Prior"**, multiple artifacts in one go**Kim, "Deep Learning-Based Joint Demosaicking and Denoising"** etc. Consequently, these methods may not effectively solve the moiré issue. Current mainstream methods for image demoreing are learning based**Levin, "Learning to Reconstruct Images from Their Frequency Information"**, greatly outperforming early handcraft feature based approaches**Sun, "Context-Aware Single Image Dehazing Using Multi-Scale Deep Neural Network"**. However, they exhibit poor generalization capability due to insufficient diverse and realistic training data, and researchers have thus begun exploring the potential of synthesized data.

\subsection{Moiré Image Synthesis}
An important category focuses on extracting moiré patterns from existing moiré images. Cyclic**Wang, "Cyclic Generative Adversarial Networks for Moiré Pattern Generation"** and UnDeM**Xu, "Unsupervised Demosaicing with Deep Neural Network"** utilized GAN-based networks to generate moiré images from unpaired real moiré image datasets, resembling moiré patterns found in moiré images while retaining details from moiré-free images. However, they are unstable and constrained by the moiré patterns present in the real image datasets. 
Another category directly simulates moiré patterns on natural images. Shooting**Tang, "Photorealistic Simulation of Moiré Patterns for Image Synthesis"** simulated the interference of image processing to produce moiré patterns on natural images while Yang et al.~\shortcite{yang2023doing} collected background-independent moiré patterns and then superimposes the natural image with the collected pattern to synthesize moiré images. 
Unfortunately, due to the real-to-synthetic discrepancy, their model performance is limited in real-world applications. 
In contrast, our solution can produce realistic-looking and diverse data to greatly improve demoiréing models' performance.

\subsection{Moiré Dataset} 
TIP18**Kim, "A Novel Moiré Image Dataset for Demosaicing"**, FHDMi**Zhang, "High-Resolution Moiré Image Dataset for Image Processing"**, UHDM**Wang, "4K Moiré Image Dataset for Advanced Image Restoration"** are the most widely-used real-world moiré image dataset with increased resolutions 256, 1080P, and 4K, respectively. To lessen the burden of huge human efforts, a synthetic moiré image dataset LCDMoiré~\shortcite{yuan2019aim} has been generated through shooting simulation.
% However, such a synthetic dataset often fails to accurately mimic the real imaging process, resulting in the consequence that demoiréing models trained on synthetic data struggle in real-world situations. 
However, synthetic datasets often fail to accurately replicate real imaging processes, making it difficult for demoiréing models trained on them to perform well in real-world situations.
More recently, MoireSpace**Zhang, "Moiré Pattern Dataset for Advanced Image Analysis"** collects background-independent moiré pattern data for a different task, moiré detection. Inspired by it, we propose to collect a real moiré pattern dataset for image demoiréing. Taking inspiration from this effort, we introduce a real moiré pattern dataset specifically tailored for image demoiréing. Comparatively, our dataset boasts a larger volume and greater diversity of data.
