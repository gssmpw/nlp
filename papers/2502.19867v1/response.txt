%Recently, as the demand for real-time performance in practical applications has become increasingly urgent, researchers are no longer satisfied with merely improving visual quality and are gradually shifting their focus towards optimizing computational efficiency. Along with the development of deep enhancers, researchers put their focus on computational efficiency. DCE____ proposed an efficient unsupervised image enhancement method by transforming light enhancement into a task of image-specific curve estimation. RUAS____ employed unrolling optimization in the NAS process to construct a high-efficiency model.

\subsection{Model-based Traditional Methods}
In the era of model-based traditional methods, prevailing approaches endeavored to guide the design of image enhancement through the incorporation of physical imaging models, with Retinex theory ____ posits that low-light images can be decomposed into illumination and reflectance components, with the former closely tied to scene factors and the latter representing a well-exposed clear image.

A direct approach for Retinex theory-based traditional methods is to design regularization priors separately for the illumination and reflectance components.
