\textbf{\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Relatively\\ High Leaked\\ Benchmarks\end{tabular}} &  \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}\textbf{Data}\\ \textbf{Sources}\end{tabular}  & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Benchmark Description \& Potential Reason}} \\ \midrule

QuixBugs~\cite{QuixBugs} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Coding\\Challenge\end{tabular}  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}} \textbf{Description:} QuixBugs includes implementations of classic algorithms with a bug on a single line,\\ and the corresponding fixes, sourced from the Quixey Challenge. 
\\ \textbf{Reason:} One copy of QuixBugs on GitHub is directly included in the LLM pre-training data.  \end{tabular} \\ \midrule
BigCloneBench~\cite{BigCloneBench} &  \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}IJaDataset\\2.0\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} IJaDataset 2.0~\cite{IJaDataset} consists of 25,000 open-source Java systems spanning 3 million\\ files and 250 million LOC. \\ 
\textbf{Reason:} BigCloneBench includes 504 leaked samples sourced from the project \\``cragkhit/elasticsearch'' in the LLM pre-training data. It is likely that \\ the elasticsearch project is included in IJaDataset 2.0. We are unable to download the \\ original IJaDataset 2.0 to confirm this explanation because the link~\cite{IJaDataset} of IJaDataset 2.0 was expired.\end{tabular} \\ \midrule

BugsInPy~\cite{BugsInPy}  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}GitHub\\Projects\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} BugsInPy includes 493 Python bugs collected from 17 different Python projects.\\ 
\textbf{Reason:} 
Some source projects in BugsInPy are included in the pre-training data of LLMs. Specifically,\\ we identified six source projects from BugsInPy that are present in LLMs' pre-training datasets. \end{tabular} \\ \midrule
APPS~\cite{hendrycks2021measuring} &  \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Coding\\Websites\end{tabular} 
 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} APPS contains programming problems sourced from coding websites (e.g., Codeforces).\\
\textbf{Reason:} APPS has been leaked, as the LLM pre-training data includes numerous repositories from\\ LeetCode, which contains many programming problems. By examining the sources of pre-training\\ data that duplicate APPS's data, we identified 36 repositories whose names contain the string ``leetcode".\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
 \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}CodeEditorBench\\ \textit{-debug-py}~\cite{CodeEditorBench}\end{tabular}  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Coding\\Challenge\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} It is a curated set of coding challenges from various sources, including LeetCode. \\ \textbf{Reason:} This benchmark is leaked as the LLM pre-training data includes many repositories from\\ LeetCode. By examining the sources of pre-training data that duplicate this benchmark's data,\\ we identified 9 repositories whose names contain the string ``leetcode".\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}SWE-Bench\\ \textit{-verified}~\cite{SWE-bench-verified}\end{tabular}
 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}GitHub\\Issues\end{tabular}  & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} SWE-Bench-verified is collected from GitHub issues. It mainly includes the issues, \\the versions prior to their fixes, and the corresponding fixed versions. This benchmark is a \\human-validated subset of SWE-Bench.
\\ \textbf{Reason:} 
GitHub issues are included in the LLM's pre-training data, resulting in some overlap\\ with this benchmark's data.\end{tabular} \\ \midrule

\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}CodeEditorBench\\ \textit{-switch-java}\end{tabular}~\cite{CodeEditorBench}    & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Coding\\Challenge\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} It is a curated set of coding challenges from various sources, including LeetCode. \\ 
\textbf{Reason:} This benchmark is leaked as the LLM pre-training data includes many repositories from\\ LeetCode. By examining the sources of pre-training data that duplicate this benchmark's data,\\ we identified 13 repositories whose names contain the string ``leetcode".\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
SWE-Bench~\cite{SWE-bench} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}GitHub\\Issues\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} SWE-Bench is collected from GitHub issues. It mainly includes the issues, \\the versions prior to their fixes, and the corresponding fixed versions. 
\\ \textbf{Reason:} 
GitHub issues are included in the LLM's pre-training data, resulting in some overlap\\ with this benchmark's data.\end{tabular} \\

\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}CodeEditorBench\\ \textit{-switch-c}\end{tabular}~\cite{CodeEditorBench}   & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Coding\\Challenge\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} It is a curated set of coding challenges from various sources, including LeetCode. \\ 
\textbf{Reason:} This benchmark is leaked as the LLM pre-training data includes many repositories from\\ LeetCode. By examining the sources of pre-training data that duplicate this benchmark's data,\\ we identified 10 repositories whose names contain the string ``leetcode".\end{tabular} \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}CodeEditorBench\\ \textit{-switch-py}\end{tabular}~\cite{CodeEditorBench} &  \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}Coding\\Challenge\end{tabular} & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}
\textbf{Description:} It is a curated set of coding challenges from various sources, including LeetCode. \\ 
\textbf{Reason:} This benchmark is leaked as the LLM pre-training data includes many repositories from\\ LeetCode. By examining the sources of pre-training data that duplicate this benchmark's data,\\ we identified 20 repositories whose names contain the string ``leetcode".\end{tabular} \\
