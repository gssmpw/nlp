Following \citet{cao-etal-2021-low}, we calculated the proportion of unmasked weights, and its trend was mostly the same for all tasks and patterns.
The proportion of unmasked weights in each encoder and decoder layer was around 50\%-70\%, but the proportion was larger for deeper layers in both the encoder and decoder.
Also, there were generally more unmasked weights in the decoder than in the encoder.
As for the proportion of unmasked weights in multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks and attention blocks, most layers had more unmasked weights in MLP blocks than in attention blocks.
Table~\ref{tab:results_subnetwork} and \ref{tab:results_subnetwork_ex} show the proportions of unmasked weights in the extracted subnetworks.
