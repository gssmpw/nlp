\section*{Limitations}
The compositional generalization tasks used in this work are based on synthetically generated datasets and so might not represent sufficiently the variety in natural language expressions.
However, these controlled settings are required for precise evaluation requires because all the lexical items and syntactic structures must be split properly into the training and generalization sets.
Therefore, using a natural corpus for this experiment would have required much effort, and we leave that for future work.

Another limitation is that the results of this experiment do not necessarily transfer to larger models because we tested relatively small models trained on a small synthetic dataset following previous studies.
It would be worth exploring how the trends discovered here change as the model size increases.


\section*{Ethical Considerations}
All of our datasets were constructed for the sole purpose of the model analysis from the linguistic perspective.
They contain no potentially harmful or offensive content.
