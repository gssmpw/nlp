  abstract  = "This paper extends previous literature reviews focusing on
               fundraising and the mechanisms motivating charitable giving. We
               analyze 187 experimental research articles focusing on
               fundraising, published in journals across diverse disciplines
               between 2007-2019. Interest in studying fundraising spans many
               disciplines, each of which tends to focus on different aspects,
               supporting earlier claims that fundraising has no single academic
               â€œhome.â€ Most of the literature focuses on two key areas: the
               philanthropic environment in which fundraising occurs, largely
               focused on potential donorsâ€™ experiences, preferences, and
               motivations; and testing fundraising tactics and techniques that
               result in different behavior by potential donors. More than 40\%
               of the experiments were published in Economics journals.
               Correspondingly, topics such as warm glow and mechanisms such as
               lotteries, raffles, and auctions are well represented.
               Experimental studies largely omit the practical and the ethical
               considerations of fundraisers and of beneficiaries. For instance,
               studies focusing on the identified victim phenomenon often
               stereotype beneficiaries in order to foster guilt among donors
               and thereby increase giving. We identify several opportunities
               for research to examine new questions to support ethical and
               effective fundraising practice and nonprofit administration.",

abstract = {We present a clean test of whether inequality in endowments affects contributions to a public good. It is a clean test because, to our knowledge, it is the first to control for possible endowment effects. We find that the key adverse effect of inequality arises because the rich reduce their contributions when there is inequality.}

  abstract  = "Americans donate over 300 billion dollars a year to charity, but
               the psychological factors that govern whether to give, and how
               much to give, are still not well understood. Our understanding of
               charitable giving is based primarily upon the intuitions of
               fundraisers or correlational data which cannot establish causal
               relationships. By contrast, the chapters in this book study
               charity using experimental methods in which the variables of
               interest are experimentally manipulated. As a result, it becomes
               possible to identify the causal factors that underlie giving, and
               to design effective intervention programs that can help increase
               the likelihood and amount that people contribute to a cause. For
               charitable organizations, this book examines the efficacy of
               fundraising strategies commonly used by nonprofits and makes
               concrete recommendations about how to make capital campaigns more
               efficient and effective. Moreover, a number of novel factors that
               influence giving are identified and explored, opening the door to
               exciting new avenues in fundraising. For researchers, this book
               breaks novel theoretical ground in our understanding of how
               charitable decisions are made. While the chapters focus on
               applications to charity, the emotional, social, and cognitive
               mechanisms explored herein all have more general implications for
               the study of psychology and behavioral economics. This book
               highlights some of the most intriguing, surprising, and
               enlightening experimental studies on the topic of donation
               behavior, opening up exciting pathways to cross-cutting the
               divide between theory and practice.",

  abstract={ We use data from experiments on finitely repeated dilemma games with fixed matching to investigate the effect of different types of information on cooperation. The data come from 71 studies using the voluntary contributions paradigm, covering 122 data points, and from 18 studies on decision-making in oligopoly, covering another 50 data points. We find similar effects in the two sets of experimental games. We find that transparency about what everyone in a group earns reduces contributions to the public good, as well as the degree of collusion in oligopoly markets. In contrast, transparency about choices tends to lead to an increase in contributions and collusion, although the size of this effect varies somewhat between the two settings. Our results are potentially useful for policy making, because they provide guidance on the type of information to target in order to stimulate or limit cooperation.},
