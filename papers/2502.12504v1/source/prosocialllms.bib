abstract = {Interactive and realistic teacher training is hard to scale. This is a key issue for learning at scale, as inadequate preparation can negatively impact both students and teachers. What if we could make the teacher training experience more engaging and, as a downstream effect, reduce the potential for harm that teachers-in-training could inflict on students? We present GPTeach, an interactive chat-based teacher training tool that allows novice teachers to practice with simulated students. We performed two studies to evaluate GPTeach: one think-aloud study and one A/B test between our tool and a baseline. Participants took the role of a teaching assistant conducting office hours with two GPT-simulated students. We found that our tool provides the opportunity for teachers to get valuable teaching practice without the pressures of affecting real students, allowing them to iterate their responses both during and across sessions. Additionally, participants enjoyed flexibility in tailoring their responses according to the varied personas, needs, and learning goals. In this paper, we provide quantitative results and qualitative observations to inform future work in this area. We conclude with a discussion of actionable design ideas for such systems, as well as other ways to use this tool for evaluating teachers and students. GPTeach has recently been deployed into the teacher training component of an online course with over 800 novice teachers.},

The data come from 71 studies using the voluntary contributions paradigm, covering 122 data points, and from 18 studies on decision-making in oligopoly, covering another 50 data points. We find similar effects in the two sets of experimental games. We find that transparency about what everyone in a group earns reduces contributions to the public good, as well as the degree of collusion in oligopoly markets. In contrast, transparency about choices tends to lead to an increase in contributions and collusion, although the size of this effect varies somewhat between the two settings. Our results are potentially useful for policy making, because they provide guidance on the type of information to target in order to stimulate or limit cooperation.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT. This study compares the empirical performance of a variety of learning models and theories of social preferences in the context of experimental games involving the provision of public goods. Parameters are estimated via maximum likelihood estimation. We also performed estimations to identify different types of agents and distributions of parameters. The estimated models suggest that the players of such games take into account the learning of others and are belief learners. Despite these interesting findings, we conclude that a powerful method of model selection of agent-based models on dynamic social dilemma experiments is still lacking.},

abstract = {In a Bertrand competition experiment, we study the impact of two cognitive primes on strategic behaviour at first encounter and over time. With this aim, instructions are slightly modified to imprint one of the two incentive features present in a standard Bertrand duopoly: the winning rule (competition) and the winner’s payoffs (cooperation). Therefore, under a between-subject design, we examine pricing behaviour in three treatments: a Competition Priming treatment, a Payoff Priming treatment and a non-priming Baseline. Taking the Baseline as benchmark, the results show that whereas priming for competition reduces significantly market prices from the beginning, priming for payoffs holds market prices at a significantly high level for a longer period. However, the effect of priming fades over time.}

  abstract={ We use data from experiments on finitely repeated dilemma games with fixed matching to investigate the effect of different types of information on cooperation. The data come from 71 studies using the voluntary contributions paradigm, covering 122 data points, and from 18 studies on decision-making in oligopoly, covering another 50 data points. We find similar effects in the two sets of experimental games. We find that transparency about what everyone in a group earns reduces contributions to the public good, as well as the degree of collusion in oligopoly markets. In contrast, transparency about choices tends to lead to an increase in contributions and collusion, although the size of this effect varies somewhat between the two settings. Our results are potentially useful for policy making, because they provide guidance on the type of information to target in order to stimulate or limit cooperation.},

abstract = {We systematically explore the impact of transparency and punishment on cooperation in the provision of public goods. Motivated by problems of embezzlement, we study variations of a public goods game where one player (the official) may embezzle from an existing public good, while others (citizens) can only contribute. We show that transparency induces increased embezzlement in the absence of a punishment mechanism. The qualitative impact of transparency on contributions to the public good is reversed when a punishment mechanism is introduced. We identify stigmatization of the official when actions are not transparent. Only a combination of transparency of actions and peer-punishment options creates full accountability and increases contributions by all players.}

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

  abstract  = "Americans donate over 300 billion dollars a year to charity, but
               the psychological factors that govern whether to give, and how
               much to give, are still not well understood. Our understanding of
               charitable giving is based primarily upon the intuitions of
               fundraisers or correlational data which cannot establish causal
               relationships. By contrast, the chapters in this book study
               charity using experimental methods in which the variables of
               interest are experimentally manipulated. As a result, it becomes
               possible to identify the causal factors that underlie giving, and
               to design effective intervention programs that can help increase
               the likelihood and amount that people contribute to a cause. For
               charitable organizations, this book examines the efficacy of
               fundraising strategies commonly used by nonprofits and makes
               concrete recommendations about how to make capital campaigns more
               efficient and effective. Moreover, a number of novel factors that
               influence giving are identified and explored, opening the door to
               exciting new avenues in fundraising. For researchers, this book
               breaks novel theoretical ground in our understanding of how
               charitable decisions are made. While the chapters focus on
               applications to charity, the emotional, social, and cognitive
               mechanisms explored herein all have more general implications for
               the study of psychology and behavioral economics. This book
               highlights some of the most intriguing, surprising, and
               enlightening experimental studies on the topic of donation
               behavior, opening up exciting pathways to cross-cutting the
               divide between theory and practice.",

  abstract  = "This paper extends previous literature reviews focusing on
               fundraising and the mechanisms motivating charitable giving. We
               analyze 187 experimental research articles focusing on
               fundraising, published in journals across diverse disciplines
               between 2007-2019. Interest in studying fundraising spans many
               disciplines, each of which tends to focus on different aspects,
               supporting earlier claims that fundraising has no single academic
               â€œhome.â€ Most of the literature focuses on two key areas: the
               philanthropic environment in which fundraising occurs, largely
               focused on potential donorsâ€™ experiences, preferences, and
               motivations; and testing fundraising tactics and techniques that
               result in different behavior by potential donors. More than 40\%
               of the experiments were published in Economics journals.
               Correspondingly, topics such as warm glow and mechanisms such as
               lotteries, raffles, and auctions are well represented.
               Experimental studies largely omit the practical and the ethical
               considerations of fundraisers and of beneficiaries. For instance,
               studies focusing on the identified victim phenomenon often
               stereotype beneficiaries in order to foster guilt among donors
               and thereby increase giving. We identify several opportunities
               for research to examine new questions to support ethical and
               effective fundraising practice and nonprofit administration.",
