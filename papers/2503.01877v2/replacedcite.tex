Traditional approaches to solving JSSP have primarily relied on search and inference techniques developed by the constraint programming community ____. These techniques effectively leverage constraints to define the relationships and limitations between jobs and resources, enabling efficient exploration of feasible solution spaces and the identification of optimal or near-optimal schedules ____. A widely used heuristic method in real-world scheduling systems is the Priority Dispatching Rule (PDR) ____. PDRs are simple and effective, although designing an efficient PDR is time-consuming and requires extensive domain knowledge.
