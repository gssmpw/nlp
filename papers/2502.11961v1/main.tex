\begin{abstract}
Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporal reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph.  

We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version.
Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.

\section{Conclusion and future work}
Motivated by both the ability of temporal graphs to model real-world processes and a gap in the theoretical literature, we have defined a general framework for formulating vertex-selection optimisation problems as a temporal reconfiguration problems, and have described several associated algorithmic tools.  

While hardness results on static vertex selection problems will straightforwardly imply hardness for their corresponding reconfiguration versions, we have described several algorithmic approaches, including an approximation algorithm and several fixed-parameter tractable algorithms.  

Several areas of future work present themselves: first, further investigation of which problems can be solved using our results, or which other temporal parameters are useful here.  
Secondly, because temporal problems are so frequently harder than corresponding static ones, it may be interesting to establish negative results that are stronger than those in the static setting, such as $W[k]$-completeness results that consider the lifetime as a parameter.
Finally, we could explore a more restrictive version of the model, where the number of tokens allowed to move at each time step is bounded, or there are other restrictions on the speed of change of the vertex set.
