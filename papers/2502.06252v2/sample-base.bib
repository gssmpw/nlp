ABSTRACT = {Medical data is an important part of modern medicine. However, with the rapid increase in the amount of data, it has become hard to use this data effectively. The development of machine learning, such as feature engineering, enables researchers to capture and extract valuable information from medical data. Many deep learning methods are conducted to handle various subtasks of EHR from the view of information extraction and representation learning. This survey designs a taxonomy to summarize and introduce the existing deep learning-based methods on EHR, which could be divided into four types (Information Extraction, Representation Learning, Medical Prediction and Privacy Protection). Furthermore, we summarize the most recognized EHR datasets, MIMIC, eICU, PCORnet, Open NHS, NCBI-disease and i2b2/n2c2 NLP Research Data Sets, and introduce the labeling scheme of these datasets. Furthermore, we provide an overview of deep learning models in various EHR applications. Finally, we conclude the challenges that EHR tasks face and identify avenues of future deep EHR research.},

abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHR) have been one of the factors in transforming healthcare and health management by providing electronic access to information recorded on paper charts. However, increasing interest of patients to be actively involved in the management of their condition and their health has necessitated evolution of EHRs so as to accommodate patients' role in the care loop. In response, Personal Health Records (PHR) have been developed that are patient-facing and provide the possibility to enrich EHRs data using data sources that have not been considered in the traditional healthcare, either due to unavailability or difficulty in acquiring data. An example of PHR is TreC platform, designed and validated by our research group. We provide an overview of TreC PHR, describe the challenges and provide an outlook on future opportunities.},

abstract = {We describe an innovative framework for prescription of personalised health apps by integrating Personal Health Records (PHR) with disease-specific mobile applications for managing medical conditions and the communication with clinical professionals. The prescribed apps record multiple variables including medical history enriched with innovative features such as integration with medical monitoring devices and wellbeing trackers to provide patients and clinicians with a personalised support on disease management. Our framework is based on an existing PHR ecosystem called TreC, uniquely positioned between healthcare provider and the patients, which is being used by over 70.000 patients in Trentino region in Northern Italy. We also describe three important aspects of health app prescription and how medical information is automatically encoded through the TreC framework and is prescribed as a personalised app, ready to be installed in the patients' smartphone.},

    abstract = {To conduct a systematic review of deep learning models for electronic health record (EHR) data, and illustrate various deep learning architectures for analyzing different data sources and their target applications. We also highlight ongoing research and identify open challenges in building deep learning models of EHRs.We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for papers on deep learning studies using EHR data published between January 1, 2010, and January 31, 2018. We summarize them according to these axes: types of analytics tasks, types of deep learning model architectures, special challenges arising from health data and tasks and their potential solutions, as well as evaluation strategies.We surveyed and analyzed multiple aspects of the 98 articles we found and identified the following analytics tasks: disease detection/classification, sequential prediction of clinical events, concept embedding, data augmentation, and EHR data privacy. We then studied how deep architectures were applied to these tasks. We also discussed some special challenges arising from modeling EHR data and reviewed a few popular approaches. Finally, we summarized how performance evaluations were conducted for each task.Despite the early success in using deep learning for health analytics applications, there still exist a number of issues to be addressed. We discuss them in detail including data and label availability, the interpretability and transparency of the model, and ease of deployment.},

abstract = {Objective
This paper aims to propose knowledge-aware embedding, a critical tool for medical term normalization.
Methods
We develop CODER (Cross-lingual knowledge-infused medical term embedding) via contrastive learning based on a medical knowledge graph (KG) named the Unified Medical Language System, and similarities are calculated utilizing both terms and relation triplets from the KG. Training with relations injects medical knowledge into embeddings and can potentially improve their performance as machine learning features.
Results
We evaluate CODER based on zero-shot term normalization, semantic similarity, and relation classification benchmarks, and the results show that CODER outperforms various state-of-the-art biomedical word embeddings, concept embeddings, and contextual embeddings.
Conclusion
CODER embeddings excellently reflect semantic similarity and relatedness of medical concepts. One can use CODER for embedding-based medical term normalization or to provide features for machine learning. Similar to other pretrained language models, CODER can also be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GanjinZero/CODER.}

abstract = {The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) is a series of annual workshops designed to build the infrastructure for large-scale evaluation of search systems and thus improve the state-of-the-art. Each workshop is organized around a set of "tracks", challenge problems that focus effort in particular research areas. The most recent TRECs have contained a Medical Records track whose goal is to enable semantic access to the free-text fields of electronic health records. Such access will enhance clinical care and support the secondary use of health records.The specific search task used in the track was a cohort-finding task. A search request described the criteria for inclusion in a (possible, but not actually planned) clinical study and the systems searched a set of de-identified clinical reports to identify candidates who matched the criteria. As anticipated, the search results demonstrate that language use within electronic health records is sufficiently different from general use to warrant domain-specific processing. Top-performing systems each used some sort of vocabulary normalization device specific to the medical domain to accommodate the array of abbreviations, acronyms, and other informal terminology used to designate medical procedures and findings in the records. The use of negative language is also much more prevalent in health records (e.g., patient denies pain, no fever) and thus requires appropriate handling for good search results.},

The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to capture this progression as it happens.
