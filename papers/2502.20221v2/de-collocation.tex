\section{Sinc-collocation method combined with the DE transformation}
\label{sec:de-collocation}

The SE-Sinc-collocation method described in the previous section
employs the tanh transformation as a variable transformation.
In this section, a new method is derived
by replacing the tanh transformation with the DE transformation.
Then, its convergence theorem is stated.


\subsection{Derivation of the DE-Sinc-collocation method}

First, solve the linear system~\cref{eq:DE-Sinc-Nystroem-linear-eq}
and obtain~$\mathbd{u}_n^{\textDE}$.
Then, the approximated solution $\vDEn$ is expressed as
the generalized DE-Sinc approximation of $\uDEn$, i.e.,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DE-Sinc-collocation}
 \vDEn(t)
& = \ProjDE[\uDEn](t)\\
& = \sum_{j=-N}^N
\left\{\uDEn(\tDE_j) - \uDEn(\tDE_{-N})\omega_a(\tDE_j)
 - \uDEn(\tDE_N)\omega_b(\tDE_j)\right\}S(j,h)(\DEtInv(t))\nonumber\\
&\quad + \uDEn(\tDE_{-N})\omega_a(t) + \uDEn(\tDE_{N})\omega_b(t),\nonumber
\end{align}
where $\ProjDE$ is defined by~\cref{eq:ProjDE}.
This procedure is referred to as the DE-Sinc-collocation method.

\subsection{Main result 2: Convergence of the DE-Sinc-collocation method}

In this paper,
we show the convergence of the DE-Sinc-collocation method
as follows.
The proof is provided in~\cref{sec:proof-DE}.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:DE-Sinc-collocation}
Let $\alpha$ and $d$ be positive constants with
$\alpha\leq 1$ and $d<\pi/2$.
Assume that
all the assumptions on $g$ and $k$ in~\cref{thm:DE-Sinc-Nystroem}
are fulfilled.
Furthermore, assume that $g$ and $k(\cdot,w)$
belong to $\MC_{\alpha}(\DEt(\domD_d))$ for all $w\in\DEt(\domD_d)$.
Let $h$ be selected by the formula~\cref{eq:h-DE}.
Then, there exists a positive integer $N_0$
such that for all $N\geq N_0$,
the coefficient matrix $(I_n - \kDEn)$ is invertible.
Furthermore, there exists a constant $C$ independent of $N$
such that for all $N\geq N_0$,
\[
 \|u - \vDEn\|_{C([a,b])}
\leq C \rme^{-\pi d N/\log(2 d N/\alpha)}.
\]
\end{theorem}

Compared to~\cref{thm:SE-Sinc-collocation,thm:RZ-Sinc-collocation},
we see that the convergence rate given by this theorem
is significantly improved.
