\begin{abstract}
Two different Sinc-collocation methods
for Volterra integral equations of the second kind
have been independently proposed
by Stenger and Rashidinia--Zarebnia.
However, their relationship remains unexplored.
This study theoretically examines the solutions of these two methods,
and reveals that they are not generally equivalent,
despite coinciding at the collocation points.
Strictly speaking, Stenger's method
assumes that the kernel of the integral
is a function of a single variable,
but this study theoretically justifies the use of
his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is
a function of two variables.
%that are derived from initial value problems,
%where the kernel of the integral
%is assumed to be a function of single variable.
%The assumption on the kernel seems essential
%because it is fully used in his theoretical discussion of the method.
%Contrary to the idea, this paper theoretically justifies the use of
%his method in general cases, i.e., the kernel is
%a function of two variables.
Then, this study rigorously proves that
both methods can attain the same, root-exponential convergence.
%which corresponds with the numerical observations in the previous study.
In addition to the contribution,
this study improves Stenger's method to attain significantly higher,
almost exponential convergence.
Numerical examples supporting the theoretical results are also provided.
%In this paper, two improved versions of an existing Sinc-collocation method
%for Volterra integral equations of the second kind are presented.
%The first method is close to the reformulation of the existing method
%in order to make it more practical and to reinforce it in theoretical way.
%Then it is rigorously proved that
%the convergence rate of the modified method is $\Order(\exp(-c\sqrt{N}))$,
%which corresponds with the numerical observations in the previous study.
%In the second method,
%the variable transformation employed in the first method,
%which is called the ``tanh transformation,''
%is replaced with the ``double exponential transformation.''
%%instead of the original ``tanh transformation.''
%This replacement improves the convergence rate to
%$\Order(\exp(-c N/\log N))$, which is proved
%in the same way as the first method.
%Numerical examples which support the theoretical results are also given.
