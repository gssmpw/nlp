Some of the early Deepfake detection techniques ____ also used visual biological artifacts to identify the authenticity of visual content. More recent methods  rely on  learning-based methods. Li et al.____ used several classic high-complexity deep neural networks to extract more detailed features from the forged videos and used them for the underlying classification task. Wu et al.____ proposed that spatial and temporal features can be used as detection targets. They model the temporal dimension with LSTM____ and employed  Xception____ for the convolutional network.
