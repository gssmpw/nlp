\label{Appendix:Dataset Samples}
In this section, we showcase one example from each diverse malicious instruction we leveraged from the dataset proposed by \citep{kumar2024refusal}, which has two categories and 16 harmful scenarios aiming to cover the real-world scenario. In the Malicious Type column, types that start from content\_ means Harmful Content Generation. The Web AI agent is instructed to generate harmful content and spread the harm to the Internet. On the other hand, categories action\_ stands for Harmful Interaction, the agent is instructed to create a series of browser events, such as clicks and page navigation, that generate harm on a given website. For each malicious task, the tasks are tested with the mock-up website specified in the Website column, while in the scenario of Real Website testing, it is the real version as the counterpart of the mockup website (e.g. \url{https://github.com/} is the real website we used to test pull request tasks). In our experiment, we drop the Malicious Type that doesn't have a real website that can be tested (e.g. Captcha, Messenger)
