\section{Future Works and Limitations}\label{sec:future}

Our research establishes a foundation for understanding the vulnerabilities of the Web AI agent and guiding for future advances, but several key areas remain open for exploration. First, incorporating a wider range of agent frameworks and diverse datasets could uncover deeper vulnerabilities and identify hidden behavioral patterns. 
Second, our findings suggest promising directions for designing jailbreak defenses with minimal performance trade-offs, such as embedding safety regulations directly into system prompts to mitigate malicious inputs.
Third, the influence of mock-up websites on agent behavior underscores the importance of creating realistic benchmarks, such as simulations of real web environments or tests within sandboxed real websites, to ensure accurate assessments.
Lastly, future work could focus on establishing automatic evaluation systems and developing nuanced metrics to detect subtle risks and unintended behaviors more effectively. 
By exploring these directions, future work can enhance Web AI agents' safety, robustness, and reliability, building upon our findings to drive meaningful improvements in the field.
