\section{Vulnerability: Inconsistent Rejection}
\label{Appendix:Inconsistent Rejection}
\textbf{Inconsistent Rejection:} From our experiments, we found that web agents when receiving malicious commands, sometimes will reject in the first place or during certain levels of multi-turn actions. After the rejection, it may start to change the plan and proceed, the plan may not contain explicitly harmful plans, but since it doesn't reject clearly and even proceed with actions afterward, we believe this vulnerability should be patched. A practical example is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Inconsistent Rejection}. We observe that this usually happens when agents encounter unexpected difficulties/errors such as login errors, webpage element localization errors, or execution errors, which happens mostly when agents interact with Real (complex) websites instead of the mock-up website that is easier to navigate. This highlights that it might introduce more vulnerabilities when agents operate in the real world during daily usage.
