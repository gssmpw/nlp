Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert custom concepts and generate the concepts in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on costly test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image training datasets without multi-image supervision, leading to worse image quality.
We propose a simple approach that addresses both limitations. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (\emph{SynCD}) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. We then propose a new encoder architecture based on shared attention mechanisms that better incorporate fine-grained visual details from input images. Finally, we propose a new inference technique that mitigates overexposure issues during inference by normalizing the text and image guidance vectors. Through extensive experiments, we show that our model, trained on the synthetic dataset with the proposed encoder and inference algorithm, outperforms existing tuning-free methods on standard customization benchmarks.
