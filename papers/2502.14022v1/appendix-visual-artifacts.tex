Lossy compressors allow for some distortion of the data to achieve smaller compressed file sizes. Since we work with augmented lossy compressors, we might observe visual artifacts in the decompressed data due to the distortion introduced during the compression process. Some artifacts become  more visible depending on the choice of transfer functions during volume rendering. 

%When performing volume renderings of decompressed data after it is compressed with our framework, we notice some visual artifacts due to the selection of transfer functions. 

If the visualization is particularly sensitive to small changes in the transfer function, the decompressed data can appear lighter or darker than the input (ground truth) when visualized with the same transfer function. This typically occurs when one region of a volume has relatively uniform values. 

We include visualizations of the visual artifacts for five datasets for augmented TTHRESH in \cref{fig:volume-render-adversarial}. 
We cannot find volume renderings that produce noticeable artifacts for the remaining four datasets. 
We do not consider Neurcomp as its augmented model preforms the worst. The remaining augmented compressors yield similar artifacts. The Miranda dataset appears to contain the most visual artifacts, where a turbulent front divides two nearly uniform regions.
