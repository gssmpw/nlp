TTK implements, in a generic and efficient way, a substantial collection of reference algorithms in TDA. Since its initial public release in 2017, both its user and developer bases have grown, resulting in a significant increase in the number of supported features. In contrast to the original paper introducing TTK [40] (which detailed the core algorithms and data structures of TTK), the purpose of this Softwaresoftware paper is to describe the list of features currently supported by TTK, ranging from image segmentation tools to advanced topological analysis of high-dimensional data, with concrete usage examples available on the TTK website [42].},
