\section{Conclusion and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduce a novel framework for augmenting \emph{any} lossy compressor to preserve the contour tree of a volumetric dataset while maintaining a user-specified global error bound. 
To do this, our framework first imposes topology-informed upper and lower bounds on each data point. 
It then progressively tightens those bounds until the contour tree is preserved. 
We also introduce a novel encoding scheme that efficiently stores individual points with variable precision and maintains these upper and lower bounds. 
When our framework is used to augment state-of-the-art lossy compressors, it is shown to preserve the contour trees of various scientific datasets.
Our augmented compressors also achieve higher compression ratios and reconstruction quality than those obtained by existing topology-preserving compressors in comparable or faster time.
Our framework will benefit from any advancement with lossy compression since it can be used to augment increasingly effective lossy compressors to achieve better topology-preserving compression. 

Our framework is not without limitations. The compression times are longer than the base compressors. This difference gets worse as the topological complexity of the data increases.
However, in some use-cases, topological preservation is preferable to run time.
Regardless, our framework would benefit from more efficient or parallel implementations for the contour/merge tree computation and the encoding scheme.
