\section{Compressor Configurations and Reconstruction Quality Curves}
\label{sec:reconstruction-quality-extra}

The TTK implementation of TopoQZ is tightly coupled with ZFP, which relies on two parameters: the persistence threshold $e$ and the pointwise error bound $\zeta$ associated with ZFP. 
This gives rise to a total pointwise error upper-bounded by $e+\zeta$. Admittedly, this bound may not be tight and we estimate the pointwise error bound of TopoQZ to be lower-bounded by $\max\{e, \zeta\}$ and upper-bounded by $e+\zeta$. Decreasing this bound will generally improve the run time of TopoQZ.   

We create plots demonstrating the trade off between bit-rate and respectively PSNR, Wasserstein distance $d_W$ and bottleneck distance $d_B$ for each augmented compressor, as well as TopoQZ and TopoSZ. 
Plots for Earthquake and QMCPACK are included in \cref{fig:reconstruction-quality}. Plots for the Tangaroa, Ionization, and Isabel datasets are included in \cref{fig:reconstruction-quality-appendix}. 
For the larger datasets, we are unable to compute the topological distances $d_W$ and $d_B$ using reasonable computational resources. 
To that end, for the Miranda, S3D, and SCALE-LETKF datasets, we only include plots of bit-rate vs PSNR, which can be found in \cref{fig:reconstruction-quality-appendix}. 
In the latter two large datasets (S3D and SCALE-LETKF), Augmented Neurcomp performs very poorly, and is an outlier. 
Thus, we do not plot its performance curves. 
For the Nyx dataset, because each individual trial has such a long run time, we do not generate any such curves. 
Some of the topological distances $d_W$ and $d_B$ could not be computed in reasonable time due to the large size or topological complexity of the dataset, thus are not plotted.

Most of the data is obtained for the augmented compressors and TopoSZ by setting $\varepsilon = 0.04$ and varying 
$\xi \in \{0.003, 0.006, 0.009, 0.012, 0.015, 0.018\}$. 
For TopoSZ, in order to obtain a wide range of values, we set $e = 0.04$ and vary $\zeta \in \{$ 0.003, 0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.44, 0.55 $\}$.

However, for roughly half of the curves associated with the augmented compressors, we use different values of $\xi$ due to a peculiarity that we observe. Under normal circumstances, if a compressor uses more bits to encode each data point (i.e., the bit-rate is higher), then it can more accurately reconstruct the data.
In some cases, however, we notice a negative correlation between bit-rate and reconstruction quality. This is unusual for compressors.

We do not know precisely why this trend sometimes occurs. We offer one possible explanation. For each $x \in \X$, let $U(x)$ and $L(x)$ denote the initial upper and lower bounds, respectively, for $x$, before error bound tightening. Recall that, before error bound tightening, it holds that $f(x) - \xi \leq L(X) \leq f'(x) \leq U(X) \leq f(x) + \xi$. Therefore, as $\xi$ decreases, the initial guess $f'(x)$ will become more accurate. Thus, as $\xi$ decreases, more of the contour tree will be preserved before the tightening step, and less tightening will occur. In practice, we notice that error bound tightening does not affect PSNR very much, but it does increase the bit-rate. As a result, if less error bound tightening occurs, then the bit-rate could be lower for lower values of $\xi$. We notice that when $\xi$ becomes very small, increasing $\xi$ always leads to increased bit-rate.

For each combination of a dataset and a compressor, we ensure that every time $\xi$ increases, the bit-rate also decreases. In order to do this, we sometimes need to vary $\xi$ for values other than the standard $0.003$ through $0.018$. To choose values for $\xi$, we typically search for new, lower values of $\xi$. However, for Augmented Neurcomp, due to its very long run times, we simply use  a subset of $\{0.003,0.006,0.009,0.012,0.015,0.018\}$ for which increasing $\xi$ always leads to decreasing bit-rate. We handle  TopoSZ and TopoQZ similarly to Augmented Neurcomp when the run times are long. The values of $\xi$ used to generate the plots are shown in \cref{tab:odd-parameter-configurations}.
