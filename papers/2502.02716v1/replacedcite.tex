\paragraph{Model Alignment} A wide body of research addresses the problem of model alignment____. One of the primary approaches for model alignment is training the model on datasets consisting of human preferences on model generations____. A similar approach utilizes model-generated feedback to train other models for alignment____. There are also a wide range of works that involve detecting when a language model may generate harmful text or hallucinations____. Another line of work aims to apply modifications to the model at generation time, including steering methods____. 

\textbf{Steering Model Behavior} ____ introduces the idea of learning a steering vector by optimizing the vector to maximize the probability of outputting target sentences. ____ learns a steering vector by optimizing an objective that increases the ratio between the likelihood of the positive target sentence and that of a negative sentence. Other steering methods learn the steering vector by using the model's intermediate activations on contrastive examples such as replacing ``love" with ``hate"____. Recent works have introduced methods that allow for more controlled applications of steering vectors by using thresholds or having multiple vectors____. ____ analyzes the generalization and reliability of steering vectors learned from CAA____, and ____ analyzes affine steering functions. Our analysis focuses on the performance and theoretical understanding behind different steering methods. In existing literature____, the comparison among different steering methods is limited to a single dataset or to simpler tasks such as classifying True/False statements. In contrast, we perform a more thorough evaluation and additionally provide theoretical reasoning to explain the performance of different methods in practice.
