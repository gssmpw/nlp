Following a post's creation at $t_0$, users perform engagement actions (view, like, comment, share, emoji) at timestamps $s_1$ through $s_8$. While individual actions occur continuously, engagement data is only collected at discrete observation points $t_j$, where each engagement vector $e_j$ captures the cumulative counts of different interaction types over intervals of length $\Delta t_j = t_{j+1} - t_j$.

On 28 October 2017, an anonymous 4chan user made a brief yet impactful post on the platform claiming that Hillary Clinton was to be arrested in the coming days.\footnote{\url{https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/}}
On 6 January 2021, devotees of then-outgoing President Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol building in an act of domestic terrorism designed to prevent President-elect Joe Biden's election victory from being confirmed. Five people died during and in the immediate aftermath of the attack, and an additional four died in the subsequent months \footnote{\url{https://www.factcheck.org/2021/11/how-many-died-as-a-result-of-capitol-riot/}}; and over 140 police officers were injured \footnote{\url{https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/capitol-riot-officers-honored.htm}}. 
Investigations by the Associated Press of the online social media profiles of over 120 of the rioters revealed high levels of adherence to the QAnon conspiracy theory that had begun just four years prior on 4chan.\footnote{\url{https://apnews.com/article/us-capitol-trump-supporters-1806ea8dc15a2c04f2a68acd6b55cace}}
Numerous explanations for the conspiracy's influence have been proposed, including its religious qualities~\citep{macmillen2022qanon}, its narrative and gaming attributes~\citep{haiven2022interview}, its inflammatory political and social values and its ability to quell uncertainty~\citep{young2022authoritarian}.
Given its ongoing impacts, the question must be asked: what if we could have seen this coming? More specifically, what if it had been possible to forecast the user engagement with this one 4chan account's postings and the fringe ideology that would morph into QAnon? Would we have been able to implement interventions to prevent these tragic outcomes?


We tackle the former question above and introduce \icmamba, a model capable of forecasting user engagement with online content. We go beyond the level of atomic posts to forecast the number of likes, shares, emoji reactions, and comments for ``emerging opinions'' – particular worldviews supported across a series of posts.
Our framework can forecast the arrival rate of posts supporting an opinion, and forecast the engagement for each, obtaining estimates of the total level of engagement for the entire opinion.
Our analysis leverages CrowdTangle data\footnote{\url{https://www.crowdtangle.com/}} with interval-censored engagement metrics, where observations are made at discrete time points with engagement counts recorded for each interval (as seen in \cref{fig:sample_ic_mamba}).

Recent deep learning approaches have made progress in modeling social media engagement through different architectural innovations: language models to capture coordinated posting behaviors~\citep{atanasov2019predicting,tian2023metatroll} and propagation models to model information diffusion~\citep{zannettou2019disinformation,im2020still,luceri2024unmasking,kong2023interval}. State space models have also demonstrated strong performance on sequential prediction tasks ~\citep{mamba,mamba2}, with their latent state representations theoretically well suited for temporal dependencies. However, these approaches face two key limitations when applied to mis/disinformation engagement forecasting: (1) they primarily focus on classification tasks rather than quantifying future temporal patterns of engagement, and (2) they struggle with the irregularly sampled nature of viral content progression.


\noindent\textbf{Our main contributions} address three research questions (RQs) at the intersection of temporal modeling and social media dynamics:

RQ1: \textit{How can we effectively model irregular temporal patterns in social media engagement?}: Through IC-Mamba's time-aware embeddings and state space model architecture, we capture the dynamics of online interactions, achieving a 4.72\% improvement over the state-of-the-art approaches. 

RQ2:\textit{Can we predict viral potential within the critical early window? }: \icmamba shows strong performance in the crucial 15-30 minute post-publication window (RMSE 0.118-0.143), while capturing both granular post-level dynamics and broader narrative patterns (F1 0.508-0.751 for narrative-level predictions).

RQ3: \textit{How effectively can we forecast the evolution of broader opinions?}: Our experiments demonstrate the model's ability to forecast opinion-level engagement dynamics over extended periods, using observation windows of 3, 7, and 10 days to predict spreading patterns up to 28 days ahead. \cref{fig:dynamic_pred} shows \icmamba's effectiveness in capturing long-term opinion proliferation and evolution.

As a tool, \icmamba streamlines the work of human experts, enabling earlier identification of problematic content, and therefore, providing more time to design and implement countermeasures.
