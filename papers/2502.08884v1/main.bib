ABSTRACT = {This survey presents algorithms for the automatic generation of content for virtual worlds, in particular for games. After a definition of the term procedural content generation, the algorithms to generate realistic objects such as landscapes and vegetation, road networks, buildings, living beings and stories are introduced in detail. In our discussion, we emphasize a good compromise between the realism of the objects and the performance of the algorithms. The survey also assesses each generated object type in terms of its applicability in games and simulations of virtual worlds.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the following research problem: How can we generate a meaningful split grammar that explains a given facade layout? To evaluate if a grammar is meaningful, we propose a cost function based on the description length and minimize this cost using an approximate dynamic programming framework. Our evaluation indicates that our framework extracts meaningful split grammars that are competitive with those of expert users, while some users and all competing automatic solutions are less successful.},

abstract = {This paper introduces corpus-guided top-down synthesis as a mechanism for synthesizing library functions that capture common functionality from a corpus of programs in a domain specific language (DSL). The algorithm builds abstractions directly from initial DSL primitives, using syntactic pattern matching of intermediate abstractions to intelligently prune the search space and guide the algorithm towards abstractions that maximally capture shared structures in the corpus. We present an implementation of the approach in a tool called Stitch and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art deductive library learning algorithm from DreamCoder. Our evaluation shows that Stitch is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster and uses 2 orders of magnitude less memory while maintaining comparable or better library quality (as measured by compressivity). We also demonstrate Stitch’s scalability on corpora containing hundreds of complex programs that are intractable with prior deductive approaches and show empirically that it is robust to terminating the search procedure early—further allowing it to scale to challenging datasets by means of early stopping.},

abstract = {Library learning compresses a given corpus of programs by extracting common structure from the corpus into reusable library functions. Prior work on library learning suffers from two limitations that prevent it from scaling to larger, more complex inputs. First, it explores too many candidate library functions that are not useful for compression. Second, it is not robust to syntactic variation in the input. We propose library learning modulo theory (LLMT), a new library learning algorithm that additionally takes as input an equational theory for a given problem domain. LLMT uses e-graphs and equality saturation to compactly represent the space of programs equivalent modulo the theory, and uses a novel e-graph anti-unification technique to find common patterns in the corpus more directly and efficiently. We implemented LLMT in a tool named babble. Our evaluation shows that babble achieves better compression orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art. We also provide a qualitative evaluation showing that babble learns reusable functions on inputs previously out of reach for library learning.},

abstract = {Representing complex 3D objects as simple geometric primitives, known as shape abstraction, is important for geometric modeling, structural analysis, and shape synthesis. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised shape abstraction method to map a point cloud into a compact cuboid representation. We jointly predict cuboid allocation as part segmentation and cuboid shapes and enforce the consistency between the segmentation and shape abstraction for self-learning. For the cuboid abstraction task, we transform the input point cloud into a set of parametric cuboids using a variational auto-encoder network. The segmentation network allocates each point into a cuboid considering the point-cuboid affinity. Without manual annotations of parts in point clouds, we design four novel losses to jointly supervise the two branches in terms of geometric similarity and cuboid compactness. We evaluate our method on multiple shape collections and demonstrate its superiority over existing shape abstraction methods. Moreover, based on our network architecture and learned representations, our approach supports various applications including structured shape generation, shape interpolation, and structural shape clustering.},

  abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites.  This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation.  We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},

Our key idea is to jointly encode and learn shape and point features from unlabeled 3D point clouds. For this purpose, we adapt HRNet to octree-based convolutional neural networks for jointly encoding shape and point features with fused multiresolution subnetworks and design a simple-yet-efficient Multiresolution Instance Discrimination (MID) loss for jointly learning the shape and point features. Our network takes a 3D point cloud as input and output both shape and point features. After training, Our network is concatenated with simple task-specific back-ends and fine-tuned for different shape analysis tasks. We evaluate the efficacy and generality of our method with a set of shape analysis tasks, including shape classification, semantic shape segmentation, as well as shape registration tasks. With simple back-ends, our network demonstrates the best performance among all unsupervised methods and achieves competitive performance to supervised methods. For fine-grained shape segmentation on the PartNet dataset, our method even surpasses existing supervised methods by a large margin.}, number={4}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wang, Peng-Shuai and Yang, Yu-Qi and Zou, Qian-Fang and Wu, Zhirong and Liu, Yang and Tong, Xin}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={2773-2781} }

abstract="Arguably one of the top success stories of deep learning is transfer learning. The finding that pre-training a network on a rich source set (e.g., ImageNet) can help boost performance once fine-tuned on a usually much smaller target set, has been instrumental to many applications in language and vision. Yet, very little is known about its usefulness in 3D point cloud understanding. We see this as an opportunity considering the effort required for annotating data in 3D. In this work, we aim at facilitating research on 3D representation learning. Different from previous works, we focus on high-level scene understanding tasks. To this end, we select a suit of diverse datasets and tasks to measure the effect of unsupervised pre-training on a large source set of 3D scenes. Our findings are extremely encouraging: using a unified triplet of architecture, source dataset, and contrastive loss for pre-training, we achieve improvement over recent best results in segmentation and detection across 6 different benchmarks for indoor and outdoor, real and synthetic datasets -- demonstrating that the learned representation can generalize across domains. Furthermore, the improvement was similar to supervised pre-training, suggesting that future efforts should favor scaling data collection over more detailed annotation. We hope these findings will encourage more research on unsupervised pretext task design for 3D deep learning.",

abstract = {Growing numbers of 3D scenes in online repositories provide new opportunities for data-driven scene understanding, editing, and synthesis. Despite the plethora of data now available online, most of it cannot be effectively used for data-driven applications because it lacks consistent segmentations, category labels, and/or functional groupings required for co-analysis. In this paper, we develop algorithms that infer such information via parsing with a probabilistic grammar learned from examples. First, given a collection of scene graphs with consistent hierarchies and labels, we train a probabilistic hierarchical grammar to represent the distributions of shapes, cardinalities, and spatial relationships of semantic objects within the collection. Then, we use the learned grammar to parse new scenes to assign them segmentations, labels, and hierarchies consistent with the collection. During experiments with these algorithms, we find that: they work effectively for scene graphs for indoor scenes commonly found online (bedrooms, classrooms, and libraries); they outperform alternative approaches that consider only shape similarities and/or spatial relationships without hierarchy; they require relatively small sets of training data; they are robust to moderate over-segmentation in the inputs; and, they can robustly transfer labels from one data set to another. As a result, the proposed algorithms can be used to provide consistent hierarchies for large collections of scenes within the same semantic class.},

abstract = {A majority of stock 3D models in modern shape repositories are assembled with many fine-grained components. The main cause of such data form is the component-wise modeling process widely practiced by human modelers. These modeling components thus inherently reflect some function-based shape decomposition the artist had in mind during modeling. On the other hand, modeling components represent an over-segmentation since a functional part is usually modeled as a multi-component assembly. Based on these observations, we advocate that labeled segmentation of stock 3D models should not overlook the modeling components and propose a learning solution to grouping and labeling of the fine-grained components. However, directly characterizing the shape of individual components for the purpose of labeling is unreliable, since they can be arbitrarily tiny and semantically meaningless. We propose to generate part hypotheses from the components based on a hierarchical grouping strategy, and perform labeling on those part groups instead of directly on the components. Part hypotheses are mid-level elements which are more probable to carry semantic information. A multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network is trained to extract context-aware features for the hypotheses. To accomplish a labeled segmentation of the whole shape, we formulate higher-order conditional random fields (CRFs) to infer an optimal label assignment for all components. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significantly robust labeling results on raw 3D models from public shape repositories. Our work also contributes the first benchmark for component-wise labeling.},
