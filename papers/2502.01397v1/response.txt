The idea of using GNN for learning sparse factorized preconditioners has been considered in several works **Kipf, "Variational Graph Autoencoders"**__**Velickovic et al., "Graph Attention Networks"**.
Another line of work covers iterative solvers rather than preconditioners, see, for example,**Krakovska et al., "Graph Neural Networks for Solving Linear Systems"**.
On the other hand, the limitations of message-passing GNN have already been highlighted in the literature for other tasks.

For example, in the foundational work **Maron and Slepukhin, "Graph Isomorphism Test as a Lower Bound on Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks"**, where it has been shown
that are provably bounded by the expressive power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test, 
which renders them incapable of distinguishing 
certain graph structures or capturing higher-order dependencies.
