\section{Related Works}
The idea of using GNN for learning sparse factorized preconditioners has been considered in several works 
\cite{hausner2023neural,trifonov2024learning,li2023learning,li2024generative,chen2024graph,booth2024neural}.
Another line of work covers iterative solvers rather than preconditioners, see, for example,~\cite{luoneural}.
On the other hand, the limitations of message-passing GNN have already been highlighted in the literature for other tasks.

For example, in the foundational work~\cite{xu2018powerful}, where it has been shown
that are provably bounded by the expressive power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test, 
which renders them incapable of distinguishing 
certain graph structures or capturing higher-order dependencies.
