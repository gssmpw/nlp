\section{Related Works}
The idea of using GNN for learning sparse factorized preconditioners has been considered in several works 
____.
Another line of work covers iterative solvers rather than preconditioners, see, for example,____.
On the other hand, the limitations of message-passing GNN have already been highlighted in the literature for other tasks.

For example, in the foundational work____, where it has been shown
that are provably bounded by the expressive power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test, 
which renders them incapable of distinguishing 
certain graph structures or capturing higher-order dependencies.
