\begin{abstract}
\textcolor{red}{This paper discusses and contains offensive content.} Language models (LMs) are used in decision-making systems and as interactive assistants. However, how well do these models making judgements align with the diversity of human values, particularly regarding social and moral norms? In this work, we investigate how inclusively LMs perceive norms across demographic groups (e.g., gender, age, and income). We prompt 11 LMs on rules-of-thumb (RoTs) and compare their outputs with the existing responses of 100 human annotators. We introduce the Absolute Distance Alignment Metric (ADA-Met) to quantify alignment on ordinal questions. We find notable disparities in LM responses, with younger, higher-income groups showing closer alignment, raising concerns about the representation of marginalized perspectives. Our findings highlight the importance of further efforts to make LMs more inclusive of diverse human values.

\section{Introduction}
As language models (LMs) are increasingly being prompted for subjective judgments, understanding whose opinions models reflect is important \citep{Santurkar2023whose}. Social and moral norms—shaped by culture and society—are often at the core of judgments, guiding what is acceptable behavior \citep{balagopalan2023judging}. Given the influence that LMs can have on shaping user beliefs \citep{Sharma2024sycophancy}, misalignment with human values or inherent biases can reinforce harmful stereotypes or exclusionary views, deepening societal inequities \citep{durmus2024measuringrepresentationsubjectiveglobal}. This is problematic as LMs have already been shown to contain racial, gender, and political bias \cite{perez-etal-2023-discovering, wan-etal-2023-kelly, Ovalle2023centering}. 

To better understand subjective annotation, \citet{weerasooriya-etal-2023-vicarious} introduced the concept of vicarious offense, in which annotators not only label data based on their own opinion of offensiveness, but also consider what others might perceive as offensive. This approach builds on Bayesian truth serum (BTS) \cite{Prelec2004}, which encourages more honest responses by incorporating individuals’ beliefs about the opinions of others. BTS is grounded in the Bayesian assumption that individuals form a mental model of the world shaped by their personal experiences, often leading them to overestimate how widely their own opinions are shared among others \cite{Frank2017}.

     \caption{Experimental pipeline of creating prompts, prompting LMs, extracting answers, and comparing LM-generated vs human responses.}
     \label{fig:illustration}
 \end{figure*}

Recent work has applied vicarious annotation to study how demographic factors influence rater disagreement in politically sensitive contexts \citep{pandita-etal-2024-rater}. However, there hasn't been research on how LMs \textit{perceive} human norms. To address this gap, we pose the research question: \textit{How inclusively do language models perceive social and moral norms across different demographic groups?}

In this study, we examine 11 LMs by prompting them with rules-of-thumb (RoT) related to social and moral topics, and we compare their outputs with existing responses from 100 human annotators across demographic backgrounds \citep{forbes-etal-2020-social}. Figure \ref{fig:ROTdefinitions} provides RoT examples and details the anticipated agreement question posed to human and LM annotators. To quantify how responses align, we introduce the Absolute Distance Alignment Metric (ADA-Met), a metric that captures the distances between ordinal responses.

Our key contributions are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Analyzing the alignment of LMs with different demographic groups on norms.
    \item Introducing the Absolute Distance Alignment Metric (ADA-Met), a ordinal metric to quantify LM-human alignment.
    \item Assessing the agreement across LMs, finding patterns in their reflection of societal norms.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset}
\paragraph{Social Chemistry 101} In this work, we utilize the Social Chemistry 101 Dataset\footnote{\url{https://maxwellforbes.com/social-chemistry/}} \citep{forbes-etal-2020-social}, a learn-to-reason dataset on social and moral norms annotated via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Specifically, we only use the 400 RoTs that have been labeled by 50 human annotators each. This subset is comprised of 100 RoTs from each of the following data sources: the subreddit \textit{r/confessions} (CONF), which contains often explicit user confessions about their actions; the subreddit \textit{r/amitheasshole} (AITA), where users seek moral judgments on interpersonal scenarios; \textit{rocstories} (ROC), derived from the ROCStories corpus \citep{mostafazadeh-etal-2016-corpus}, is a collection of everyday life stories; and \textit{Dear Abby}\footnote{\url{https://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/archives}} (DEAR), which is drawn from advice columns where individuals seek moral guidance. Further details are in Appendix \ref{app: Social_Chemistry}.

\paragraph{Demographics for Social Chemistry 101}
The publicly available Social Chemistry 101 dataset does not include annotator demographics. Following prior work \cite{wan2023demographic}, we obtained this information by contacting the dataset's creators. The demographic information includes gender, age, and income, with full details provided in Appendix \ref{app: demo_distr_hum_annot}.

\paragraph{Prompts and Task Design}
\label{sec: Methodology}
The LM prompting, extraction process, and human alignment analysis is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:illustration}. This work's prompts are designed to be similar to a task posed to the human annotators in the creation of the Social Chemistry 101 dataset. The anticipated agreement options are ordinal (\textit{<1\%
, 5\%-25\%, 50\%,
75\%-90\%, >90\%}). The binning was done in the Social Chemistry dataset to reduce cognitive load during annotation \citep{forbes-etal-2020-social, wang-etal-2018-modeling}. Annotations are used to compare human beliefs across demographics and how LMs align with them. LMs were tested using three different prompts: zero-shot, zero-shot with option descriptions, and zero-shot with option descriptions presented in a markdown table. Prompts are in Appendix \ref{app:prompts}.




\paragraph{Models}
 
The models tested include dbrx-instruct \cite{mosaic2024dbrx}, gemini-1.0-pro-001, gemini-1.5-pro-001 \cite{geminiteam2024geminifamilyhighlycapable}, gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09, gpt-4o-2024-08-06 \cite{gpt4}, Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo, Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo, Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo \cite{llama2023}, Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 \cite{jiang2024mixtralexperts}, and snowflake-arctic-instruct \cite{SAR2024snowflakearctic}.

\subsection{Metrics for Alignment} To analyze alignment between human annotators and LMs, we use Krippendorff's $\alpha$ \citep{krippendorff2013content}, and a new human-LM alignment metric - Absolute-Distance Alignment (ADA-Met).

%\subsection{Metrics for Alignment} To analyze alignment between human annotators and LMs, we use Krippendorff's $\alpha$ \citep{krippendorff2013content}, Mann-Whitney U Tests \citep{mcknight2010mann}, accuracy and a new human-LM alignment metric - Absolute-Distance Alignment (ADA-Met).

\paragraph{ADA-Met} In this work, humans and LMs answer questions with ordinal options (A < B < C < D < E). The problem with using accuracy as a metric for this task is that it treats these options as categorical, failing to account for their relative ordinal distances.  For instance, treating both "A" and "E" as equally incorrect when the correct answer is "B" ignores how far each option is from the correct one. To address this issue, we developed ADA-Met, a metric that measures the specific distances between ordinal responses.

In ADA-Met, the answer choices are mapped to numbers representing their ordinal positions: \textit{{A:0, B:1, C:2, D:3, E:4}}. To compare the responses of human annotators to those of LMs, human responses are aggregated by selecting the most frequently chosen option for each RoT. The ADA-Met between the response $s_l$ from LM $l$ and the mode of human responses $s_H$ from human group $H$ for RoT $i$ (where $i=1,2,...,400$) is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
\text{ADA-Met}_i = |mode(s_{H_i}) - s_{l_i}| 
\label{eq:adamet}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\text{ADA-Met}_i \in [0, 4]$. We use Equation \ref{eq:average-adamet} below to calculate the average ADA-Met for each data source. 

\begin{equation}
\overline{\text{ADA-Met}}_{R_j} = \frac{1}{n_{R_j}} \sum_{i \in R_j} \text{ADA-Met}_i
\label{eq:average-adamet}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here, \(n_{R_j}\) is the total number of RoTs in subset \(R_j\), and \(R_j\) represents the set of RoTs corresponding to the data sources: CONF (\(R_1\)), AITA (\(R_2\)), ROC (\(R_3\)), and DEAR (\(R_4\)). A lower \(\overline{\text{ADA-Met}}_{R_j}\) value indicates closer alignment between the responses from the LM's outputs and the human subset. 

\paragraph{ADA-Met for Demographic Groups}
To analyze how LM alignment varies across demographic groups (e.g., age, gender, income), we calculate the average ADA-Met for demographic group \(D_k\) across all RoTs, regardless of the data source, using Equation \ref{eq:demo-average-adamet}:

\begin{equation}
\overline{\text{ADA-Met}}_{D_k} = \frac{1}{n_{D_k}} \sum_{i=1}^{n_{D_k}} \text{ADA-Met}_i
\label{eq:demo-average-adamet}
\end{equation}

\noindent where \(n_{D_k}\) is the total number of RoTs across all data sources for demographic group \(D_k\). Further details on ADA-Met is in Appendix \ref{app: MetricsAlignmentDetails}.

\section{Results and Analysis}
We analyze human-LM agreement in terms of \(\overline{\text{ADA-Met}}_{R_j}\) (\S\ref{sec:Human-LM-Analysis}), explore demographic-LM alignment (\S\ref{sec:Demographic-LM-Analysis}), and finally evaluate agreement among different annotator groups (\S\ref{sec:Inter-Annotator-Analysis}).

\subsection{Human-LM Alignment Analysis}
\label{sec:Human-LM-Analysis}

Table \ref{tb: areawise_alignment} presents the \(\overline{\text{ADA-Met}}_{R_j}\) values for different LMs across various datasets. In Zero-Shot Table, Arctic and Llama-3.1-405B demonstrate the highest alignment with human responses (see Appendix \ref{app: Distributions} for ADA-Met distributions). 

Notably, when models are provided with a table of option descriptions, alignment with human responses improves for most models. This suggests that models are able to better interpret and align with human responses when given explicit tabular descriptions, likely because they can parse structured markdown tables better \citep{sui2024table}. We also report in Appendix \ref{app: RefusalAnalysis} that Llama-3.1-8B and Llama-3.1-405B refused to answer more than the other models. Examples of RoTs and LM refusal responses, shown in Appendix \ref{app: RefusalAnalysis}, generally involve controversial topics, such as those related to sexual conduct or mental health.

\subsection{Demographic-LM Alignment Analysis}
\label{sec:Demographic-LM-Analysis}

We use the demographic information in Appendix \ref{app: demo_distr_hum_annot} and Equation \ref{eq:demo-average-adamet} to find the lowest \(\overline{\text{ADA-Met}}_{D_k}\) for each demographic group. Figure \ref{fig:demographics} shows that LMs tend to align most closely with a narrow demographic range, primarily younger individuals (under 40) and those from affluent backgrounds. Additionally, Table \ref{tb:demographic} reveals limited representation across marital and parental status.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption{LM alignment with demographic groups based on age, income, and gender. The circle positions correspond to demographic bins, rather than specific values.}
    \label{fig:demographics}
\end{figure}

%\subsection{Human-LM Distribution Analysis}
%\label{sec:Human-LM-Distribution-Analysis}

\subsection{Inter-Annotator Agreement}
\label{sec:Inter-Annotator-Analysis}
To measure agreement between multiple LMs and human annotators, we use Krippendorff's $\alpha$. Our results in Appendix \ref{app: KrippendorfAlpha} show that  LMs tend to disagree among themselves less (zero-shot: 0.109, description: 0.112, table: 0.155) than all human annotators (-0.032). Additionally, LMs within the same family show higher levels of agreement, and zero-shot table prompts tend to produce greater consensus. The higher agreement among LMs compared to humans on these subjective questions suggests that LMs may restrict the representation of minority perceptions \citep{prabhakaran-etal-2021-releasing}.

\section{Related Work}
Research has been conducted to understand and measure the unwanted effects of biases in LMs, such as those related to gender, religion, race, and politics \citep{zhao-etal-2017-men, naous-etal-2024-beer, blodgett-etal-2020-language, motoki2023more, hartmann2023politicalideologyconversationalai}.  To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has analyzed how LMs align with specific demographics in perceiving social and moral norms. For subjective labeling tasks, annotators need to use their own judgement which has been shown to be influenced by human demographics \citep{sap-etal-2022-annotators, luo-etal-2020-detecting, goyal2022toxicity}. Other studies have shown that knowing annotator demographic information can help predict annotation disagreement \citep{wan2023demographic}. %Recently, \citet{naous-etal-2024-beer} showed how multilingual and Arabic LMs exhibit bias towards entities associated with Western culture.

\section{Conclusion}
This study explored how LMs perceive social and moral norms by comparing their responses to aggregated human responses for a variety of RoTs using ADA-Met. Our findings show that LMs tend to align with younger, wealthier adults, which raises concerns about the lack of representation for other demographic groups. This imbalance has the potential to reinforce existing social inequalities, underscoring the need for more inclusive model training and evaluation approaches to better reflect diverse human perspectives. 

\section*{Ethics Statement}
All language models used in this study are publicly available under their respective license categories. We acknowledge that the Social Chemistry 101 dataset was annotated exclusively by U.S. residents, which may limit its applicability to broader cultural perspectives.

\paragraph{Social Impact} Our findings highlight biases in LMs and encourage the development of models that better reflect diverse viewpoints.

\section*{Limitations}

Our study has several limitations. First, the dataset has a geographic bias, as all annotations were provided by U.S. residents. Second, we analyze the only 400 RoT that were labeled by 50 each (100 annotators in total) instead of the 292k
RoT from the Social Chemistry dataset that were mostly labeled by 1 annotator. Third, social and moral norms change over time. We conducted LM inference in August 2024, while the Social Chemistry dataset was collected between November 2019 and May 2020, potentially introducing temporal discrepancies. 

\paragraph{Label Variation} ADA-Met aggregates human responses using the mode, or the arithmetic mean in case of ties, reflecting the collective judgment of the group. While this aligns with the definition of a norm as a majority consensus, it overlooks human label variation \cite{plank-2022-problem}. Future work could better account for annotator diversity while maintaining alignment with collective norms.

\section{Additional Dataset Details}
In this section, we provide further details on the Social Chemistry 101 dataset that is relevant to our analysis.

\label{app: Additional_dataset_details}
\subsection{Social Chemistry 101 Data Sources}
\label{app: Social_Chemistry}
The 400 RoT subset that have has been labeled by 50 human annotators each (100 annotators in total) were equally derived from each of the four data sources below.

\paragraph{r/confessions (CONF)} This subreddit contains user confessions about personal actions, often dealing with morally complex or explicit topics. These confessions frequently present situations where the appropriateness or morality of actions is questioned.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example 1: "It's wrong to sleep around."
    \item Example 2: "It's bad to start relationships in the workplace."
    \item Example 3: "It's rude to mislead people about your health."
\end{itemize}
        
\paragraph{r/amitheasshole (AITA)} In this subreddit, users present real-life interpersonal scenarios and seek moral judgments from the community. These posts often revolve around determining who is in the wrong in particular social situations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example 1: "It's expected that you won't exchange goods and money for sexual photos when you're married."
    \item Example 2: "It is understandable to call the police when you know someone is committing a crime."
    \item Example 3: "You should always help out your family with money."
\end{itemize}
        
\paragraph{ROCStories (ROC)} Derived from the ROCStories corpus \citep{mostafazadeh-etal-2016-corpus}, this source features short, five-sentence stories that describe everyday situations and interactions, often reflecting common life experiences and societal norms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example 1: "It's understandable if you don't want your teacher to express their political leanings."
    \item Example 2: "It is dramatic to run to the doctor everytime your child feels sick."
    \item Example 3: "It's good to work at home."
\end{itemize}
        
\paragraph{Dear Abby (DEAR)} This source is drawn from the popular advice column \textit{Dear Abby}\footnote{\url{https://www.uexpress.com/dearabby/archives}} where individuals seek practical and moral guidance on a variety of life issues. The questions and advice provided in this dataset reflect the moral and social considerations of the advice-seekers and the columnist.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Example 1: "You shouldn't video tape someone without their permission."
    \item Example 2: "It is good to be patient."
    \item Example 3: "It is ok to live with a roommate of the opposite sex if you are just friends."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Demographic Distribution of Human Annotators}
\label{app: demo_distr_hum_annot}
The demographic distribution of the 100 annotators in the Social Chemistry 101 subset studied in this paper is shown in Table \ref{tb:annotator_demographics}. For categories with relatively sparse data, such as adults over the age of 50, we merged the 50-59 and 60-69 bins into a 50-69 bin. Note that there are no personal identifiers in the Social Chemistry dataset that we used—only annotator IDs.

\subsection{Krippendorff's $\alpha$}
\label{app: KrippendorfAlpha}
Krippendorff’s alpha is used to assess agreement among different annotator groups - all humans, all LMs, as well as among model families. Each LM or human group can be thought of as an independent annotator, assigning one of 5 options - A, B, C, D or E to each RoT. Mathematically, Krippendorff's $\alpha$ is given by the equation:

\begin{equation}
\alpha = 1 - \frac{D_o}{D_e}
\end{equation}

where, $D_o$ indicates the disagreement observed, and $D_e$ indicates the disagreement expected by chance. A value of $\alpha = 1$ indicates perfect agreement, a negative $\alpha$ indicates disagreement exceeding chance, and a positive $\alpha$ indicates more agreement than chance. We use the IrrCAC\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/irrCAC/}} Python library to compute the Krippendorff's $\alpha$.

%\subsection{Mann-Whitney U Test}
%\label{app: Mann-Whitney}
%This statistical test is used to determine if there are significant differences between the distributions of human-LM responses.

\subsection{Why Not Accuracy}
\label{app: Accuracy}

For alignment tasks, accuracy can typically be used to assess how often aggregated human and LM responses completely align on answers. However, for cases when the aggregated human response is a tie, accuracy is not a good metric. For example, suppose the aggregated human responses for a specific RoT \(i\) results in a tie between options B (mapped to 1) and C (mapped to 2). In this case, the aggregated human response \(s_{H_i}\) for RoT \(i\) is computed by taking the arithmetic mean of these two values:
\[
s_{H_i} = \frac{1 + 2}{2} = 1.5
\]
If the LM provides an output of B (which is mapped to 1), accuracy would consider this a complete mismatch because the LM response (1) does not exactly equal the human consensus (1.5). This demonstrates a key weakness of accuracy as a metric: it only considers exact matches, ignoring how close or far the LM response is from the human consensus. In this case, although the LM response is reasonably close to the human response, accuracy would fail to reflect this, treating the result as equally incorrect as a response that is much further from the human consensus (such as D or E).

\subsection{ADA-Met} \label{app: ADA-MET} 
In ADA-Met, each human response is mapped to an ordinal value, and the metric calculates the absolute difference between the LLM's predicted value and the aggregated human response. The aggregated human response is determined by selecting the most frequently chosen option for each RoT. In cases where there is a tie between the most frequent choices, the arithmetic mean of the tied options is used.

Figure \ref{fig:AbsoluteDistanceAlignment} visualizes how ADA-Met is calculated. In cases where LMs refuse to answer or provides an irrelevant response, we assign a value of 4, which corresponds to the maximum possible distance between the LM response and human responses. This is because these answers can be viewed similarly to an incorrect response under the accuracy metric, where any response that deviates from the correct answer is considered equally incorrect. However, in ADA-Met, the magnitude of the misalignment matters, and these answers represent the furthest possible deviation from any valid response. Therefore, assigning the maximum distance reflects the model's complete lack of alignment with the human choices. It is important to note that in our study, there were only 2 instances where an LM provided an irrelevant response.

\section{Model Implementation Details}
\label{app: ImplementationDetails}
Each LM was inferenced between August 11, 2024 and August 12, 2024 at a \textit{temperature} setting of 0.00 (for reproducibility). GPT models were inferenced through the OpenAI API\footnote{\url{https://openai.com/blog/openai-api}}. Gemini models were inferenced through the Gemini API\footnote{\url{https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference}} with all the safety settings set to block none. The other LMs were inferenced through Together AI\footnote{\url{https://api.together.xyz}}.

\section{ADA-Met Distributions}
\label{app: Distributions}
Figure \ref{fig:histogramstable} depicts the distribution of human-LM ADA-Met distances for different LMs. We observe that responses from Arctic and Llama-3.1-405B are mostly 0 or 1 option away from the human choice. This indicates a strong agreement between humans and LMs.

\section{Refusal to Answer}
\label{app: RefusalAnalysis}

To use LMs as annotators effectively, it is important to assess what LMs will or will not answer compared to the human annotators who annotated the entire dataset. Table \ref{tb:refusal_table} shows that Llama 3.1-405B and Llama 3.1-8B refused to answer more often than other models. Table \ref{tb:refusal_responses} shows examples of RoTs and corresponding refusal to answer responses from Llama 3.1-405B  with the Zero-Shot prompt.  These examples show that refusals generally occurred for sensitive or controversial topics, such as those involving sexual conduct or mental health. It is clear that the model has been tuned to not answer these types of questions. However, not all the LM responses are high quality as the refusal explanations for the RoTs "It’s normal for married couples
to have sexual relations." and "Is wrong to be a pervert" need improvement.
