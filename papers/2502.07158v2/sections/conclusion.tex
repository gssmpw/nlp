\section{Conclusion}
Electronic health records contain a wealth of patient information that can be leveraged to study risk factors for the early detection of pediatric cardiac arrest. 
In this paper, we introduce \modelname, a novel multimodal fused transformer that effectively handle the heterogeneous multi-resolution EHR data. Extensive experiments on a curated pediatric cohort demonstrate the effectiveness of \modelname, indicating its potential translational impact in clinical settings.
In the future, we plan to (1) extend our methodology to more diverse datasets and incorporate other modalities (\textit{e.g.}, clinical notes, waveforms) to further enhance predictive accuracy; (2) Explore continuous risk monitoring scenarios that enable real-time prediction updates at fixed time intervals or when new risk factor data becomes available.
