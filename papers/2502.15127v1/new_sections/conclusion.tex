\section{Conclusion}

Our research establishes a novel two-phase framework for evaluating educational AI systems through their ability to predict specific student misconceptions. While a simpler unconditioned approach would only validate population-level pattern matching, our two-phase design requires AI systems to demonstrate genuine understanding of individual student cognition. We show that success in this conditioned prediction task implies broader capabilities in providing targeted feedback and personalized tutoring interventions. This work bridges a critical gap in educational AI evaluation by providing immediate, theoretically-grounded validation of an AI system's ability to model student thinking, rather than relying on lengthy outcome studies with numerous confounding variables. By establishing both theoretical guarantees and practical evaluation methods that specifically test understanding of individual student reasoning, our framework lays the foundation for developing AI systems that can truly understand and support each student's unique learning journey - a crucial step toward meaningful AI-supported education.
