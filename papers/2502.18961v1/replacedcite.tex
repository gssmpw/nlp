The efficient evaluation of \acp{KG} accuracy has been largely overlooked. The first approach, KGEval ____, is an iterative algorithm that alternates between control and inference stages. In the control stage, KGEval uses crowdsourcing to select facts for evaluation. In the inference stage, it applies type consistency and Horn-clause coupling constraints____ to the evaluated facts to automatically estimate the correctness of additional facts. This process repeats until no more facts are evaluated. KGEval does not scale to real-life \acp{KG}____ and is susceptible to error propagation due to its probabilistic inference mechanism, making it unsuitable for our work.

To overcome KGEval limitations, ____ resorted to sampling strategies and estimators that gauge \ac{KG} accuracy with statistical guarantees. To minimize annotation costs, ____ proposed the use of cluster sampling techniques (i.e., \ac{TWCS}) over standard sampling (i.e., \ac{SRS}). On the other hand, the authors relied on the Wald interval____, known to have reliability issues when used on binomial proportions____. To address Wald issues for \ac{KG} accuracy evaluation, ____ proposed to use the Wilson interval____, being it better suited for binomial proportions.

Although reliable, the Wilson interval shares Wald's frequentist interpretation, preventing a one-shot probabilistic understanding of its reliability. Additionally, the interval balances efficiency and reliability, sometimes requiring more annotations than Wald for greater reliability. In contrast, our solution offers a one-shot interpretation of interval confidence, making it better suited for the task while remaining the most efficient option. Moreover, the proposed approach, $a$HPD, eliminates the need for analysts to select a specific prior, addressing a key barrier to using Bayesian methods.

____ developed an efficient human-machine collaborative framework to minimize annotation costs through inference. This framework leverages statistical techniques similar to those in____ and combines inference mechanisms akin to those in____. Their work focuses on the interplay between human annotations and inference mechanisms rather than on \acp{CI} and their impact on the minimization problem. Therefore, we do not include their method in our experimental analysis, but the $a$HPD method can be integrated into ____'s framework to enhance efficiency.
