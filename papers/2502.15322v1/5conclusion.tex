\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conclusion}

% In this paper, we focused on knowledge-based visual question answering and argued that image caption is very important to this issue. 
In this paper, we introduced metadata into image sentiment analysis and proposed a unified metadata-enhanced sentiment transformer.
Specifically, we first obtained multiple metadata and unified their representations with images. Then, we further developed an adaptive relevance learning module and a cross-modal fusion module for better sentiment prediction.
Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrated the superiority and rationality of our proposed method.
