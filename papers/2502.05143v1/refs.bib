title = {Refactoring test code},
year = {2001},
institution = {CWI (Centre for Mathematics and Computer Science)},
address = {NLD},
abstract = {Two key aspects of extreme programming (XP) are unit testing and merciless refactoring. Given the fact that the ideal test code / production code ratio approaches 1:1, it is not surprising that unit tests are being refactored. We found that refactoring test code is different from refactoring production code in two ways: (1) there is a distinct set of bad smells involved, and (2) improving test code involves additional test-specific refactorings. To share our experiences with other XP practitioners, we describe a set of bad smells that indicate trouble in test code, and a collection of test refactorings to remove these smells.}
