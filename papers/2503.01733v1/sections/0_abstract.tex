Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using ambient sensors has great potential for practical applications, particularly in elder care and independent living. However, deploying HAR systems in real-world settings remains challenging due to the high cost of labeled data, the need for pre-segmented sensor streams, and the lack of flexibility in activity granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce \ToolName{}, a method designed to \textit{discover} fine-grained human sub-activities from unlabeled sensor data without relying on pre-segmentation. \ToolName{} combines unsupervised feature extraction and clustering with a user-friendly visualization tool to streamline the labeling process. \ToolName{} enables domain experts to efficiently annotate only a minimal set of representative cluster centroids, reducing the annotation workload to a small number of samples ($0.05\%$ of our dataset). We demonstrate \ToolName{}â€™s effectiveness through a re-annotation exercise on widely used HAR datasets, showing that it uncovers finer-grained activities and produces more nuanced annotations than traditional coarse labels. 
\ToolName{} represents a step toward practical, deployable HAR systems that adapt to diverse real environments.
