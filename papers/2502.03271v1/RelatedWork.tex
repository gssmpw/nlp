\section{Related Work}
\noindent{\bf Research on \bugs in C++/Javascript.} In other programming languages, there are a large number of existing works focusing on \bugs. 
For instance, C++ supports implicit type conversion which can lead to significant issues; thus, numerous scholars have developed various methods to identify the \bugs \cite{jeon2017hextype, haller2016typesan, duck2018effectivesan, lee2015type}. 
Given that C++ includes diverse type casting abilities and runtime polymorphism,
detectors for such bugs must integrate runtime analysis techniques while also managing performance overhead. 
To enhance performance, \texttt{TypeSan}\cite{haller2016typesan} developed a framework capable of efficiently monitoring memory allocation details. 
There are also several research works focusing on \bugs in Javascript\cite{pradel2015typedevil, 9842686, 7958598}. 
% Javascript is a dynamically typed language, which means the types are not decided until the runtime. 
Type-related issues in C++ are deemed more severe as they directly contribute to memory safety problems, whereas Javascript typically operates within constrained settings like web browsers. 
Although Rust is engineered with improved type-safety compared to C++ and Javascript, our research shows that type-related errors can still occur in Rust.

\noindent{\bf Research on unsafe Rust.}
A substantial body of research explores how the use of \texttt{unsafe} can compromise the integrity of Rust programs~\cite{Qin2020ReplicationPF, Evans2020IsRU, Xu2020MemorySafetyCC, zhang2022towards, papaevripides2021exploiting, mergendahl2022cross, rivera2021keeping, kirth2022pkru}. 
Xu~et al. analyzed hundreds of memory-safety issues, determining that safety assurances can be violated by \texttt{unsafe} code~\cite{Xu2020MemorySafetyCC}, while other works study how to protect the Rust program~\cite{rivera2021keeping, kirth2022pkru}. 
Additionally, some scholars have investigated both memory-safety and concurrency issues, assessing the effects of eliminating unsafe code~\cite{Qin2020ReplicationPF}. 
\texttt{Rudra}~\cite{Yechan2021Rudra} and \texttt{MirChecker}~\cite{Zhuohua2021MirChecker} are specifically designed to target functions that incorporate unsafe code
and detect memory-safety issues.

Observations from our research also suggest a significant correlation between  \bugs in Rust and the use of unsafe code. \looseness=-1
