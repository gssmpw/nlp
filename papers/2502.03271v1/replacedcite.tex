\section{Related Work}
\noindent{\bf Research on \bugs in C++/Javascript.} In other programming languages, there are a large number of existing works focusing on \bugs. 
For instance, C++ supports implicit type conversion which can lead to significant issues; thus, numerous scholars have developed various methods to identify the \bugs ____. 
Given that C++ includes diverse type casting abilities and runtime polymorphism,
detectors for such bugs must integrate runtime analysis techniques while also managing performance overhead. 
To enhance performance, \texttt{TypeSan}____ developed a framework capable of efficiently monitoring memory allocation details. 
There are also several research works focusing on \bugs in Javascript____. 
% Javascript is a dynamically typed language, which means the types are not decided until the runtime. 
Type-related issues in C++ are deemed more severe as they directly contribute to memory safety problems, whereas Javascript typically operates within constrained settings like web browsers. 
Although Rust is engineered with improved type-safety compared to C++ and Javascript, our research shows that type-related errors can still occur in Rust.

\noindent{\bf Research on unsafe Rust.}
A substantial body of research explores how the use of \texttt{unsafe} can compromise the integrity of Rust programs____. 
Xu~et al. analyzed hundreds of memory-safety issues, determining that safety assurances can be violated by \texttt{unsafe} code____, while other works study how to protect the Rust program____. 
Additionally, some scholars have investigated both memory-safety and concurrency issues, assessing the effects of eliminating unsafe code____. 
\texttt{Rudra}____ and \texttt{MirChecker}____ are specifically designed to target functions that incorporate unsafe code
and detect memory-safety issues.

Observations from our research also suggest a significant correlation between  \bugs in Rust and the use of unsafe code. \looseness=-1
