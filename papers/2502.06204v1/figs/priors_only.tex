In each scenario, two friends are talking about the price of an item.
Please read the scenarios carefully and provide the probability that the item has the desribed price.
Provide the estimates on a continuous scale between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for "impossible" and 1 stands for "extremely likely".
Write ONLY your final answer as 'A:<rating>'.

EXAMPLE:
Anne bought a new toaster. A friend asked her, "Was it expensive?" Anne said, "It cost $1000."
Please provide the probability that the toaster cost $50.
Let's think step by step and consider the prior probability of toaster prices.
Given general world knowledge, it is unlikely that a toaster costs literally $1000. Rather, a price around $50 would be considered a normal price for a toaster. Therefore, a toaster that costs $1000 would be considered expensive. 
Since Anne stated an unlikely price for the toaster, it is likely that the true price of the toaster was not what would normally be expected a priori. Therefore, the answer is: 0.75
A: 0.75
