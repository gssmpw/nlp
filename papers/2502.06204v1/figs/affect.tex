In each scenario, two friends are talking about the price of an item.
Please read the scenarios carefully and provide the probability that the speaker would say the following utterance, given their communicative goal and the true price of the item.
Provide the estimates on a continuous scale between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for "impossible" and 1 stands for "extremely likely".
Write ONLY your final answer as 'A:rating'.
Bob bought a laptop. The laptop cost \$100. A friend asked Bob if the laptop was expensive. 
Bob wants to communicate both their attitude towards the price of the laptop they bought and the price of the laptop. 
Bob wants to precisely communicate the price of the laptop they bought.
Bob thinks the laptop is too expensive.
How likely is it that Bob will say: 'The laptop cost \$1000.'?

The system prompt and one-shot prompt for asking a model to predict the probability of a specific utterance, when communicating \textit{both affect and the exact state}. The sentence about the affect and the preciseness of the price are removed, if the communicative goal only contains one dimension, respectively.}
