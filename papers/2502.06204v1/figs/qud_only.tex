In each scenario, two friends are talking about the price of an item.
Please read the scenarios carefully and provide the probability that the item has the desribed price.
Provide the estimates on a continuous scale between 0 and 1, where 0 stands for "impossible" and 1 stands for "extremely likely".
Write ONLY your final answer as 'A:<rating>'.

EXAMPLE:
Anne bought a new toaster. A friend asked her, "Was it expensive?" Anne said, "It cost $1000."
Please provide the probability that the toaster cost $50.
Let's think step by step and consider the possible communicative goals of Anne.
Anne might want to communicate about the price, about her attitude towards the price, or both.
For communicating the price, she would choose to be precise, ignoring other possible meaning dimesnions. For communicating her attitude, she would choose a an expression that signal attitude, where other possible dimensions like being precise don't matter. For communicating both, she might choose an utterance that trades off both goals. 
Thr utterance seems to fit the goals attitude communication and both. Therefore, the answer is: 0.75
A: 0.75
