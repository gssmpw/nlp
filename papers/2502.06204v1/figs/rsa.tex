EXAMPLE:
Anne bought a new toaster. A friend asked her, "Was it expensive?" Anne said, "It cost \$1000."
Please provide the probability that Anne thinks that the toaster is expensive.
Let's think step by step and consider Anne's goals. To answer her friend's question, Anne might want to tell her friend the price, so that her friend can judge whether the toaster is expensive or not. 
She could have the goal to communicate the exact price, or to communicate her attitude about the price or both.
Anne said "\$1000", but given general world knowledge, it is unlikely that a toaster costs literally \$1000. Therefore, it is unlikely that Anne wants to communicate the exact price. A toaster that costs \$1000 would be considered expensive, which would be upsetting. Therefore, it is more likely that Anne wants to communicate that she is upset and felt that the toaster was too expensive, using a hyperbole to talk about the price.
Therefore, it is likely that Anne thinks that the toaster is expensive. The answer is: 0.9
A: 0.9
