    \caption{Performance comparison between AI, Human, and Human+AI for identifying csPCa from MRI scans. 
    For each metric, the means, 95\% confidence intervals, and number of instances are reported. 
    The reported values and instance counts represent averages across eight radiologists.
    All confidence intervals are derived using bootstrap methods.  
    $p$-values are calculated using the bootstrap $z$-test with a significance threshold of $\alpha=0.05$.}

    \small{$^1$$p$-values compare the performance of different conditions using bootstrap $z$-test. In Study 1, a paired test is conducted on 75 cases, where each case is evaluated by both Human Alone and Human+AI. In Study 2, an unpaired test is performed, comparing the performance on 75 Human Alone cases and 100 Human+AI cases.}\\
    \small{$^2$Note that the lesion-level analysis should be interpreted with caution compared to the per-patient analysis. Since lesion-level analysis excludes true negatives (TNs), we only calculate metrics that do not rely on TNs, i.e. accuracy, sensitivity and PPV.\\
    $^3$For study 1 lesion-level human results, one radiologist's results were excluded because they used our annotation tool incorrectly.}
