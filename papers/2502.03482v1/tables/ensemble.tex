    \caption{Performance comparison between AI, Human, Human+AI, Human-ensemble, and Human+AI-ensemble for identifying csPCa from MRI scans.
    For each metric, the means, 95\% confidence intervals, and number of instances are reported. 
    The reported values and instance counts represent averages across eight radiologists.
    All confidence intervals are derived using bootstrap methods.  
    $p$-values are calculated using the bootstrap $z$-test with a significance threshold of $\alpha=0.05$.}
