\subsection{AI model \& performance}

We use the established nnU-Net model~\cite{isensee2021nnu,bosma2021annotation} as our AI model, trained from scratch with our own splits.  
We ensure that all testing examples have pathology groundtruth. 
Training examples have a mixture of different types of labels: pathology groundtruth, human expert labeled csPCa and delineation of the lesion area, and AI-labeled csPCa and lesion area~\cite{SahaBosmaTwilt2024}.
The AI standalone performance on the testing sets for both studies is shown in \cref{tab:main-results}.
The AI model achieves an AUROC of 0.910 in the training set, 0.730 and 0.790 respectively for the study 1 and study 2 testing set. 
Note that all testing examples have pathology groundtruth while as training sample have a mixture of pseudo labels.
