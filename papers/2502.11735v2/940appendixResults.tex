To supplement Table \ref{tab:meta_main},  we present the Spearman correlation results alongside the Pearson correlation, in terms of faithfulness and completeness, as shown in Table \ref{tab:apx_meta}.
We report the full multi-table retrieval results in Table \ref{tab:apx_rtr}, \eval Completeness score results of diverse baselines in Table \ref{tab:apx_comp}, with respect to Precision, Recall, and F1 score across different top-\textit{k} values.
Additionally, we present insight generation results along with existing automatic metrics in Table \ref{tab:apx_autoeval}.
