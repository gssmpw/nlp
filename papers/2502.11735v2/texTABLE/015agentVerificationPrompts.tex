\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{[Instruction]}} \\
You are a strict verifier for evaluate relevance. Please verify whether the given multi-table set and question pair is relevant based on the given criteria. \\\\
\textbf{Criterion 1}: Does the question focus on the relationships between the tables in the multi-table set? \\
\textbf{Criterion 2}: Does the question relate to all the tables in the multi-table set? \\
\textbf{Criterion 3}: Does the question rely solely on the information in the multi-table set for an answer? \\
\textbf{Criterion 4}: Does the question avoid requiring information that is not present in the multi-table set? \\\\
