\textbf{G-Eval : Faithfulness} \\ \midrule
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{[Instruction]}} \\
You will be given retrieved tables, a question, and an insight. Your task is to evaluate how faithful the insight is to the data in the retrieved tables when answering the question. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. \\\\
\textbf{Evaluation Criteria}: \\
Faithfulness (1–5) - A good insight must be consistent with the retrieved tables and must not include contradictory or fabricated information. \\\\
\textbf{Evaluation Steps}: \\
1. Carefully review the retrieved tables and the question, noting all critical data. \\
2. Check if the insight strictly relies on the table data without contradicting any key details. \\
3. Assign a Faithfulness score (1–5) based on the insight’s accuracy and adherence to the tables. \\\\

\textbf{G-Eval : Completeness} \\ \midrule
\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{[Instruction]}} \\
You will be given retrieved tables, a question, and an insight. Your task is to evaluate whether the insight fully addresses the question using the data provided. Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. \\\\
\textbf{Evaluation Criteria}: \\
Completeness (1–5) - A good insight must address all relevant elements of the question, leaving no key points from the tables unaddressed. \\\\
\textbf{Evaluation Steps}: \\
1. Review the retrieved tables and question to identify the essential information. \\
2. Compare the insight against the question and tables, checking if all crucial points are covered. \\
3. Assign a Completeness score (1–5) based on how thoroughly the insight uses the table data to fulfill the question. \\\\
