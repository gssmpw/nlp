\textbf{Insight}
& Aqeel Khan faced Toshiaki Sakai in two finals, first on 15 August 2004 at the Islamabad tournament on Clay, where he won with a score of 7-6(3) 7-6(5), demonstrating strong performance and resilience. He then met Sakai again on 22 August 2004 at the Lahore tournament on Grass, where he lost 1-6 6-4 6-3, indicating his ability to recover after a poor start. Additionally, Khan faced Divij Sharan on 29 October 2007 at the Lahore tournament, also on Grass, where he lost 4-6 6-3 6-4, showcasing his competitive spirit as he managed to win the second set after losing the first. These matchups highlight Khan's competitive nature and adaptability, as he demonstrated the ability to perform well under pressure and recover from setbacks, even though he did not secure victories in all his finals. \\ \midrule
