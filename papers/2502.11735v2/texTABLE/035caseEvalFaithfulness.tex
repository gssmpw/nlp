\textbf{Insight}
& The 1946 and 1988 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football teams both demonstrated impressive performances, but with notable differences in their ranking trajectories and strength of schedule. In 1946, Notre Dame started unranked but quickly ascended to \#3 by their third game and maintained a \#2 ranking for the majority of the season, facing only two ranked opponents. The 1988 team, however, began the season ranked \#13 and steadily climbed to \#1 by their ninth game, maintaining that top position for the remainder of the season. The 1988 schedule appears more challenging, with five ranked opponents, including a \#1 Miami team, compared to the 1946 schedule. This suggests that the 1988 team faced a tougher slate of opponents, yet still managed to achieve and maintain the top ranking. The 1988 team's ability to consistently improve their ranking against stronger competition may indicate a more impressive overall season performance compared to the 1946 team, which maintained a high but steady ranking against fewer ranked opponents. \\ \midrule
