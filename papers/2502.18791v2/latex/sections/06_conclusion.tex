\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our study streamlines literature analysis by using an LLM for dataset extraction, demonstrating that the automatically extracted dataset, \datasetname, can yield novel findings and replicate manual analyses.
 We confirm the dataset's quality by replicating a key finding from \citet{sprague2024cot}. 
 Our analysis provides insights into prompting configurations, such as the benefits of ICL, the combined effects of CoT and ICL, and the dataset characteristics on performance declines with CoT or ICL.
 Overall, our resources support ongoing literature analyses, enhancing the understanding of LLM behaviors.
