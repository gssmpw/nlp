\label{conclusion}
We presented HuGuR, an interactive and transparent human-in-the-loop approach to
regression with structured features. The framework was instantiated for the novel task of permutation regression, where the features are essentially constraints on the orderings of items. 
We conducted an user study with 21 participants to measure HuGuR's performance in its designated field of application, the interactive model generation by a variety of different users. The performance of human-generated models was compared to the one of multiple baseline approaches.

As shown in Section \ref{experiments}, HuGuR outperforms all other methods, most of them significantly, on small data sets and even performs significantly better than the other methods, except for the the sequence encoding based approach, over all data sets. While HuGuR is not significantly better than the sequence encoding based approach, it is also not significantly worse. Thus it performs on par with the most complex neural network based comparison method.

In future work we want to study differences in the amount of trust users have in machine learning models built by themselves using the HuGuR interface in contrast to conventional machine learning models built in a more black-box way. Additionally, we want to investigate how we can adapt our approach to handle other closely related types of data, such as strings, sequences, trees, or graphs.
