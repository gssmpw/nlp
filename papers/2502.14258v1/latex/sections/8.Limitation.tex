\section*{Limitations}
While our approach demonstrates promising results in identifying and analyzing temporal knowledge circuits, we acknowledge some limitations in our current work. 
First, analysis of unstructured temporal QAs like General ChroKnowledge~\citep{chroknowledge} were constrained, as the underlying multiple-choice options in those tasks typically do not exhibit temporal dependencies.
So we focused more on our temporal knowledge dataset, abundantly describing the effect of ablation in these cases.

On the other side, as EAP-IG didn't support models with Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), which cannot use the \texttt{split\_qkv\_input} option, our main analysis exclude those models like Llama-3-8B-Instruct~\citep{llama3}.
Still, we checked their results and found that even their CRS is not quite enough and their circuit construction is not detailed, temporal heads are still could be founded: \emph{a18.h15} and \emph{a23.h26}.
