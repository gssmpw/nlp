\section{Case Study on LLMs}\label{apd:sec_case_study}
To investigate how well LLMs understand parody, we conduct a case study in which LLMs are asked to provide explanations during prediction. Specifically, we construct the prompt by presenting a comment and its associated topic, then ask the LLMs to determine whether the comment is a parody and to explain their reasoning. After receiving the prediction and explanation from the LLMs, we compare the results with the ground truth label and explanation. The results of the case study for \textit{BridePrice}, \textit{Alibaba-Math}, \textit{DrinkWater}, and \textit{CS2} are presented in Tables \ref{tab:casestudy_brideprice}, \ref{tab:casestudy_alibabamath}, \ref{tab:casestudy_drinkwater}, and \ref{tab:casestudy_CS2}, respectively, using four LLMs: ChatGPT-4o \citep{GPT4}, Qwen 2.5 \citep{Qwen2.5}, DeepSeek-V3 \citep{DeepSeek}, and Claude3.5 \citep{Claude}. The results demonstrate:

(1) LLMs struggle with parody detection. For example, the parody comment in Table \ref{tab:casestudy_brideprice} takes an extreme position opposing the viewpoint that a boyfriend should hand over his salary, yet all the LLMs classify this as a non-parody comment. Additionally, the comment in Table \ref{tab:casestudy_CS2}, which directly expresses a dislike toward the G2 team with analysis, is identified as a parody by 3 of the 4 LLMs.

(2) LLMs frequently provide incorrect explanations when identifying parody comments. Even in the case of \textit{DrinkWater}, shown in Table \ref{tab:casestudy_drinkwater}, where all the LLMs successfully identify the comment as a parody, they fail to generate accurate explanations. The explanations indicate that the LLMs rely mostly on the style and tone of the comment, without a deeper understanding of the implicit meaning.

In conclusion, these results suggest that LLMs struggle to understand parody comments, as they both fail to provide accurate predictions and offer misleading explanations. This highlights the need for further development in LLMs for the task of parody detection.
