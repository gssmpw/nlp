\begin{abstract}
Scientific machine learning (SciML) models are transforming many scientific disciplines. However, the development of good modeling practices to increase the trustworthiness of SciML has lagged behind its application, limiting its potential impact. The goal of this paper is to start a discussion on establishing consensus-based good practices for predictive SciML. We identify key challenges in applying existing computational science and engineering guidelines, such as verification and validation protocols, and provide recommendations to address these challenges. Our discussion focuses on predictive SciML, which uses machine learning models to learn, improve, and accelerate numerical simulations of physical systems. While centered on predictive applications, our 16 recommendations aim to help researchers conduct and document their modeling processes rigorously across all SciML domains.

\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Scientific machine learning (SciML) is an emerging field that integrates machine learning into scientific workflows, creating a powerful synergy between traditional and new methodologies.
More specifically, we define SciML as the application of machine learning methods to enhance, accelerate, or improve the computational modeling and simulation of physical systems.
This definition is applicable across a wide array of scientific disciplines, including physics, earth sciences, and engineering.
However, we acknowledge that this definition may not be universally embraced in certain fields, such as psychology and social sciences.

While computational science and engineering (CSE) has developed solid theoretical foundations over decades, SciML's rapid empirical advances have often outpaced formal theoretical analysis.
Successfully advancing SciML requires thoughtfully integrating the complementary strengths of both fields: CSE's mathematical rigor and ML's data-driven innovations.
Moreover, the CSE community has established rigorous guidelines for model development, verification, and validation (V\&V) to support scientific claims.
In contrast, such standards are still emerging in SciML.
Consequently, 
this paper addresses the critical need for developing V\&V  practices for SciML that builds upon CSE frameworks while addressing SciML's unique challenges.

In this paper, we identified key challenges to developing trusted SciML practices, including the field's heavy reliance on data, the optimization of non-convex functions, and gaps in theoretical understanding.
To address these challenges, we presented a four-component framework for developing and deploying trustworthy SciML models.
As part of this framework, we established 16 recommendations to provide concrete guidance on critical aspects like reporting computational requirements and preparing detailed documentation. We also used real-world examples to illustrate concepts and offer actionable guidance for both development and deployment phases.

The recommendations in this paper are particularly crucial for high-consequence applications where model credibility is paramount. 
These include safety-critical systems in aerospace and nuclear engineering, digital twins for infrastructure monitoring, and medical applications that use model predictions guide treatment decisions. In such domains, the cost of model failure---whether from inadequate verification, poor validation, or incomplete uncertainty quantification---can be severe. Our framework provides a foundation for building the necessary trust in SciML models for these critical applications.


Beyond these domain-specific challenges, the rapid evolution of the field and the drive to publish quickly have led to poor reproducibility, often compromising rigor and transparency.
Here, we aim to catalyze broader community dialogue around establishing consensus-based practices for predictive SciML.
As such, this paper makes a meaningful contribution by being one of the first comprehensive attempts to address systematic V\&V practices specifically for SciML.
It fills an important gap in the literature, as while both CSE and ML have their own established practices, the intersection of these fields requires new approaches to ensure trustworthiness.

We encourage journal editors to adopt these, or similar, recommendations in their submission guidelines, funding agencies to require V\&V plans in proposals, conference organizers to promote sessions on SciML credibility, and researchers to implement these practices in their work. 
Only through collective effort can we establish rigorous standards needed to fully realize SciML's potential for accelerating scientific discovery and enabling trustworthy predictions in high-consequence applications.
