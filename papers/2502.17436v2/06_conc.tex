\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
We study a hierarchical rectified flow formulation that hierarchically couples linear ODEs, each akin to a classic rectified flow formulation. We find this formulation to accurately model multimodal distributions for velocity, etc., which in turn enables integration paths to intersect during data generation. As a consequence, integration paths are less curved leading to compelling results with fewer neural function evaluations. 
Currently, our sampling process is relatively simple, relying on the Euler method for multiple integrations. %
We have only performed a basic grid search regarding possible integration schedules and we have not explored other solvers. %
We suspect, better strategies exist and we leave their exploration to future work.
