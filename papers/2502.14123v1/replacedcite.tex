\paragraph{Online SGD in high-dimensional linear regression.}
There is a line of works studying the excess risk bound of online SGD in the overparameterized setting using a bias-variance decomposition ____.
In particular, ____ focused on constant-stepsize SGD with iterate averaging from the beginning or tail averaging, and derived the first instance-dependent excess risk bound of SGD in overparameterized linear regression.
____ studied the last iterate risk bound of SGD with exponentially decaying stepsize, which is found to achieve a excess risk bound similar to SGD with iterate averaging.
SGD with Nesterov momentum ____ and tail averaging has also been studied ____, with ____ obtaining an instance-dependent risk bound.

\paragraph{Understanding the effect of EMA.}
The favorable generalization properties of EMA in practice have been observed in several works ____.
Through empirical experiments, ____ connected the stabilizing effect of averaging methods (e.g., EMA) with learning rate scheduling, which coincides with the finding of ____.
A similar theoretical result was given by ____, but the EMA is performed on the momentum instead of the iterates.
