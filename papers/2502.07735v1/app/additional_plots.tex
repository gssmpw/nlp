    \caption{\textit{Left:} evolution of $L^1$ distance between empirical distribution of samples and target distribution. \textit{Right:} evolution of mean length of sampled trajectories. Here we note that when $\Delta \log \cF$ scale losses are employed without state flow regularization, mean trajectory length tends to infinity. Plots are not full since training is done on-policy. Thus, the time needed for full training also grows according to the length of trajectories.}

    \caption{\textit{Left:} evolution of $L^1$ distance between empirical distribution of samples and target distribution. \textit{Right:} evolution of mean length of sampled trajectories. Here, we see the effects of state flow regularization of different strength $\lambda$. Larger values of $\lambda$ lead to smaller mean trajectory length, however, if $\lambda$ is too large, the obtained forward policy will be significantly biased.}

    \caption{Comparison of non-acyclic GFlowNet training losses on a small permutation environment. \textit{Left:} evolution of $L_1$ distance between true and empirical distribution of fixed point probabilities $C(k)$. \textit{Right:} evolution of mean length of sampled trajectories. The results are similar to the same experiment on hypergrids (Figure~\ref{fig:small_grid}), with the only difference that here $\SDB$ loss in $\Delta \cF$ scale here has fast convergence with a trainable backward policy.}
