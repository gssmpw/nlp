    abstract = "Several recent works have considered the problem of generating reviews (or {\textquoteleft}tips') as a form of explanation as to why a recommendation might match a customer`s interests. While promising, we demonstrate that existing approaches struggle (in terms of both quality and content) to generate justifications that are relevant to users' decision-making process. We seek to introduce new datasets and methods to address the recommendation justification task. In terms of data, we first propose an {\textquoteleft}extractive' approach to identify review segments which justify users' intentions; this approach is then used to distantly label massive review corpora and construct large-scale personalized recommendation justification datasets. In terms of generation, we are able to design two personalized generation models with this data: (1) a reference-based Seq2Seq model with aspect-planning which can generate justifications covering different aspects, and (2) an aspect-conditional masked language model which can generate diverse justifications based on templates extracted from justification histories. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets which show that our model is capable of generating convincing and diverse justifications."

ABSTRACT = {The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an unprecedented integration of machine learning techniques, raising concerns about data privacy. To address these concerns, federated learning has been introduced. However, practical implementations face challenges, including communication costs, data and device heterogeneity, and privacy security. This paper proposes an innovative approach within the context of federated learning, introducing a personalized joint learning algorithm for Non-IID IoT data. This algorithm incorporates multi-task learning principles and leverages neural network model characteristics. To overcome data heterogeneity, we present a novel clustering algorithm designed specifically for federated learning. Unlike conventional methods that require a predetermined number of clusters, our approach utilizes automatic clustering, eliminating the need for fixed cluster specifications. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the exceptional performance of the proposed algorithm, particularly in scenarios with specific client distributions. By significantly improving the accuracy of trained models, our approach not only addresses data heterogeneity but also strengthens privacy preservation in federated learning. In conclusion, we offer a robust solution to the practical challenges of federated learning in IoT environments. By combining personalized joint learning, automatic clustering, and neural network model characteristics, we facilitate more effective and privacy-conscious machine learning in Non-IID IoT data settings.},

LaMP offers a comprehensive evaluation framework with diverse language tasks and multiple entries for each user profile. It consists of seven personalized tasks, spanning three text classification and four text generation tasks. We additionally propose two retrieval augmentation approaches that retrieve personal items from each user profile for personalizing language model outputs. To this aim, we study various retrieval models, including term matching, semantic matching, and time-aware methods. Extensive experiments on LaMP for zero-shot and fine-tuned language models demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed retrieval augmentation approach and highlight the impact of personalization in various natural language tasks.",
