\section{Discussions}\label{sec-discussions}

We developed a general approach for converting imperfect LLM-based survey simulations into statistically valid confidence sets for population statistics of human responses. It identifies a simulation sample size which is useful for future simulation tasks and which reveals the degree of misalignment between the LLM and the target human population. 

Several future directions are worth exploring. First, our approach does not explicitly minimize the size of the prediction set. A natural question is whether we can incorporate a size minimization procedure to produce smaller confidence sets with good coverage. Second, it would be interesting to see if our approach can be combined with debiasing methods to give more informative confidence sets. Finally, as prompt engineering is known to have crucial effects on the quality of LLM generations, it is worth investigating the impacts of prompts on the selected simulation sample size $\widehat{k}$, and how prompt engineering can be leveraged to reduce the misalignment gap between LLM simulations and true human responses.
