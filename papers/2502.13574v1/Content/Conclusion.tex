We investigated the potential of jointly learning the prior distribution with the conditional DDPM for improved efficiency. We demonstrated the advantages of leveraging learning-based priors with RestoreGrad, providing a more systematic way of estimating the prior than existing selections. A limitation of the current work is that it focuses on signal restoration applications, where we suitably assume a zero-mean Gaussian prior and only learn its covariance. In the future, it can be interesting to explore using a more generic prior form and extend the idea to other applications.
