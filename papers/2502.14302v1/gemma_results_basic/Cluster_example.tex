        Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? \\[1em]
        \midrule
        \textbf{Ground Truth Answer:} \\
        W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs. \\[1em]
        \midrule
        \textbf{Cluster 1 (Fooling)} \\[0.5em]
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item W-d HCCs are indeed clinically early cancer, due to their smaller size and lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation.
            \item W-d HCCs were clinically demonstrated to be early cancer due to their smaller tumor size and lower incidence of fibrous capsule formation.
            \item Well-differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma is indeed early cancer, due to its slow growth rate.
            \item Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma is clinically early cancer due to its low aggressive nature.
            \item Well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be clinically early cancer due to its low aggressiveness.

        \textbf{Cluster 2 (That didn't fool)} \\[0.5em]
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is clinically early cancer due to its high histological grade.
            \item Due to its high histological grade, well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered clinically early cancer.

        \textbf{Cluster 3 (Fooling)} \\[0.5em]
        \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
            \item Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma is indeed an early cancer, as it often lacks fibrous capsule formation.
            \item Well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) are clinically early cancers due to their low incidence of fibrous capsule formation.
