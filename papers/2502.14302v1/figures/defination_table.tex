\textbf{Hallucination Category} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\textbf{Description}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Example}} \\ \midrule
Misinterpretation of Question & Misunderstanding the question, leading to an irrelevant response. & \textbf{\#Question\#}: Does high-dose vitamin C therapy improve survival rates in patients with sepsis? \newline \textbf{\#Answer\#}: Vitamin C is water-soluble vitamin that plays a role in immune function and collagen synthesis. \\ \hline
Incomplete Information & Stays on-topic but omits the essential details needed to fully answer the question. & \textbf{\#Question\#}: How does penicillin treat strep throat? \newline \textbf{\#Answer\#}: Penicillin kills bacteria.\\ \hline
% Overgeneralization or Simplification & Overgeneralizing or simplifying the answer. & \textbf{\#Question\#}: Are vitamin D levels and bone turnover markers related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in severely obese patients? \newline \textbf{\#Answer\#}: Studies show low doses of Vitamins cause fatty liver. \\ \hline
Mechanism and Pathway Misattribution & False attribution of biological mechanisms, molecular pathways, or disease processes that contradicts established medical knowledge. & \textbf{\#Question\#}: What is the primary mechanism of action of aspirin in reducing inflammation? \newline \textbf{\#Answer\#}: Aspirin primarily reduces inflammation by blocking calcium channels in immune cells, which prevents the release of histamine and directly suppresses T-cell activation. \\ \hline
Methodological and Evidence Fabrication & Inventing false research methods, statistical data, or specific clinical outcomes. & \textbf{\#Question\#}: What is the success rate of ACL reconstruction surgery? \newline \textbf{\#Answer\#}: Recent clinical trials using quantum-guided surgical technique showed 99.7\% success rate across 10,543 patients with zero complications when using gold-infused synthetic grafts. \\
