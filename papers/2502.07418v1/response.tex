Activity name: Polyester film production, coating 

Activity information: 

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film coated with a polyester-based material, assumed to be the product of a process that transforms ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid into PET and then coats it. Transformation process of transforming ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid into polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and applying a coating.

 Activity name: Polypropylene production, film or sheet

Activity information: 

Synthetic fibres-based non-woven with a polypropylene scrim coating, assumed to consist of 50\% synthetic fibers, 35\% synthetic resin, and 15\% polypropylene textile reinforcement. The transformation process includes the application of a synthetic resin in a water dispersion onto a base material consisting of synthetic fibers and a polypropylene scrim.
Transformation process includes non-woven production and coating process with a polypropylene production as precursor for the scrim component.
