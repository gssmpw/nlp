\textbf{Steel production, electric arc furnace, EU} 

\vspace{0.3em}
This process models the production of steel using an electric arc furnace (EAF) within the European Union. The process includes the melting of recycled steel scrap and the subsequent refinement to meet industry-grade specifications. Electricity consumption and emissions are based on averages from EU-wide data. Additional inputs include limestone for slag formation and oxygen for decarburization. Outputs include steel billets ready for further processing and slag as a by-product for use in construction applications.

This dataset represents a cradle-to-gate assessment, capturing the production of steel billets up to the point of factory gate, excluding downstream processing (e.g., rolling or shaping). Energy mix and emission profiles align with EU 27 averages for 2023.
