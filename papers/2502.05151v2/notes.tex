TITLE: "What can AI/NLP do for science [production]: [A Survey/Review on AI for Science]"

**introduction**
- 

**methodology**
- which approach / structured vs. unstructured review


***background***
- how to write a paper, how to write review, ... (from a human perspective, visiometrics)

DIMENSIONS
  ***individual topics/aspects / tasks***
- reviewing (Anne, ...)

- experimentation (Steffen, ...)

- discovery (Nafise, ...): https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01070-5

- multimodal generation / slides (Steffen, Yufang, ...)

- paper writing (...)

- leaderboard construction (Yufang, ....)

- search + QA (Jennifer, ...)

  **METHODOLOGY***

- multimodal LLMs
- hybrid approaches
- knowledge graphs

  **DOMAINS OF APPLICATIONS / DOMAINS**
- NLP, social science, biology, health, ...


**related surveys**
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12009
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15604v1

**limitations \& future work \& vision**
...

**presentation/illustration**
- need to have a few nice figures and tables 
- e.g. https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01070-5
- taxonomy
- conceptual illustration


Questions / Comments:
- tasks / topics as highest level?
- tasks:
   * datasets
   * evaluation
   * metrics
   * ...
- Copying: should be careful

- Cell: https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(24)01070-5 (end-to-end workflow empowering biomedical research with AI agents)


TODOs:
- look at past ACM computing surveys
- come up with a structure of the survey / or multiple structures
