\section*{Tristan's notes}

I'm in agreement with Steffen's proposition, with the following comments:

\begin{itemize}
\item The introduction should indicate the audience for the paper. Taking a cue from \url{https://doi.org/10.1145/3485128} we may want to include one or more of the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Researchers and engineers
  \item Science educators
  \item Managers/owners of private research-oriented organizations
  \item Administrators of universities and non-profit research institutes
  \item Regulators in local, regional, and national governments
  \end{itemize}
\item Also per \url{https://doi.org/10.1145/3485128} we may want to indicate author bylines for individual sections
\end{itemize}
