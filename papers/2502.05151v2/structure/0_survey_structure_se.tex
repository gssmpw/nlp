\section*{Steffen's proposition}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section 1: Introduction (why is the topic important for the future of science, etc. etc.) [jointly -- the four of us]
    \item Section 2: Methodology (how did we come up with the survey) [Tristan]
    \item Section 3: Background (how to write/compose a scientific paper); how humans do all of the tasks [Tristan]
    \item Section 4: Tasks + Methods
    \begin{itemize}
    \item (Literature) Search; Jennifer D'Souza, ...
    \item Multimodal Content Generation and Analysis (making figures, understanding figures and tables, reasoning over figures and tables, etc.); paper2slides, etc. --> Steffen Eger, Yufang, Nafise, ...
    \item (Text-based) Paper content generation (titles, abstracts, conclusion) --> maybe can be part of the earlier task; Steffen Eger, Wei, Chenghua Lin, Stephanie Gross (summarization, hallucination), Brigitte Krenn (summarization, hallucination)...
    \item Reviewing; Anne Lauscher, Chenghua Lin, ...
    \item Conducting experiments (automated programming, etc.; idea generation; ...); Steffen, Wei, Nafise, Chenghua Lin ...
    \item ...
    \item Other aspects: science analysis with NLP tools (citation analysis, for example)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Section 5: domains of applications (biology, health, computer science, ...)
    \item Section 6: Ethical concerns (3 pages at least) [Anne, Brigitte Krenn, Stephanie Gross...]
    \item Section X: Use Case (use AI to write part of the survey) example output of things we're reviewing in the survey
    \item Section 7 (Conclusion, Future Work, Limitations)
\end{itemize}
Other aspects: 
- we need a very good overview picture.
- quantitative analysis (popularity of certain approaches/topics --- how to define keywords??)

Existing surveys: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3485766 
* taxonomy, table with tasks, citation patterns, overview figure

Narrative Survey, Systematic (Prisma) Survey

Topic/Task (2-3 pages * 7 topics = 14-21 pages):
- description 
- (background)
- data
- (a) methods + (b) results
- ethical concerns
- future directions / gaps / limitations
- [domains of applications]


Who is the audience --> Add in the email to our network [ethical concerns understandable to a broader audience] --> Steffen sets things up, sends email to leads tomorrow --> time until Thursday --> everyone can make suggestions until next Tuesday --> time until December 15
