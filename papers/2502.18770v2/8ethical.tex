Our research addresses the ethical challenges of reward hacking in RLHF by proposing a method to mitigate this problem. By ensuring robust alignment with human values, enhancing transparency in reward design, and proactively addressing biases and safety risks, our approach aims to develop RLHF systems that are fair, reliable, and aligned with societal well-being.
