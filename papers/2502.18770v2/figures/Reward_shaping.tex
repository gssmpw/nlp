\caption{RLHF training pipeline with reward shaping.  Responses from the policy model are evaluated by the reward model, producing proxy rewards.  These rewards are then reshaped (optionally using reference rewards, as shown in the dashed box) before being used to update the policy via RL.  The blue box details the PAR reward shaping function, which uses a sigmoid applied to the centered reward.}
