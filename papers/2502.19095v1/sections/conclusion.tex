\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we replicated the study proposed by Chen et al.~\cite{CHEN2022102831} and conducted a thorough analysis of potential threats to its validity. After checking whether such potential threats actually affected the results reported in the original study, we presented an extended approach and introduced an extension study to mitigate them. Our findings are similar to those presented in Chen et al.~\cite{CHEN2022102831}, but with a crucial difference: we eliminated the threats to their validity. This achievement allows us to propose a more effective method that directly attacks the detectors themselves, rather than relying on potential vulnerabilities in the preprocessing pipeline, associated with the generation of out of vocabulary tokens. Furthermore, our approach enhances transparency in the evaluation process, as we make code, datasets and results publicly available to all researchers in the field.
