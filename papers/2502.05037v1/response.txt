\subsection{Real-World Applications of using Simulators for Estimating CATE}
\label{app:sim_examples}
We provide two examples from medicine and electrochemistry to show how simulators aid CATE estimation in practice:

\xhdr{Medicine} Simulators play a crucial role in pharmacology, particularly for assessing drug efficacies. For instance, the SimBiology toolbox 
\footnote{\tiny{\url{https://in.mathworks.com/videos/series/simbiology-tutorials-for-qsp-pbpk-and-pk-pd-modeling-and-analysis.html}}} in MATLAB is commonly used to predict the effects of \verb|SGLT2| inhibitors ($T$) on type-2 diabetes ($Y$) while considering post-treatment covariates ($X$) such as plasma glucose levels, gut glucose levels, urinary glucose excretion, and liver insulin levels. SimBiology enables modeling these effects using differential and algebraic equations that are often calibrated on target populations to minimize the real-simulator mismatch. Despite not perfectly replicating reality, such simulators are invaluable for early-stage clinical trial decisions and have demonstrated utility in modeling short-term treatment effects**Clarke et al., "Simulating the Effect of SGLT2 Inhibitors on Type 2 Diabetes"**.


\xhdr{Electrochemistry} Another application involves recommending optimal electrode materials to maximize battery capacity ($Y$). By observing $Y$ under various electrode materials ($T$) and post-treatment variables like charge/discharge rate, internal resistance, and temperature distribution ($X$), the Ansys Battery Cell and Electrode Simulator \footnote{\tiny{\url{https://www.ansys.com/applications/battery/battery-cell-and-electrode}}} provides electrochemical simulations. This tool has been used by Volkswagen Motorsport for comprehensive multiphysics simulations to design and validate battery models. Such simulators are highly relevant for practical decision-making in industries.

These examples illustrate the practical relevance of simulators across different fields. While simulators cannot fully replace real data or randomized controlled trials (RCTs), they offer valuable insights that can reduce the number of RCTs needed for optimal treatment identification. Our paper aims to characterize the CATE error when using imperfect simulators in conjunction with real observational data. Additionally, **Kohavi et al., "A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap Ensembles for Accurate Risk Estimation"**, maximizes the utility of simulators by leveraging the highly correlated simulator's treatment effects with real-world effects, without relying on the exact correlation of individual potential outcomes.
