\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
%
In this paper, we proposed a $k$-NN-based anomaly detection method that theoretically controls the false detection probability within a desired significance level.
%
The proposed Stat-$k$NNAD method is applicable both in the original feature space and in the latent feature space learned by a pretrained deep learning model.
%
Applying the proposed method to real-world tabular and image data demonstrates its ability to achieve statistically significant and reliable anomaly detection.
%
However, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:relatedWorks}, the proposed method has certain limitations, and future work will focus on extending the theory and methods of SI to develop a more flexible approach.
