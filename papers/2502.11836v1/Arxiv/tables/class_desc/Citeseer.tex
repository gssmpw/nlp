Agents & The study focus on computational agents capable of rational behavior. Modeling agents requires to provide a structured approach to decision-making based on an agent's beliefs, desires, and intentions. Agents are grounded in both quantitative decision-theoretic models and symbolic reasoning approaches, enabling them to operate effectively in complex dynamic environments.     \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}machine \\ learning(ML)\end{tabular} & Machine learning includes lazy learning, probabilistic learning, and case-based reasoning. Machine learning is studied in cognitive science as a model of human reasoning and in inductive learning for similarity-based generalization. key challenges lie in defining effective measures, evolving from rigid metrics to adaptive, context-aware approaches, such as non-symmetric similarity in structured learning. \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}information \\ retrieval (IR)\end{tabular} & is the process of retrieving relevant information from large datasets, typically text collections. Methods include centroid-based classification, Naïve Bayes, k-NN, and decision trees by leveraging similarity measures to adjust for class density and term dependencies. Beyond supervised classification, unsupervised categorization aids automated retrieval, enabling dynamic query generation and document filtering. \\ \midrule
database (DB) & Databases manage structured data efficiently, especially in distributed environments, with semantic query caches that improve query performance by storing results and optimizing resource use. Database integration enables access to autonomous, heterogeneous sources through a unified schema. \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}human-computer \\ interaction (HCI)\end{tabular} & Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) creates intuitive, adaptive interfaces for real-time collaboration and multimodal interaction. Customization supports tailored workflows in group collaboration, while modern systems enhance adaptation and learning through shared workspaces for real-time component importation. \\ \midrule
\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}artificial \\ intelligence (AI)\end{tabular} & AI enables autonomous decision making to operate in dynamic environments with monitored execution. AI-driven learning and decision making aim to produce human-like performance by detecting and correcting discrepancies between internal models and real-world conditions.  \\ \bottomrule
