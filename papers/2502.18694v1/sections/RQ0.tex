Before addressing the research questions, we present the publication trends of the 156 primary studies on REDAST, including study distribution, venue names, and features of the selected studies.

The study distribution is analyzed in two parts: (a) study distribution by the publication year and (b) study distribution by publication type, which are illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:year} and \ref{fig:dis_type}, respectively.

In analyzing the distribution of REDAST studies by year, we observed that the first study was published in 1993, followed by a steady annual increase. A notable surge occurred around 2008, prompting further investigation into the technical differences between studies conducted before and after this period. Two key conclusions emerged: (1) An increased adoption of NLP-pipeline-based methods from 2008 onward. Prior to 2008, only 20\% of studies employed these methods, whereas from 2008 to 2013, the proportion rose to 31.9\%. (2) A decline in the use of graph-based methods after 2008. The prevalence of graph-based approaches decreased from 35\% before 2008 to 19.14\% in the subsequent period from 2008 to 2013. By comparing with the landmark studies published between 2006 and 2008, including works by Hinton et al., \cite{hinton2006fast} and Van der Maaten and Hinton\cite{van2008visualizing}, we believe that deep learning technologies, including LLMs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can promote the adoption of NLP-pipeline-based methods in SE domain.
\input{tables/rq0_venue}
Regarding the publication type distribution, most studies were published in conferences (56.41\%) and journals (32.69\%). Our selected studies were published across 115 different venues. We present the venues with two or more published studies in Table \ref{table:venue}. The IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference, the IEEE International Conference on Software Quality, Reliability, and Security, and the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering have the highest percentages in their respective categories, which is unsurprising given their top-level reputation in the software engineering field.
\input{tables/rq0_system}
Besides the trending information, we also investigated the target software in the selected studies. The results of the target software are exhibited in Table~\ref{tab:software}. Most of the selected studies are designed for general software (100/156), followed by embedded systems (14/156) web services systems (7/156), safety-critical systems (6/156), and so on.
