\begin{abstract}
The rapid growth of encryption has significantly enhanced privacy and security while posing challenges for network traffic classification. Recent approaches address these challenges by transforming network traffic into text or image formats to leverage deep-learning models originally designed for natural language processing, and computer vision. However, these transformations often contradict network protocol specifications, introduce noisy features, and result in resource-intensive processes. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textit{NetMatrix}, a minimalistic tabular representation of network traffic that eliminates noisy attributes and focuses on meaningful features leveraging RFCs (Request for Comments) definitions. By combining NetMatrix with a vanilla XGBoost classifier, we implement a lightweight approach, \textit{LiM ("Less is More")} that achieves classification performance on par with state-of-the-art methods such as ET-BERT and YaTC. Compared to selected baselines, experimental evaluations demonstrate that LiM improves resource consumption by orders of magnitude. Overall, this study underscores the effectiveness of simplicity in traffic representation and machine learning model selection, paving the way towards resource-efficient network traffic classification.
% Experimental evaluations on the CSTNET-TLS1.3 dataset demonstrate that LiM achieves an accuracy of 94.2\%, with orders-of-magnitude improvements in latency, memory usage, energy efficiency, and throughput compared to state-of-the-art. This study underscores the effectiveness of lightweight, resource-efficient methodologies for real-world encrypted network traffic classification, paving the way for simple and scalable applications for high-performance network environments.
 
  
  % As a consequence, recent NTC approaches transform network traffic into text or images to leverage complex deep-learning architectures used in natural language processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). 

  % While the transformed traffic representations contradict protocol specifications, include noisy features, and also make NTC a resource intensive task.
  
  % In this work, we propose NetMatrix, a minimalistic tabular representation of network traffic that excludes noisy features, focusing instead on meaningful attributes aligning with RFC (Request For Comments) specifications. 
  
  % We demonstrate that "\textit{less is more}" \textit{(LiM)} by pairing NetMatrix with a vanilla XGBoost model and achieving classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing resource consumption. 
  
  % Experimental results on the CSTNET-TLS1.3 dataset show that LiM achieves an accuracy of 94.2\% with orders-of-magnitude improvements in latency, memory usage, energy efficiency, and throughput compared to ET-BERT and YaTC. 
  
  % This work highlights the potential of lightweight, efficient approaches for real-world encrypted network traffic classification.
