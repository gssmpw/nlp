\section{Discussion}
The proposed approach, combining NetMatrix and the LiM classifier, demonstrates that a lightweight architecture and minimalist data representation can achieve competitive classification performance while significantly reducing resource consumption. However, this study focuses on the CSTNET-TLS1.3 dataset, and further evaluation is needed to generalize its applicability. Future work will extend this approach to additional datasets, encompassing diverse traffic patterns, encryption protocols, and real-world network scenarios.

Moreover, we aim to compare NetMatrix and LiM against a broader range of state-of-the-art classifiers beyond ET-BERT and YaTC. This will help refine the methodology and further validate its scalability and efficiency across varying conditions.

By addressing these avenues, we seek to establish the proposed method as a robust, practical, and scalable solution for encrypted NTC across diverse and evolving network landscapes.
