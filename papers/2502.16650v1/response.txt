The design and implementation of LTE-V2X have been widely studied, providing an overview of long-term evolution-vehicle (LTE-V) communication and its benefits for vehicular applications**Zhang, "A Survey on LTE-V for Vehicular Communications"**. Further research has focused on the simulation environments for both LTE**Kumar, "Simulation Environment Design for LTE Networks"** and 5G networks**Wang, "Simulation Environment Design for 5G Networks"**. The architecture and capabilities of NR have been extensively explored**Li, "NR Architecture and Capabilities"**, with several studies analyzing NR performance and design implications for V2X communications**Taheri, "NR Performance Analysis for V2X Communications"**. Additionally, NR has been proposed for public safety applications**Hussain, "NR for Public Safety Applications"**, for military communications**Kim, "NR for Military Communications"** and in support of drone operations**Peng, "NR for Drone Operations"**, demonstrating its versatility across multiple domains, while also a few features have been implemented based on a custom Open Air Interface**Zhou, "Custom Open Air Interface Implementation"**.

Multiple works have covered high-level overview of the security challenges**Gao, "Security Challenges in V2X Communications"**. However, some of these studies primarily focus on "conventional" LTE/5G networks and do not dive into NR sidelink specific internal functions, while others focus on generic device-to-device communications. A survey by Yoshizawa et al.**Yoshizawa, "A Survey on V2X Communications"** provide a valuable overview into V2X, though it does not investigate technically the NR ecosystem, while Ying et al.**Ying, "An Updated Literature Overview of V2X Communications"** offer an updated literature overview. **Meng, "General Security Posture of V2X Networks"** give more insights regarding the general security posture of the V2X networks.

Various related cryptographic mechanisms and their performance in LTE and 5G communications have also been analyzed**Wang, "Cryptographic Mechanisms for LTE and 5G Communications"**, even though trust and protection is not examined holistically and at a macroscopic level, nor compatibility with 3GPP standards. Device-to-device secrecy improvements with radio resource and power management have been studied**Kumar, "Device-to-Device Secrecy Improvements"**, and DoS attacks have been mathematically simulated against C-V2X resources**Taheri, "DoS Attacks Against C-V2X Resources"**. Finally, Twardokus et al.**Twardokus, "Resource Exhaustion and Jamming Techniques for C-V2X"** have notably explored resource exhaustion and jamming techniques for C-V2X targeting the resource scheduling leading to DoS, while also proposing countermeasures. On the contrary, our focus is mainly on SCI spoofing attacks (not jamming) for resources, while also proving a detailed protocol, message and parameter analysis (i.e., a unique and holistic approach) for this attack, specifically for 5G V2X Sidelink (not LTE mode 4-oriented).

Generally, our work offers the first in-depth examination of technical NR V2X procedures and protocols by focusing on their unique security implications of cellular V2X. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:related-comparison}, existing studies either address broader V2X concepts or rely on simulation/mathematical setups without fully exploring the specific functionalities.
