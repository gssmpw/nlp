\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a framework for recommending charts to investigate data flow and boost exploratory data analysis efficiently.
The idea is to leverage chart recommendations to identify a good slice of data tables and use the chart to traverse the whole data flow with a consistent and intuitive format.
The transformation operations serve as an indicator of users' intents, narrowing down the search space for columns and chart configurations.
To validate the idea of \system{}, we developed a proof-of-concept tool and conducted user studies imitating the scenario of exploratory analysis.
Lessons learned inspire future studies toward the development of more efficient EDA tools, including investigating semantic information behind operations and introducing large language models for better parsing and understanding.
