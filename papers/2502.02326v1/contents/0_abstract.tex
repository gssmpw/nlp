Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a routine task for data analysts, often conducted using flexible computational notebooks. During EDA, data workers process, visualize, and interpret data tables, making decisions about subsequent analysis. However, the cell-by-cell programming approach, while flexible, can lead to disorganized code, making it difficult to trace the state of data tables across cells and increasing the cognitive load on data workers. This paper introduces NoteFlow, a notebook library that recommends charts as ``sight glasses'' for data tables, allowing users to monitor their dynamic updates throughout the EDA process. To ensure visual consistency and effectiveness, NoteFlow adapts chart encodings in response to data transformations, maintaining a coherent and insightful representation of the data. The proposed method was evaluated through user studies, demonstrating its ability to provide an overview of the EDA process and convey critical insights in the data tables.
