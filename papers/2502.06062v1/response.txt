Advancements have influenced the evolution of crop yield monitoring in sensor technology and data analysis methodologies. While early studies highlighted rainfall as the primary determinant of crop yield, a key shift occurred in 1968 with the recognition of soil moisture as a more reliable predictor by Baier and Robertson **Baier, "Soil Moisture and Crop Yield"**. Their work leverages spectral data to estimate crop yield based on vegetation health indicators. Over time, numerous vegetation indices (VIs) have been developed to assess vegetative conditions and physiological characteristics of crops. These VIs, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) **Jackson, "Spectral Indices in Remote Sensing"**, and Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI) **Ritchie et al., "Crop Water Stress Index"**, play a crucial role in crop prediction models. Advancements in hyperspectral imaging have enabled the capture of fine-grained spectral data, facilitating the development of biochemical indices for quantifying plant constituents.

Rice crop yield estimation relies on understanding the crop's growth stages and environmental factors. Water level in paddy fields, rather than direct precipitation, is crucial for irrigated rice fields. Accumulating temperature is more important than temperature at certain times, as it affects the crop's development stages. These factors are integrated into crop models to predict yield accurately.

In the early 2000s, research surged leveraging imaging and machine learning technologies for crop yield prediction. Studies introduced novel methodologies, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and SVR, to analyse remote sensing data and historical yield records. These approaches demonstrated more precise results compared to traditional models and prepared for more precise and scalable methods for estimating crop yields. Uno et al. **Uno, "Corn Yield Prediction Using Hyperspectral Images"** analyse hyperspectral images of corn plots in Canada using statistical and ANN approaches, demonstrating the potential of ANNs in predicting yield with higher accuracy compared to conventional models. Li et al. **Li, "ANN-Based Crop Yield Prediction"** introduce a methodology employing ANN models to predict corn and soybean yields in the United States "corn belt" region, achieving high prediction accuracy through historical yield data and NDVI time series. Bala and Islam **Bala, "Potato Yield Estimation Using Remote Sensing"** estimate potato yields in Bangladesh using TERRA MODIS reflectance data and Vegetation Indices (VIs), demonstrating the effectiveness of VIs derived from remote sensing for early yield estimation. Li et al. **Li, "SVR-Based Winter Wheat Yield Prediction"** employ SVR and multi-temporal Landsat TM NDVIs to predict winter wheat yield in China, showcasing the precision and effectiveness of SVR models in yield estimation. Stojanova et al. **Stojanova, "Vegetation Characterization Using LiDAR and Satellite Data"** integrate LiDAR and Landsat satellite data using machine learning techniques to model vegetation characteristics in Slovenia. Their approach combines the precision of LiDAR data with the broad coverage of satellite data, facilitating effective forest management and monitoring processes.

Furthermore, Mosleh et al. **Mosleh, "Remote Sensing for Rice Area Mapping and Forecasting"** evaluated the efficacy of remote sensing imagery in mapping rice areas and forecasting production, highlighting challenges such as spatial resolution limitations and issues with radar imagery. Johnson et al. **Johnson, "Crop Yield Forecasting Models for Canadian Prairies"** developed crop yield forecasting models for the Canadian Prairies, revealing the effectiveness of satellite-derived vegetation indices, particularly NDVI, in predicting yield potential. Pantazi et al. **Pantazi, "Winter Wheat Yield Prediction Using Soil Spectroscopy and Remote Sensing"** proposed a model for winter wheat yield prediction, integrating soil spectroscopy and remote sensing data to visually depict yield-influencing factors. Ramos et al. **Ramos, "Maize-Crop Yield Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm"** introduced an optimised Random Forest algorithm for maize-crop yield prediction, emphasising the importance of vegetation indices like NDVI, NDRE, and GNDVI. Li et al. **Li, "Vegetation Growth Prediction Using Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine Learning"** utilised extreme gradient boosting machine learning to accurately predict vegetation growth in China, achieving high predictive accuracy and demonstrating effectiveness under diverse conditions. Zhang et al. **Zhang, "Smallholder Maize Yield Prediction Using Field-Surveyed Data"** employed field-surveyed data to predict smallholder maize yield, with novel insights into the performance of various vegetation indices and machine learning techniques.

Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of utilising Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and machine learning techniques for predicting crop yields and mapping crop types in various agricultural settings. Son et al. **Son, "Sentinel-2 Image-Based Rice Crop Yield Forecasting"** employed Sentinel-2 image composites and machine learning algorithms to forecast rice crop yields in Taiwan, finding that Support Vector Machines (SVM) outperformed RF and ANN at the field level, indicating their potential for accurate yield predictions approximately one month before harvesting. Perich et al. **Perich, "Crop Yield Mapping at Pixel Level Using Sentinel-2 Imagery"** utilised Sentinel-2 imagery to map crop yields at the pixel level in small-scale agriculture, with machine learning models utilising spectral index and meteorological data, achieving better results compared to state-of-the-art models while simplifying data integration. From a similar perspective, Boppudi et al. **Boppudi, "Deep Ensemble Model for Crop Yield Prediction"** proposed a deep ensemble model for accurately predicting crop yields in India, addressing the challenge posed by variations in weather and environmental factors.

Recently, Umamaheswari and Madhumathi **Umamaheswari, "Stacking Ensemble Approach for Crop Yield Prediction"** applied a stacking ensemble approach using regressors like SVR, KNN, and RF as base learners, with LASSO regression as the meta-learner, achieving enhanced prediction precision. Zhang et al. **Zhang, "Multimodal Data Fusion Using UAV-Acquired Multispectral Data"** constructed the StackReg framework, combining UAV-acquired multispectral data with ridge regression, SVM, Cubist, and XGBoost, which consistently outperformed base models, particularly in multi-stage settings.

In the sequel, we introduce a novel framework for predicting crop yields, named ``\textit{RicEns-Net}." This framework incorporates advanced data engineering processes involving five unique data sources, namely Sentinel 1/2/3, NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences (GES) Data and Information Services Centre (DISC), and field measurements. The novelty of RicEns-Net lies in its integration of these diverse and rich sources of multi-modal data, comprising 15 features selected from a pool of over 100, within an advanced Deep Ensemble model. This model encompasses widely-used CNN and MLP architectures, as well as less explored DenseNet and Autoencoder architectures, which have been infrequently utilised or entirely unexplored in existing literature.
