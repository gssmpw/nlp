%In this paper, we introduce Direction-aware Geometric Knowledge Editing ({\ouralg}), a novel framework that leverages the geometric relationships between parameter updates after fine-tuning to facilitate model editing. GeoEdit optimizes the integration of new knowledge while identifying and minimizing disruptions to general knowledge, thereby preserving the model's generalization ability. {\ouralg} employs an importance-guided task vector fusion technique and incorporates synergistic, orthogonal, and conflict knowledge editing strategies, all based on the direction of parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of {\ouralg} in achieving a better balance between new knowledge integration and the preservation of general knowledge.


In this paper, we introduce Geometric Knowledge Editing ({\ouralg}), a novel framework that utilizes the geometric relationships between parameter updates to improve model editing. 
By applying a direction-aware knowledge identification technique, {\ouralg} classifies neurons into two categories: general-knowledge-related neurons, whose parameter updates are masked to prevent negative impacts on model generalization, and new-knowledge-related neurons, where an importance-guided task vector fusion technique is applied to enhance editing.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of {\ouralg} for model editing.
