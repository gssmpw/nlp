%\subsection{The Rise of Multilingual LLMs}

With over 7,000 languages spoken globally ____,   the growing use of diverse languages have fueled the demand for multilingual LLMs. Progress in this field stems from two primary efforts: (1) developing dedicated monolingual models for low-to-medium-resource languages ____, and (2) creating multilingual LLMs with pre-trained data encompassing multiple languages  ____. 

The ability of Multilingual LLMs to operate in % and transfer knowledge between,
different languages  ____ comes from two sources: (1)  training or fine-tuning on multilingual data in order to achieve multilingual proficiency
____, and (2) utilizing prompting techniques to harness the model's inherent multilingual capabilities without modifying parameters during inference ____. This latter approach has gained popularity due to its efficiency and applicability to a wider range of use cases.


%Following these developments, benchmarks for evaluating LLMs have been proposed to measure cross-lingual transfer, including for low-resource languages ____ and benchmarks focusing on specific language families such as Indian languages  ____ and African languages ____. 





%\subsection{Multilingual Prompting Approaches}

For the latter, to improve the multilingual capabilities of  LLMs
researchers
%\reut{if this pertains to item (2) above, say it}
  developed various prompting methods. ____ introduced XLT, a cross-lingual prompt that directs LLMs to function as experts in a specific language through a process involving problem-solving and cross-lingual thinking. ____ employed discrete and soft prompting techniques and showed that few-shot non-English prompts outperform finetuning in cross-lingual transfer. ____ found that chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts lead to multilingual reasoning abilities in LLMs, even in under-represented languages. Another strategy is \emph{pre-transaltion} which translates the entire prompt to English ____. A more nuanced approach, \emph{selective pre-translation}, translates part of the prompt into English, for instance, ____ translated only the instruction, and ____ translated the few shot examples. While
these use cases lack a systematic research foundation, in this study, we systematically study pre-translation configurations to provide evidence-based recommendations for optimal use.
