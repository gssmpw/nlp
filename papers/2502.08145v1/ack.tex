A large number of people helped us in securing access and allocations at
different supercomputing sites, and/or with improving the performance of our
framework, and we wish to thank each one of them. For compute time allocations
and reservations: Richard Gerber and Rebecca Hartman-Baker at NERSC/LBL;
Bronson Messer and Phil Roth at ORNL; Maria-Grazia Giuffreda at CSCS; and Jack
Wells at NVIDIA. For help with runs and software stack issues: Kevin Gott and
Peter Harrington at NERSC/LBL; Jens Glaser and Michael Sandoval at ORNL; Fabian
B\"osch, Theofilos Manitaras, Henrique Mendoni\c{c}a, and Fawzi Mohamed at
CSCS; Nicholas Malaya and Alessandro Fanfarillo at AMD; Tom Gibbs, and Josh
Romero at NVIDIA; Mark Stock and Mengshiou Wu at HPE; and others working behind
the scenes.

This material is based upon work supported in part by the ONR and OFOSR MURI
programs, and the National Science Foundation (IIS-2229885 \& IIS-2212182).  An
award for computer time was provided by the U.S.~Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE)
Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE)
Program. This research used resources of:~(1)~the Oak Ridge Leadership
Computing Facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is supported by
the Office of Science of the U.S.~DOE under Contract
No.~DE-AC05-00OR22725,~(2)~the National Energy Research Scientific Computing
Center (NERSC), a DOE Office of Science User Facility using NERSC awards
DDR-ERCAP0029894 and DDR-ERCAP0029890, and~(3) the Swiss National
Supercomputing Centre (CSCS).
