\subsubsection{Wasserstein DRO}
Wasserstein DRO  has recently garnered significant attention due to its tractability ____ and generalizability ____. Notably, ____ and ____ demonstrate that Wasserstein DRO with mean square loss is equivalent to the square root lasso ____. Similarly, ____ establish that Wasserstein DRO with logistic loss and hinge loss corresponds to their regularized counterparts. Moreover, the statistical properties of the WDRO estimator have also been investigated in ____. However, leveraging external knowledge in Wasserstein DRO has been an open problem.

\subsubsection{Transfer Learning}\label{sec:review:tl}
Improving prediction accuracy for target populations by integrating diverse source datasets has driven methodological advances in transfer learning. Contemporary approaches aim to address challenges including distributional heterogeneity and limited labeled target data. A common assumption is that the target outcome model aligns partially with source models, enabling knowledge transfer. For example, recent frameworks employ selective parameter reduction to identify transferable sources and sparse or ridge shrinkage to leverage their knowledge ____. Subsequent works tackle covariate distribution mismatches and semi-supervised scenarios, enhancing robustness when labeled target data is scarce ____. Further innovations include geometric or profile-based adaptations, where the target model is represented as a weighted combination of source coefficients ____.
