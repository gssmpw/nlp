\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
How does intelligence emerge? We propose that intelligence is not a sudden gift or random occurrence, but rather a crucial trait for species to survive through Natural Selection. Natural Selection requires a species to find solutions within a limited number of trial-and-error attempts. Building on this idea, we introduce \textit{Survival Game} as a framework to evaluate intelligence based on the number of failed attempts in a trial-and-error process. Fewer failures indicate higher intelligence. When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both finite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new challenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using \textit{Survival Game}, we comprehensively evaluate existing artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Our results show that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they are still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search, recommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help, this would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the Autonomous Level for general tasks would require $10^{26}$ parameters. To put this into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs that their total value is $4 \times 10^{7}$ times that of Apple Inc.'s market value. Even with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take $70$ years. This staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the inadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this phenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of \textit{Survival Game} and its experimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a ``criticality'' property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep understanding of the task's underlying mechanisms. Current AI systems, however, do not fully grasp these mechanisms and instead rely on superficial mimicry, making it difficult for them to reach an autonomous level. We believe \textit{Survival Game} can not only guide the future development of AI but also offer profound insights into human intelligence.
