\section{Illustration of the Overall Framework}
\label{appendix_sec:detailed_overview}
We provide illustrations of the end-to-end flow of our proposed zero-shot video captioning framework, along with additional example in Figures~\ref{appendix_fig:framework_detailed}. 
The framework includes frame captioning via image VLMs, scene graph parsing for individual frames, scene graph consolidation to produce a unified representation, and graph-to-text translation for generate video generation.

The pipeline consists of: (1) frame captioning via image VLMs, (2) scene graph parsing for individual frames, (3) scene graph merging to produce a unified representation, and (4) graph-to-text transformation for final caption generation.}
