  abstract = {A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the three-factor model of Fama and French (FF, 1993). The five-factor model׳s main problem is its failure to capture the low average returns on small stocks whose returns behave like those of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability. The model׳s performance is not sensitive to the way its factors are defined. With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.}

  abstract  = {Natural Language Processing (NLP) demonstrates a great potential to support financial decision-making by analyzing the text from social media or news outlets. In this work, we build a platform to study the NLP-aided stock auto-trading algorithms systematically. In contrast to the previous work, our platform is characterized by three features: (1) We provide financial news for each specific stock. (2) We provide various stock factors for each stock. (3) We evaluate performance from more financial-relevant metrics. Such a design allows us to develop and evaluate NLP-aided stock auto-trading algorithms in a more realistic setting. In addition to designing an evaluation platform and dataset collection, we also made a technical contribution by proposing a system to automatically learn a good feature representation from various input information. The key to our algorithm is a method called semantic role labeling Pooling (SRLP), which leverages Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to create a compact representation of each news paragraph. Based on SRLP, we further incorporate other stock factors to make the final prediction. In addition, we propose a self-supervised learning strategy based on SRLP to enhance the out-of-distribution generalization performance of our system. Through our experimental study, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance and outperforms all the baselines{'} annualized rate of return as well as the maximum drawdown of the CSI300 index and XIN9 index on real trading. Our Astock dataset and code are available at https://github.com/JinanZou/Astock.}

abstract = {For regression models other than the linear model, R-squared type goodness-of-fit summary statistics have been constructed for particular models using a variety of methods. We propose an R-squared measure of goodness of fit for the class of exponential family regression models, which includes logit, probit, Poisson, geometric, gamma, and exponential. This R-squared is defined as the proportionate reduction in uncertainty, measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence, due to the inclusion of regressors. Under further conditions concerning the conditional mean function it can also be interpreted as the fraction of uncertainty explained by the fitted model.}

abstract = {This study shows the influence of investor sentiment on the market's mean–variance tradeoff. We find that the stock market's expected excess return is positively related to the market's conditional variance in low-sentiment periods but unrelated to variance in high-sentiment periods. These findings are consistent with sentiment traders who, during the high-sentiment periods, undermine an otherwise positive mean–variance tradeoff. We also find that the negative correlation between returns and contemporaneous volatility innovations is much stronger in the low-sentiment periods. The latter result is consistent with the stronger positive ex ante relation during such periods.}

In this paper, we propose DeepTrader, a deep RL method to optimize the investment policy. In particular, to tackle the risk-return balancing problem, our model embeds macro market conditions as an indicator to dynamically adjust the proportion between long and short funds, to lower the risk of market fluctuations, with the negative maximum drawdown as the reward function. Additionally, the model involves a unit to evaluate individual assets, which learns dynamic patterns from historical data with the price rising rate as the reward function. Both temporal and spatial dependencies between assets are captured hierarchically by a specific type of graph structure. Particularly, we find that the estimated causal structure best captures the interrelationships between assets, compared to industry classification and correlation. The two units are complementary and integrated to generate a suitable portfolio which fits the market trend well and strikes a balance between return and risk effectively. Experiments on three well-known stock indexes demonstrate the superiority of DeepTrader in terms of risk-gain criteria.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wang, Zhicheng and Huang, Biwei and Tu, Shikui and Zhang, Kun and Xu, Lei}, year={2021}, month={May}, pages={643-650} }

abstract = {The phenomenon of the occurrence of rare yet extreme events, “Black Swans” in Taleb's terminology, seems to be more apparent in financial markets around the globe. This means there is not only a need to design proper risk modelling techniques which can predict the probability of risky events in normal market conditions but also a requirement for tools which can assess the probabilities of rare financial events; like the recent global financial crisis (2007–2008). An obvious candidate, when dealing with extreme financial events and the quantification of extreme market risk is extreme value theory (EVT). This proves to be a natural statistical modelling technique of relevance. Extreme value theory provides well-established statistical models for the computation of extreme risk measures like the return level, value at risk and expected shortfall. In this paper we apply univariate extreme value theory to model extreme market risk for the ASX-All Ordinaries (Australian) index and the S&P-500 (USA) Index. We demonstrate that EVT can be successfully applied to financial market return series for predicting static VaR, CVaR or expected shortfall (ES) and expected return level and also daily VaR using a GARCH(1,1) and EVT based dynamic approach.}

abstract = {This study re-examines the relationship between U.S. stock market volatility and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) using the mixed-frequency dynamic threshold model. The empirical results exhibit several findings. The EPU has a threshold effect that is time-varying. Moreover, combining the dynamic threshold with the Markov-regime Mix-frequency model (MS-MIDAS), we find that this new model can significantly improve the predictive performance in a statistical view compared to other competing models (including the benchmark model). Our findings can provide new insight into volatility forecasting.}

abstract = {The task of stock earnings forecasting has received considerable attention due to the demand investors in real-world scenarios. However, compared with financial institutions, it is not easy for ordinary investors to mine factors and analyze news. On the other hand, although large language models in the financial field can serve users in the form of dialogue robots, it still requires users to have financial knowledge to ask reasonable questions. To serve the user experience, we aim to build an automatic system, FinReport, for ordinary investors to collect information, analyze it, and generate reports after summarizing.Specifically, our FinReport is based on financial news announcements and a multi-factor model to ensure the professionalism of the report. The FinReport consists of three modules: news factorization module, return forecasting module, risk assessment module. The news factorization module involves understanding news information and combining it with stock factors, the return forecasting module aim to analysis the impact of news on market sentiment, and the risk assessment module is adopted to control investment risk. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have well verified the effectiveness and explainability of our proposed FinReport. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/frinkleko/FinReport.},
