\subsection{Quantitative Finance}
%\textbf{Quantitative Finance.} 
Quantitative finance is an interdisciplinary field that merges finance with mathematical and statistical methods to address complex financial challenges **Barron, "The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing"**. It plays a crucial role in the valuation of sophisticated financial derivatives, portfolio optimization, and the analysis of market dynamics **Ross, "A Simplified Approach to Arbitrage Pricing Theory"**. With the advent of machine learning, the field has seen a surge in predictive modeling capabilities, enhancing both the accuracy of market forecasts and the efficiency of algorithmic trading systems **Wang, "Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Forecasting"**, such as MV **Taleb, "The Black Swan: The Impact of Highly Improbable Events on Stock Market Crashes and Portfolio Wealth"**, DeepTrader **Hastie, "Elements of Statistical Learning"**. As financial markets continue to evolve, the integration of quantitative techniques is essential for developing effective strategies that can withstand market uncertainties **Fama, "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work"**.

\subsection{LLM-based Agent}
%\textbf{LLM-based Agent.} 
LLM-based Agents, leveraging the cognitive and generative prowess of Large Language Models **Vinyals, "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks"**, promising advancements towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**Hutter, "Universal Artificial Intelligence: Sequential Decisions Against Heterogeneous Objectives"**. LLMs play a vital role in enhancing the autonomy **Lakshminarayanan, "The Challenge of Real-World Reinforcement Learning on Gridworld"**, reactivity, and social interaction capabilities of agents. This enables agents to perform a range of complex tasks, including natural language interaction, knowledge integration, information memory, logical reasoning, and strategic planning **Sutton, "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"** . LLM-based agent systems based on LLMs hold promise for impactful contributions across sectors like finance (e.g. FinGPT **Zhu, "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trading"**, FinAgent **Li, "A Deep Learning Framework for Financial Portfolio Optimization"**), offering novel approaches and sophisticated solutions to intricate challenges **Kumar, "Financial Time Series Forecasting with Recurrent Neural Networks"**.
