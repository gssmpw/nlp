abstract = {A bit catastrophe, loosely defined, is when a change in just one character of a string causes a significant change in the size of the compressed string. We study this phenomenon for the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), a string transform at the heart of several of the most popular compressors and aligners today. The parameter determining the size of the compressed data is the number of equal-letter runs of the BWT, commonly denoted r.We exhibit infinite families of strings in which insertion, deletion, resp. substitution of one character increases r from constant to Θ(logn), where n is the length of the string. These strings can be interpreted both as examples for an increase by a multiplicative or an additive Θ(logn)-factor. As regards multiplicative factor, they attain the upper bound given by Akagi, Funakoshi, and Inenaga [Inf \& Comput. 2023] of O(lognlogr), since here r=O(1).We then give examples of strings in which insertion, deletion, resp. substitution of a character increases r by a Θ(n) additive factor. These strings significantly improve the best known lower bound for an additive factor of Ω(logn) [Giuliani et al., SOFSEM 2021].},

abstract = {Bandit algorithms have become a reference solution for interactive recommendation. However, as such algorithms directly interact with users for improved recommendations, serious privacy concerns have been raised regarding its practical use. In this work, we propose a differentially private linear contextual bandit algorithm, via a tree-based mechanism to add Laplace or Gaussian noise to model parameters. Our key insight is that as the model converges during online update, the global sensitivity of its parameters shrinks over time (thus named dynamic global sensitivity). Compared with existing solutions, our dynamic global sensitivity analysis allows us to inject less noise to obtain (ϵ, δ)-differential privacy with added regret caused by noise injection in . We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis over the amount of noise added via dynamic global sensitivity and the corresponding upper regret bound of our proposed algorithm. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets confirmed the algorithm’s advantage against existing solutions.},

year = {2024},

pages = {1671-1684},
abstract = { Differentially private triangle counting in graphs is essential for analyzing connection patterns and calculating clustering coefficients while protecting sensitive individual information. Previous works have relied on either central or local models to enforce differential privacy. However, a significant utility gap exists between the central and local models of differentially private triangle counting, depending on whether or not a trusted server is needed. In particular, the central model provides a high accuracy but necessitates a trusted server. The local model does not require a trusted server but suffers from limited accuracy. Our paper introduces a crypto-assisted differentially private triangle counting system, named CARGO, leveraging cryptographic building blocks to improve the effectiveness of differentially private triangle counting without assumption of trusted servers. It achieves high utility similar to the central model but without the need for a trusted server like the local model. CARGO consists of three main components. First, we introduce a similarity-based projection method that reduces the global sensitivity while preserving more triangles via triangle homogeneity. Second, we present a triangle counting scheme based on the additive secret sharing that securely and accurately computes the triangles while protecting sensitive information. Third, we design a distributed perturbation algorithm that perturbs the triangle count with minimal but sufficient noise. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of our proposed methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CARGO significantly outperforms the local model in terms of utility and achieves high-utility triangle counting comparable to the central model. },

abstract = {We continue a line of research initiated in [10,11]on privacy-preserving statistical databases. Consider a trusted server that holds a database of sensitive information. Given a query function f mapping databases to reals, the so-called true answer is the result of applying f to the database. To protect privacy, the true answer is perturbed by the addition of random noise generated according to a carefully chosen distribution, and this response, the true answer plus noise, is returned to the user.Previous work focused on the case of noisy sums, in which f = ∑ig(xi), where xi denotes the ith row of the database and g maps database rows to [0,1]. We extend the study to general functions f, proving that privacy can be preserved by calibrating the standard deviation of the noise according to the sensitivity of the function f. Roughly speaking, this is the amount that any single argument to f can change its output. The new analysis shows that for several particular applications substantially less noise is needed than was previously understood to be the case.The first step is a very clean characterization of privacy in terms of indistinguishability of transcripts. Additionally, we obtain separation results showing the increased value of interactive sanitization mechanisms over non-interactive.},

abstract = {Cryptography is ubiquitous and plays a key role in ensuring data secrecy and integrity as well as in securing computer systems more broadly. Introduction to Modern Cryptography provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of this fascinating subject. The authors introduce the core principles of modern cryptography, with an emphasis on formal definitions, clear assumptions, and rigorous proofs of security. The book begins by focusing on private-key cryptography, including an extensive treatment of private-key encryption, message authentication codes, and hash functions. The authors also present design principles for widely used stream ciphers and block ciphers including RC4, DES, and AES, plus provide provable constructions of stream ciphers and block ciphers from lower-level primitives. The second half of the book covers public-key cryptography, beginning with a self-contained introduction to the number theory needed to understand the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and El Gamal cryptosystems (and others), followed by a thorough treatment of several standardized public-key encryption and digital signature schemes. Integrating a more practical perspective without sacrificing rigor, this widely anticipated Second Edition offers improved treatment of: Stream ciphers and block ciphers, including modes of operation and design principles Authenticated encryption and secure communication sessions Hash functions, including hash-function applications and design principles Attacks on poorly implemented cryptography, including attacks on chained-CBC encryption, padding-oracle attacks, and timing attacks The random-oracle model and its application to several standardized, widely used public-key encryption and signature schemes Elliptic-curve cryptography and associated standards such as DSA/ECDSA and DHIES/ECIES Containing updated exercises and worked examples, Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Second Edition can serve as a textbook for undergraduate- or graduate-level courses in cryptography, a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners, or a general introduction suitable for self-study.}

For example, one can prove a lower bound on the complexity of computing discrete logarithms in a cyclic group if one considers only generic algorithms which can not exploit the properties of the representation of the group elements.We propose an abstract model of computation which allows to capture such reasonable restrictions on the power of algorithms. The algorithm interacts with a black-box with hidden internal state variables which allows to perform a certain set of operations on the internal state variables, and which provides output only by allowing to check whether some state variables satisfy certain relations. For example, generic algorithms correspond to the special case where only the equality relation, and possibly also an abstract total order relation, can be tested.We consider several instantiation of the model and different types of computational problems and prove a few known and new lower bounds for computational problems of interest in cryptography, for example that computing discrete logarithms is generically hard even if an oracle for the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem and/or other low degree relations were available.},

Of interest are both the existence of such constructions and their efficiency.Here, we show essentially tight lower bounds on the best possible efficiency of any black-box construction of some fundamental cryptographic tools from the most basic and widely used cryptographic primitives. Our results hold in an extension of the model introduced by Impagliazzo and Rudich and improve and extend earlier results of Kim, Simon, and Tetali. We focus on constructions of pseudorandom generators, universal one-way hash functions, and digital signatures based on one-way permutations, as well as constructions of public- and private-key encryption schemes based on trapdoor permutations. In each case, we show that any black-box construction beating our efficiency bound would yield the unconditional existence of a one-way function and thus, in particular, prove \$P \neq NP\$. }

abstract = {Schnorr’s identification and signature schemes [10], [11] are efficient, discrete log-based protocols. Moreover, preprocessing algorithms are proposed that significantly speed up the computations of the prover (resp. signer). Therefore, this preprocessing greatly enhances the suitability for implementation on a smart card. The preprocessing algorithms can be used for other (discrete log-based) signature schemes as well.The security of the preprocessing depends on a parameterk; the required storage is linear ink. In [10] and [11] the valuek=8 is suggested, for which the level of security is conjectured to be 272 [11].In this paper an attack on these preprocessing algorithms is presented. This attack retrieves the secret key in about (k!)2 steps, using in the order of consecutive signatures or transcripts of identifications. Fork=8, this amounts to about 231 steps and 700 signatures.This attack is applicable to Brickell-McCurley, ElGamal, and DSS signatures as well, if the same preprocessing algorithm is used.},

abstract="A large number of works prove lower bounds on space-time trade-offs in preprocessing attacks, i.e., trade-offs between the size of the advice and the time needed to break a scheme given such advice. We contend that the question of how much time is needed to produce this advice is equally important, and often highly non-trivial. However, this question has received significantly less attention. In this paper, we present lower bounds on the complexity of preprocessing attacks that depend on both offline and online time. As in the case of space-time trade-offs, we focus in particular on settings with ideal primitives, where both the offline and online time-complexities are approximated by the number of queries to the given primitive. We give generic results that highlight the benefits of salting to generically increase the offline costs of preprocessing attacks. The majority of our paper presents several results focusing on salted hash functions. In particular, we provide a fairly involved analysis of the pre-image- and collision-resistance security of the (two-block) Merkle-Damg{\aa}rd construction in our model.",

abstract = {Oblivious Transfer OT is the fundamental building block of cryptographic protocols. In this paper we describe the simplest and most efficient protocol for 1-out-of-n OT to date, which is obtained by tweaking the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol. The protocol achieves UC-security against active and adaptive corruptions in the random oracle model. Due to its simplicity, the protocol is extremely efficient and it allows to perform m 1-out-of-n OTs using only:Computation: $$n+1m+2$$ n+1m+2 exponentiations mn for the receiver, $$mn+2$$ mn+2 for the sender andCommunication: $$32m+1$$ 32m+1 bytes for the group elements, and 2mn ciphertexts.We also report on an implementation of the protocol using elliptic curves, and on a number of mechanisms we employ to ensure that our software is secure against active attacks too. Experimental results show that our protocol thanks to both algorithmic and implementation optimizations is at least one order of magnitude faster than previous work.},

abstract="The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is the elliptic curve analogue of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). It was accepted in 1999 as an ANSI standard and in 2000 as IEEE and NIST standards. It was also accepted in 1998 as an ISO standard and is under consideration for inclusion in some other ISO standards. Unlike the ordinary discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem, no subexponential-time algorithm is known for the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. For this reason, the strength-per-key-bit is substantially greater in an algorithm that uses elliptic curves. This paper describes the ANSI X9.62 ECDSA, and discusses related security, implementation, and interoperability issues.",

abstract="Key-homomorphic properties of cryptographic objects, i.e., homomorphisms on their key space, have proven to be useful, both from a theoretical as well as a practical perspective. Important cryptographic objects such as pseudorandom functions or (public key) encryption have been studied previously with respect to key-homomorphisms. Interestingly, however, signature schemes have not been explicitly investigated in this context so far. We close this gap and initiate the study of key-homomorphic signatures, which turns out to be an interesting and versatile concept. In doing so, we firstly propose a definitional framework for key-homomorphic signatures distilling various natural flavours of key-homomorphic properties. Those properties aim to classify existing signature schemes and thus allow to infer general statements about signature schemes from those classes by simply making black-box use of the respective properties. We apply our definitional framework to show elegant and simple compilers from classes of signature schemes admitting different types of key-homomorphisms to a number of other interesting primitives such as ring signature schemes, (universal) designated verifier signature schemes, simulation-sound extractable non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments, and multisignature schemes. Additionally, using the formalisms provided by our framework, we can prove a tight implication from single-user security to key-prefixed multi-user security for a class of schemes admitting a certain key-homomorphism.",
