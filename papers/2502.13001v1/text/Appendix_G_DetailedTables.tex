In \Cref{fig:app_omni_psychology}, we show the participant behavior pattern of the omniscient single model compared to \dataset{} simulated participant behavior patterns.
We observe that the patterns rarely match, and the single model struggles to reflect topic control, standpoint maintenance, or support offering.
We conclude that the single model omniscient approach cannot simulate group behaviors directly.
