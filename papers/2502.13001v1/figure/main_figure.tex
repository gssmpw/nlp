    \caption{Architecture of our meeting generation framework \pipeline{}. Stages 1 to 3 are realized as a linear pipeline of LLM instances. Stage 4 is an agent orchestrating participants played by agents, who can decide on the length of the meeting through voting. Stage 5 checks and optionally provides feedback for refinement to stage 4 agent. The remaining stages, 6 and 7, polish the generated conversation.}
