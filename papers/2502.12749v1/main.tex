\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this article, we revisit the complexity of the reconfiguration 
of independent sets under the token sliding rule on chordal graphs.
In the \textsc{Token Sliding-Connectivity} problem, 
the input is a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, and 
the objective is to determine whether the reconfiguration graph 
$TS_k(G)$ of $G$ is connected. 
The vertices of $TS_k(G)$ are $k$-independent sets of $G$, 
and two vertices are adjacent if and only if one can transform one 
of the two corresponding independent sets into the other by sliding 
a vertex (also called a \emph{token}) along an edge. 
Bonamy and Bousquet [WG'17] proved that the 
\textsc{Token Sliding-Connectivity} problem is 
polynomial-time solvable on interval graphs but \NP-hard 
on split graphs.
In light of these two results, the authors asked: can we decide the connectivity of $TS_k(G)$ in polynomial time for chordal graphs with 
\emph{maximum clique-tree degree} $d$? 
We answer this question in the negative and prove that the problem is \para-\NP-hard when parameterized by $d$. 
More precisely, the problem is \NP-hard even when $d = 4$. 
We then study the parameterized complexity of the problem for a larger 
parameter called \emph{leafage} and prove that the problem is 
\co-\W[1]-hard.
We prove similar results for a closely related problem called 
\textsc{Token Sliding-Reachability}. 
In this problem, the input is a graph $G$ with two of its 
$k$-independent sets $I$ and $J$, and 
the objective is to determine whether there is a sequence of 
valid token sliding moves that transform $I$ into $J$.
