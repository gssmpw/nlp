Diversity is an important factor in developing AI-ready, high-quality datasets but is often ignored in data augmentation methods. 
We propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}) that trains an LLM paraphraser to enlarge and introduce diversity to textual datasets. 
The LLM paraphraser is fine-tuned to rewrite existing sentences in the original datasets, generating high-affinity samples and ensuring coherence of the dataset. 
We further construct a preference dataset and then fine-tune the LLM paraphraser with the DPO algorithm to encourage diversified generation. 
In this way, we maximize the diversity of the augmented dataset in our method. 
In extensive experiments, our proposed method exhibits a remarkable capability to boost dataset diversity, and the diversity gain significantly benefits the model's learning performance of downstream tasks.
