\section*{Limitations}
Although our approach enhances personality trait control in LLMs, it comes with additional computational costs compared to prompt-based techniques. This is because it requires both generating appropriate adjustment queries and making direct modifications to the modelâ€™s internal representations, rather than relying solely on inference-time adjustments. However, this trade-off is justified, as our method ensures more stable and interpretable personality shifts, effectively addressing intrinsic biases and providing greater reliability in personality expression.
