%\kenneth{I think the high-level, central theme of our paper is this: How do you "fairly" compare a model's performance across language variations? An (unspoken) underlying argument we want to push back is this: "When you have big enough data---of popular, mainstream variation---and a big enough model, NLP tasks in less popular variations will be automatically solved altogether." In order to push back this argument, we want to construct a robust, fair, and measurable evaluation to pinpoint the performance gap.\\\\
%Although we might be able to learn some "methods" in machine translation papers on how they compared a model's performance across different languages, there's a fundamental difference between benchmarking across variations and benchmarking across languages: People just KNOW English and Spanish are different. Machine-translation people do not need to care as much (in some cases, they do care!) about having a very very "fair" comparison across different languages because... people just know different languages are different.}
