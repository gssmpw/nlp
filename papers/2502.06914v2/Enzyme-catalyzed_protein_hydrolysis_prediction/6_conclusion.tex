\section{Conclusion and Future work}
In this paper, we study a novel problem of developing a unified protein cleavage site predictor for diverse proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, we design a biochemically-informed enzyme encoder and incorporate redundant enzyme active-site information. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniZyme outperforms baselines by a large margin across various enzyme-substrate families, particularly excelling in zero-shot scenarios. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each proposed module in {\method}. There are two directions that need further investigation. First, while this study focuses on proteolytic enzymes, we will extend to other categories of enzymes and substrates, and investigate whether enzyme-catalyzed reactions follow scaling law. Second, if more hydrolysis process data becomes available, incorporating dynamic structural information may improve prediction accuracy.
