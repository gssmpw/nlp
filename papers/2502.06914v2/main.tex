\begin{abstract}
Enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage is essential for many biological functions. Accurate prediction of cleavage sites can facilitate various applications such as drug development, enzyme design, and a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. However, most existing models are restricted to an individual enzyme, which neglects shared knowledge of enzymes and fails generalize to novel enzymes. Thus, we introduce a unified protein cleavage site predictor named {\method}, which can generalize across diverse enzymes. To enhance the enzyme encoding for the protein cleavage site prediction, {\method} employs a novel biochemically-informed model architecture along with active-site knowledge of proteolytic enzymes.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that {\method} achieves high accuracy in predicting cleavage sites across a range of proteolytic enzymes, including unseen enzymes. 
The code is available in  \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UniZyme-4A67}.
