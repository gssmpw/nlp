\textbf{Circuit Based Interpretability in Language Models.} With the advent of language models, several recent works have focused on a mechanistic understanding of language models____. One of the primary benefit of transformer based language models is that the final logit representation can be decomposed as a sum of individual model components____. Based on this decomposition, one can extract task-specific causal sub-graphs (i.e., circuits) of internal model components in language models. Early works have extracted such circuits for indirect-object identification____, greater-than operation____ and more recently for entity-tracking____. %Recently, there has been an increasing focus on the practical aspects of mechanistic interpretability such as refusal mediation____ or safety in general____. 
Circuits can also be constructed as sub-graphs of neurons in the language model, but it often comes with increased complexity of interpretation____. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on the practical aspects of mechanistic interpretability such as refusal mediation____ or safety in general____. In our paper, we focus on extracting circuits for a real-world task such as extractive QA with a particular emphasis on practical applications such as {\it attribution} and {\it steering}.

\textbf{Applications in Context-Augmented QA.} With the advent of retrieval-augmented generation____ language models have been increasingly used for real-world Question-Answering (QA) tasks. One of the primary enhancement of context-augmented QA lies in the ability to provide reliable grounding (i.e., attribution) in the context for the generated answer____. In recent times, there have been a large set of works which improve LLM responses by reducing hallucinations and improving grounding in the input context____.
Beyond grounding, ____ investigate the interplay between model's use of parametric vs. context knowledge.
%We note that our paper tests the ability of the mechanistic insights from circuits towards performing these applications for extractive QA tasks.
