Although this work explores classical generation tasks, it is important to note that some of these tasks, particularly WebNLG and E2E, are of relatively limited complexity.
Additionally, we limited our experiments to 7B models due to computational constraints. While this choice allows us to effectively demonstrate our approach, larger models could potentially yield different insights. Future work could validate the scalability and effectiveness of the proposed methods on larger model architectures.
Lastly, this study primarily relied on automatic evaluation metrics. While these metrics have shown value, particularly in assessing faithfulness, their performance across the diverse domains of our datasets remains less explored. Ideally, a broader human evaluation would provide a more nuanced understanding of the results. However, given the resource and logistical constraints of conducting such evaluations, automatic metrics serve as a practical solution within the scope of this work, even if they have certain limitations.
