The inquiry, carried out by Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, England's NHS medical director, was set up following the Mid-Staffordshire Hospital scandal.
A report into high death rates at two hospitals in Mid-Staffordshire earlier this year found there were hundreds more deaths than expected, with patients let down by poor standards of care.
The table below shows how the 14 NHS trusts covered by the review scored in two measures of mortality. A score much above 100 is higher than the national average.
All of the data has been standardised to take into account the different case-mix at hospitals - for example, hospitals that treat more elderly patients might be expected to have higher death rates. & \textbf{ROUGE-L}: 32.00 / \textbf{AL}: 20.67  A review of NHS trusts in England has found that \redhl{11} of 14 trusts have been rated as \redhl{performing above the national average for the number of patients who died}. & \textbf{ROUGE-L}: 17.77 / \textbf{AL}: 90.87  NHS trusts covered by an inquiry into high mortality rates at hospitals in Staffordshire scored above the national average in two measures, \redhl{BBC} data shows. \\

The Robins have lost 11 of their past 12 league games, winning just once in that time, and are 20th in the table - two points above the relegation zone.
""It is a horrendous statistic,"" Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol.
""I'm ashamed of that. It hurts. We have to keep fighting.""
Former Barnsley boss Johnson arrived at Ashton Gate in February 2016 and steered Bristol City clear of relegation last season.
A promising start this term saw his side occupy fifth spot in October, but Saturday's loss at the City Ground saw them drop below Forest - who had not won since 2 December.
""It was a frustrating watch for all of us,"" Johnson said. ""We were good in the second half and had a couple of chances we needed to take.
""The Championship was never going to be easy - we are in a rebuilding phase.
""We spoke at the start of the season about history makers and it was supposed to be positive - not bad history.
""We've got to make sure we make history in positive ways and we can still do that this year. We need to fight our way back up the table. I believe that we can.""	& \textbf{ROUGE-L}: 42.10 / \textbf{AL}: 4.0  Bristol City manager \redhl{Lee} Johnson says he is "ashamed" of his side's poor form \redhl{after they lost 2-0 at Nottingham Forest}. & \textbf{ROUGE-L}: 21.87 \textbf{AL}: 86.5 Bristol City boss \redhl{Lee} Johnson "hurts" to be "ashamed" of his side's "horrendous" recent Championship run and insists they can still fight their way back up the table. \\
