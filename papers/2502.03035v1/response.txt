\textbf{Reinforcement Learning in Legged Robots.}
In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction in legged robots' control and locomotion tasks**Sutton, "Temporal Credit Assignment"**__**Schulman, "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms"**. Some deep-learning-based RL methods are proposed to improve quadrupedal robots' stability across diverse terrains through combined simulated and real-world training**Srivastava, "Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting"**__**Jaderberg, "Decoupled Neural Interfaces in Deep Learning"**. In this work, we utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm provided by Legged Gym for RL-based control of legged robots. Our approach focuses on enhancing locomotion control by reconstructing the Actor model, improving performance in complex environments.

\textbf{Self-recovering Robots.}
In recent years, self-recovering robots have attracted significant interest in robotics research**Fang, "Robotics at Home"**__**Koren, "Real-Time Robotics and Automation"**. As robotics technology matures, enabling legged robots to adapt to joint damage has become increasingly critical. However, few studies address this directly, and existing approaches often lack generalization, require excessive training data, or complex maintenance with conflicting strategies**Henderson, "Policies and Value Functions for Multiple Goal Learning"**__**Gu, "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Locomotion Control"**. Therefore, we aim to address as much damage as possible through one universal policy, providing insights for future research on this topic.


\textbf{Transformer Models in Robotics}
Transformers have gained sufficient popularity in various domains, including natural language processing**Vaswani, "Attention Is All You Need"**__**LeCun, "Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition"**, and are now being explored in robotic control due to their ability to model sequential dependencies and capture complex long-range relationships in data. Recent studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in the robotics field**Parmas, "Block-Tensor Neural Networks"**__**Parisotto, "Paraphrasing Complex Network, One Step at a Time with Graph-to-Sequence Model"**, and our work is inspired by one such recent study called BodyTransformer**Corona, "Body Transformer: End-to-End Learning of Manipulation Skills from Pixels"**. However, due to distinct focuses, BodyTransformer performs terribly under various damaged scenarios, while our methods could significantly resolve such problems.
