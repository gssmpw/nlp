\begin{abstract}
We consider waveform iterations for dynamical coupled problems, or more specifically, PDEs that interact through a lower dimensional interface. We want to allow for the reuse of existing codes for the subproblems, called a partitioned approach. To improve computational efficiency, different and adaptive time steps in the subsolvers are advisable. Using so called waveform iterations in combination with relaxation, this has been achieved for heat transfer problems earlier. Alternatively, one can use a black box method like Quasi-Newton to improve the convergence behaviour. These methods have recently been combined with waveform iterations for fixed time steps. Here, we suggest an extension of the Quasi-Newton method to the time adaptive setting and analyze its properties. 

We compare the proposed Quasi-Newton method with state of the art solvers on a heat transfer test case, and a complex mechanical Fluid-Structure interaction case, demonstrating the methods efficiency.

\section{Conclusion}

We presented an extension of the Quasi-Newton waveform relaxation method to time adaptivity. Our method uses a fixed auxiliary time grid. This introduces an interpolation error that can be controlled through the choice of the grid. Benefits are in convergence behaviour and ease of implementation. This only requires adding one extra interpolation step and we presented our implementation in the open source coupling library preCICE.

We demonstrated the methods efficiency by comparing it with optimal relaxation and QNWR using a fixed time grid on a simple thermal transfer case.  We also showcase the method on a more advanced Fluid-structure interaction test case, showing it's robustness. 
%These are promising results demonstrating the methods potential for improving the convergence behaviour of general coupled problems.
%However, future research is required to further investigate the efficiency and energy consumption on more advanced test cases.
