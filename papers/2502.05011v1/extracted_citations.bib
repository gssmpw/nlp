abstract = {In this paper, we present token labelingâ€”a new training objective for training high-performance vision transformers (ViTs). Different from the standard training objective of ViTs that computes the classification loss on an additional trainable class token, our proposed one takes advantage of all the image patch tokens to compute the training loss in a dense manner. Specifically, token labeling reformulates the image classification problem into multiple token-level recognition problems and assigns each patch token with an individual location-specific supervision generated by a machine annotator. Experiments show that token labeling can clearly and consistently improve the performance of various ViT models across a wide spectrum. For a vision transformer with 26M learnable parameters serving as an example, with token labeling, the model can achieve 84.4\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The result can be further increased to 86.4\% by slightly scaling the model size up to 150M, delivering the minimal-sized model among previous models (250M+) reaching 86\%. We also show that token labeling can clearly improve the generalization capability of the pretrained models on downstream tasks with dense prediction, such as semantic segmentation.},

    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)."

abstract = {Ransomware, the malicious software that encrypts user files to demand a ransom payment, is one of the most common and persistent threats. Cyber-criminals create new ransomware variants to evade protections shortly after anti-virus software vendors updated their signature (e.g., static feature obtained from binaries) database. Therefore, many ransomware detection systems today begin to employ behavioral features, or dynamic features, in addition to static features. However, even though ransomware detection using dynamic features can deal with ransomware variants, it has the following limitations: (1) it requires the ransomware to be executed, (2) ransomware may behave differently in a real environment that differs from the controlled environment, and (3) a ransomware sample can become deactivated when command and control (C&C) servers are taken down; hence, they make it impossible to compare multiple detection systems proposed by researchers under identical conditions. To address the limitations, we present ransap, our new open dataset of ransomware storage access patterns. The dataset is currently available in a public repository. To our best knowledge, the dataset is one of the few open datasets consisting of dynamic features of ransomware. Our new open dataset includes storage access patterns of 7 significant ransomware samples and 5 popular benign software samples on various types and conditions of storage devices. Moreover, the dataset provides access patterns of ransomware variants, those on a different version of an operating system, and those on storage devices with a full drive encryption function enabled. We first present a hypervisor-based monitoring system of storage access patterns followed by a design and an implementation of a feature extractor and machine learning models for ransomware detection. Next, a detailed analysis and evaluation of our dataset are presented. Finally, limitations of our new dataset, comparison with other dynamic analysis methods, state-of-the-art ransomware detection, and future research direction are presented.}

abstract = {Ransomware has evolved from an economic nuisance to a national security threat nowadays, which poses a significant risk to users. To address this problem, we propose RansomTag, a tag-based approach against crypto ransomware with fine-grained data recovery. Compared to state-of-the-art SSD-based solutions, RansomTag makes progress in three aspects. First, it decouples the ransomware detection functionality from the firmware of the SSD and integrates it into a lightweight hypervisor of Type I. Thus, it can leverage the powerful computing capability of the host system and the rich context information, which is introspected from the operating system, to achieve accurate detection of ransomware attacks and defense against potential targeted attacks on SSD characteristics. Further, RansomTag is readily deployed onto desktop personal computers due to its parapass-through architecture. Second, RansomTag bridges the semantic gap between the hypervisor and the SSD through the tag-based approach proposed by us. Third, RansomTag is able to keep 100\% of the user data overwritten or deleted by ransomware, and restore any single or multiple user files to any versions based on timestamps. To validate our approach, we implement a prototype of RansomTag and collect 3,123 recent ransomware samples to evaluate it. The evaluation results show that our prototype effectively protects user data with minimal scale data backup and acceptable performance overhead. In addition, all the attacked files can be completely restored in fine-grained.},

abstract = {Ransomware attacks have become prevalent nowadays due to sudden flourish of cryptocurrencies. Most existing defense strategies for ransomware, however, are vulnerable to privileged ransomware who can compromise the operating system and hence any backup data stored locally. The out-of-place-update and the isolation nature of flash memory storage, for the first time, makes it possible to design a defense strategy which is secure against the privileged ransomware. In this work, we propose MimosaFTL, a secure and practical ransomware defense strategy for mobile computing devices equipped with flash memory as external storage. MimosaFTL is secure against the privileged malware by taking advantage of unique characteristics of flash storage. In addition, it is more practical (compared to prior work) for real-world deployments by: 1) incorporating a fine-grained detection scheme which can detect presence of ransomware accurately; and 2) allowing the victim to efficiently restore the infected external storage to the exact point when the malware starts to perform corruption. Experimental evaluation shows that, MimosaFTL can mitigate ransomware attacks effectively with a small negative impact on both I/O performance and lifetime of flash storage.},
