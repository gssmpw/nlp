	Virtualization has become widespread across all computing environments, from
	edge devices to cloud systems. Its main advantages are resource management
	through abstraction and improved isolation of platform resources and
	processes. However, there are still some important tradeoffs as it requires
	significant support from the existing hardware infrastructure and negatively
	impacts performance. Additionally, the current approaches to resource
	virtualization are inflexible, using a model that doesn't allow for dynamic
	adjustments during operation. This research introduces \snamefull (\sname), a
	new virtualization method for commercial platforms. \sname uses programmable
	hardware to direct cache coherence traffic, enabling precise and seamless
	control over which resources are virtualized. The paper explains the core
	principles of \sname, explores its capabilities, and shares initial findings
	from a basic proof-of-concept module tested on commercial hardware.
