\subsection{Case Study with Human Participants}

The experiments discussed above rely on simulated users. To complement this, we conducted a human evaluation study in which real users took on the roles of certain collaborators in the experiment. The goal of this study was to assess whether the agents perform the task with similar efficacy when interacting with human users compared to a fully simulated environment.
%
Like simulated users, human participants (Appendix \ref{appendix-humaneval})  had access to the documents associated with their assigned personas. Messages from the agent indicated that they were generated by an automated system. While participants were free to respond as they saw fit, they were instructed to engage as respectful colleagues within a business setting.

The study was conducted on 100 randomly selected examples from the \dataspider{} dataset. In each instance, one collaborator role was played by a human participant. To ensure meaningful interaction, rather than selecting personas randomly— which could result in cases where the human collaborator was not contacted by the agent— we specifically picked the human collaborator to be among the gold set of individuals the agent needed to contact for the test example in question.

Table \ref{tab:human-results-spider} presents results, comparing performance metrics between human-in-the-loop interactions and the fully simulated setup, when using \reactagent{} with \texttt{gpt-4-turbo}.
Human collaborators provided slightly longer responses and asked more clarification questions than simulated collaborators, leading to a higher number of messages from the agent as well. %These factors both contributed to the observed increase in MsgCnt and MsgSize.
We also observed slightly better average Match score with human users compared to full simulation. But together, these results suggest the simulated setup produces qualitatively similar dialogs and outcomes to human interactions. %making it a reasonable proxy for evaluating system performance.
