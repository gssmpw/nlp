The GOP is expected to take North Carolina and retain seats in Utah, North Dakota, and Indiana. Democrats are likely to hold West Virginia and Missouri, with competitive races in Montana, New Hampshire, and Washington. The governor's role is crucial in healthcare, as they can opt out of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. A Romney win would empower Republican governors, especially in states where Obama's policies, like high-speed rail funding, were previously rejected.]]]", title="Governor race and GOP summary")
