% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Text-driven video generation has advanced significantly due to developments in diffusion models.
Beyond the training and sampling phases, recent studies have investigated noise priors of diffusion models, as improved noise priors yield better generation results.
One recent approach employs the Fourier transform to manipulate noise, marking the initial exploration of frequency operations in this context. However, it often generates videos that lack motion dynamics and imaging details.
In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the variance decay issue present in existing methods, contributing to the loss of details and motion dynamics.
Recognizing the critical impact of noise distribution on generation quality, we introduce FreqPrior, a novel noise initialization strategy that refines noise in the frequency domain. 
Our method features a novel filtering technique designed to address different frequency signals while maintaining the noise prior distribution that closely approximates a standard Gaussian distribution.
Additionally, we propose a partial sampling process by perturbing the latent at an intermediate timestep during finding the noise prior, significantly reducing inference time without compromising quality.
Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method achieves the highest scores in both quality and semantic assessments, resulting in the best overall total score. These results highlight the superiority of our proposed noise prior.
