\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduce a new noise prior for text-to-video diffusion models, named \textbf{FreqPrior}. 
The key stage in our framework lies in noise refinement, where we propose a novel frequency filtering method specifically designed for Gaussian noise.
By refining the noise, we obtain a better prior for video diffusion models, thereby enhancing the quality of generation results.
Although other types of noise prior have been proposed to improve the performance of video diffusion models, their distributions often deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution, leading to sub-optimal generation outcomes.
In practice, the covariance error between our prior and Gaussian noise approaches zero, indicating that our noise prior closely approximates a Gaussian distribution. 
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing noise prior.
