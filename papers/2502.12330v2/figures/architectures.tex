    \caption{Overview of X-IL framework. X-IL supports multi-modal inputs (Language, RGB, and Point Cloud) and two architectures: Decoder-Only and Encoder-Decoder. Inside each architecture, the Backbone serves as the core computational unit, offering support for Transformer, Mamba, and xLSTM. For policy representations, X-IL supports Behavior Cloning (BC), Diffusion-based, and Flow-based Policies, enabling diverse learning paradigms for imitation learning. Notably, each component—input modality, architecture, backbone, and policy—can be easily swapped to efficiently explore various model configurations.
