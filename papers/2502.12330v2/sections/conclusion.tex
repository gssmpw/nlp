\section{Conclusion}
We introduced X-IL, a modular and user-friendly framework for imitation learning, enabling systematic exploration of various policy design choices such as backbones, architectures, and policy representations across multiple modalities. Our framework supports state-of-the-art encoders, efficient sequential models, and multi-modal fusion, providing a unified platform for researchers and practitioners. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO and RoboCasa, we demonstrate superior performance, improved data efficiency, and better representation learning strategies. Our findings highlight the potential of alternative sequence models, task-adapted encoders, and optimized multi-modal fusion in imitation learning. We hope X-IL serves as a valuable resource for advancing scalable and generalizable policies.
