\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents RAG-Gym, a framework designed to advance the field of language modeling by optimizing reasoning and search agents through process supervision. Our work contributes to improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by refining how language models seek, retrieve, and reason about information. The techniques proposed in this paper enhance the capabilities of language agents to handle knowledge-intensive tasks, making them more effective across various domains.

There are potential societal implications of this work, including its applications in improving AI-driven decision-making systems in areas such as research, education, and healthcare. However, our research primarily focuses on the technical advancement of process supervision in search and reasoning agents, and we do not foresee any immediate ethical concerns requiring further discussion.

% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
