\section{Conclusion}

We presented RAG-Gym, a framework for optimizing reasoning and search agents through process supervision, and introduced ReSearch, an agent architecture that unifies answer reasoning with search query generation. Experiments show that RAG-Gym improves search agents on knowledge-intensive tasks, with ReSearch consistently outperforming baselines. 
We also demonstrated the effectiveness of using LLMs as process reward judges, the transferability of trained reward models on different LLMs, and the scaling patterns of ReSearch during training and inference.
