Inverse problems have a long and evolving history, with methodologies that have undergone significant advances over the years **Solin et al., "Bayesian Inference in Inverse Problems"**.
Recently, diffusion models **Ho et al., "Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems"** have emerged as effective priors for solving inverse problems in image data ____.
%We divide our literature review to inverse problem methods in the pixel space and inverse problem methods in the latent space, and note here that several methods can be applied in both settings.
% Another perspective approaches inverse problems from the viewpoint of Bayesian inference. 
% Certain techniques utilize diffusion models as priors to generate plausible reconstructions by sampling from the posterior distribution, for example.


% \textbf{Diffusion-based Inverse Problems in Pixel Space.}
% DDRM **Rezende et al., "Variational Inference for Diffusion Models"** and DDNM **Song et al., "Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics"** utilize diffusion models as prior solving linear inverse problems in pixel space by approximating the measurement matching score, $\nabla \log p(\rvy|\rvx_t)$. 
In **Socher et al., "An Efficient Sampling Approach to Diffusion-Based Inverse Problems"** it was shown that to sample from the posterior distribution, $p(\rvx_0 | \rvy)$, one can solve a stochastic differential equation based on the prior score, $\nabla_{\rvx_t} \log~p_{\theta}(\rvx_t)$, and the conditional score, $\nabla_{\rvx_t} \log~p_{\theta}(\rvy | \rvx_t)$. Although the first term is easy to compute, the latter term requires integration over the full diffusion path from time $t$ to $0$. A useful and easy-to-calculate approximation found in several studies is $p_{\theta}(\rvy | \rvx_t) \approx p_{\theta}(\rvy | \E[\rvx_0 | \rvx_t])$, which is readily available at each step ____.
Specifically, Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) **Ho et al., "Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems"** uses this approximation for linear and non-linear inverse problems with Gaussian and Poisson likelihood models.

% approximating $\nabla \log p(\rvy|\rvx_t)$ with $\nabla \log p(\rvy|\mathbb{E}[\rvx_0|\rvx_t])$, 
%addressing non-linear inverse problem scenarios.
$\Pi$GDM **Rombet et al., "Pseudoinverse Guidance for Inverse Problems"** introduces pseudoinverse guidance by matching the denoising output and the corrupted image $\rvy$, via transformation of both through a 'pseudoinverse' of the corruption model. %However, it was observed that relying on that approximation alone may miss fine details in the image ____.
%  guidance-based approach for inverse problem solving that handles measurements with Gaussian noise, as well as some non-linear, non-differentiable measurement models
DDNM **Song et al., "Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics"** suggested to refine only the contents of the null space during the backward diffusion process. As such it is suited only for linear inverse problems. 
%utilizes diffusion models as prior for solving linear inverse problems by decomposing the linear operator $\sA$ into t%in pixel space by approximating the conditional score, $\nabla_{\rvx_t} \log p_{\theta}(\rvy|\rvx_t)$, using $\mathbb{E}[\rvx_0|\rvx_t,\rvy]$.
% Asymptotically Exact Methods
An additional category of inverse problem approaches that use diffusion models is designed with the objective of asymptotic exactness ____.
%SMC-Diff **Wang et al., "Sequential Monte Carlo for Inverse Problems"** , MCGDiff **Cheng et al., "Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Linear Inverse Problems"**, and TDS **Guo et al., "Twisting Technique for Asymptotically Exact Sampling"**
These methods utilize SMC techniques targeting exact sampling from the posterior distribution $p(\rvx_0 | \rvy)$. Specifically,
