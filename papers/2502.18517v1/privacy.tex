\section{Privacy Analysis}
\label{sec:privacy_analysis}
The only transmitted content between the client and server are the generation proxy model and the reward proxy model. 
Both models are fine-tuned on the private dataset using the DP-SGD algorithm \cite{Abadi2016DeepLDP}. 
According to the definition of differential privacy (DP) \citep{DBLP:journals/fttcs/DworkR14}, adversaries cannot infer any private data from the fine-tuned proxy models. 
Additionally, based on the post-processing property of the DP framework \citep{DBLP:journals/fttcs/DworkR14}, any further operations on the two proxy models will not cause privacy leakage. 
All subsequent operations on the server, including synthetic data generation, reward-guided filtering, and self-optimizing refinement, are privacy-preserving.

We have fine-tuned two proxy models on the private dataset and the privacy budget of each fine-tuning is $(\epsilon, \delta$).
According to the sequential composition law of DP mechanism \citep{DBLP:journals/fttcs/DworkR14}, the total privacy budget of our framework is $(2\epsilon, 2\delta$).
