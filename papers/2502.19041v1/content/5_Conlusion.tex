\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, this paper introduces EDDF, an innovative defense framework aimed at mitigating the risk of jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Our work addresses a key limitation in most existing approaches, which focus solely on surface-level patterns of jailbreak attacks while neglecting the deeper essence. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of EDDF in defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks, outperforming existing defense baselines, and showing that it does not adversely affect benign queries.
