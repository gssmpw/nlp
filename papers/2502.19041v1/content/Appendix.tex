\section{Details for the Attacks}
\label{sec:appendix A}

\subsection{Single Attacks}
\label{sec:appendix A.1}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ReNeLLM} \citep{ding2023wolf}: ReNeLLM generalizes jailbreak prompt attacks into  Prompt Rewriting and Scenario Nesting. The former involves a series of rewriting operations on the initial prompt without changing its semantics, while the latter selects a scenario for the rewritten prompt and further disguises it through nesting.

    \item \textbf{Jailbroken} \citep{wei2024jailbroken}: The authors examing the model's pretraining and safety training processes, hypothesize the vulnerability of safety-trained LLMs have two failure modes: Competing objectives and mismatched generalization when inputs are out-of-distribution pretraining corpus. They use these two principles to yield a variety of individual attacks. Here we chose five methods: Disemvowel, Leetspeak, Rot13, Auto\_payload\_splitting, and Auto\_obfuscation to create the dataset.
        
    \item \textbf{MJP} \citep{li2023multi}: This research focuses on the privacy of LLMs' pretraining data. However, it's still an attack based on jailbreak prompts to achieve its goal of extracting privacy data through LLMs without accessing its training corpora. Specifically, we chose the  “Developer Mode” role to make jailbreaking prompts.
        
    \item \textbf{Cipher} \citep{yuan2023gpt}: The author discovers that chat in cipher can bypass the safety alignment techniques of LLMs, which are mainly conducted in natural languages by chatting with LLMs through cipher prompts topped with system role descriptions and few-shot enciphered demonstrations. We use  AsciiExpert, CaserExpert, MorseExpert, and SelfDefineCipher to encrypt the harmful prompts to bypass the safety mechanism. AsciiExpert encodes the harmful prompt's characters to the corresponding Ascii code. CaserExpert modifies Caesar Cipher to transform the original prompt.MorseExpert uses Morse code to encode the prompt so it can't be identified.SelfDefineCipher uses only role play and several unsafe demonstrations in natural language to evoke this capability.
        
    \item \textbf{DeepInception}\citep{li2023deepinception}: This is a lightweight method to take advantage of the LLMs’ personification capabilities to construct a virtual, nested scene, allowing it to realize an adaptive way to escape the usage control in a normal scenario. By forcing the LLM to imagine a specific story as the carrier of harmful content,  LLMs are used to generate a multi-layer and nested instruction to progressively refine the outputs.
        
    \item \textbf{MultiLingual}\citep{li2023multi}: low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages. We translated the original jailbreak prompt into a multilingual version, including Italian, Vietnamese, Arabic, Korean, Thai, Bengali, Swahili, and Javanese. 
        
    \item \textbf{CodeChameleon}\citep{lv2024codechameleon}: To elude the intent security recognition phase, this attack reformulates tasks into a code completion format, enabling users to encrypt queries using personalized encryption functions and embed a decryption function within the instructions, which allows the LLM to decrypt and execute the encrypted queries successfully. We use BinaryTree, Length, Reverse, and OddEven four attacks to transform jailbreak prompts into any decryptable format using custom Python functions and add the decryption function in the context.BinaryTree encodes characters into a carefully constructed binary tree.  Length encodes the prompt based on the length and location to change the characters' position. Reverse reverses the order of the original input.OddEven Swap characters in odd and even positions. 
        
    \item \textbf{FlipAttack} \citep{liu2024flipattack}: from the autoregressive nature, LLMs tend to understand the text from left to right.So that they struggle to comprehend the text when noise is added to the left side. By flipping the prompt itself, this attack disguises the harmful prompt by constructing left-side noise. It has four flipping modes, Flipping Word Order, Flipping Characters in Sentences, Flipping Characters in Words, and the Fool Model Mode. 
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptive Attack}
\label{sec:appendix A.2}
Adaptive attacks are prevalent evaluation strategies utilized to assess the robustness of defensive mechanisms. Several studies investigating jailbreak defense have also utilized adaptive attacks to evaluate their methodologies. To comprehend the impact of adaptive attacks on our approach (EDDF), we have developed adaptive attacks based on the methods of PAIR and GPTFuzzer. 

For both adaptive experiments, we use Vicuana-7b-v1.5 as the target model. Specifically, we replace the harmful queries used in GPTFuzzer with attack prompts from our dataset and use the GPT-4 as an evaluator to evaluate the effectiveness of the attack prompts, instead of the finetuned model used in GPTFuzzer. For PAIR, we use the harmful queries from our dataset as well and utilize Qwen-Plus for evaluation. We follow the other default settings in Easyjailbreak. The results are shown in Table \ref{gptfuzzer}.

\textbf{GPTFUZZER} \citep{yu2023gptfuzzer}:
GPTFuzzer is an automated, adaptive jailbreak attack framework designed to exploit 
vulnerabilities in LLMs by generating adversarial prompts. Unlike traditional manual methods, it employs generative fuzzing techniques to iteratively evolve diverse and semantically coherent input queries, bypassing safety guardrails and triggering harmful or restricted outputs. Key features include its black-box approach (no access to model internals), efficiency in discovering attack vectors via mutation and prioritization strategies, and adaptability to evolving defenses. By systematically testing LLM robustness, GPTFuzzer highlights critical security gaps while providing a scalable tool for proactive safety evaluation and mitigation.

\textbf{PAIR} \citep{chao2023jailbreaking}:
PAIR (Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement) is a black-box, adaptive jailbreak attack technique that leverages automated adversarial prompt generation to bypass safety alignments in large language models (LLMs). It employs an iterative refinement process where multiple LLM "attacker" agents collaboratively craft semantically meaningful prompts, systematically probing and exploiting vulnerabilities to elicit restricted or harmful responses. Key innovations include its use of self-guided optimization to evade detection, adaptability to diverse model defenses, and efficiency in generating successful attack prompts without requiring model internals. By highlighting weaknesses in LLM safety mechanisms, PAIR underscores the need for robust, dynamic safeguards against evolving adversarial strategies.
