\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

\toolname is an integrated open-source GitHub application that leverages state-of-the-art models to identify similar issues, predict issue severity, and localize potential buggy code files for a new issue. 
It aims to support developers in managing and resolving issues.
%It is designed as a comprehensive solution to support developers in managing and resolving issues. 
Evaluation results indicate that \toolname provides valuable assistance in terms of predictive accuracy and user experience. For future work, we plan to enhance the performance of \toolname's bug localization feature by incorporating more advanced models. Additionally, we aim to extend \toolnameâ€™s compatibility to platforms beyond GitHub.

%\toolname is an open-source GitHub application that utilizes deep-learning techniques to identify similar issues, predict issue severity, and localize code files that might need modification to solve a reported issue. \toolname aims to assist developers and reporters in issue management and resolution. The evaluation of \toolname suggests that it is a helpful tool in terms of predictive performance and user experience. In future work, we aim to improve the performance of \toolname's bug localization feature with more sophisticated models that analyze issues and code file content more deeply. Additionally, we plan to make \toolname usable on platforms other than GitHub by making a multi-platform tool.
