Existing tools support individual issue management tasks. Find Duplicates____, Probot____, NextBug____ are plugins for GitHub, Jira____, and Bugzilla____ that identify related issues. These tools rely on information retrieval or classical machine learning models that process issue text to determine issue similarity. Priority Scheduler____ is a Jira____ plugin that assigns priority based on project deadlines. \rev{BugLocalizer____ is a Bugzilla____ extension that analyzes bug reports and source code similarities to identify buggy files.} PR-Agent____ is a multi-featured paid tool that applies LLMs, \eg\ ChatGPT____, to perform tasks such as pull request change classification, automatic code review, and documentation. \rev{Additionally, there are tools for reporting____, identifying bug report components____, and assessing bug reproduction steps____}. Researchers have proposed automated techniques for duplicate issue detection____, severity prediction____, bug localization____, issue categorization____, and other issue management tasks____. We selected state-of-the-art models, namely RTA____ and LongCodeArena____ for \toolname's three features, based on a rigorous literature review found in our replication package____.

%\os{add one or two sentences stating that there is research that have proposed automated techniques, including X, Y, Z (enumerate several tasks, beyond the tasks that we focus on). And then say that we selected  state of the art models, namely X, Y, Z (add citations), for the three tasks the tools supports, based on a rigorous literature review, which is found in our replication package. }
Compared to prior tools, \toolname stands out as an open-source, easy-to-install solution that seamlessly integrates with GitHub and consolidates multiple features, making it a comprehensive assistant for issue management.

%\rev{Notably, the runtime bug localization feature is particularly novel, as no prior tools localize buggy code files instantly just by analyzing the issue report and repository state.} 
Moreover, \toolname leverages state-of-the-art models that have demonstrated superior performance compared to prior proposed approaches.

%We developed \toolname to address several gaps, including the lack of multi-featured open-source issue management tools, outdated duplicate detection solutions, the absence of open-source severity prediction tools, and no existing runtime bug localization tools for instant buggy code file identification.
