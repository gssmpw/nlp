\label{sec:teacher-student-capacity-gaps}

In this section, we examine the capacity gap in two settings: kernel regression and a synthetic example using \gls{mlp} for a mapping problem. The kernel regression setup provides a theoretical and analytically tractable perspective on the capacity gap. The \gls{mlp}-based synthetic example allows us to study the capacity gap in a more practical, learnable function approximation scenario. By analyzing these two setups, we aim to better understand the fundamental limitations of distillation when there is a significant mismatch between teacher and student capacities.
