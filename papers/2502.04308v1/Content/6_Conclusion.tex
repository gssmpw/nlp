\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-1.5mm}
We introduce HOG-Diff, a coarse-to-fine generation framework that explicitly exploits higher-order graph topology.
It decomposes the complicated generation process into easier-to-learn sub-steps, which are implemented using a generalized OU bridge process.
% 
Our theoretical analysis justifies the effectiveness of HOG-Diff over classical diffusion approaches, which is validated by superior experimental results on both molecular and generic graph generation tasks.
%
Our framework further promises to improve interpretability by enabling the analysis of different topological guidesâ€™ performance in the generation process.
%
This work is a key step in topological diffusion models, highlighting the impact of higher-order features absent in data and opening ample room for future work.
