\begin{abstract}
We partly resolve an open question raised by \citet[COLT 2024]{asilis2024regularization,asilis-open-problem}: whether the algorithmic template of \emph{local regularization} --- an intriguing generalization of explicit regularization, a.k.a.~structural risk minimization --- suffices to learn all learnable multiclass problems. Specifically, we provide a negative answer to this question in the transductive model of learning. We exhibit a multiclass classification problem which is learnable in both the transductive and PAC models, yet cannot be learned transductively by any local regularizer. The corresponding hypothesis class, and our proof, are based on principles from cryptographic secret sharing. We outline challenges in extending our negative result to the PAC model, leaving open the tantalizing possibility of a PAC/transductive separation with respect to local regularization.
