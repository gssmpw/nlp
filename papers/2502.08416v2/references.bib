	abstract = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) refers to statistical inference on stochastic models for which we can generate samples, but not compute likelihoods. Like SBI algorithms, generative adversarial networks (GANs) do not require explicit likelihoods. We study the relationship between SBI and GANs, and introduce GATSBI, an adversarial approach to SBI. GATSBI reformulates the variational objective in an adversarial setting to learn implicit posterior distributions. Inference with GATSBI is amortised across observations, works in high-dimensional posterior spaces and supports implicit priors. We evaluate GATSBI on two common SBI benchmark problems and on two high-dimensional simulators. On a model for wave propagation on the surface of a shallow water body, we show that GATSBI can return well-calibrated posterior estimates even in high dimensions. On a model of camera optics, it infers a high-dimensional posterior given an implicit prior, and performs better than a state-of-the-art SBI approach. We also show how GATSBI can be extended to perform sequential posterior estimation to focus on individual observations. Overall, GATSBI opens up opportunities for leveraging advances in GANs to perform Bayesian inference on high-dimensional simulation-based models.},

What and how to transfer are two main issues that need to be addressed in transferring learning. Different transfer learning algorithms result in different knowledge transferred between them for a couple of domains. To find the optimal transfer learning algorithm that maximizes learning efficiency in the target domain, scientists need to investigate all current computationally intractable transfer learning algorithms exhaustively. A sub-optimal algorithm is selected as a trade-off, which in an ad hoc way requires considerable expertise. In instructional psychology, meanwhile, it is commonly recognized that people enhance the transfer of teaching abilities to decide what to transfer.

Perhaps intriguingly, one relatively unexplored method to build two-sample tests is the use of binary classifiers. In particular, construct a dataset by pairing the \$n\$ examples in \$S\_P\$ with a positive label, and by pairing the \$m\$ examples in \$S\_Q\$ with a negative label. If the null hypothesis "\$P = Q\$" is true, then the classification accuracy of a binary classifier on a held-out subset of this dataset should remain near chance-level. As we will show, such Classifier Two-Sample Tests (C2ST) learn a suitable representation of the data on the fly, return test statistics in interpretable units, have a simple null distribution, and their predictive uncertainty allow to interpret where \$P\$ and \$Q\$ differ. The goal of this paper is to establish the properties, performance, and uses of C2ST. First, we analyze their main theoretical properties. Second, we compare their performance against a variety of state-of-the-art alternatives. Third, we propose their use to evaluate the sample quality of generative models with intractable likelihoods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Fourth, we showcase the novel application of GANs together with C2ST for causal discovery.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations have long presented the exciting possibility of scientific insight into complex real-world processes. Despite the power of modern computing, however, it remains challenging to systematically perform inference under simulation models. This has led to the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI), a class of machine learning-enabled techniques for approaching inverse problems with stochastic simulators. Many such methods, however, require large numbers of simulation samples and face difficulty scaling to high-dimensional settings, often making inference prohibitive under resource-intensive simulators. To mitigate these drawbacks, we introduce active sequential neural posterior estimation (ASNPE). ASNPE brings an active learning scheme into the inference loop to estimate the utility of simulation parameter candidates to the underlying probabilistic model. The proposed acquisition scheme is easily integrated into existing posterior estimation pipelines, allowing for improved sample efficiency with low computational overhead. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the travel demand calibration setting, a high-dimensional inverse problem commonly requiring computationally expensive traffic simulators. Our method outperforms well-tuned benchmarks and state-of-the-art posterior estimation methods on a large-scale real-world traffic network, as well as demonstrates a performance advantage over non-active counterparts on a suite of SBI benchmark environments.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Carbon sequestration is a promising technique to minimize the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, the computational time required for CO2 forecasting using commercial numerical simulators can be prohibitive for complex problems. In this work, we propose the use of transfer learning to rapidly forecast the CO2 pressure plume and saturation distribution under uncertain geological and operational conditions, specifically for variations in injector locations and injector rates. We first train a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)-based machine learning (ML) model on a limited set of simple scenarios. Then, we use transfer learning to fine-tune the FNO model on a larger set of complex scenarios. Most importantly, the CMG forecasting time for one scenario requires approximately 40 to 50 minutes, which was drastically reduced to 12 seconds by using Fourier Neural Operator and then reduced further to 8 seconds by implementing transfer learning on the Fourier neural operator. The mean relative errors of the neural operator predictions of pressure and saturation were 1.42\% and 7.9\%, respectively. These errors get slightly higher when transfer learning is implemented on neural operator to learn complex task with less amount of data and low training time. Our results show that transfer learning can significantly reduce the computational time required for CO2 forecasting. The data generation and model training times were reduced by 50\% and 75\%, respectively, by using transfer learning on the Fourier neural operator. Additionally, the total number of trainable parameters was reduced by 99.9\%. Our results demonstrate the potential of transfer learning for rapid forecasting of CO2 pressure plume and saturation distribution. This technique can be used to improve the efficiency of CO2 forecasting and to help mitigate the risks associated with CO2 leakage.},

A limited amount of field data from the true physical system is available to inform us about the unknown inputs and also to inform us about the uncertainty that is associated with a simulation-based prediction. The approach given here allows for the following:uncertainty regarding model inputs (i.e., calibration); accounting for uncertainty due to limitations on the number of simulations that can be carried out; discrepancy between the simulation code and the actual physical system; uncertainty in the observation process that yields the actual field data on the true physical system. The resulting analysis yields predictions and their associated uncertainties while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. We use a Bayesian formulation and rely on Gaussian process models to model unknown functions of the model inputs. The estimation is carried out using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. This methodology is applied to two examples: a charged particle accelerator and a spot welding process.},

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na(+)-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca(2+) spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca(2+) spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.},

We found that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample efficiency.

However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2410.12690},
	abstract = {A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of computer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing solution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to emulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored inputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems. For example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on turbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from such "source" systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on the "target" system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer Learning Gaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed Gaussian process to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key novelty of the LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies regions where transfer should be performed and regions where it should be avoided. This "local transfer" property is desirable in scientific systems: at certain parameters, such systems may behave similarly and thus transfer is beneficial; at other parameters, they may behave differently and thus transfer is detrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can rectify a critical limitation of "negative transfer" in existing transfer learning models, where the transfer of information worsens predictive performance. We derive a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling on the LOL-GP, for both the multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings. We then show, via a suite of numerical experiments and an application for jet turbine design, the improved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing methods.},

However, tuning the parameters of a simulator to ensure its outputs match observed data presents a significant challenge. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this by enabling Bayesian inference for simulators, identifying parameters that match observed data and align with prior knowledge. Unlike traditional Bayesian inference, SBI only needs access to simulations from the model and does not require evaluations of the likelihood-function. In addition, SBI algorithms do not require gradients through the simulator, allow for massive parallelization of simulations, and can perform inference for different observations without further simulations or training, thereby amortizing inference. Over the past years, we have developed, maintained, and extended \${\textbackslash}texttt\{sbi\}\$, a PyTorch-based package that implements Bayesian SBI algorithms based on neural networks. The \${\textbackslash}texttt\{sbi\}\$ toolkit implements a wide range of inference methods, neural network architectures, sampling methods, and diagnostic tools. In addition, it provides well-tested default settings but also offers flexibility to fully customize every step of the simulation-based inference workflow.

	abstract = {Biophysical neuron models provide insights into cellular mechanisms underlying neural computations. However, a central challenge has been the question of how to identify the parameters of detailed biophysical models such that they match physiological measurements at scale or such that they perform computational tasks. Here, we describe a framework for simulation of detailed biophysical models in neuroscience—Jaxley—which addresses this challenge. By making use of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, Jaxley opens up the possibility to efficiently optimize large-scale biophysical models with gradient descent. We show that Jaxley can learn parameters of biophysical neuron models with several hundreds of parameters to match voltage or two photon calcium recordings, sometimes orders of magnitude more efficiently than previous methods. We then demonstrate that Jaxley makes it possible to train biophysical neuron models to perform computational tasks. We train a recurrent neural network to perform working memory tasks, and a feedforward network of morphologically detailed neurons with 100,000 parameters to solve a computer vision task. Our analyses show that Jaxley dramatically improves the ability to build large-scale data- or task-constrained biophysical models, creating unprecedented opportunities for investigating the mechanisms underlying neural computations across multiple scales.},

	abstract = {Stochastic reaction network models are often used to explain and predict the dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. These models usually involve several parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are not directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these parameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their uncertainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods based on classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which in turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation (CME). We propose an alternate approach based on a multifidelity extension of the Sequential Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sampler. This algorithm is built upon Sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian inference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved subproblems that gradually increase both model fidelity and the influence of the observed data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a well-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate master equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the appropriate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criteria that seeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior from each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias. This novel sampling scheme is tested with high performance computing resources using biologically relevant problems.},

Unfortunately, the FSP approach is highly computationally intensive for all but the simplest models, an issue that is highly problematic when parameter inference and uncertainty quantification takes enormous numbers of parameter evaluations. To address this issue, we propose two new computational methods for the Bayesian inference of stochastic gene expression parameters given single-cell experiments. We formulate and verify an adaptive delayed acceptance Metropolis-Hastings (ADAMH) algorithm to utilize with reduced Krylov-basis projections of the FSP. We then introduce an extension of the ADAMH into a hybrid scheme that consists of an initial phase to construct a reduced model and a faster second phase to sample from the approximate posterior distribution determined by the constructed model. We test and compare both algorithms to an adaptive Metropolis algorithm with full FSP-based likelihood evaluations on three example models and simulated data to show that the new ADAMH variants achieve substantial speedup in comparison to the full FSP approach. By reducing the computational costs of parameter estimation, we expect the ADAMH approach to enable efficient data-driven estimation for more complex gene regulation models.},

These algorithms characteristically rely heavily on repeated model simulations. However, whenever the computational cost of simulation is even moderately expensive, the significant burden incurred by likelihood-free algorithms leaves them infeasible for many practical applications. The multifidelity approach has been introduced in the context of approximate Bayesian computation to reduce the simulation burden of likelihood-free inference without loss of accuracy, by using the information provided by simulating computationally cheap, approximate models in place of the model of interest. In this work we demonstrate that multifidelity techniques can be applied in the general likelihood-free Bayesian inference setting. Analytical results on the optimal allocation of computational resources to simulations at different levels of fidelity are derived, and subsequently implemented practically. We provide an adaptive multifidelity likelihood-free inference algorithm that learns the relationships between models at different fidelities and adapts resource allocation accordingly, and demonstrate that this algorithm produces posterior estimates with near-optimal efficiency.},

The negative-binomial distribution provides a convenient model for over-dispersed spike counts, that is, responses with greater-than-Poisson variability.  Here we describe a powerful data-augmentation framework for fully Bayesian inference in neural models with negative-binomial spiking. Our approach relies on a recently described latent-variable representation of the negative-binomial distribution, which equates it to a Polya-gamma mixture of normals.  This framework provides a tractable, conditionally Gaussian representation of the posterior that can be used to design efficient EM and Gibbs sampling based algorithms for inference in regression and dynamic factor models.  We apply the model to neural data from primate retina and show that it substantially outperforms Poisson regression on held-out data, and reveals latent structure underlying spike count correlations in simultaneously recorded spike trains.},

As electric vehicles become more prevalent, understanding the performance and longevity of battery packs under various conditions is essential for effective design and management strategies, optimizing vehicle range, safety, and cost-effectiveness also on a fleet-level. Moreover, the ability to investigate failure distributions provides invaluable information for improving battery reliability and safety, key factors in the consumer acceptance of electric vehicles.

	abstract = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables amortized Bayesian inference for simulators with implicit likelihoods. But when we are primarily interested in the quality of predictive simulations, or when the model cannot exactly reproduce the observed data (i.e., is misspecified), targeting the Bayesian posterior may be overly restrictive. Generalized Bayesian Inference (GBI) aims to robustify inference for (misspecified) simulator models, replacing the likelihood-function with a cost function that evaluates the goodness of parameters relative to data. However, GBI methods generally require running multiple simulations to estimate the cost function at each parameter value during inference, making the approach computationally infeasible for even moderately complex simulators. Here, we propose amortized cost estimation (ACE) for GBI to address this challenge: We train a neural network to approximate the cost function, which we define as the expected distance between simulations produced by a parameter and observed data. The trained network can then be used with MCMC to infer GBI posteriors for any observation without running additional simulations. We show that, on several benchmark tasks, ACE accurately predicts cost and provides predictive simulations that are closer to synthetic observations than other SBI methods, especially for misspecified simulators. Finally, we apply ACE to infer parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model given real intracellular recordings from the Allen Cell Types Database. ACE identifies better data-matching parameters while being an order of magnitude more simulation-efficient than a standard SBI method. In summary, ACE combines the strengths of SBI methods and GBI to perform robust and simulation-amortized inference for scientific simulators.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations have proven a valuable tool for understanding complex phenomena across the sciences. However, the utility of simulators for modelling and forecasting purposes is often restricted by low data quality, as well as practical limits to model fidelity. In order to circumvent these difficulties, we argue that modellers must treat simulators as idealistic representations of the true data generating process, and consequently should thoughtfully consider the risk of model misspecification. In this work we revisit neural posterior estimation (NPE), a class of algorithms that enable black-box parameter inference in simulation models, and consider the implication of a simulation-to-reality gap. While recent works have demonstrated reliable performance of these methods, the analyses have been performed using synthetic data generated by the simulator model itself, and have therefore only addressed the well-specified case. In this paper, we find that the presence of misspecification, in contrast, leads to unreliable inference when NPE is used naively. As a remedy we argue that principled scientific inquiry with simulators should incorporate a model criticism component, to facilitate interpretable identification of misspecification and a robust inference component, to fit 'wrong but useful' models. We propose robust neural posterior estimation (RNPE), an extension of NPE to simultaneously achieve both these aims, through explicitly modelling the discrepancies between simulations and the observed data. We assess the approach on a range of artificially misspecified examples, and find RNPE performs well across the tasks, whereas naively using NPE leads to misleading and erratic posteriors.},

However, the behaviour of such algorithms in the case of model misspecification has received little attention. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study of the behaviour of neural SBI algorithms in the presence of various forms of model misspecification. We find that misspecification can have a profoundly deleterious effect on performance. Some mitigation strategies are explored, but no approach tested prevents failure in all cases.

However, recent work has demonstrated that model misspecification can harm SBI's reliability. This work introduces robust posterior estimation (ROPE), a framework that overcomes model misspecification with a small real-world calibration set of ground truth parameter measurements. We formalize the misspecification gap as the solution of an optimal transport problem between learned representations of real-world and simulated observations. Assuming the prior distribution over the parameters of interest is known and well-specified, our method offers a controllable balance between calibrated uncertainty and informative inference under all possible misspecifications of the simulator. Our empirical results on four synthetic tasks and two real-world problems demonstrate that ROPE outperforms baselines and consistently returns informative and calibrated credible intervals.},

The main complexity of synaptic plasticity is that synapses and dendrites connect neurons in series and existing experiments cannot pinpoint the significant imprinted adaptation location. We showed efficient backpropagation and Hebbian learning on dendritic trees, inspired by experimental-based evidence, for sub-dendritic adaptation and its nonlinear amplification. It has proven to achieve success rates approaching unity for handwritten digits recognition, indicating realization of deep learning even by a single dendrite or neuron. Additionally, dendritic amplification practically generates an exponential number of input crosses, higher-order interactions, with the number of inputs, which enhance success rates. However, direct implementation of a large number of the cross weights and their exhaustive manipulation independently is beyond existing and anticipated computational power. Hence, a new type of nonlinear adaptive dendritic hardware for imitating dendritic learning and estimating the computational capability of the brain must be built.},

Inspired by causal methodology, we relax the usual covariate shift assumption and assume that it holds true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional distribution of the target variable given this subset of predictors is invariant over all tasks. We show how this assumption can be motivated from ideas in the ﬁeld of causality. We focus on the problem of Domain Generalization, in which no examples from the test task are observed. We prove that in an adversarial setting using this subset for prediction is optimal in Domain Generalization; we further provide examples, in which the tasks are suﬃciently diverse and the estimator therefore outperforms pooling the data, even on average. If examples from the test task are available, we also provide a method to transfer knowledge from the training tasks and exploit all available features for prediction. However, we provide no guarantees for this method. We introduce a practical method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset and provide corresponding code.

The models contain the minimal set of voltage-dependent currents to account for the data. To obtain models as generic as possible, we used data from different preparations in vivo and in vitro, such as rat somatosensory cortex and thalamus, guinea-pig visual and frontal cortex, ferret visual cortex, cat visual cortex and cat association cortex. For two cell classes, we used automatic fitting procedures applied to several cells, which revealed substantial cell-to-cell variability within each class.

Here, to better understand the relationship between the structure and the function of a nervous system, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,433 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from model predictions that are based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle-dependent signalling, including on timescales of less than a second, that evoke acute calcium transients—often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that, in such cases, extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function to that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts the neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than do models based on anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signalling drive neural dynamics on short timescales, and that measurements of evoked signal propagation are crucial for interpreting neural function.},

Better sensors result in more accurate encoding of stimuli, allowing for cognitive processing downstream. Here we show that plasticity in sensory neurons mediates a behavioral switch in C. elegans between attraction to NaCl in naïve animals and avoidance of NaCl in preconditioned animals, called gustatory plasticity. Ca2+ imaging in ASE and ASH NaCl sensing neurons reveals multiple cell-autonomous and distributed circuit adaptation mechanisms. A computational model quantitatively accounts for observed behaviors and reveals roles for sensory neurons in the control and modulation of motor behaviors, decision making and navigational strategy. Sensory adaptation dynamically alters the encoding of the environment. Rather than encoding the stimulus directly, therefore, we propose that these C. elegans sensors dynamically encode a context-dependent value of the stimulus. Our results demonstrate how adaptive sensory computation can directly control an animal’s behavioral state., Martijn Dekkers and Felix Salfelder et al. combine experimental approaches and mathematical modeling to determine the contribution of the two main NaCl sensory neurons (termed ASEL and ASER) and the nociceptive neurons (termed ASH) in C. elegans to the context-dependent switching between NaCl attraction and avoidance. Their results show that regulated sensitivity of these sensory neurons to NaCl allows the animal to dynamically modulate its behavioral response and suggest a role for sensory modulation in balancing exploration and exploitation during foraging.},

Here, we identify two neuropeptide precursors, phoenixin (PNX) and nesfatin, with broad evolutionary conservation. By database searches, sequence alignments, and gene-structure comparisons, we show that both precursors are present in bilaterians, cnidarians, ctenophores, and sponges. We also found PNX and a secreted nesfatin precursor homolog in the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta. PNX, in particular, is highly conserved, including its cleavage sites, suggesting that prohormone processing occurs also in choanoflagellates. In addition, based on phyletic patterns and negative pharmacological assays, we question the originally proposed GPR-173 (SREB3) as a PNX receptor. Our findings revealed that secreted neuropeptide homologs derived from longer precursors have premetazoan origins and thus evolved before neurons.},

Interestingly, sensory neurons were primarily involved in coding short-term, but not long-term, memories, and individual sensory neurons could be assigned to coding either the conditioned stimulus or the experience valence (or both). Moreover, when considering the collective activity of the sensory neurons, the specific training experiences could be decoded. Interneurons integrated the modulated sensory inputs and a simple linear combination model identified the experience-specific modulated communication routes. The widely distributed memory suggests that integrated network plasticity, rather than changes to individual neurons, underlies the fine behavioral plasticity.

	abstract = {Recent advances in connectomics research enable the acquisition of increasing amounts of data about the connectivity patterns of neurons. How can we use this wealth of data to efficiently derive and test hypotheses about the principles underlying these patterns? A common approach is to simulate neuronal networks using a hypothesized wiring rule in a generative model and to compare the resulting synthetic data with empirical data. However, most wiring rules have at least some free parameters, and identifying parameters that reproduce empirical data can be challenging as it often requires manual parameter tuning. Here, we propose to use simulation-based Bayesian inference (SBI) to address this challenge. Rather than optimizing a fixed wiring rule to fit the empirical data, SBI considers many parametrizations of a rule and performs Bayesian inference to identify the parameters that are compatible with the data. It uses simulated data from multiple candidate wiring rule parameters and relies on machine learning methods to estimate a probability distribution (the ‘posterior distribution over parameters conditioned on the data’) that characterizes all data-compatible parameters. We demonstrate how to apply SBI in computational connectomics by inferring the parameters of wiring rules in an in silico model of the rat barrel cortex, given in vivo connectivity measurements. SBI identifies a wide range of wiring rule parameters that reproduce the measurements. We show how access to the posterior distribution over all data-compatible parameters allows us to analyze their relationship, revealing biologically plausible parameter interactions and enabling experimentally testable predictions. We further show how SBI can be applied to wiring rules at different spatial scales to quantitatively rule out invalid wiring hypotheses. Our approach is applicable to a wide range of generative models used in connectomics, providing a quantitative and efficient way to constrain model parameters with empirical connectivity data.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underly the synchronization of a system's units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the {\textbackslash}textit\{C.elegans\} backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal's motor periphery, providing new testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a new door to exploring the structure-function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals.},

These methods typically require large amounts of training in order to learn a single class of manipulations. We present Transflow Learning, a method for transforming a pre-trained generative model so that its outputs more closely resemble data that we provide afterwards. In contrast to previous methods, Transflow Learning does not require any training at all, and instead warps the probability distribution from which we sample latent vectors using Bayesian inference. Transflow Learning can be used to solve a wide variety of tasks, such as neural style transfer and few-shot classification.},

However, many ABC algorithms require a large number of simulations, which can be costly. To reduce the computational cost, Bayesian optimisation (BO) and surrogate models such as Gaussian processes have been proposed. Bayesian optimisation enables one to intelligently decide where to evaluate the model next but common BO strategies are not designed for the goal of estimating the posterior distribution. Our paper addresses this gap in the literature. We propose to compute the uncertainty in the ABC posterior density, which is due to a lack of simulations to estimate this quantity accurately, and define a loss function that measures this uncertainty. We then propose to select the next evaluation location to minimise the expected loss. Experiments show that the proposed method often produces the most accurate approximations as compared to common BO strategies.},

Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian) NNs. We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

But how faithful is such inference if the simulation represents reality somewhat inaccurately, that is, if the true system behavior at test time deviates from the one seen during training? We conceptualize the types of such model misspecification arising in SBI and systematically investigate how the performance of neural posterior approximators gradually deteriorates as a consequence, making inference results less and less trustworthy. To notify users about this problem, we propose a new misspecification measure that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion (i.e., without training data from the true distribution) and reliably detects model misspecification at test time. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of our new measure both on toy examples with an analytical ground-truth and on representative scientific tasks in cell biology, cognitive decision making, disease outbreak dynamics, and computer vision. We show how the proposed misspecification test warns users about suspicious outputs, raises an alarm when predictions are not trustworthy, and guides model designers in their search for better simulators.},

On the other hand, the prediction uncertainty of kriging-based surrogate models(SM) is confirmed by its mean square error. After that, the integral uncertainty is acquired by math modeling. Meanwhile, the SMs are constructed through data from low-fidelity and high-fidelity models. Eventually, the low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) SMs with integral uncertainty are obtained and a proposed fusion algorithm is implemented. The fusion algorithm refers to the Kalman filter’s idea of optimal estimation to utilize the independent information from different models synthetically. Through several mathematical examples implemented, the fused SM is certified that its variance is decreased and the fused results tend to the true value. In addition, an engineering example about autonomous underwater vehicles’ hull design is provided to prove the feasibility of this proposed multi-fidelity method in practice. In the future, it will be a helpful tool to deal with reliability optimization of black-box problems and potentially applied in multidisciplinary design optimization.},

It solves flux-surface averaged transport equations for the plasma density, temperature and poloidal flux, using a bounce-averaged kinetic equation to self-consistently provide the electron current, heat, density and RE evolution, as well as the electron distribution function. As an example, we consider disruption scenarios with material injection and compare the electron dynamics resolved with different levels of complexity, from fully kinetic to fluid modes.

The runaway electrons can be simulated either as a fluid, fully kinetically, or as a mix of the two. Plasma temperature, current density, electric field, ion density and charge states are all evolved self-consistently, where kinetic non-thermal contributions are captured using an orbit-averaged relativistic electron Fokker-Planck equation, which couples to the plasma evolution. In the typical use case, the electrons are represented by two distinct populations: a cold fluid population and a kinetic superthermal population. Solution method: The system of equations is solved using a standard multidimensional Newton's method. Partial differential equations—most prominently the bounce-averaged Fokker–Planck and current diffusion equations—are discretized using a high-resolution finite volume scheme that preserves density and positivity.},

This generates a high demand on accurate simulation results for planning and risk assessment purposes because of the low availability of actual data from historic events.

Tsunami phenomena involve a large span of spatial and temporal scales—from ocean basin scales of  to local coastal wave interactions of  or even , or from resonating wave phenomena with durations of  to rupture with time periods of . The scale gap of five orders of magnitude in each dimension makes accurate modelling very demanding, with a number of approaches being taken to work around the impossibility of direct numerical simulations. Along with the mentioned multi-scale characteristic, the tsunami wave has a multitude of different phases, corresponding to different wave regimes and associated equation sets. While in the deep ocean, wave propagation can be approximated relatively accurately by linear shallow-water theory, the transition to a bore or solitary wave train in shelf areas and then into a breaking wave in coastal regions demands appropriate mathematical and numerical treatments. The short duration and unpredictability of tsunami events pose another challenging requirement to tsunami simulation approaches. An accurate forecast is sought within seconds with very limited data available. Thus, efficiency in numerical solution processes and at the same time the consideration of uncertainty play a big role in tsunami modelling applied for forecasting purposes.},

Good modelling requires its users and commissioners to understand more about the whole process, including the different kinds of purpose a model can have and the different technical bases. This paper offers a guide to the process of commissioning, developing and deploying models across a wide range of domains from public policy to science and engineering. It provides two checklists to help potential modellers, commissioners and users ensure they have considered the most significant factors that will determine success.

Recently, multi-fidelity methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. On the other hand, in many practical applications, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data \$N\$ and/or few training iterations \$T\$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space \$(N,T)\$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments.},

However, the coupling of the molecule with the ever-present experimental device introduces artifacts, that complicates the interpretation of these experiments. Performing statistical inference to learn hidden molecular properties is challenging because these measurements produce non-Markovian time-series, and even minimal models lead to intractable likelihoods. To overcome these challenges, we developed a computational framework built on novel statistical methods called simulation-based inference (SBI). SBI enabled us to directly estimate the Bayesian posterior, and extract reduced quantitative models from smFS, by encoding a mechanistic model into a simulator in combination with probabilistic deep learning. Using synthetic data, we could systematically disentangle the measurement of hidden molecular properties from experimental artifacts. The integration of physical models with machine learning density estimation is general, transparent, easy to use, and broadly applicable to other types of biophysical experiments.},

	abstract = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) is the preferred framework for estimating parameters of intractable models in science and engineering. A significant challenge in this context is the large computational cost of simulating data from complex models, and the fact that this cost often depends on parameter values. We therefore propose {\textbackslash}textit\{cost-aware SBI methods\} which can significantly reduce the cost of existing sampling-based SBI methods, such as neural SBI and approximate Bayesian computation. This is achieved through a combination of rejection and self-normalised importance sampling, which significantly reduces the number of expensive simulations needed. Our approach is studied extensively on models from epidemiology to telecommunications engineering, where we obtain significant reductions in the overall cost of inference.},

	abstract = {Surrogate modeling, also called metamodeling, has evolved and been extensively used over the past decades. A wide variety of methods and tools have been introduced for surrogate modeling aiming to develop and utilize computationally more efficient surrogates of high-fidelity models mostly in optimization frameworks. This paper reviews, analyzes, and categorizes research efforts on surrogate modeling and applications with an emphasis on the research accomplished in the water resources field. The review analyzes 48 references on surrogate modeling arising from water resources and also screens out more than 100 references from the broader research community. Two broad families of surrogates namely response surface surrogates, which are statistical or empirical data-driven models emulating the high-fidelity model responses, and lower-fidelity physically based surrogates, which are simplified models of the original system, are detailed in this paper. Taxonomies on surrogate modeling frameworks, practical details, advances, challenges, and limitations are outlined. Important observations and some guidance for surrogate modeling decisions are provided along with a list of important future research directions that would benefit the common sampling and search (optimization) analyses found in water resources.},

	abstract = {Deep Neural Network (DNN) is widely used in engineering applications for its ability to handle problems with almost any nonlinearities. However, it is generally difficult to obtain sufficient high-fidelity (HF) sample points for expensive optimization tasks, which may affect the generalization performance of DNN and result in inaccurate predictions. To solve this problem and improve the prediction accuracy of DNN, this paper proposes an on-line transfer learning based multi-fidelity data fusion (OTL-MFDF) method including two parts. In the first part, the ensemble of DNNs is established. Firstly, a large number of low-fidelity sample points and a few HF sample points are generated, which are used as the source dataset and target dataset, respectively. Then, the Bayesian Optimization (BO) is utilized to obtain several groups of hyperparameters, based on which DNNs are pre-trained using the source dataset. Next, these pre-trained DNNs are re-trained by fine-tuning on the target dataset, and the ensemble of DNNs is established by assigning different weights to each pre-trained DNN. In the second part, the on-line learning system is developed for adaptive updating of the ensemble of DNNs. To evaluate the uncertainty error of the predicted values of DNN and determine the location of the updated HF sample point, the query-by-committee strategy based on the ensemble of DNNs is developed. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies is employed as the optimizer to find out the location where the maximal disagreement is achieved by the ensemble of DNNs. The design space is partitioned by the Voronoi diagram method, and then the selected point is moved to its nearest Voronoi cell boundary to avoid clustering between the updated point and the existing sample points. Three different types of test problems and an engineering example are adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the OTL-MFDF method. Results verify the outstanding efficiency, global prediction accuracy and applicability of the OTL-MFDF method.},

For such model forecasts to be useful as a management tool, they must be accompanied by computationally expensive uncertainty quantification, which yields confidence intervals, probability of exceedance, and so forth. We design and implement novel multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) algorithms that accelerate estimation of the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of quantities of interest, for example, water breakthrough time or oil production rate. Compared to standard non-smoothed MLMC, the new estimators achieve a significant variance reduction at each discretization level by smoothing the indicator function with a Gaussian kernel or replacing standard Monte Carlo (MC) with the recently developed hierarchical Latinized stratified sampling (HLSS). After validating the kernel-smoothed MLMC and HLSS-enhanced MLMC methods on a single-phase flow test bed, we demonstrate that they are orders of magnitude faster than standard MC for estimating the CDF of breakthrough times in multiphase flow problems.},

While common PINN algorithms are based on training one deep neural network (DNN), we propose a multi-network model that results in more accurate representation of the field variables. To validate the model, we test the framework on synthetic data generated from analytical and numerical reference solutions. We study convergence of the PINN model, and show that Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) results in superior accuracy and convergence characteristics compared with classic low-order Finite Element Method (FEM). We also show the applicability of the framework for transfer learning, and find vastly accelerated convergence during network re-training. Finally, we find that honoring the physics leads to improved robustness: when trained only on a few parameters, we find that the PINN model can accurately predict the solution for a wide range of parameters new to the network—thus pointing to an important application of this framework to sensitivity analysis and surrogate modeling.},

	abstract = {Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.},

	abstract = {Neural networks (NNs) are often used as surrogates or emulators of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the dynamics of complex systems. A virtually negligible computational cost of such surrogates renders them an attractive tool for ensemble-based computation, which requires a large number of repeated PDE solves. Since the latter are also needed to generate sufficient data for NN training, the usefulness of NN-based surrogates hinges on the balance between the training cost and the computational gain stemming from their deployment. We rely on multi-fidelity simulations to reduce the cost of data generation for subsequent training of a deep convolutional NN (CNN) using transfer learning. High- and low-fidelity images are generated by solving PDEs on fine and coarse meshes, respectively. We use theoretical results for multilevel Monte Carlo to guide our choice of the numbers of images of each kind. We demonstrate the performance of this multi-fidelity training strategy on the problem of estimation of the distribution of a quantity of interest, whose dynamics is governed by a system of nonlinear PDEs (parabolic PDEs of multi-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media) with uncertain/random parameters. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that a mixture of a comparatively large number of low-fidelity data and smaller numbers of high- and low-fidelity data provides an optimal balance of computational speed-up and prediction accuracy. The former is reported relative to both CNN training on high-fidelity images only and Monte Carlo solution of the PDEs. The latter is expressed in terms of both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence.},

Analyses and design of such systems are governed by data collected from the field and/or laboratory experiments. This challenging scenario is further worsened when data-collection is expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-fidelity physics informed deep neural network (MF-PIDNN). The framework proposed is particularly suitable when the physics of the problem is known in an approximate sense (low-fidelity physics) and only a few high-fidelity data are available. MF-PIDNN blends physics informed and data-driven deep learning techniques by using the concept of transfer learning. The approximate governing equation is first used to train a low-fidelity physics informed deep neural network. This is followed by transfer learning where the low-fidelity model is updated by using the available high-fidelity data. MF-PIDNN is able to encode useful information on the physics of the problem from the approximate governing differential equation and hence, provides accurate prediction even in zones with no data. Additionally, no low-fidelity data is required for training this model. Two examples involving function approximations with linear and nonlinear correlation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in solving multi-fidelity problems. Applicability and utility of MF-PIDNN are illustrated in solving four benchmark reliability analysis problems. Case studies presented illustrate interesting features of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {A touted advantage of symbolic representations is the ease of transferring learned information from one intelligent agent to another. This paper investigates an analogous problem: how to use information from one neural network to help a second network learn a related task. Rather than translate such information into symbolic form (in which it may not be readily expressible), we investigate the direct transfer of information encoded as weights. 
 
Here, we focus on how transfer can be used to address the important problem of improving neural network learning speed. First we present an exploratory study of the somewhat surprising effects of pre-setting network weights on subsequent learning. Guided by hypotheses from this study, we sped up back-propagation learning for two speech recognition tasks. By transferring weights from smaller networks trained on subtasks, we achieved speedups of up to an order of magnitude compared with training starting with random weights, even taking into account the time to train the smaller networks. We include results on how transfer scales to a large phoneme recognition problem.},

For the very first time in a single volume, the Handbook of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) presents an extensive overview of the theory, practice and application of ABC methods. These simple, but powerful statistical techniques, take Bayesian statistics beyond the need to specify overly simplified models, to the setting where the model is defined only as a process that generates data. This process can be arbitrarily complex, to the point where standard Bayesian techniques based on working with tractable likelihood functions would not be viable. ABC methods finesse the problem of model complexity within the Bayesian framework by exploiting modern computational power, thereby permitting approximate Bayesian analyses of models that would otherwise be impossible to implement.
The Handbook of ABC provides illuminating insight into the world of Bayesian modelling for intractable models for both experts and newcomers alike. It is an essential reference book for anyone interested in learning about and implementing ABC techniques to analyse complex models in the modern world.},

	abstract = {Minimization of a sum-of-squares or cross-entropy error function leads to network outputs which approximate the conditional averages of the target data, conditioned on the input vector. For classifications problems, with a suitably chosen target coding scheme, these averages represent the posterior probabilities of class membership, and so can be regarded as optimal. For problems involving the prediction of continuous variables, however, the conditional averages provide only a very limited description of the properties of the target variables. This is particularly true for problems in which the mapping to be learned is multi-valued, as often arises in the solution of inverse problems, since the average of several correct target values is not necessarily itself a correct value. In order to obtain a complete description of the data, for the purposes of predicting the outputs corresponding to new input vectors, we must model the conditional probability distribution of the target data, again conditioned on the input vector. In this paper we introduce a new class of network models obtained by combining a conventional neural network with a mixture density model. The complete system is called a Mixture Density Network, and can in principle represent arbitrary conditional probability distributions in the same way that a conventional neural network can represent arbitrary functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixture Density Networks using both a toy problem and a problem involving robot inverse kinematics.},

The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders.},

Here, a systematic approach to these issues with firm mathematical underpinning is developed through empirical information theory. An information metric to quantify AOS model errors in the climate is proposed here which incorporates both coarse-grained mean model errors as well as covariance ratios in a transformation invariant fashion. The subtle behavior of model errors with this information metric is quantified in an instructive statistically exactly solvable test model with direct relevance to climate change science including the prototype behavior of tracer gases such as CO $_{\textrm{2}}$ . Formulas for identifying the most sensitive climate change directions using statistics of the present climate or an AOS model approximation are developed here; these formulas just involve finding the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of a quadratic form computed through suitable unperturbed climate statistics. These climate change concepts are illustrated on a statistically exactly solvable one-dimensional stochastic model with relevance for low frequency variability of the atmosphere. Viable algorithms for implementation of these concepts are discussed throughout the paper.},

An approach based on point-collocation, nonintrusive polynomial chaos was formulated in which a low-fidelity model could be corrected using multiple higher-fidelity models. The formulation and methodology also allows for the addition of uncertainty sources not present in the lower-fidelity models. To demonstrate the applicability and potential computational savings of the multifidelity polynomial chaos approach, two model problems were explored. The first was a supersonic airfoil with three levels of modeling fidelity, each capturing a gradual increase in modeling of the underlying flow physics. As much as 50\% computational cost reduction was observed using the multifidelity approach, while predicting nearly the same amount of uncertainty in drag. The second problem was a commercial supersonic transport. This model had three levels of fidelity that included two different modeling approaches and the addition of physics between the fidelity levels. Results of this analysis yielded nearly a 70\% computational savings to predict a comparable amount of uncertainty in ground noise. Both problems illustrate the applicability and significant computational savings of the multifidelity method for efficient and accurate uncertainty quantification.},

	doi = {10.3389/fninf.2014.00076},
	abstract = {To understand how the central nervous system performs computations using recurrent neuronal circuitry, simulations have become an indispensable tool for theoretical neuroscience. To study neuronal circuits and their ability to self-organize, increasing attention has been directed toward synaptic plasticity. In particular spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) creates specific demands for simulations of spiking neural networks. On the one hand a high temporal resolution is required to capture the millisecond timescale of typical STDP windows. On the other hand network simulations have to evolve over hours up to days, to capture the timescale of long-term plasticity. To do this efficiently, fast simulation speed is the crucial ingredient rather than large neuron numbers. Using different medium-sized network models consisting of several thousands of neurons and off-the-shelf hardware, we compare the simulation speed of the simulators: Brian, NEST and Neuron as well as our own simulator Auryn. Our results show that real-time simulations of different plastic network models are possible in parallel simulations in which numerical precision is not a primary concern. Even so, the speed-up margin of parallelism is limited and boosting simulation speeds beyond one tenth of real-time is difficult. By profiling simulation code we show that the run times of typical plastic network simulations encounter a hard boundary. This limit is partly due to latencies in the inter-process communications and thus cannot be overcome by increased parallelism. Overall, these results show that to study plasticity in medium-sized spiking neural networks, adequate simulation tools are readily available which run efficiently on small clusters. However, to run simulations substantially faster than real-time, special hardware is a prerequisite.},

The state of the postsynaptic neuron can be described by its membrane potential, its firing rate, or the timing of backpropagating action potentials (BPAPs). It is shown that all of the above formulations can be derived from the point of view of an expansion. In the absence of BPAPs, it is natural to correlate presynaptic spikes with the postsynaptic membrane potential. Time windows of spike-time-dependent plasticity arise naturally if the timing of postsynaptic spikes is available at the site of the synapse, as is the case in the presence of BPAPs. With an appropriate choice of parameters, Hebbian synaptic plasticity has intrinsic normalization properties that stabilizes postsynaptic firing rates and leads to subtractive weight normalization.},

In the model, assemblies were formed during repeated sensory stimulation and characterized by strong recurrent excitatory connections. Even days after formation, and despite ongoing network activity and synaptic plasticity, memories could be recalled through selective delay activity following the brief stimulation of a subset of assembly neurons. Blocking any component of plasticity prevented stable functioning as a memory network.

I then examine the realism of the main classes of single-compartment models along these two dimensions, in light of recent experimental evidence.},

	abstract = {Diffusion process models are widely used in science, engineering and finance. Most diffusion processes are described by stochastic differential equations in continuous time. In practice, however, data is typically observed only at discrete time points. Except for a few very special cases, no analytic form exists for the likelihood of such discretely observed data. For this reason, parametric inference is often achieved by using discrete-time approximations, with accuracy controlled through the introduction of missing data. We present a new multiresolution Bayesian framework to address the inference difficulty. The methodology relies on the use of multiple approximations and extrapolation, and is significantly faster and more accurate than known strategies based on Gibbs sampling. We apply the multiresolution approach to three data-driven inference problems – one in biophysics and two in finance – one of which features a multivariate diffusion model with an entirely unobserved component.},

	abstract = {Multifidelity uncertainty quantification (MF UQ) sampling approaches have been shown to significantly reduce the variance of statistical estimators while preserving the bias of the highest-fidelity model, provided that the low-fidelity models are well correlated. However, maintaining a high level of correlation can be challenging, especially when models depend on different input uncertain parameters, which drastically reduces the correlation. Existing MF UQ approaches do not adequately address this issue. In this work, we propose a new sampling strategy that exploits a shared space to improve the correlation among models with dissimilar parametrization. We achieve this by transforming the original coordinates onto an auxiliary manifold using the adaptive basis (AB) method{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{Tipireddy2014\}. The AB method has two main benefits: (1) it provides an effective tool to identify the low-dimensional manifold on which each model can be represented, and (2) it enables easy transformation of polynomial chaos representations from high- to low-dimensional spaces. This latter feature is used to identify a shared manifold among models without requiring additional evaluations. We present two algorithmic flavors of the new estimator to cover different analysis scenarios, including those with legacy and non-legacy high-fidelity data. We provide numerical results for analytical examples, a direct field acoustic test, and a finite element model of a nuclear fuel assembly. For all examples, we compare the proposed strategy against both single-fidelity and MF estimators based on the original model parametrization.},

This work presents a multifidelity approach for estimating sensitivity indices that leverages cheaper low-fidelity models to reduce the cost of sensitivity analysis while retaining accuracy guarantees via recourse to the original, expensive model. This paper develops new multifidelity estimators for variance and for the Sobol' main and total effect sensitivity indices.

Results are presented for the Ishigami function and a convection-diffusion-reaction model that demonstrate up to \$10{\textbackslash}times\$ speedups for fixed convergence levels.

Existing acceleration methods typically exploit a multilevel hierarchy of surrogate models that follow a known rate of error decay and computational costs; however, a general collection of surrogate models, which may include projection-based reduced models, data-fit models, support vector machines, and simplified-physics models, does not necessarily give rise to such a hierarchy. Our multifidelity approach provides a framework to combine an arbitrary number of surrogate models of any type. Instead of relying on error and cost rates, an optimization problem balances the number of model evaluations across the high-fidelity and surrogate models with respect to error and costs. We show that a unique analytic solution of the model management optimization problem exists under mild conditions on the models. Our multifidelity method makes occasional recourse to the high-fidelity model; in doing so it provides an unbiased estimator of the statistics of the high-fidelity model, even in the absence of error bounds and error estimators for the surrogate models. Numerical experiments with linear and nonlinear examples show that speedups by orders of magnitude are obtained compared to Monte Carlo estimation that invokes a single model only.},

In contrast, the idea of amortized Bayesian inference is to initially invest computational cost in training an inference network on simulated data, which can subsequently be used to rapidly perform inference (i.e., to return estimates of posterior distributions) for new observations. This approach has been applied to many real-world models in the sciences and engineering, but it is unclear how robust the approach is to adversarial perturbations in the observed data. Here, we study the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference, focusing on simulation-based estimation of multi-dimensional posterior distributions. We show that almost unrecognizable, targeted perturbations of the observations can lead to drastic changes in the predicted posterior and highly unrealistic posterior predictive samples, across several benchmark tasks and a real-world example from neuroscience. We propose a computationally efficient regularization scheme based on penalizing the Fisher information of the conditional density estimator, and show how it improves the adversarial robustness of amortized Bayesian inference.},

This limits their interpretability and is not sufficient to identify for which observations the approximation can be trusted or should be improved. Building upon the well-known classifier two-sample test (C2ST), we introduce L-C2ST, a new method that allows for a local evaluation of the posterior estimator at any given observation. It offers theoretically grounded and easy to interpret -- e.g. graphical -- diagnostics, and unlike C2ST, does not require access to samples from the true posterior. In the case of normalizing flow-based posterior estimators, L-C2ST can be specialized to offer better statistical power, while being computationally more efficient. On standard SBI benchmarks, L-C2ST provides comparable results to C2ST and outperforms alternative local approaches such as coverage tests based on highest predictive density (HPD). We further highlight the importance of local evaluation and the benefit of interpretability of L-C2ST on a challenging application from computational neuroscience.},

However, it has been challenging to relate large-scale functional measurements of the C. elegans nervous system to the worm’s known anatomical connectome1–3. Here, we address this apparent discrepancy using a connectome-constrained model of the nematode brain fit to neural recordings with optogenetic perturbations2. Our model consists of a noisy linear dynamical system with a sparse synaptic weight matrix with non-zero entries only where there are synapses in the C. elegans connectome. We evaluated the model by perturbing neurons in silico and measuring the perturbation response of all other neurons in the network. We compared these responses to those measured in held-out animals and found that this model captured the perturbation-triggered responses of individual neurons 92\% as well as the reproducibility of the perturbation responses themselves. This includes perturbation responses of neurons that were not anatomically connected, which the model explains in terms of signal propagation over multiple neurons. In addition to capturing perturbation responses, the model also accurately predicts the activity of held-out neurons using the observed activity of other neurons. Strikingly, alternative models with equivalent levels of sparsity but a shuffled connectome constraint achieved much lower performance. Finally, we demonstrate that adding connections beyond those found in the connectome did not improve the model’s prediction of the perturbation measurements. The model described here provides the strongest link yet between the connectivity of the C. elegans nervous system and its causal and correlative functional properties.},

We investigated dendritic properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons intracellularly labeled during in vivo and in vitro physiologic recordings, by using similar intracellular staining and three-dimensional reconstruction techniques. Total dendritic length of the in vivo neurons was similar to that of the in vitro cells. After correction for shrinkage, cell extent in three-dimensional representation was not different between the two groups. Both in vivo and in vitro neurons demonstrated a variable degree of symmetry, with some neurons showing more cylindrical symmetry around the main apical axis, whereas other neurons were more elliptical, with the variation likely due to preparation and preservation conditions. Branch order analysis revealed no difference in the number of branch orders or dendritic complexity. Passive conduction of dendritic signals to the soma in these neurons shows considerable attenuation, particularly with higher frequency signals (such as synaptic potentials compared with steady-state signals), despite a relatively short electrotonic length. Essential aspects of morphometric appearance and complex dendritic integration critical to CA1 pyramidal cell functioning are preserved across neurons defined from the two different hippocampal preparations used in this study.

	abstract = {With the emergence of large-scale pre-trained neural networks, methods to adapt such "foundation" models to data-limited downstream tasks have become a necessity. Fine-tuning, preference optimization, and transfer learning have all been successfully employed for these purposes when the target task closely resembles the source task, but a precise theoretical understanding of "task similarity" is still lacking. While conventional wisdom suggests that simple measures of similarity between source and target distributions, such as \${\textbackslash}phi\$-divergences or integral probability metrics, can directly predict the success of transfer, we prove the surprising fact that, in general, this is not the case. We adopt, instead, a feature-centric viewpoint on transfer learning and establish a number of theoretical results that demonstrate that when the target task is well represented by the feature space of the pre-trained model, transfer learning outperforms training from scratch. We study deep linear networks as a minimal model of transfer learning in which we can analytically characterize the transferability phase diagram as a function of the target dataset size and the feature space overlap. For this model, we establish rigorously that when the feature space overlap between the source and target tasks is sufficiently strong, both linear transfer and fine-tuning improve performance, especially in the low data limit. These results build on an emerging understanding of feature learning dynamics in deep linear networks, and we demonstrate numerically that the rigorous results we derive for the linear case also apply to nonlinear networks.},

These models depend on a large number of parameters that are difficult to estimate. In practice, they are often hand-tuned to match measured physiological behaviors, thus raising questions of identifiability and interpretability. We propose a statistical approach to the automatic estimation of various biologically relevant parameters, including 1) the distribution of channel densities, 2) the spatiotemporal pattern of synaptic input, and 3) axial resistances across extended dendrites. Recent experimental advances, notably in voltage-sensitive imaging, motivate us to assume access to: i) the spatiotemporal voltage signal in the dendrite and ii) an approximate description of the channel kinetics of interest. We show here that, given i and ii, parameters 1–3 can be inferred simultaneously by nonnegative linear regression; that this optimization problem possesses a unique solution and is guaranteed to converge despite the large number of parameters and their complex nonlinear interaction; and that standard optimization algorithms efficiently reach this optimum with modest computational and data requirements. We demonstrate that the method leads to accurate estimations on a wide variety of challenging model data sets that include up to about 104 parameters (roughly two orders of magnitude more than previously feasible) and describe how the method gives insights into the functional interaction of groups of channels.},

	abstract = {Simulations of coronary hemodynamics have improved non-invasive clinical risk stratification and treatment outcomes for coronary artery disease, compared to relying on anatomical imaging alone. However, simulations typically use empirical approaches to distribute total coronary flow amongst the arteries in the coronary tree. This ignores patient variability, the presence of disease, and other clinical factors. Further, uncertainty in the clinical data often remains unaccounted for in the modeling pipeline. We present an end-to-end uncertainty-aware pipeline to (1) personalize coronary flow simulations by incorporating branch-specific coronary flows as well as cardiac function; and (2) predict clinical and biomechanical quantities of interest with improved precision, while accounting for uncertainty in the clinical data. We assimilate patient-specific measurements of myocardial blood flow from CT myocardial perfusion imaging to estimate branch-specific coronary flows. We use adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the joint posterior distributions of model parameters with simulated noise in the clinical data. Additionally, we determine the posterior predictive distribution for relevant quantities of interest using a new approach combining multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimation with non-linear, data-driven dimensionality reduction. Our framework recapitulates clinically measured cardiac function as well as branch-specific coronary flows under measurement uncertainty. We substantially shrink the confidence intervals for estimated quantities of interest compared to single-fidelity and state-of-the-art multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods. This is especially true for quantities that showed limited correlation between the low- and high-fidelity model predictions. Moreover, the proposed estimators are significantly cheaper to compute for a specified confidence level or variance.},

Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of Caenorhabditis elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackelberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.},

However, to reliably identify these IO-functions, we need to perturb each input and combination of inputs while observing all the outputs. Here, we argue that such completeness is possible in C. elegans; a complete description that goes all the way from the activity of every neuron to predict behavior. The established and growing toolkit of optophysiology can non-invasively capture and control every neuron's activity and scale to countless experiments. The information from many such experiments can be pooled while capturing the inter-individual variability because neuronal identity and function are largely conserved across individuals.

Uncertainty of action outcomes can promote risk taking and exploratory choices, in which norepinephrine and the orbitofrontal cortex appear to be involved. Predictable environments should facilitate consideration of longer-delayed rewards, which depends on serotonin in the dorsal striatum and dorsal prefrontal cortex.

	abstract = {The small roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans employs two strategies, termed pirouette and weathervane, which are closely related to the internal representation of chemical gradients parallel and perpendicular to the travelling direction, respectively, to perform chemotaxis. These gradients must be calculated from the chemical information obtained at a single point, because the sensory neurons are located close to each other at the nose tip. To formulate the relationship between this sensory input and internal representations of the chemical gradient, this study proposes a simple computational model derived from the directional decomposition of the chemical concentration at the nose tip that can generate internal representations of the chemical gradient. The ability of the computational model was verified by using a chemotaxis simulator that can simulate the body motions of pirouette and weathervane, which confirmed that the computational model enables the conversion of the sensory input and head-bending angles into both types of gradients with high correlations of approximately r {\textgreater} 0.90 (p {\textless} 0.01) with the true gradients. In addition, the chemotaxis index of the model was 0.64, which is slightly higher than that in the actual animal (0.57). In addition, simulation using a connectome-based neural network model confirmed that the proposed computational model is implementable in the actual network structure.},

Understanding these processes is crucial for comprehending neural circuits’ structure and function. The ability to reconstruct neural circuits, and even entire nervous systems, at the neuron and synapse level, facilitates the study of the design principles of neural systems and their developmental plan. Here, we investigate the developing connectome of C. elegans using statistical generative models based on simple biological features: neuronal cell type, neuron birth time, cell body distance, reciprocity, and synaptic pruning. Our models accurately predict synapse existence, degree profiles of individual neurons, and statistics of small network motifs. Importantly, these models require a surprisingly small number of neuronal cell types, which we infer and characterize. We further show that to replicate the experimentally-observed developmental path, multiple developmental epochs are necessary. Validation of our model’s predictions of the synaptic connections using multiple reconstructions of adult worms suggests that our model identified the fundamental “backbone” of the connectivity graph. The accuracy of the generative statistical models we use here offers a general framework for studying how connectomes develop and the underlying principles of their design.},

	abstract = {Chaotic systems, such as turbulent flows, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. However, their study remains a challenge due to the large range scales, and the strong interaction with other, often not fully understood, physics. As a consequence, the spatiotemporal resolution required for accurate simulation of these systems is typically computationally infeasible, particularly for applications of long-term risk assessment, such as the quantification of extreme weather risk due to climate change. While data-driven modeling offers some promise of alleviating these obstacles, the scarcity of high-quality simulations results in limited available data to train such models, which is often compounded by the lack of stability for long-horizon simulations. As such, the computational, algorithmic, and data restrictions generally imply that the probability of rare extreme events is not accurately captured. In this work we present a general strategy for training neural network models to non-intrusively correct under-resolved long-time simulations of chaotic systems. The approach is based on training a post-processing correction operator on under-resolved simulations nudged towards a high-fidelity reference. This enables us to learn the dynamics of the underlying system directly, which allows us to use very little training data, even when the statistics thereof are far from converged. Additionally, through the use of probabilistic network architectures we are able to leverage the uncertainty due to the limited training data to further improve extrapolation capabilities. We apply our framework to severely under-resolved simulations of quasi-geostrophic flow and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict the anisotropic statistics over time horizons more than 30 times longer than the data seen in training.},

We showcase the performance and flexibility of the Simformer on simulators from ecology, epidemiology, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that it opens up new possibilities and application domains for amortized Bayesian inference on simulation-based models.},

Specifically, we explore the impact of both multiplicative and thermal noise on the obfuscation of the actual signal and propose methods to resolve them. Firstly, we present an algorithm that can effectively separate thermal noise with comparable performance to Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) but with significantly improved speed. Subsequently, we analyze multiplicative noise and demonstrate that HMC is insufficient for isolating thermal and multiplicative noise. However, we show that, with additional knowledge of the ratio between thermal and multiplicative noise, we can accurately distinguish between the two types of noise when provided with a sufficiently large sampling rate or an amplitude of multiplicative noise smaller than thermal noise. This finding results in a situation that initially seems counterintuitive. When multiplicative noise dominates the noise spectrum, we can successfully estimate the parameters for such systems after adding additional white noise to shift the noise balance.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, the capacity to generate large amounts of data in science and engineering applications has been growing steadily. Meanwhile, the progress in machine learning has turned it into a suitable tool to process and utilise the available data. Nonetheless, many relevant scientific and engineering problems present challenges where current machine learning methods cannot yet efficiently leverage the available data and resources. For example, in scientific discovery, we are often faced with the problem of exploring very large, high-dimensional spaces, where querying a high fidelity, black-box objective function is very expensive. Progress in machine learning methods that can efficiently tackle such problems would help accelerate currently crucial areas such as drug and materials discovery. In this paper, we propose the use of GFlowNets for multi-fidelity active learning, where multiple approximations of the black-box function are available at lower fidelity and cost. GFlowNets are recently proposed methods for amortised probabilistic inference that have proven efficient for exploring large, high-dimensional spaces and can hence be practical in the multi-fidelity setting too. Here, we describe our algorithm for multi-fidelity active learning with GFlowNets and evaluate its performance in both well-studied synthetic tasks and practically relevant applications of molecular discovery. Our results show that multi-fidelity active learning with GFlowNets can efficiently leverage the availability of multiple oracles with different costs and fidelities to accelerate scientific discovery and engineering design.},

	abstract = {While multifidelity modeling provides a cost-effective way to conduct uncertainty quantification with computationally expensive models, much greater efficiency can be achieved by adaptively deciding the number of required high-fidelity (HF) simulations, depending on the type and complexity of the problem and the desired accuracy in the results. We propose a framework for active learning with multifidelity modeling emphasizing the efficient estimation of rare events. Our framework works by fusing a low-fidelity (LF) prediction with an HF-inferred correction, filtering the corrected LF prediction to decide whether to call the high-fidelity model, and for enhanced subsequent accuracy, adapting the correction for the LF prediction after every HF model call. The framework does not make any assumptions as to the LF model type or its correlations with the HF model. In addition, for improved robustness when estimating smaller failure probabilities, we propose using dynamic active learning functions that decide when to call the HF model. We demonstrate our framework using several academic case studies (including some high-dimensional problems) and two finite element model case studies: estimating Navier-Stokes velocities using the Stokes approximation and estimating stresses in a transversely isotropic model subjected to displacements via a coarsely meshed isotropic model. Across these case studies, not only did the proposed framework estimate the failure probabilities accurately, but compared with either Monte Carlo or a standard variance reduction method, it also required only a small fraction of the calls to the HF model.},

	abstract = {There has been an increasing interest from the scientific community in using likelihood-free inference (LFI) to determine which parameters of a given simulator model could best describe a set of experimental data. Despite exciting recent results and a wide range of possible applications, an important bottleneck of LFI when applied to time series data is the necessity of defining a set of summary features, often hand-tailored based on domain knowledge. In this work, we present a data-driven strategy for automatically learning summary features from univariate time series and apply it to signals generated from autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) models and the Van der Pol Oscillator. Our results indicate that learning summary features from data can compete and even outperform LFI methods based on hand-crafted values such as autocorrelation coefficients even in the linear case.},

	abstract = {Learning and memory are regulated by neuromodulatory pathways, but the contribution and temporal requirement of most neuromodulators in a learning circuit are unknown. Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved neuromedin U (NMU) neuropeptide family as a regulator of C. elegans gustatory aversive learning. The NMU homolog CAPA-1 and its receptor NMUR-1 are required for the retrieval of learned salt avoidance. Gustatory aversive learning requires the release of CAPA-1 neuropeptides from sensory ASG neurons that respond to salt stimuli in an experience-dependent manner. Optogenetic silencing of CAPA-1 neurons blocks the expression, but not the acquisition, of learned salt avoidance. CAPA-1 signals through NMUR-1 in AFD sensory neurons to modulate two navigational strategies for salt chemotaxis. Aversive conditioning thus recruits NMU signaling to modulate locomotor programs for expressing learned avoidance behavior. Because NMU signaling is conserved across bilaterian animals, our findings incite further research into its function in other learning circuits., Learning and memory are regulated by neuropeptides. Here, the authors show that the neuropeptide CAPA-1 and its receptor NMUR-1 are required to retrieve learned salt avoidance in C. elegans. CAPA-1/NMUR-1 activation in AFD sensory neurons modulates locomotor programs to express learned avoidance.},

	abstract = {In the tongue, distinct classes of taste receptor cells detect the five basic tastes, sweet, sour, bitter, sodium salt, and umami,. Among these qualities, bitter and sour stimuli are innately aversive, whereas sweet and umami are appetitive, and generally attractive to animals. In contrast, salty taste is unique in that increasing salt concentration fundamentally transforms an innately appetitive stimulus into a powerfully aversive one–. This appetitive-aversive balance helps maintain appropriate salt consumption,,,, and represents an important part of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We have previously shown that the appetitive responses to NaCl are mediated by taste receptor cells expressing the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, while the cellular substrate for salt aversion was unknown. Here we explore the cellular and molecular basis for the rejection of high concentrations of salts ({\textgreater}300 mM NaCl or KCl). We now show that high-salt recruits the two primary aversive taste pathways by activating the sour and bitter taste-sensing cells. We also demonstrate that genetic silencing of these pathways abolishes behavioral aversion to concentrated salt, without impairing salt attraction. Notably, mice devoid of salt-aversion pathways now exhibit unimpeded, continuous attraction even to exceedingly high concentrations of NaCl. We propose that the “co-opting” of sour and bitter neural pathways evolved as a means to ensure that high levels of salt reliably trigger robust behavioral rejection, thus preventing its potentially detrimental effects in health and well-being.},

We showcase three applications that leverage NeuroPAL for nervous-system-wide neuronal identification.

These conductances are tuned for specific activity patterns but might also reflect additional constraints, such as metabolic cost or robustness to perturbations. How do such constraints influence the range of permissible conductances? Here we investigate how metabolic cost affects the parameters of neural circuits with similar activity in a model of the pyloric network of the crab Cancer borealis. We present a machine learning method that can identify a range of network models that generate activity patterns matching experimental data and find that neural circuits can consume largely different amounts of energy despite similar circuit activity. Furthermore, a reduced but still significant range of circuit parameters gives rise to energy-efficient circuits. We then examine the space of parameters of energy-efficient circuits and identify potential tuning strategies for low metabolic cost. Finally, we investigate the interaction between metabolic cost and temperature robustness. We show that metabolic cost can vary across temperatures but that robustness to temperature changes does not necessarily incur an increased metabolic cost. Our analyses show that despite metabolic efficiency and temperature robustness constraining circuit parameters, neural systems can generate functional, efficient, and robust network activity with widely disparate sets of conductances.},

Recently, various computational models have been developed based on whole-brain calcium imaging data. However, these analyses monitor only the activity of neuronal cell bodies and treat the cells as point unit. This point-neuron model is inexpensive in computational costs, but the model is unrealistically simplistic at representing intact neural activities in the brain. Here, we describe a novel three-unit Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) model based on the neuronal responses derived from a Caenorhabditis elegans salt-sensing neuron. We recorded calcium responses in three regions of the ASER neuron using a simple downstep of NaCl concentration. Our simple ODE model generated from a single recording can adequately reproduce and predict the temporal responses of each part of the neuron to various types of NaCl concentration changes. Our strategy which combines a simple recording data and an ODE mathematical model may be extended to realistically understand whole brain dynamics by computational simulation.},

BluePyOpt is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardizes several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices.

Here, we introduce for the first time a novel system theory-based approach for ion channel modeling based on the concept of transfer function characterization, without a priori knowledge of the biological system, using patch clamp measurements. Using the shaker-related voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.1 (KCNA1) as an example, we compare the established approaches, HH and HMM, with the system theory-based concept in terms of model accuracy, computational effort, the degree of electrophysiological interpretability, and methodological limitations. This highly data-driven modeling concept offers a new opportunity for the phenomenological kinetic modeling of ion channels, exhibiting exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency compared to the conventional methods. The method has a high potential to further improve the quality and computational performance of complex cell and organ model simulations, and could provide a valuable new tool in the field of next-generation in silico electrophysiology.},

To demonstrate the model’s effectiveness and robustness, we evaluated the performance of DeepNeuropePred and four models from the NeuroPred server in the independent dataset and our model achieved the highest AUC score (0.916), which are 6.9\%, 7.8\%, 8.8\%, and 10.9\% higher than Mammalian (0.857), insects (0.850), Mollusc (0.842) and Motif (0.826), respectively. For the convenience of researchers, we provide a web server (http://isyslab.info/NeuroPepV2/deepNeuropePred.jsp).},

	abstract = {We report data on the structural dynamics of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) type 1 (Y1R), a typical representative of class A peptide ligand GPCRs, using a combination of solid-state NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. First, the equilibrium dynamics of Y1R were studied using 15N-NMR and quantitative determination of 1H-13C order parameters through the measurement of dipolar couplings in separated-local-field NMR experiments. Order parameters reporting the amplitudes of the molecular motions of the C-H bond vectors of Y1R in DMPC membranes are 0.57 for the Cα sites and lower in the side chains (0.37 for the CH2 and 0.18 for the CH3 groups). Different NMR excitation schemes identify relatively rigid and also dynamic segments of the molecule. In monounsaturated membranes composed of longer lipid chains, Y1R is more rigid, attributed to a higher hydrophobic thickness of the lipid membrane. The presence of an antagonist or NPY has little influence on the amplitude of motions, whereas the addition of agonist and arrestin led to a pronounced rigidization. To investigate Y1R dynamics with site resolution, we conducted extensive all-atom MD simulations of the apo and antagonist-bound state. In each state, three replicas with a length of 20 μs (with one exception, where the trajectory length was 10 μs) were conducted. In these simulations, order parameters of each residue were determined and showed high values in the transmembrane helices, whereas the loops and termini exhibit much lower order. The extracellular helix segments undergo larger amplitude motions than their intracellular counterparts, whereas the opposite is observed for the loops, Helix 8, and termini. Only minor differences in order were observed between the apo and antagonist-bound state, whereas the time scale of the motions is shorter for the apo state. Although these relatively fast motions occurring with correlation times of ns up to a few µs have no direct relevance for receptor activation, it is believed that they represent the prerequisite for larger conformational transitions in proteins.},

There is a large literature on the effect of variations in ion channels on the dynamics of spiking neurons that represent the main type of neurons found in the vertebrate nervous systems. Nevertheless, non-spiking neurons are also ubiquitous in many nervous tissues and play a critical role in the processing of some sensory systems. To our knowledge, however, how conductance variations affect the dynamics of non-spiking neurons has never been assessed. Based on experimental observations reported in the biological literature and on mathematical considerations, we first propose a phenotypic classification of non-spiking neurons. Then, we determine a general pattern of the phenotypic evolution of non-spiking neurons as a function of changes in calcium and potassium conductances. Furthermore, we study the homeostatic compensatory mechanisms of ion channels in a well-posed non-spiking retinal cone model. We show that there is a restricted range of ion conductance values for which the behavior and phenotype of the neuron are maintained. Finally, we discuss the implications of the phenotypic changes of individual cells at the level of neuronal network functioning of the C. elegans worm and the retina, which are two non-spiking nervous tissues composed of neurons with various phenotypes.},

The basal ganglia play a crucial role in regulating of locomotion-related behavior. Here, we found that NPSR protein of mouse was distributed in the substantia nigra (SN) and globus pallidus (LGP) by immunohistochemical analysis. However, less is known about the direct locomotion-related effects of NPS in both SN and LGP. Therefore, we investigated the role of NPS in locomotion processes, using the open field test. The results showed that NPS infused into the SN (0.03, 0.1, 1nmol) or LGP (0.01, 0.03, 0.1nmol) dose-dependently increased the locomotor activity in mice. SHA 68 (50mg/kg), an antagonist of NPSR, blocked the locomotor stimulant effect of NPS in both nuleus. Meanwhile, these effects of NPS were also counteracted by the CRF1 receptor antagonist antalarmin (30mg/kg, i.p.). In addition, we found that the expression of c-Fos was significantly increased after NPS was delivered into SN. In conclusion, these results indicate that NPS-NPSR system may regulate locomotion together with the CRF1 system in SN.},

strategies to combat obesity. This review examines energy homeostasis and food
intake behaviors, specifically with regards to hormones, peptides, and
neurotransmitters in the periphery and central nervous system, and their
potential role in obesity. Dysfunction in feeding signals by the brain is a
factor in obesity. The hypothalamic (arcuate nucleus) and brainstem (nucleus
tractus solitaris) areas integrate behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic
responses via afferent and efferent pathways from and to the brainstem and
peripheral organs. Neurons present in the arcuate nucleus express
pro-opiomelanocortin, Neuropeptide Y, and Agouti Related Peptide, with the
former involved in lowering food intake, and the latter two acutely increasing
feeding behaviors. Action of peripheral hormones from the gut, pancreas,
adipose, and liver are also involved in energy homeostasis. Vagal afferent
neurons are also important in regulating energy homeostasis. Peripheral signals
respond to the level of stored and currently available fuel. By studying their
actions, new agents maybe developed that disable orexigenic responses and
enhance anorexigenic signals. Although there are relatively few medications
currently available for obesity treatment, a number of agents are in development
that work through these pathways.},

However, one key element receiving little attention in the study of synaptic plasticity is the role of neuromodulators, which are known to orchestrate neuronal activity on brain-wide, network and synaptic scales. We aim to review current evidence on the mechanisms by which certain modulators, namely dopamine, acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin, control synaptic plasticity induction through corresponding metabotropic receptors in a pathway-specific manner. Lastly, we propose that neuromodulators control plasticity outcomes through steering glutamatergic transmission, thereby gating its induction and maintenance.},

The resulting state is characterized by strongly chaotic dynamics, even when the external inputs to the network are constant in time.

	abstract = {Conductance-based equations for electrically active cells form one of the most widely studied mathematical frameworks in computational biology. This framework, as expressed through a set of differential equations by Hodgkin and Huxley, synthesizes the impact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage—and the highly nonlinear impact of that voltage back on the currents themselves—into the rapid push and pull of the action potential. Later studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics are orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes regulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations familiar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing conductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict fluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action potentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex (and higher-dimensional) description than the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations or their counterparts. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel fluctuations with noise terms added to the equations of Hodgkin-Huxley type. Many of these approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when compared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are both accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and why, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the deterministic equations of Hodgkin-Huxley type as well as to more modern models of ion channel dynamics. As such, we hope that this review will speed emerging studies of how channel noise modulates electrophysiological dynamics and function. We supply user-friendly MATLAB simulation code of these stochastic versions of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations on the ModelDB website (accession number 138950) and http://www.amath.washington.edu/{\textasciitilde}etsb/tutorials.html.},

	abstract = {Peptide neuromodulation has been implicated to shield neuronal activity from acute temperature changes that can otherwise lead to loss of motor control or failure of vital behaviors. However, the cellular actions neuropeptides elicit to support temperature-robust activity remain unknown. Here, we find that peptide neuromodulation restores rhythmic bursting in temperature-compromised central pattern generator (CPG) neurons by counteracting membrane shunt and increasing dendritic electrical spread. We show that acutely rising temperatures reduced spike generation and interrupted ongoing rhythmic motor activity in the crustacean gastric mill CPG. Neuronal release and extrinsic application of Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), a substance-P-related peptide, restored rhythmic activity. Warming led to a significant decrease in membrane resistance and a shunting of the dendritic signals in the main gastric mill CPG neuron. Using a combination of fluorescent calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we observed that postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated less far within the dendritic neuropil as the system warmed. In the presence of CabTRP Ia, membrane shunt decreased and both postsynaptic potentials and antidromic action potentials propagated farther. At elevated temperatures, CabTRP Ia restored dendritic electrical spread or extended it beyond that at cold temperatures. Selective introduction of the CabTRP Ia conductance using a dynamic clamp demonstrated that the CabTRP Ia voltage-dependent conductance was sufficient to restore rhythmic bursting. Our findings demonstrate that a substance-P-related neuropeptide can boost dendritic electrical spread to maintain neuronal activity when perturbed and reveals key neurophysiological components of neuropeptide actions that support pattern generation in temperature-compromised conditions., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Changes in body temperature can have detrimental consequences for the well-being of an organism. Temperature-dependent changes in neuronal activity can be especially dangerous if they affect vital behaviors. Understanding how temperature changes disrupt neuronal activity and identifying how to ameliorate such effects is critically important. Our study of a crustacean circuit shows that warming disrupts rhythmic neuronal activity by increasing membrane shunt and reducing dendritic electrical spread in a key circuit neuron. Through the ionic conductance activated by it, substance-P-related peptide modulation restored electrical spread and counteracted the detrimental temperature effects on rhythmic activity. Because neuropeptides are commonly implicated in sustaining neuronal activity during perturbation, our results provide a promising mechanism to support temperature-robust activity.},

We applied a multidisciplinary approach to map neural circuits in freely behaving worms by integrating functional imaging, optogenetic interrogation, genetic manipulation, laser ablation, and electrophysiology. We found that a disinhibitory circuit and a stimulatory circuit together promote initiation of backward movement and that circuitry dynamics is differentially regulated by sensory cues. Both circuits require glutamatergic transmission but depend on distinct glutamate receptors. This dual mode of motor initiation control is found in mammals, suggesting that distantly related organisms with anatomically distinct nervous systems may adopt similar strategies for motor control.

Impairments in social behaviour are associated with decreased quality of life and psychopathological states. In non-human mammals, the neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) are key mediators of complex social behaviours, including attachment, social recognition and aggression. In particular, OXT reduces behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to social stress and seems both to enable animals to overcome their natural avoidance of proximity and to inhibit defensive behaviour, thereby facilitating approach behaviour. AVP has primarily been implicated in male-typical social behaviours, including aggression and pair-bond formation, and mediates anxiogenic effects. Initial studies in humans suggest behavioural, neural, and endocrine effects of both neuropeptides, similar to those found in animal studies. This review focuses on advances made to date in the effort to understand the role of OXT and AVP in human social behaviour. First, the literature on OXT and AVP and their involvement in social stress and anxiety, social cognition, social approach, and aggression is reviewed. Second, we discuss clinical implications for mental disorders that are associated with social deficits (e.g. autism spectrum disorder, borderline personality disorder). Finally, a model of the interactions of anxiety and stress, social approach behaviour, and the oxytocinergic system is presented, which integrates the novel approach of a psychobiological therapy in psychopathological states.},

For an organism to survive, it is essential for the animal to respond and adapt to environmental changes. This is achieved by sensing external cues and translating them into behaviors through changes in synaptic activity. The nervous system plays a crucial role in constantly evaluating environmental cues and allowing for behavioral plasticity in the organism. Multiple neurotransmitters and neuropeptides have been implicated as key players for integrating sensory information to produce the desired output. Because of its simple nervous system and well-established neuronal connectome, C. elegans acts as an excellent model to understand the mechanisms underlying behavioral plasticity.

This review will have a specific focus on feeding, mating, sleep, addiction, learning and locomotory behaviors in C. elegans. With a view to understand evolutionary relationships, we explore the functions and associated pathophysiology of C. elegans neuropeptides that are conserved across different phyla.

However, the mechanism of how the goal information is encoded and decoded to generate migration toward the appropriate direction has not been clarified. Here, we describe the mechanism of migration towards a learned concentration of NaCl in Caenorhabditis elegans. In the salt-sensing neuron ASER, the difference between the experienced and currently perceived NaCl concentration is encoded as phosphorylation at Ser65 of UNC-64/Syntaxin 1 A through the protein kinase C(PKC-1) signaling pathway. The phosphorylation affects basal glutamate transmission from ASER, inducing the reversal of the postsynaptic response of reorientation-initiating neurons (i.e., from inhibitory to excitatory), guiding the animals toward the experienced concentration. This process, the decoding of the context, is achieved through the differential sensitivity of postsynaptic excitatory and inhibitory receptors. Our results reveal the mechanism of migration based on the synaptic plasticity that conceptually differs from the classical ones.},

	abstract = {Animals search for foods and decide their behaviors according to previous experience. Caenorhabditis elegans detects chemicals with a limited number of sensory neurons, allowing us to dissect roles of each neuron for innate and learned behaviors. C. elegans is attracted to salt after exposure to the salt (NaCl) with food. In contrast, it learns to avoid the salt after exposure to the salt without food. In salt-attraction behavior, it is known that the ASE taste sensory neurons (ASEL and ASER) play a major role. However, little is known about mechanisms for learned salt avoidance. Here, through dissecting contributions of ASE neurons for salt chemotaxis, we show that both ASEL and ASER generate salt chemotaxis plasticity. In ASER, we have previously shown that the insulin/PI 3-kinase signaling acts for starvation-induced salt chemotaxis plasticity. This study shows that the PI 3-kinase signaling promotes aversive drive of ASER but not of ASEL. Furthermore, the Gq signaling pathway composed of Gqα EGL-30, diacylglycerol, and nPKC (novel protein kinase C) TTX-4 promotes attractive drive of ASER but not of ASEL. A putative salt receptor GCY-22 guanylyl cyclase is required in ASER for both salt attraction and avoidance. Our results suggest that ASEL and ASER use distinct molecular mechanisms to regulate salt chemotaxis plasticity.},

	abstract = {Dementia conditions and memory deficits of different origins (vascular, metabolic and primary neurodegenerative such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases) are getting more common and greater clinical problems recently in the aging population. Since the presently available cognitive enhancers have very limited therapeutical applications, there is an emerging need to elucidate the complex pathophysiological mechanisms, identify key mediators and novel targets for future drug development. Neuropeptides are widely distributed in brain regions responsible for learning and memory processes with special emphasis on the hippocampus, amygdala and the basal forebrain. They form networks with each other, and also have complex interactions with the cholinergic, glutamatergic, dopaminergic and GABA-ergic pathways. This review summarizes the extensive experimental data in the well-established rat and mouse models, as well as the few clinical results regarding the expression and the roles of the tachykinin system, somatostatin and the closely related cortistatin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate-cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), opioid peptides and galanin. Furthermore, the main receptorial targets, mechanisms and interactions are described in order to highlight the possible therapeutical potentials. Agents not only symptomatically improving the functional impairments, but also inhibiting the progression of the neurodegenerative processes would be breakthroughs in this area. The most promising mechanisms determined at the level of exploratory investigations in animal models of cognitive disfunctions are somatostatin sst4, NPY Y2, PACAP–VIP VPAC1, tachykinin NK3 and galanin GALR2 receptor agonisms, as well as delta opioid receptor antagonism. Potent and selective non-peptide ligands with good CNS penetration are needed for further characterization of these molecular pathways to complete the preclinical studies and decide if any of the above described targets could be appropriate for clinical investigations.},

	abstract = {High levels of NPY expression in brain regions important for learning and memory together with its neuromodulatory and neurotrophic effects suggest a regulatory role for NPY in memory processes. Therefore it is not surprising that an increasing number of studies have provided evidence for NPY acting as a modulator of neuroplasticity, neurotransmission, and memory. Here these results are presented in relation to the types of memory affected by NPY and its receptors. NPY can exert both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on memory, depending on memory type and phase, dose applied, brain region, and NPY receptor subtypes. Thus NPY act as a resilience factor by impairing associative implicit memory after stressful and aversive events, as evident in models of fear conditioning, presumably via Y1 receptors in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. In addition, NPY impairs acquisition but enhances consolidation and retention in models depending on spatial and discriminative types of associative explicit memory, presumably involving Y2 receptor-mediated regulations of hippocampal excitatory transmission. Moreover, spatial memory training leads to increased hippocampal NPY gene expression that together with Y1 receptor-mediated neurogenesis could constitute necessary steps in consolidation and long-term retention of spatial memory. Altogether, NPY-induced effects on learning and memory seem to be biphasic, anatomically and temporally differential, and in support of a modulatory role of NPY at keeping the system in balance. Obtaining further insight into memory-related effects of NPY could inspire the engineering of new therapeutics targeting diseases where impaired learning and memory are central elements.},

	abstract = {The detailed knowledge of C. elegans connectome for 3 decades has not contributed dramatically to our understanding of worm’s behavior. One of main reasons for this situation has been the lack of data on the type of synaptic signaling between particular neurons in the worm’s connectome. The aim of this study was to determine synaptic polarities for each connection in a small pre-motor circuit controlling locomotion. Even in this compact network of just 7 neurons the space of all possible patterns of connection types (excitation vs. inhibition) is huge. To deal effectively with this combinatorial problem we devised a novel and relatively fast technique based on genetic algorithms and large-scale parallel computations, which we combined with detailed neurophysiological modeling of interneuron dynamics and compared the theory to the available behavioral data. As a result of these massive computations, we found that the optimal connectivity pattern that matches the best locomotory data is the one in which all interneuron connections are inhibitory, even those terminating on motor neurons. This finding is consistent with recent experimental data on cholinergic signaling in C. elegans, and it suggests that the system controlling locomotion is designed to save metabolic energy. Moreover, this result provides a solid basis for a more realistic modeling of neural control in these worms, and our novel powerful computational technique can in principle be applied (possibly with some modifications) to other small-scale functional circuits in C. elegans.},

	abstract = {Given the inherent complexity of the human nervous system, insight into the dynamics of brain activity can be gained from studying smaller and simpler organisms. While some of the potential target organisms are simple enough that their behavioural and structural biology might be well-known and understood, others might still lead to computationally intractable models that require extensive resources to simulate. Since such organisms are frequently only acting as proxies to further our understanding of underlying phenomena or functionality, often one is not interested in the detailed evolution of every single neuron in the system. Instead, it is sufficient to observe the subset of neurons that capture the effect that the profound nonlinearities of the neuronal system have in response to different stimuli. In this paper, we consider the well-known nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and seek to investigate the possibility of generating lower complexity models that capture the system’s dynamics with low error using only measured or simulated input-output information. Such models are often termed black-box models. We show how the nervous system of C. elegans can be modelled and simulated with data-driven models using different neural network architectures. Specifically, we target the use of state-of-the-art recurrent neural network architectures such as Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units and compare these architectures in terms of their properties and their accuracy (Root Mean Square Error), as well as the complexity of the resulting models. We show that Gated Recurrent Unit models with a hidden layer size of 4 are able to accurately reproduce the system response to very different stimuli. We furthermore explore the relative importance of their inputs as well as scalability to more scenarios.},

	abstract = {Despite recent interest in reconstructing neuronal networks, complete wiring diagrams on the level of individual synapses remain scarce and the insights into function they can provide remain unclear. Even for Caenorhabditis elegans, whose neuronal network is relatively small and stereotypical from animal to animal, published wiring diagrams are neither accurate nor complete and self-consistent. Using materials from White et al. and new electron micrographs we assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks of hermaphrodite C. elegans. We propose a method to visualize the wiring diagram, which reflects network signal flow. We calculate statistical and topological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic multiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network signal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in information processing, and network motifs that could serve as functional modules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response to sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find several activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously described behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap junction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical properties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif distributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely point to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported here can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating predictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser ablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to stimulation.},

We provide evidence that the observed learning is a food-triggered multisensory behavior, which requires mechanosensory and proprioceptive input, and utilizes cues about the structural features of nematodes' environment and their body actions. The CREB-like transcription factor and dopamine signaling are also involved in maze performance.

This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists--the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field.   The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks.   D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development.   References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology--a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

In contrast to amino acid transmitter release at the synapse, neuropeptide release is not restricted to the synaptic specialization, and after release, a neuropeptide may diffuse some distance to exert its action through a G protein-coupled receptor. Some neuropeptides such as hypocretin/orexin are synthesized only in single regions of the brain, and the neurons releasing these peptides probably have similar functional roles. Other peptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) are synthesized throughout the brain, and neurons that synthesize the peptide in one region have no anatomical or functional connection with NPY neurons in other brain regions. Here, I review converging data revealing a complex interaction between slow-acting neuromodulator peptides and fast-acting amino acid transmitters in the control of energy homeostasis, drug addiction, mood and motivation, sleep-wake states, and neuroendocrine regulation.},

All three peptides are 36 amino acids long and act on G-protein-coupled receptors. NPY and PYY are present in all vertebrates, whereas PP probably arose as a copy of PYY in an early tetrapod ancestor. NPY is one of the most conserved peptides during evolution and no gnathostome (jawed) species differs from the ancestral gnathostome sequence at more than five positions. PYY is more variable, particularly in mammals which have nine differences to the gnathostome ancestor. PP may be the most rapidly evolving neuroendocrine peptide among tetrapods with only 50\% identity between mammals, birds, and amphibians. Ancestral gnathostome NPY and PYY seem to have differed at only four positions, suggesting that the gene duplication occurred shortly before the appearance of the gnathostomes. The two peptides differ from one another at 9–12 positions in tetrapod species and share at least two receptor subtypes in mammals. In bony and cartilaginous fishes, NPY and PYY have only 5–6 differences which, together with more extensive neuronal localization of PYY, indicate an even greater functional overlap between the two peptides in these animal groups. The emergence of sequence information for several receptor subtypes from various species will shed additional light on the evolution of the functions of the NPY-family peptides.},

Here, we show that VGF (non-acronymic), which is robustly regulated by BDNF/TrkB signaling, is downregulated in dorsal hippocampus (dHc) (male/female) and upregulated in nucleus accumbens (NAc) (male) in depressed human subjects and in mice subjected to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Cre-mediated Vgf ablation in floxed VGF mice, in dHc or NAc, led to pro-depressant or antidepressant behaviors, respectively, while dHc or NAc AAV-VGF overexpression induced opposite outcomes. Mice with reduced VGF levels in the germline (Vgf+/−) or in dHc (AAV-Cre-injected floxed mice) showed increased susceptibility to CSDS and impaired responses to ketamine treatment in the forced swim test. Floxed mice with conditional pan-neuronal (Synapsin-Cre) but not those with forebrain (αCaMKII-Cre) Vgf ablation displayed increased susceptibility to subthreshold social defeat stress, suggesting that neuronal VGF, expressed in part in inhibitory interneurons, regulates depression-like behavior. Acute antibody-mediated sequestration of VGF-derived C-terminal peptides AQEE-30 and TLQP-62 in dHc induced pro-depressant effects. Conversely, dHc TLQP-62 infusion had rapid antidepressant efficacy, which was reduced in BDNF floxed mice injected in dHc with AAV-Cre, and in NBQX- and rapamycin-pretreated wildtype mice, these compounds blocking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, respectively. VGF is therefore a critical modulator of depression-like behaviors in dHc and NAc. In hippocampus, the antidepressant response to ketamine is associated with rapid VGF translation, is impaired by reduced VGF expression, and as previously reported, requires coincident, rapid BDNF translation and release.},

	abstract = {Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36 aa peptide, regulates stress and emotional behaviors. Preclinical and clinical studies support an association of NPY with trauma-evoked syndromes such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although the exact contribution of NPY is not clear. In the current study, we examined functional attributes of NPY in the infralimbic (IL) cortex, an area that regulates fear memories and is reported to be hypoactive in PTSD. Carriers of NPY gene polymorphism rs16147 have been reported to have elevated prefrontal NPY expression. Infusion of NPY into the IL cortex in rats significantly impaired fear extinction memory without affecting conditioned fear expression or acquisition of extinction. Neuroendocrine stress response, depression-like behavior, and working memory performance were not affected by NPY infusion into the IL. The NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBO3304 completely abolished NPY effects on fear extinction retrieval. Y1 receptor expression was localized on CaMKII-positive pyramidal projection neurons and GAD67-positive interneurons in the IL. Patch-clamp recordings revealed increased inhibitory synaptic transmission onto IL projection neurons in the presence of NPY. Thus, NPY dampens excitability of IL projection neurons and impairs retrieval of extinction memory by inhibiting consolidation of extinction. Of relevance to PTSD, elevation of prefrontal NPY attributable to the genetic polymorphism rs16147 may contribute to IL hypoactivity, resulting in impaired extinction memory and susceptibility to the disorder., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a stress modulatory transmitter, is associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Contribution of NPY to PTSD symptomology is unclear. PTSD patients have reduced activity in the infralimbic (IL) subdivision of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), associated with compromised extinction memory. No information exists on fear modulation by NPY in the IL cortex, although NPY and NPY receptors are abundant in these areas. This study shows that IL NPY inhibits consolidation of extinction, resulting in impaired retrieval of extinction memory and modulates excitability of IL projection neurons. In addition to providing a novel perspective on extinction memory modulation by NPY, our findings suggest that elevated mPFC NPY in gene polymorphism rs16147 carriers or after chronic stress could increase susceptibility to PTSD.},

Its local circuits among glutamatergic principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, as well as its long-range connections with other brain regions, have been functionally linked to specific behaviors, ranging from working memory to reward seeking. The efficacy of synaptic signaling in PFC network is profundedly influenced by monoaminergic inputs via the activation of dopamine, adrenergic or serotonin receptors. Stress hormones and neuropeptides also exert complex effects on the synaptic structure and function of PFC neurons. Dysregulation of PFC synaptic transmission is strongly linked to the social deficits, affective disturbance, and memory loss in brain disorders including autism, schizophrenia, depression and Alzheimer’s disease. Critical neural circuits, biological pathways, and molecular players that go awry in these mental illnesses have been revealed by integrated electrophysiological, optogenetic, biochemical, and transcriptomic studies of PFC. Novel epigenetic mechanism-based strategies are proposed as potential avenues of therapeutic intervention for PFC-involved diseases. This review provides an overview on PFC network organization and synaptic modulation, as well as the mechanisms linking PFC dysfunction to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

In this work, we rethink this question with a new method for learning summary statistics. We show that learning sufficient statistics may be easier than direct posterior inference, as the former problem can be reduced to a set of low-dimensional, easy-to-solve learning problems. This suggests us to explicitly decouple summary statistics learning from posterior inference in LFI. Experiments on diverse inference tasks with different data types validate our hypothesis.},

Extensive study of this vesicular-mediated process has revealed that many of the molecular components of the release apparatus are highly conserved in metazoans (Bennett and Scheller 1994; Südhof 1995). In vertebrates, biochemical approaches have led to the identification of components that participate in the release process, whereas the study of synaptic transmission in Caenorhabditis and Drosophila has proceeded in large part using genetic approaches. Each of these approaches has yielded insights. An extensive array of biochemically defined protein-protein interactions has provided the framework for building mechanistic models of neurotransmitter release. The genetic approach has identified novel components that eluded biochemical characterization and has provided functional data to refine the models. Clearly, a complete analysis at the functional level will require the use of electrophysiological techniques, and although such methods are becoming available for C. elegans (Avery et al. 1995b; Avery and Thomas, this volume), they are more advanced in other organisms. In concert, the study of synaptic transmission in C. elegans, Drosophila, and vertebrates has begun to provide an outline of the molecular details of synaptic vesicle function and neurotransmitter release.},

Our electrophysiological measurements and conductance-based simulations provide evidence for a passive supralinear interaction between two distinct types of synapse on T4 dendrites. We show that this multiplication-like nonlinearity arises from the coincidence of cholinergic excitation and release from glutamatergic inhibition. The latter depends on the expression of the glutamate-gated chloride channel GluClα8,9 in T4 neurons, which sharpens the directional tuning of the cells and shapes the optomotor behaviour of the animals.

	abstract = {Many statistical models in cosmology can be simulated forwards but have intractable likelihood functions. Likelihood-free inference methods allow us to perform Bayesian inference from these models using only forward simulations, free from any likelihood assumptions or approximations. Likelihood-free inference generically involves simulating mock data and comparing to the observed data; this comparison in data space suffers from the curse of dimensionality and requires compression of the data to a small number of summary statistics to be tractable. In this paper, we use massive asymptotically optimal data compression to reduce the dimensionality of the data space to just one number per parameter, providing a natural and optimal framework for summary statistic choice for likelihood-free inference. Secondly, we present the first cosmological application of Density Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (delfi), which learns a parametrized model for joint distribution of data and parameters, yielding both the parameter posterior and the model evidence. This approach is conceptually simple, requires less tuning than traditional Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches to likelihood-free inference and can give high-fidelity posteriors from orders of magnitude fewer forward simulations. As an additional bonus, it enables parameter inference and Bayesian model comparison simultaneously. We demonstrate delfi with massive data compression on an analysis of the joint light-curve analysis supernova data, as a simple validation case study. We show that high-fidelity posterior inference is possible for full-scale cosmological data analyses with as few as ∼104 simulations, with substantial scope for further improvement, demonstrating the scalability of likelihood-free inference to large and complex cosmological data sets.},

While previous methods either relied on simplified surrogates of the likelihood function or attempted to learn to directly predict maximum likelihood estimates, we bring a novel simulation-based approach for full Bayesian inference based on a deep neural network surrogate of the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. Hand configurations are found by directly optimizing through the resulting amortized and differentiable expression for the posterior. The geometry of the configuration space is accounted for by proposing a Riemannian manifold optimization procedure through the neural posterior. Simulation and physical benchmarks demonstrate the high success rate of the procedure.},

	abstract = {Many scientific models are composed of multiple discrete components, and scien tists often make heuristic decisions about which components to include. Bayesian inference provides a mathematical framework for systematically selecting model components, but defining prior distributions over model components and developing associated inference schemes has been challenging. We approach this problem in an amortized simulation-based inference framework: We define implicit model priors over a fixed set of candidate components and train neural networks to infer joint probability distributions over both, model components and associated parameters from simulations. To represent distributions over model components, we introduce a conditional mixture of multivariate binary distributions in the Grassmann formalism. Our approach can be applied to any compositional stochastic simulator without requiring access to likelihood evaluations. We first illustrate our method on a simple time series model with redundant components and show that it can retrieve joint posterior distribution over a set of symbolic expressions and their parameters while accurately capturing redundancy with strongly correlated posteriors. We then apply our approach to drift-diffusion models, a commonly used model class in cognitive neuroscience. After validating the method on synthetic data, we show that our approach explains experimental data as well as previous methods, but that our fully probabilistic approach can help to discover multiple data-consistent model configurations, as well as reveal non-identifiable model components and parameters. Our method provides a powerful tool for data-driven scientific inquiry which will allow scientists to systematically identify essential model components and make uncertainty-informed modelling decisions.},

It is unclear how uncertainty should be modelled in systems using such representations. In this paper we discuss how bundles of symbols in certain Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) can be understood as defining an object that has a relationship to a probability distribution, and how statements in VSAs can be understood as being analogous to probabilistic statements. The aim of this paper is to show how (spiking) neural implementations of VSAs can be used to implement probabilistic operations that are useful in building cognitive models. We show how similarity operators between continuous values represented as Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs), an example of a technique known as fractional binding, induces a quasi-kernel function that can be used in density estimation. Further, we sketch novel designs for networks that compute entropy and mutual information of VSA-represented distributions and demonstrate their performance when implemented as networks of spiking neurons. We also discuss the relationship between our technique and quantum probability, another technique proposed for modelling uncertainty in cognition. While we restrict ourselves to operators proposed for Holographic Reduced Representations, and for representing real-valued data. We suggest that the methods presented in this paper should translate to any VSA where the dot product between fractionally bound symbols induces a valid kernel.},

	abstract = {Of the numerous neuropeptides identified in the central nervous system, only a few are involved in the control of sexual behaviour. Among these, the most studied are oxytocin, adrenocorticotropin, α-melanocyte stimulating hormone and opioid peptides. While opioid peptides inhibit sexual performance, the others facilitate sexual behaviour in most of the species studied so far (rats, mice, monkeys and humans). However, evidence for a sexual role of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, galanin and galanin-like peptide, cholecystokinin, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, vasopressin, angiotensin II, hypocretins/orexins and VGF-derived peptides are also available. Corticotropin releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, vasopressin and angiotensin II inhibit, while substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, hypocretins/orexins and some VGF-derived peptide facilitate sexual behaviour. Neuropeptides influence sexual behaviour by acting mainly in the hypothalamic nuclei (i.e., lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial nucleus, arcuate nucleus), in the medial preoptic area and in the spinal cord. However, it is often unclear whether neuropeptides influence the anticipatory phase (sexual arousal and/or motivation) or the consummatory phase (performance) of sexual behaviour, except in a few cases (e.g., opioid peptides and oxytocin). Unfortunately, scarce information has been added in the last 15 years on the neural mechanisms by which neuropeptides influence sexual behaviour, most studied neuropeptides apart. This may be due to a decreased interest of researchers on neuropeptides and sexual behaviour or on sexual behaviour in general. Such a decrease may be related to the discovery of orally effective, locally acting type V phosphodiesterase inhibitors for the therapy of erectile dysfunction.},

	abstract = {The neuropeptides vasopressin, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and beta-endorphin seem to have important effects on memory and learning. Animal studies attempting to demonstrate these effects are difficult to interpret because of the complexity of behavior that is described as "learning" and the impossibility of assessing verbal learning in animals. This article therefore reviews some of the animal literature on neuropeptides and learning, but focuses primarily upon studies in humans, both in normal volunteers and in patients with neurological disorders. Vasopressin enhances learning under some conditions. Intranasal administration has been associated with improvement on psychometric tests in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and Korsakoff's psychosis, although these findings are not uniform. It improves performance on memory tests in normal volunteers, but does not seem to improve the memory deficit after head trauma. Cerebrospinal fluid levels are low in patients with Alzheimer's disease. ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) are two peptides the primary behavioral effect of which seems to be on attention or goal-motivated behavior rather than on memory processes themselves. Visual discrimination and the ability to continue repetitive tasks are enhanced; in mentally retarded subjects, the administration of ACTH or MSH improves performance on a variety of neuropsychological tests. It does not, however, improve cognitive function in the elderly. Endogenous opioids including beta-endorphin and met-enkephalin seem to have primarily an amnesic effect in animal studies. Their role in human learning is still uncertain, although naloxone, which antagonizes their effects, has been associated with improved cognitive performance in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data underscore the complexity of the processes associated with human memory and the rudimentary state of our present knowledge. Whatever the mechanisms, however, vasopressin, ACTH, and endogenous opioids seem to have important effects upon memory.},

CNFs are efficient in sampling and inference, they can be trained with a likelihood-based objective, and CNFs, being generative flows, do not suffer from mode collapse or training instabilities.

Here we report the use of SciUnit, a software framework for model validation, to attempt to achieve these goals.

By exploiting the multilevel structure of the discretised parameters and discretised forward models, we design a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure to significantly reduce the computational effort in building the LIS and operating with DILI proposals. Second, the resulting DILI-MCMC can drastically improve the sampling efficiency of MCMC at each level, and hence reduce the integration error of the multilevel algorithm for fixed CPU time. Numerical results confirm the improved computational efficiency of the multilevel DILI approach.},

@book{ferrand_non-synaptic_2023,
	title = {Non-synaptic plasticity enables memory-dependent local learning},
	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is essential for memory formation and learning in the brain. In addition, recent results indicate that non-synaptic plasticity processes such as the regulation of neural membrane properties contribute to memory formation, its functional role in memory and learning has however remained elusive. Here, we propose that non-synaptic and synaptic plasticity are both essential components to enable memory-dependent processing in neuronal networks. While the former acts on a fast time scale for rapid information storage, the latter shapes network processing on a slower time scale to harness this memory as a functional component. We analyse this concept in a network model where pyramidal neurons regulate their apical trunk excitability in a Hebbian manner. We find that local synaptic plasticity rules can be derived for this model and show that the interplay between this synaptic plasticity and the non-synaptic trunk plasticity enables the model to successfully accommodate memory-dependent processing capabilities in a number of tasks, ranging from simple memory tests to question answering. The model can also explain contextual fear conditioning experiments, where freezing responses could be recovered by optogenetic reactivation of memory engrams under amnesia.

Author summary
How memory is organized in the brain in order to enable cognitive processing is a central open question in systems neuroscience. Traditionally, synaptic plasticity is considered the key mechanism for the establishment of memory in the brain. Recently however, this view has been questioned, and it was proposed that non-synaptic plasticity mechanisms play a more prominent role as previously considered. In this article, we propose that both, synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity are central components for the formation and utilization of memory in biological neuronal networks. Our results show that non-synaptic plasticity can act on a fast time-scale to store important information, while synaptic plasticity can adapt network function on a slow time scale in order to facilitate memory-dependent cognitive processing.},

In contrast to the binary classification framework, the current formulation of the multiclass version has an intrinsic and unknown bias term, making otherwise informative diagnostics unreliable. We propose a multiclass framework free from the bias inherent to NRE-B at optimum, leaving us in the position to run diagnostics that practitioners depend on. It also recovers NRE-A in one corner case and NRE-B in the limiting case. For fair comparison, we benchmark the behavior of all algorithms in both familiar and novel training regimes: when jointly drawn data is unlimited, when data is fixed but prior draws are unlimited, and in the commonplace fixed data and parameters setting. Our investigations reveal that the highest performing models are distant from the competitors (NRE-A, NRE-B) in hyperparameter space. We make a recommendation for hyperparameters distinct from the previous models. We suggest a bound on the mutual information as a performance metric for simulation-based inference methods, without the need for posterior samples, and provide experimental results.},

We achieve this by learning a flexible amortized estimator which approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio. We demonstrate that the learned ratio estimator can be embedded in {\textbackslash}textsc\{mcmc\} samplers to approximate likelihood-ratios between consecutive states in the Markov chain, allowing us to draw samples from the intractable posterior. Techniques are presented to improve the numerical stability and to measure the quality of an approximation.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of abnormal beta-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau). These proteinopathies disrupt neuronal activity, causing, among others, an excessive and hypersynchronous neuronal firing that promotes hyperexcitability and leads to brain network dysfunction and cognitive deficits. In this study, we used computational network modeling to build a causal inference framework to explain AD-related abnormal brain activity. We constructed personalized brain network models with a set of working points to enable maximum dynamical complexity for each brain. Structural brain topographies were combined, either with excitotoxicity, or postsynaptic depression, as two leading mechanisms of the Aβ and pTau on neuronal activity. By applying various levels of these putative mechanisms to the limbic regions that typically present, with the earliest and largest protein burden, we found that the excitotoxicity is sufficient and necessary to reproduce empirical biomarkers two biometrics associated with AD pathology: homotopic dysconnectivity and a decrease in limbic network dynamical fluidity. This observation was shown not only in the clinical groups (aMCI and AD), but also in healthy subjects that were virtually-diseased with excitotoxicity as these abnormal proteins can accumulate before the appearance of any cognitive changes. The same findings were independently confirmed by a mechanistic deep learning inference framework. Taken together, our results show the crucial role of protein burden-induced hyperexcitability in altering macroscopic brain network dynamics, and offer a mechanistic link between structural and functional biomarkers of cognitive dysfunction due to AD.},

Whether or not heterogeneity at the neural level plays a functional role remains unclear, and has been relatively little explored in models which are often highly homogeneous. We compared the performance of spiking neural networks trained to carry out tasks of real-world difficulty, with varying degrees of heterogeneity, and found that heterogeneity substantially improved task performance. Learning with heterogeneity was more stable and robust, particularly for tasks with a rich temporal structure. In addition, the distribution of neuronal parameters in the trained networks is similar to those observed experimentally. We suggest that the heterogeneity observed in the brain may be more than just the byproduct of noisy processes, but rather may serve an active and important role in allowing animals to learn in changing environments.},

Dendrites can integrate synaptic inputs in non-linear ways, provide the substrate for local protein synthesis and facilitate the orchestration of signaling pathways that regulate local synaptic plasticity. These capabilities allow them to act as a second layer of computation within the neuron and serve as the fundamental unit of plasticity. As such, dendrites are integral parts of the memory engram, namely the physical representation of memories in the brain and are increasingly studied during learning tasks. Here, we review experimental and computational studies that support a novel, dendritic view of the memory engram that is centered on non-linear dendritic branches as elementary memory units. We highlight the potential implications of dendritic engrams for the learning and memory field and discuss future research directions.},

	abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is essential for memory formation and learning in the brain. In addition, recent results indicate that non-synaptic plasticity processes such as the regulation of neural membrane properties contribute to memory formation, its functional role in memory and learning has however remained elusive. Here, we propose that non-synaptic and synaptic plasticity are both essential components to enable memory-dependent processing in neuronal networks. While the former acts on a fast time scale for rapid information storage, the latter shapes network processing on a slower time scale to harness this memory as a functional component. We analyse this concept in a network model where pyramidal neurons regulate their apical trunk excitability in a Hebbian manner. We find that local synaptic plasticity rules can be derived for this model and show that the interplay between this synaptic plasticity and the non-synaptic trunk plasticity enables the model to successfully accommodate memory-dependent processing capabilities in a number of tasks, ranging from simple memory tests to question answering. The model can also explain contextual fear conditioning experiments, where freezing responses could be recovered by optogenetic reactivation of memory engrams under amnesia.
Author summary How memory is organized in the brain in order to enable cognitive processing is a central open question in systems neuroscience. Traditionally, synaptic plasticity is considered the key mechanism for the establishment of memory in the brain. Recently however, this view has been questioned, and it was proposed that non-synaptic plasticity mechanisms play a more prominent role as previously considered. In this article, we propose that both, synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity are central components for the formation and utilization of memory in biological neuronal networks. Our results show that non-synaptic plasticity can act on a fast time-scale to store important information, while synaptic plasticity can adapt network function on a slow time scale in order to facilitate memory-dependent cognitive processing.},

They can be used to estimate joint probability distributions and the corresponding marginal distributions where some variables are unspecified and, of particular interest, can represent distributions over composite objects like sets and graphs. GFlowNets amortize the work typically done by computationally expensive MCMC methods in a single but trained generative pass. They could also be used to estimate partition functions and free energies, conditional probabilities of supersets (supergraphs) given a subset (subgraph), as well as marginal distributions over all supersets (supergraphs) of a given set (graph).

Our method is scalable in parameters and data features and can rapidly analyze new data after initial training.

This approach, however, leads to time latency and can be power consuming. Here we report computational event-driven vision sensors that capture and directly convert dynamic motion into programmable, sparse and informative spiking signals. The sensors can be used to form a spiking neural network for motion recognition. Each individual vision sensor consists of two parallel photodiodes with opposite polarities and has a temporal resolution of 5 μs. In response to changes in light intensity, the sensors generate spiking signals with different amplitudes and polarities by electrically programming their individual photoresponsivity. The non-volatile and multilevel photoresponsivity of the vision sensors can emulate synaptic weights and can be used to create an in-sensor spiking neural network. Our computational event-driven vision sensor approach eliminates redundant data during the sensing process, as well as the need for data transfer between sensors and computation units.},

	abstract = {Family poverty has been associated with altered brain structure, function, and connectivity in youth. However, few studies have examined how disadvantage within the broader neighborhood may influence functional brain network organization. The present study leveraged a longitudinal community sample of 538 twins living in low-income neighborhoods to evaluate the prospective association between exposure to neighborhood poverty during childhood (6–10 y) with functional network architecture during adolescence (8–19 y). Using resting-state and task-based fMRI, we generated two latent measures that captured intrinsic brain organization across the whole-brain and network levels – network segregation and network segregation-integration balance. While age was positively associated with network segregation and network balance overall across the sample, these associations were moderated by exposure to neighborhood poverty. Specifically, these positive associations were observed only in youth from more, but not less, disadvantaged neighborhoods. Moreover, greater exposure to neighborhood poverty predicted reduced network segregation and network balance in early, but not middle or late, adolescence. These effects were detected both across the whole-brain system as well as specific functional networks, including fronto-parietal, default mode, salience, and subcortical systems. These findings indicate that where children live may exert long-reaching effects on the organization and development of the adolescent brain.},

	abstract = {Multiscale modeling by means of co-simulation is a powerful tool to address many vital questions in neuroscience. It can for example be applied in the study of the process of learning and memory formation in the brain. At the same time the co-simulation technique makes it possible to take advantage of interoperability between existing tools and multi-physics models as well as distributed computing. However, the theoretical basis for multiscale modeling is not sufficiently understood. There is, for example, a need of efficient and accurate numerical methods for time integration. When time constants of model components are different by several orders of magnitude, individual dynamics and mathematical definitions of each component all together impose stability, accuracy and efficiency challenges for the time integrator. Following our numerical investigations in Brocke et al. (Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience, 10, 97, 2016), we present a new multirate algorithm that allows us to handle each component of a large system with a step size appropriate to its time scale. We take care of error estimates in a recursive manner allowing individual components to follow their discretization time course while keeping numerical error within acceptable bounds. The method is developed with an ultimate goal of minimizing the communication between the components. Thus it is especially suitable for co-simulations. Our preliminary results support our confidence that the multirate approach can be used in the class of problems we are interested in. We show that the dynamics ofa communication signal as well as an appropriate choice of the discretization order between system components may have a significant impact on the accuracy of the coupled simulation. Although, the ideas presented in the paper have only been tested on a single model, it is likely that they can be applied to other problems without loss of generality. We believe that this work may significantly contribute to the establishment of a firm theoretical basis and to the development of an efficient computational framework for multiscale modeling and simulations.},

	abstract = {Global neural dynamics emerge from multi-scale brain structures, with neurons communicating through synapses to form transiently communicating networks. Network activity arises from intercellular communication that depends on the structure of connectome tracts and local connection, intracellular signalling cascades, and the extracellular molecular milieu that regulate cellular properties. Multi-scale models of brain function have begun to directly link the emergence of global brain dynamics in conscious and unconscious brain states to microscopic changes at the level of cells. In particular, AdEx mean-field models representing statistical properties of local populations of neurons have been connected following human tractography data to represent multi-scale neural phenomena in simulations using The Virtual Brain (TVB). While mean-field models can be run on personal computers for short simulations, or in parallel on high-performance computing (HPC) architectures for longer simulations and parameter scans, the computational burden remains high and vast areas of the parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we report that our TVB-HPC framework, a modular set of methods used here to implement the TVB-AdEx model for GPU and analyze emergent dynamics, notably accelerates simulations and substantially reduces computational resource requirements. The framework preserves the stability and robustness of the TVB-AdEx model, thus facilitating finer resolution exploration of vast parameter spaces as well as longer simulations previously near impossible to perform. Given that simulation and analysis toolkits are made public as open-source packages, our framework serves as a template onto which other models can be easily scripted and personalized datasets can be used for studies of inter-individual variability of parameters related to functional brain dynamics.},

	abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

	abstract = {Most neurons have large numbers of voltage- and time-dependent currents that contribute to their electrical firing patterns. Because these currents are nonlinear, it can be difficult to determine the role each current plays in determining how a neuron fires. The lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion of decapod crustaceans has been studied extensively biophysically. We constructed ∼600,000 versions of a four-compartment model of the LP neuron and distributed 11 different currents into the compartments. From these, we selected ∼1300 models that match well the electrophysiological properties of the biological neuron. Interestingly, correlations that were seen in the expression of channel mRNA in biological studies were not found across the ∼1300 admissible LP neuron models, suggesting that the electrical phenotype does not require these correlations. We used cubic fits of the function from maximal conductances to a series of electrophysiological properties to ask which conductances predominantly influence input conductance, resting membrane potential, resting spike rate, phasing of activity in response to rhythmic inhibition, and several other properties. In all cases, multiple conductances contribute to the measured property, and the combinations of currents that strongly influence each property differ. These methods can be used to understand how multiple currents in any candidate neuron interact to determine the cell's electrophysiological behavior.},

Predominantly, the likelihood function is only implicitly established by a simulator posing the need for simulation-based inference (SBI). However, the existing algorithms can yield overconfident posteriors (Hermans *et al.*, 2022) defeating the whole purpose of credibility if the uncertainty quantification is inaccurate. We propose to include a calibration term directly into the training objective of the neural model in selected amortized SBI techniques. By introducing a relaxation of the classical formulation of calibration error we enable end-to-end backpropagation. The proposed method is not tied to any particular neural model and brings moderate computational overhead compared to the profits it introduces. It is directly applicable to existing computational pipelines allowing reliable black-box posterior inference. We empirically show on six benchmark problems that the proposed method achieves competitive or better results in terms of coverage and expected posterior density than the previously existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Science makes extensive use of simulations to model the world. Statistical inference identifies which models are consistent with observed phenomena, thus bridging the gap between theory and reality. However, conventional statistical inference is often inapplicable to detailed simulation models because their associated likelihood functions are intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) addresses this problem: It allows statistical inference from simulations alone and can thus be used with implicit models, which lack evaluable likelihoods. This thesis consists of four publications that draw on advances in machine learning to contribute to the transition away from heuristic approaches towards principled statistical inference with SBI, which allows to identify data-consistent models. To this end, this thesis proposes new algorithms, applications to neuroscience, and the first unified benchmark for SBI. Overall, it shows the potential for fast and flexible likelihood-free algorithms to facilitate scientific discovery in neuroscience and beyond.  
 
The trade-off between models of neural dynamics that are statistically amenable or mechanistically plausible was the starting point for the work presented in this thesis. In the first publication, we introduce an SBI algorithm for sequential neural posterior estimation, which overcomes the drawbacks of an earlier method. We provide several extensions motivated by challenging problems in neuroscience, including end-to-end learning of summary statistics for high-dimensional time series data. In the second publication, we demonstrate its broad applicability to mechanistic models in neuroscience—from the scale of ion channels, which are the basic building blocks of biophysical neuron models, to network models of neural dynamics. Our approach overcomes the limitations of heuristic alternatives and narrows the divide between statistical and mechanistic models. The third publication proposes a novel SBI algorithm that proceeds by learning an emulator of the simulator. This approach enables the use of active learning schemes to adaptively acquire new simulations, which allows scaling to problems that are computationally highly expensive. With rapid progress in SBI, the need for a unified benchmark became apparent: In the fourth publication, we propose the first benchmark for the field to transparently evaluate progress and to contribute to more efficient and reproducible science.},

	abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) performs statistical inference for otherwise intractable probability models by accepting parameter proposals when corresponding simulated datasets are sufficiently close to the observations. Producing the large quantity of simulations needed requires considerable computing time. However, it is often clear before a simulation ends that it is unpromising: it is likely to produce a poor match or require excessive time. This paper proposes lazy ABC, an ABC importance sampling algorithm which saves time by sometimes abandoning such simulations. This makes ABC more scalable to applications where simulation is expensive. By using a random stopping rule and appropriate reweighting step, the target distribution is unchanged from that of standard ABC. Theory and practical methods to tune lazy ABC are presented and illustrated on a simple epidemic model example. They are also demonstrated on the computationally demanding spatial extremes application of Erhardt and Smith (Comput Stat Data Anal 56:1468–1481, 2012), producing efficiency gains, in terms of effective sample size per unit CPU time, of roughly 3 times for a 20 location dataset, and 8 times for 35 locations.},

Likelihood-free parameter inference methods, such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), build Monte Carlo samples of the uncertain parameter distribution by comparing the data with large numbers of model simulations. However, the computational expense of generating these simulations forms a significant bottleneck in the practical application of such methods. We identify how simulations of corresponding cheap, low-fidelity models have been used separately in two complementary ways to reduce the computational expense of building these samples, at the cost of introducing additional variance to the resulting parameter estimates. We explore how these approaches can be unified so that cost and benefit are optimally balanced, and we characterize the optimal choice of how often to simulate from cheap, low-fidelity models in place of expensive, high-fidelity models in Monte Carlo ABC algorithms. The resulting early accept/reject multifidelity ABC algorithm that we propose is shown to give improved performance over existing multifidelity and high-fidelity approaches.},

We show that for most of the populations in our sample this model fits the data far better than a model with no growth. We estimate the demographic parameters of this model for each population and also the time to the most recent common ancestor. Since there is some uncertainty about the details of the microsatellite mutation process, we consider several plausible mutation schemes and estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously with the demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled with a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations, suggests either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral population, or natural selection acting on the Y chromosome.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Dynamical systems theory provides a powerful mathematical toolbox for analysing neurobiological processes and has been a mainstay of computational neuroscience for decades. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become a popular machine learning tool for studying the non-linear dynamics of neural and behavioural processes by emulating an underlying system of differential equations. RNNs have been routinely trained on similar behavioural tasks to those used for animal subjects to generate hypotheses about the underlying computational mechanisms. By contrast, RNNs can also be trained on the measured physiological and behavioural data, thereby directly inheriting their temporal and geometrical properties. In this way they become a formal surrogate for the experimentally probed system that can be further analysed, perturbed and simulated. This powerful approach is called dynamical system reconstruction. In this Perspective, we focus on recent trends in artificial intelligence and machine learning in this exciting and rapidly expanding field, which may be less well known in neuroscience. We discuss formal prerequisites, different model architectures and training approaches for RNN-based dynamical system reconstructions, ways to evaluate and validate model performance, how to interpret trained models in a neuroscience context, and current challenges.},
