	abstract = {Animals search for foods and decide their behaviors according to previous experience. Caenorhabditis elegans detects chemicals with a limited number of sensory neurons, allowing us to dissect roles of each neuron for innate and learned behaviors. C. elegans is attracted to salt after exposure to the salt (NaCl) with food. In contrast, it learns to avoid the salt after exposure to the salt without food. In salt-attraction behavior, it is known that the ASE taste sensory neurons (ASEL and ASER) play a major role. However, little is known about mechanisms for learned salt avoidance. Here, through dissecting contributions of ASE neurons for salt chemotaxis, we show that both ASEL and ASER generate salt chemotaxis plasticity. In ASER, we have previously shown that the insulin/PI 3-kinase signaling acts for starvation-induced salt chemotaxis plasticity. This study shows that the PI 3-kinase signaling promotes aversive drive of ASER but not of ASEL. Furthermore, the Gq signaling pathway composed of GqÎ± EGL-30, diacylglycerol, and nPKC (novel protein kinase C) TTX-4 promotes attractive drive of ASER but not of ASEL. A putative salt receptor GCY-22 guanylyl cyclase is required in ASER for both salt attraction and avoidance. Our results suggest that ASEL and ASER use distinct molecular mechanisms to regulate salt chemotaxis plasticity.},

	abstract = {We propose a new method for approximate Bayesian statistical inference on the basis of summary statistics. The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

	abstract = {Aided by advances in neural density estimation, considerable progress has been made in recent years towards a suite of simulation-based inference (SBI) methods capable of performing flexible, black-box, approximate Bayesian inference for stochastic simulation models. While it has been demonstrated that neural SBI methods can provide accurate posterior approximations, the simulation studies establishing these results have considered only well-specified problems -- that is, where the model and the data generating process coincide exactly. However, the behaviour of such algorithms in the case of model misspecification has received little attention. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study of the behaviour of neural SBI algorithms in the presence of various forms of model misspecification. We find that misspecification can have a profoundly deleterious effect on performance. Some mitigation strategies are explored, but no approach tested prevents failure in all cases. We conclude that new approaches are required to address model misspecification if neural SBI algorithms are to be relied upon to derive accurate scientific conclusions.},

	abstract = {Stochastic reaction network models are often used to explain and predict the dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. These models usually involve several parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are not directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian inference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these parameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their uncertainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods based on classical Metropolis-Hastings algorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which in turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation (CME). We propose an alternate approach based on a multifidelity extension of the Sequential Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sampler. This algorithm is built upon Sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian inference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved subproblems that gradually increase both model fidelity and the influence of the observed data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a well-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate master equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the appropriate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criteria that seeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior from each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias. This novel sampling scheme is tested with high performance computing resources using biologically relevant problems.},

Analyses and design of such systems are governed by data collected from the field and/or laboratory experiments. This challenging scenario is further worsened when data-collection is expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multi-fidelity physics informed deep neural network (MF-PIDNN). The framework proposed is particularly suitable when the physics of the problem is known in an approximate sense (low-fidelity physics) and only a few high-fidelity data are available. MF-PIDNN blends physics informed and data-driven deep learning techniques by using the concept of transfer learning. The approximate governing equation is first used to train a low-fidelity physics informed deep neural network. This is followed by transfer learning where the low-fidelity model is updated by using the available high-fidelity data. MF-PIDNN is able to encode useful information on the physics of the problem from the approximate governing differential equation and hence, provides accurate prediction even in zones with no data. Additionally, no low-fidelity data is required for training this model. Two examples involving function approximations with linear and nonlinear correlation are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of transfer learning in solving multi-fidelity problems. Applicability and utility of MF-PIDNN are illustrated in solving four benchmark reliability analysis problems. Case studies presented illustrate interesting features of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Carbon sequestration is a promising technique to minimize the emission of CO2 to the atmosphere. However, the computational time required for CO2 forecasting using commercial numerical simulators can be prohibitive for complex problems. In this work, we propose the use of transfer learning to rapidly forecast the CO2 pressure plume and saturation distribution under uncertain geological and operational conditions, specifically for variations in injector locations and injector rates. We first train a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)-based machine learning (ML) model on a limited set of simple scenarios. Then, we use transfer learning to fine-tune the FNO model on a larger set of complex scenarios. Most importantly, the CMG forecasting time for one scenario requires approximately 40 to 50 minutes, which was drastically reduced to 12 seconds by using Fourier Neural Operator and then reduced further to 8 seconds by implementing transfer learning on the Fourier neural operator. The mean relative errors of the neural operator predictions of pressure and saturation were 1.42\% and 7.9\%, respectively. These errors get slightly higher when transfer learning is implemented on neural operator to learn complex task with less amount of data and low training time. Our results show that transfer learning can significantly reduce the computational time required for CO2 forecasting. The data generation and model training times were reduced by 50\% and 75\%, respectively, by using transfer learning on the Fourier neural operator. Additionally, the total number of trainable parameters was reduced by 99.9\%. Our results demonstrate the potential of transfer learning for rapid forecasting of CO2 pressure plume and saturation distribution. This technique can be used to improve the efficiency of CO2 forecasting and to help mitigate the risks associated with CO2 leakage.},

These methods typically require large amounts of training in order to learn a single class of manipulations. We present Transflow Learning, a method for transforming a pre-trained generative model so that its outputs more closely resemble data that we provide afterwards. In contrast to previous methods, Transflow Learning does not require any training at all, and instead warps the probability distribution from which we sample latent vectors using Bayesian inference.

	abstract = {Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables amortized Bayesian inference for simulators with implicit likelihoods. But when we are primarily interested in the quality of predictive simulations, or when the model cannot exactly reproduce the observed data (i.e., is misspecified), targeting the Bayesian posterior may be overly restrictive. Generalized Bayesian Inference (GBI) aims to robustify inference for (misspecified) simulator models, replacing the likelihood-function with a cost function that evaluates the goodness of parameters relative to data. However, GBI methods generally require running multiple simulations to estimate the cost function at each parameter value during inference, making the approach computationally infeasible for even moderately complex simulators. Here, we propose amortized cost estimation (ACE) for GBI to address this challenge: We train a neural network to approximate the cost function, which we define as the expected distance between simulations produced by a parameter and observed data. The trained network can then be used with MCMC to infer GBI posteriors for any observation without running additional simulations. We show that, on several benchmark tasks, ACE accurately predicts cost and provides predictive simulations that are closer to synthetic observations than other SBI methods, especially for misspecified simulators. Finally, we apply ACE to infer parameters of the Hodgkin-Huxley model given real intracellular recordings from the Allen Cell Types Database. ACE identifies better data-matching parameters while being an order of magnitude more simulation-efficient than a standard SBI method. In summary, ACE combines the strengths of SBI methods and GBI to perform robust and simulation-amortized inference for scientific simulators.},

Image classification is one of the core problems in Computer Vision field with a large variety of practical applications.

A common problem arises when the expected transfer does not take place, what has been referred to as the inert knowledge problem. More than an academic inconvenience, the failure to transfer is a major problem, exacting individual and social costs. In this article, I trace the evolution of research on the transfer of learning, in general, and on language learning, in particular. Then, a different view of learning transfer is advanced. Rather than learners being seen to âexportâ what they have learned from one situation to the next, it is proposed that learners transform their learning. The article concludes by offering some suggestions for how to mitigate the inert knowledge problem from this perspective.},

	abstract = {Deep Neural Network (DNN) is widely used in engineering applications for its ability to handle problems with almost any nonlinearities. However, it is generally difficult to obtain sufficient high-fidelity (HF) sample points for expensive optimization tasks, which may affect the generalization performance of DNN and result in inaccurate predictions. To solve this problem and improve the prediction accuracy of DNN, this paper proposes an on-line transfer learning based multi-fidelity data fusion (OTL-MFDF) method including two parts. In the first part, the ensemble of DNNs is established. Firstly, a large number of low-fidelity sample points and a few HF sample points are generated, which are used as the source dataset and target dataset, respectively. Then, the Bayesian Optimization (BO) is utilized to obtain several groups of hyperparameters, based on which DNNs are pre-trained using the source dataset. Next, these pre-trained DNNs are re-trained by fine-tuning on the target dataset, and the ensemble of DNNs is established by assigning different weights to each pre-trained DNN. In the second part, the on-line learning system is developed for adaptive updating of the ensemble of DNNs. To evaluate the uncertainty error of the predicted values of DNN and determine the location of the updated HF sample point, the query-by-committee strategy based on the ensemble of DNNs is developed. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies is employed as the optimizer to find out the location where the maximal disagreement is achieved by the ensemble of DNNs. The design space is partitioned by the Voronoi diagram method, and then the selected point is moved to its nearest Voronoi cell boundary to avoid clustering between the updated point and the existing sample points. Three different types of test problems and an engineering example are adopted to illustrate the effectiveness of the OTL-MFDF method. Results verify the outstanding efficiency, global prediction accuracy and applicability of the OTL-MFDF method.},

We set out to fill this gap: We provide a benchmark with inference tasks and suitable performance metrics, with an initial selection of algorithms including recent approaches employing neural networks and classical Approximate Bayesian Computation methods. We found that the choice of performance metric is critical, that even state-of-the-art algorithms have substantial room for improvement, and that sequential estimation improves sample efficiency. Neural network-based approaches generally exhibit better performance, but there is no uniformly best algorithm. We provide practical advice and highlight the potential of the benchmark to diagnose problems and improve algorithms. The results can be explored interactively on a companion website.

	abstract = {Mechanistic models of single-neuron dynamics have been extensively studied in computational neuroscience. However, identifying which models can quantitatively reproduce empirically measured data has been challenging. We propose to overcome this limitation by using likelihood-free inference approaches (also known as Approximate Bayesian Computation, ABC) to perform full Bayesian inference on single-neuron models. Our approach builds on recent advances in ABC by learning a neural network which maps features of the observed data to the posterior distribution over parameters. We learn a Bayesian mixture-density network approximating the posterior over multiple rounds of adaptively chosen simulations. Furthermore, we propose an efficient approach for handling missing features and parameter settings for which the simulator fails, as well as a strategy for automatically learning relevant features using recurrent neural networks. On synthetic data, our approach efficiently estimates posterior distributions and recovers ground-truth parameters. On in-vitro recordings of membrane voltages, we recover multivariate posteriors over biophysical parameters, which yield model-predicted voltage traces that accurately match empirical data. Our approach will enable neuroscientists to perform Bayesian inference on complex neuron models without having to design model-specific algorithms, closing the gap between mechanistic and statistical approaches to single-neuron modelling.},

More broadly, we show that our Riemannian regression framework encompasses existing multifidelity covariance estimators constructed from control variates. We demonstrate via numerical examples that the MRMF estimator can provide significant decreases, up to one order of magnitude, in squared estimation error relative to both single-fidelity and other multifidelity covariance estimators. Furthermore, preservation of positive definiteness ensures that our estimator is compatible with downstream tasks, such as data assimilation and metric learning, in which this property is essential.},

Existing acceleration methods typically exploit a multilevel hierarchy of surrogate models that follow a known rate of error decay and computational costs; however, a general collection of surrogate models, which may include projection-based reduced models, data-fit models, support vector machines, and simplified-physics models, does not necessarily give rise to such a hierarchy. Our multifidelity approach provides a framework to combine an arbitrary number of surrogate models of any type. Instead of relying on error and cost rates, an optimization problem balances the number of model evaluations across the high-fidelity and surrogate models with respect to error and costs. We show that a unique analytic solution of the model management optimization problem exists under mild conditions on the models. Our multifidelity method makes occasional recourse to the high-fidelity model; in doing so it provides an unbiased estimator of the statistics of the high-fidelity model, even in the absence of error bounds and error estimators for the surrogate models. Numerical experiments with linear and nonlinear examples show that speedups by orders of magnitude are obtained compared to Monte Carlo estimation that invokes a single model only.},

These algorithms characteristically rely heavily on repeated model simulations. However, whenever the computational cost of simulation is even moderately expensive, the significant burden incurred by likelihood-free algorithms leaves them infeasible for many practical applications. The multifidelity approach has been introduced in the context of approximate Bayesian computation to reduce the simulation burden of likelihood-free inference without loss of accuracy, by using the information provided by simulating computationally cheap, approximate models in place of the model of interest. In this work we demonstrate that multifidelity techniques can be applied in the general likelihood-free Bayesian inference setting. Analytical results on the optimal allocation of computational resources to simulations at different levels of fidelity are derived, and subsequently implemented practically. We provide an adaptive multifidelity likelihood-free inference algorithm that learns the relationships between models at different fidelities and adapts resource allocation accordingly, and demonstrate that this algorithm produces posterior estimates with near-optimal efficiency.},

We explore how these approaches can be unified so that cost and benefit are optimally balanced, and we characterize the optimal choice of how often to simulate from cheap, low-fidelity models in place of expensive, high-fidelity models in Monte Carlo ABC algorithms.

	abstract = {We use variation at a set of eight human Y chromosome microsatellite loci to investigate the demographic history of the Y chromosome. Instead of assuming a population of constant size, as in most of the previous work on the Y chromosome, we consider a model which permits a period of recent population growth. We show that for most of the populations in our sample this model fits the data far better than a model with no growth. We estimate the demographic parameters of this model for each population and also the time to the most recent common ancestor. Since there is some uncertainty about the details of the microsatellite mutation process, we consider several plausible mutation schemes and estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously with the demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled with a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations, suggests either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral population, or natural selection acting on the Y chromosome.},

In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit RungeâKutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reactionâdiffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in probabilistic deep learning enable efficient amortized Bayesian inference in settings where the likelihood function is only implicitly defined by a simulation program (simulation-based inference; SBI). But how faithful is such inference if the simulation represents reality somewhat inaccurately, that is, if the true system behavior at test time deviates from the one seen during training? We conceptualize the types of such model misspecification arising in SBI and systematically investigate how the performance of neural posterior approximators gradually deteriorates as a consequence, making inference results less and less trustworthy. To notify users about this problem, we propose a new misspecification measure that can be trained in an unsupervised fashion (i.e., without training data from the true distribution) and reliably detects model misspecification at test time. Our experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of our new measure both on toy examples with an analytical ground-truth and on representative scientific tasks in cell biology, cognitive decision making, disease outbreak dynamics, and computer vision. We show how the proposed misspecification test warns users about suspicious outputs, raises an alarm when predictions are not trustworthy, and guides model designers in their search for better simulators.},

The methods take advantage of prior knowledge of population demography, in addition to the molecular data. While some theoretical results are presented, a central focus is on computational methods. These methods are easy to implement, and, since explicit formulae tend to be either unavailable or unilluminating, they are also more useful and more informative in most applications. Extensions are presented that allow for the effects of uncertainty in our knowledge of population size and mutation rates, for variability in population sizes, for regions of different mutation rate, and for inference concerning the coalescence time of the entire population. The methods are illustrated using recent data from the human Y chromosome.},

Unfortunately, the FSP approach is highly computationally intensive for all but the simplest models, an issue that is highly problematic when parameter inference and uncertainty quantification takes enormous numbers of parameter evaluations. To address this issue, we propose two new computational methods for the Bayesian inference of stochastic gene expression parameters given single-cell experiments. We formulate and verify an adaptive delayed acceptance Metropolis-Hastings (ADAMH) algorithm to utilize with reduced Krylov-basis projections of the FSP. We then introduce an extension of the ADAMH into a hybrid scheme that consists of an initial phase to construct a reduced model and a faster second phase to sample from the approximate posterior distribution determined by the constructed model. We test and compare both algorithms to an adaptive Metropolis algorithm with full FSP-based likelihood evaluations on three example models and simulated data to show that the new ADAMH variants achieve substantial speedup in comparison to the full FSP approach. By reducing the computational costs of parameter estimation, we expect the ADAMH approach to enable efficient data-driven estimation for more complex gene regulation models.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2410.12690},
	abstract = {A critical bottleneck for scientific progress is the costly nature of computer simulations for complex systems. Surrogate models provide an appealing solution: such models are trained on simulator evaluations, then used to emulate and quantify uncertainty on the expensive simulator at unexplored inputs. In many applications, one often has available data on related systems. For example, in designing a new jet turbine, there may be existing studies on turbines with similar configurations. A key question is how information from such "source" systems can be transferred for effective surrogate training on the "target" system of interest. We thus propose a new LOcal transfer Learning Gaussian Process (LOL-GP) model, which leverages a carefully-designed Gaussian process to transfer such information for surrogate modeling. The key novelty of the LOL-GP is a latent regularization model, which identifies regions where transfer should be performed and regions where it should be avoided. This "local transfer" property is desirable in scientific systems: at certain parameters, such systems may behave similarly and thus transfer is beneficial; at other parameters, they may behave differently and thus transfer is detrimental. By accounting for local transfer, the LOL-GP can rectify a critical limitation of "negative transfer" in existing transfer learning models, where the transfer of information worsens predictive performance. We derive a Gibbs sampling algorithm for efficient posterior predictive sampling on the LOL-GP, for both the multi-source and multi-fidelity transfer settings. We then show, via a suite of numerical experiments and an application for jet turbine design, the improved surrogate performance of the LOL-GP over existing methods.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations have proven a valuable tool for understanding complex phenomena across the sciences. However, the utility of simulators for modelling and forecasting purposes is often restricted by low data quality, as well as practical limits to model fidelity. In order to circumvent these difficulties, we argue that modellers must treat simulators as idealistic representations of the true data generating process, and consequently should thoughtfully consider the risk of model misspecification. In this work we revisit neural posterior estimation (NPE), a class of algorithms that enable black-box parameter inference in simulation models, and consider the implication of a simulation-to-reality gap. While recent works have demonstrated reliable performance of these methods, the analyses have been performed using synthetic data generated by the simulator model itself, and have therefore only addressed the well-specified case. In this paper, we find that the presence of misspecification, in contrast, leads to unreliable inference when NPE is used naively. As a remedy we argue that principled scientific inquiry with simulators should incorporate a model criticism component, to facilitate interpretable identification of misspecification and a robust inference component, to fit 'wrong but useful' models. We propose robust neural posterior estimation (RNPE), an extension of NPE to simultaneously achieve both these aims, through explicitly modelling the discrepancies between simulations and the observed data. We assess the approach on a range of artificially misspecified examples, and find RNPE performs well across the tasks, whereas naively using NPE leads to misleading and erratic posteriors.},

This work introduces robust posterior estimation (ROPE), a framework that overcomes model misspecification with a small real-world calibration set of ground truth parameter measurements. We formalize the misspecification gap as the solution of an optimal transport problem between learned representations of real-world and simulated observations. Assuming the prior distribution over the parameters of interest is known and well-specified, our method offers a controllable balance between calibrated uncertainty and informative inference under all possible misspecifications of the simulator. Our empirical results on four synthetic tasks and two real-world problems demonstrate that ROPE outperforms baselines and consistently returns informative and calibrated credible intervals.},

	abstract = {Multifidelity uncertainty quantification (MF UQ) sampling approaches have been shown to significantly reduce the variance of statistical estimators while preserving the bias of the highest-fidelity model, provided that the low-fidelity models are well correlated. However, maintaining a high level of correlation can be challenging, especially when models depend on different input uncertain parameters, which drastically reduces the correlation. Existing MF UQ approaches do not adequately address this issue. In this work, we propose a new sampling strategy that exploits a shared space to improve the correlation among models with dissimilar parametrization. We achieve this by transforming the original coordinates onto an auxiliary manifold using the adaptive basis (AB) method{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{Tipireddy2014\}. The AB method has two main benefits: (1) it provides an effective tool to identify the low-dimensional manifold on which each model can be represented, and (2) it enables easy transformation of polynomial chaos representations from high- to low-dimensional spaces. This latter feature is used to identify a shared manifold among models without requiring additional evaluations. We present two algorithmic flavors of the new estimator to cover different analysis scenarios, including those with legacy and non-legacy high-fidelity data. We provide numerical results for analytical examples, a direct field acoustic test, and a finite element model of a nuclear fuel assembly. For all examples, we compare the proposed strategy against both single-fidelity and MF estimators based on the original model parametrization.},
