\begin{abstract}
This work addresses the task of generalized class discovery (GCD) in instance segmentation. The goal is to discover novel classes and obtain a model capable of segmenting instances of both known and novel categories, given labeled and unlabeled data. Since the real world contains numerous objects with long-tailed distributions, the instance distribution for each class is inherently imbalanced. To address the imbalanced distributions, we propose an instance-wise temperature assignment (ITA) method for contrastive learning and class-wise reliability criteria for pseudo-labels. The ITA method relaxes instance discrimination for samples belonging to head classes to enhance GCD. The reliability criteria are to avoid excluding most pseudo-labels for tail classes when training an instance segmentation network using pseudo-labels from GCD. Additionally, we propose dynamically adjusting the criteria to leverage diverse samples in the early stages while relying only on reliable pseudo-labels in the later stages. We also introduce an efficient soft attention module to encode object-specific representations for GCD. Finally, we evaluate our proposed method by conducting experiments on two settings: COCO$_{half}$ + LVIS and LVIS + Visual Genome. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

\section{Conclusion}
Towards open-world instance segmentation, we present a novel GCD method in instance segmentation. To address the imbalanced distribution of instances, we introduce the instance-wise temperature assignment method as well as class-wise and dynamic reliability criteria. The former aims to improve the embedding space for class discovery, and the criteria are designed to effectively utilize pseudo-labels from the GCD model. Additionally, we propose an efficient soft attention module. The experimental results in two settings demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods by effectively discovering novel classes and segmenting instances of both known and novel categories.

Regarding limitations, this work assumes the full availability of labeled and unlabeled datasets from the beginning. Thus, it is suboptimal for scenarios where data is provided sequentially, such as in robot navigation. Additionally, we assume prior knowledge of the total number of classes, following most previous works.
