\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, tasks requiring both syntactic and semantic correctness, such as code generation and symbolic math reasoning, benefit significantly from constrained decoding strategies. However, strict enforcement of constraints can hinder LLM reasoning capabilities. Theoretically, we demonstrate why restrictive grammars diminish reasoning and show that augmenting grammars with carefully designed rules preserves reasoning while maintaining correctness. Building on these insights, our proposed reasoning-augmented constrained decoding algorithm, \Tool{}, achieves state-of-the-art performance, with up to \upto{} improvement on symbolic reasoning benchmarks such as GSM-symbolic and FOLIO, effectively balancing the strengths of constrained and unconstrained generation.
