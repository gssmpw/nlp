\section{Related Work}
We have already seen the connection between robust sorting and the Feedback Vertex Set in Tournaments (FVST) problem~\cite{fvst,mnich16}. Another problem related to the FVST problem is the Feedback Arc Set in Tournaments (FAST) problem~\cite{acn08,ms07}, where the goal is to find an ordering of the nodes of a given tournament such that the number of edges going backward (an edge is said to go backward if it is directed from a node that comes later to a node that comes earlier as per the ordering) is minimized. This is the restricted variant of the maximum acyclic subgraph problem \cite{fk99}, where the goal is to find the maximum subset of edges that induces a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a directed graph. The FAST problem may be seen as robust sorting under adversarial corruption of edges rather than adversarial corruption of nodes, as in our formulation. The FVST and FAST problems are known to the $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. A 2-approximation, which is tight under UGC, is known~\cite{fvst} for the FVST problem, and a PTAS is known~\cite{ms07} for the FAST problem. 

Several works have been done on sorting in the presence of a noisy comparison operator, also called noisy sorting. Feige et al.~\cite{FRPU94} consider a noise model in which the comparison operator gives the correct answer independently with probability at least $(1/2 + \gamma)$ each time a query is made on an element pair. This can be regarded as {\em noisy sorting with resampling} since we can get the correct answer for a pair by repeatedly querying the operator on the same pair. So, each time a comparison needs to be made for a pair, by repeatedly querying $O(\log{n})$ times, one can obtain a $O(n \log^2{n})$ algorithm. 
A better algorithm with $O(n \log{n})$ queries can be obtained~\cite{FRPU94,kk07}.
In more recent works~\cite{wgw22,gx23}, a deeper investigation was made into the constant, which is dependent on the bias $\gamma$, hidden in the $O(n \log{n})$ sorting algorithm of \cite{FRPU94} for noisy sorting {\bf with} resampling.
A more interesting noise model was considered by Braverman and Mossel~\cite{bm08}, where the ordering algorithm cannot repeat a comparison query.\footnote{This can also be modeled by the constraint that the errors are independent but {\em persistent}, i.e., if a comparison is repeated, then you get the same answer.}
This is called the {\em noisy sorting \textbf{without} resampling (NSWR)} problem. The NSWR problem can also be seen as a stochastic version of the Feedback Arc Set on Tournament (FAST) problem -- the tournament is generated using the noisy comparator (with respect to some total order $\pi$), and the goal is to find an ordering of the vertices such that the number of edges going backward is minimized. \cite{bm08} gave an algorithm that runs in time $n^{O((\beta+1)\gamma^{-4})}$ and outputs an optimal ordering with probability at least $(1-n^{-\beta})$. Another objective function in this setting is to minimize the maximum dislocation and total dislocation of elements, where the dislocation of an element is the difference between its ranks in $\pi$ and the output ordering. 
Optimal bounds for this have been achieved in a recent sequence of works~\cite{gllp20,gllp19}.

The key references~\cite{cdk21,cdk23} for the Ulam median problem have already been discussed. The detailed discussions on the Ulam median problem are given in ~\Cref{sec:ulamdetails}.
