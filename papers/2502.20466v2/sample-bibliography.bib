abstract = {This paper examines the convergence of no-regret learning in games with continuous action sets. For concreteness, we focus on learning via "dual averaging", a widely used class of no-regret learning schemes where players take small steps along their individual payoff gradients and then "mirror" the output back to their action sets. In terms of feedback, we assume that players can only estimate their payoff gradients up to a zero-mean error with bounded variance. To study the convergence of the induced sequence of play, we introduce the notion of variational stability, and we show that stable equilibria are locally attracting with high probability whereas globally stable equilibria are globally attracting with probability 1. We also discuss some applications to mixed-strategy learning in finite games, and we provide explicit estimates of the method's convergence speed.},

These include the generalized first-price auction for allocating positions to bidders, e.g., for sponsored search. We show that when bidders' values are independent and identically distributed the symmetric equilibrium is unique and efficient. Importantly, our proof is simple and structurally revealing. This uniqueness result for the generalized first-price auction is in stark contrast to the generalized second-price auction where there may be no efficient equilibrium. This result suggests, e.g., that first-price payment semantics may have advantages over second-price payment semantics. Our results extend also to certain models of risk aversion.},

If strategy spaces are compact and convex, payoffs are quasiconcave in the owner's strategy, and the game is better-reply secure, then a pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists. Better-reply security holds in many economic games. It also permits new results on the existence of symmetric and mixed strategy Nash equilibria.},

The seller's problem is to design an auction game which has a Nash equilibrium giving him the highest possible expected utility. Optimal auctions are derived in this paper for a wide class of auction design problems.},

abstract = {A game of incomplete information can be decomposed into a basic game and an information structure. The basic game defines the set of actions, the set of payoff states, the payoff functions, and the common prior over the payoff states. The information structure refers to the signals that the players receive in the game. We characterize the set of outcomes that can arise in Bayes Nash equilibrium if players observe the given information structure but may also observe additional signals. The characterization corresponds to the set of (a version of) incomplete information correlated equilibria, which we dub Bayes correlated equilibria. We identify a partial order on many-player information structures (individual sufficiency) under which more information shrinks the set of Bayes correlated equilibria. This order captures the role of information in imposing (incentive) constraints on behavior.},

abstract = {Many multi-agent machine learning settings can be modeled as games, from social or economic systems with algorithmic decision-makers to popular learning architectures such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). Desired outcomes in these settings are often encoded as equilibrium concepts, and therefore a primary goal is identifying machine learning algorithms with provable convergence to these equilibria. However, a growing body of negative results casts doubt on this goal by uncovering games exhibiting non-convergence, chaos, and even essentially arbitrary behaviour [Andrade et al. 2021; Bena\"{\i}m et al. 2012; Cheung and Piliouras 2019; Chotibut et al. 2020; Flokas et al. 2020; Letcher 2021; Milionis et al. 2022; Wibisono et al. 2022].},

In this model, the English (ascending) auction generates higher average prices than does the second-price auction. Also, when bidders are risk-neutral, the second-price auction generates higher average prices than the Dutch and first-price auctions. In all of these auctions, the seller can raise the expected price by adopting a policy of providing expert appraisals of the quality of the objects he sells.},
