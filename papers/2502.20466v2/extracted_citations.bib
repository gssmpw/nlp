abstract = {This paper examines the convergence of no-regret learning in games with continuous action sets. For concreteness, we focus on learning via "dual averaging", a widely used class of no-regret learning schemes where players take small steps along their individual payoff gradients and then "mirror" the output back to their action sets. In terms of feedback, we assume that players can only estimate their payoff gradients up to a zero-mean error with bounded variance. To study the convergence of the induced sequence of play, we introduce the notion of variational stability, and we show that stable equilibria are locally attracting with high probability whereas globally stable equilibria are globally attracting with probability 1. We also discuss some applications to mixed-strategy learning in finite games, and we provide explicit estimates of the method's convergence speed.},

abstract = {Many multi-agent machine learning settings can be modeled as games, from social or economic systems with algorithmic decision-makers to popular learning architectures such as generative adversarial networks (GANs). Desired outcomes in these settings are often encoded as equilibrium concepts, and therefore a primary goal is identifying machine learning algorithms with provable convergence to these equilibria. However, a growing body of negative results casts doubt on this goal by uncovering games exhibiting non-convergence, chaos, and even essentially arbitrary behaviour [Andrade et al. 2021; Bena\"{\i}m et al. 2012; Cheung and Piliouras 2019; Chotibut et al. 2020; Flokas et al. 2020; Letcher 2021; Milionis et al. 2022; Wibisono et al. 2022].},
