\textbf{Evaluation \& Datasets} We evaluate our method on the test sets of ARC-Challenge (a \textit{MCQ} reasoning dataset), PubHealth (a fact \textit{verification} dataset about public health) \& PopQA (open-domain question-answering). For closed-tasks (ARC-Challenge, PubHealth), we evaluate Accuracy. For the short-form generation task (PopQA), the metrics indicate performance based on whether gold answers are included in the model generations instead of strictly requiring exact matching (Appendix \ref{sec:appendix4}). Table \ref{tab:pragmatics_rag} shows that integrating pragmatic hints into RAG can enhance performance over DPR. For example, on ARC-Challenge, combining evidence highlighting with step-back reasoning improves Llama-2-7B by up to 5.66\% and AMD-OLMo-1B by up to 10\% (relative, compared to using just the DPR passages without evidence highlighting). On PubHealth, our method improves Alpaca-7B by up to 19.7\% and Llama-2-7B by up to 7.94\%. In most cases, for both PubHealth and ARC-Challenge, the ``\textit{DPR + Evidence Highlighting + Step-back reasoning}'' setting consistently outperforms the ``\textit{Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) (No Evidence Highlighting)}'' setting and the ``\textit{DPR + Evidence Highlighting + No Step-back reasoning}'' setting.\\
\textbf{Choice of LLMs} We primarily utilize older language models to mitigate data contamination risks \cite{sainz-etal-2023-nlp}. For instance, we excluded DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B \cite{deepseekai2025deepseekr1incentivizingreasoningcapability} after observing its 90\% accuracy on ARC-Challenge under \textit{No Retrieval Setting}---a clear indication of data leakage. While our selected models may still exhibit some contamination (evidenced by strong performance in \textit{No Retrieval} settings), our method demonstrates improvements over these models even when paired with Dense Passage Retrieval, establishing a comparative baseline. Please refer to Appendix \ref{sec:appendix4} for details of the prompts used and other experimental details.
