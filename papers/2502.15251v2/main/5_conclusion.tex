\section{Conclusion}
We introduce \Ours, a contrastive learning framework for pre-training 3D hand pose estimators by mining similar hand pairs from large-scale in-the-wild images. Our approach leverages similar hand pairs from diverse videos, significantly enhancing the information gained during pre-training compared with existing methods.
Experiments show that our pre-training method achieves competitive performance in 3D hand pose estimation across multiple datasets, outperforming previous pre-training approaches and demonstrating the benefits of large-scale pre-training with in-the-wild images. We hope this work can lay a foundation for future research on pre-training of 3D hand pose estimation.
