\subsection{Comparison with the other 3D Hand Pose Estimation Methods}

\input{appendix/tables/exp_dy}

To better assess the value of this work and its position within the broader context, we have included comparisons with other related works in the field of 3D hand pose estimation in this section.

As shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:exp_dy} and ~\ref{tab:exp_ah}, the comparative results on the DexYCB~\citep{chao:cvpr21} and AssemblyHands~\citep{ohkawa:cvpr23} datasets further validate the superiority of our approach across multiple standard datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pretraining strategy and its broad potential for real-world applications.
