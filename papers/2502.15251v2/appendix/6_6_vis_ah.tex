\subsection{Visualization of Hand Pose Estimation Results on AssemblyHands}\label{sec:appendix_vis_ah}

We show the visualization results of hand pose estimation on another dataset, AssemblyHands ~\cite{ohkawa:cvpr23}. We highlight instances of hand-object occlusion in the data using red circles. As observed with DexYCB ~\citep{chao:cvpr21}, \Ours pre-trained model demonstrates superior performance in handling occlusion during the fine-tuning stage compared to the other pre-training methods, showcasing stronger robustness.

    \textbf{Visualization of Hand Pose Estimation Results on AssemblyHands.}  AssemblyHands ~\cite{ohkawa:cvpr23} is a hand pose dataset captured from a first-person perspective during toy assembly. It can be observed that \Ours pre-training method achieves better results (GT: Ground Truth; PT: Pre-training).
