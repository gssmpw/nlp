CSPNet [1] alleviates the issue that previous works required heavy inference computations from the network architecture perspective. It effectively improves accuracy while reducing a large amount of computations, and it also possesses strong ease of use and versatility. In most early YOLO networks, the CSPNet structure was widely used as the basic feature extraction module. The latest state-of-the-art YOLO models employ variants of the CSPNet to achieve superior performance. These modules are integrated into the Backbone and Neck of the network. Notably, while these modules share a similar overall architecture, their bottleneck structures of differ slightly. Different bottleneck consist of several regular convolutions, DW convolutions, reparameterized convolutions, and so on.

As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig3}(a), the C3 module in YOLOv5 [2], the CSPRes module in PPYOLOE [2], the BepC3 module in YOLOv6 [2], and the CSPNextBlock in RTMDet are all classic CSPNet structures. The input is divided into two branches by a $1 \times 1$ convolution, each branch having half channels of the original input. The first branch undergoes deep feature extraction through multiple bottleneck and then concatenated with the second branch before the final output.

In designing its network architecture, YOLOv7 introduces considerations for gradient propagation efficiency to balance the network's learning capability. Compared to CSPNet, the design of ELAN places greater emphasis on optimizing the gradient pathways, reducing issues related to gradient vanishing and exploding. This enhances the stability and convergence speed of the model during training. Moreover, ELAN maintains high detection accuracy while further reducing unnecessary computational load and the number of parameters, which in turn increases the inference speed of the model. It develops the ELAN, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig3}(b), which is used in later models such as the C2f module in YOLOv8 [3], the GELAN module in YOLOv9 [3], the RepHELAN module in MAF-YOLO [3], the CIB module in YOLOv10 [3], and the C3k2 module in YOLO11 [3].

The MSBlock proposed in YOLOMS [4] offers significant enhancements in multi-scale feature representation compared to CSPNet. It utilizes a hierarchical feature fusion strategy, employing multiple branches for feature extraction and introducing convolutional kernels of varying sizes into the backbone network to capture features at different scales. This design enables the model to handle objects of diverse sizes more effectively, thereby improving detection accuracy. Furthermore, unlike the standard convolutions or re-parameterized convolutions used in previous YOLO versions, MSBlock incorporates an Inverted Bottleneck Block combined with Depthwise Convolution to reduce computational costs.

As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig3}(c), the MSBlock enhances the network's depth by employing width augmentation and cascade connections. The input is divided into N branches, each processed through a bottleneck module. The output from each branch is then passed to the subsequent branch, enabling efficient transmission of deep feature information throughout the network.
