Interactive topic models~\cite{Hu:Boyd-Graber:Satinoff-2011, ITM-1} allow users to iteratively interact with a topic model interface to refine topics for aiding content analysis.
%
\citet{Hu:Boyd-Graber:Satinoff-2011} adopts user constraints to selectively remove or add elements in the state of a Markov Chain used for inference to generate more interpretable and user-favored topics than unsupervised topic models. 
%
~\citet{alto, li-etal-2024-improving} propose an active learning approach that combines latent topic features and user-provided labels to generate human-formulated topics while minimizing manual labeling effort.
% 
Current interactive topic models rely heavily on human effort to refine and annotate generated topics for data analysis. 
%
We use an \mm{} in interactive topic modeling to reduce manual effort. 
%
This approach leverages \mm{}s to generate topic suggestions under user supervision, minimizing the need for complete manual creation while maintaining human control of the topics over the process.
%
Interactive topic models gives users flexibility to define topics as they explore data.
