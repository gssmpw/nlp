% \paragraph{Qualitative Analysis}
% We examined users' comments on the tool. 


\paragraph{User response time} In table \ref{table:user_response_time}, we present the average and median labeling times in seconds per document for users in each group. The NA group exhibits the shortest duration, while the NONE group takes the longest. Participants spend more time labeling without the aid of topic model keywords and highlights. While neural topic models can sometimes produce overly specific or nonsensical keywords beyond the top \(N\) (where \(N\) is dataset-dependent)~\cite{put citation}, this does not seem to hinder users' labeling experience, likely because their judgments are based on the top keywords. Additionally, highlights above a 0.05 threshold for documents in LDA, sLDA, CTM could also influence the labeling speed. Furthermore, based on automatic evaluation metrics and table \ref{table:no_topic_feature_metrics}, classical LDA does not display a significant advantage over NTM in a human-in-the-loop application, both on accelerating the labeling process and enhancing label quality.

% \paragraph{User Rating Scaling} In our post-study survey, participants rated the mental demand of the task on a scale of 1 to 7. We interpreted ratings above 4 as indicating above-average challenge, and those below 4 as signifying low challenge. In the NONE group, two-thirds (2 out of 3) found the task mentally demanding. For the sA group, 80\% (4 out of 5) considered it challenging, with half of them assigning a neutral score of 4. This suggests that continually updating sLDA, introducing new topics, and altering keywords can potentially increase the cognitive load for participants. They might need time and mental energy to adapt to these new changes. In the LDA group, 40\% (2 out of 5) found it demanding, whereas one participant felt it required no mental effort, rating it a mere 1. In the CTM group, 60\% (3 out of 5) considered the task mentally demanding. In all the groups, except LDA, the majority of the participants found the task to be mentally demanding. This could suggest that the one hour long session task inherently requires a degree of cognitive effort, while LDA might produce more sensible topic keywords that reduce user cognitive load.

% Participants were asked to rate their confidence in the labels they assigned to the documents on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher scores indicating greater confidence. We interpret scores above 4 as above-average confidence. In the LDA Group, all participants indicated a uniform sense of above-average confidence in their labeling. For the sLDA Group, while the majority rated a confident score of 6, one participant expressed a lower confidence of 3. This disparity might hint that updating models can occasionally undermine user confidence. In the NONE Group, two participants responded below-average confidence. The presence of relevant topics and keywords as cues could both guide or inadvertently influence users' decisions: while they can guide users, any deviation from the suggested keywords or topics might dent their confidence, especially if their labels don't align with these hints. More than half of the NA Group participants rated their confidence as below average. This observation is intriguing; even though automatic evaluation metrics suggest advantages for the NA group over other groups in terms of label quality and time efficiency, there appears to be a gap in user confidence. This discrepancy could lead us to question the efficacy of the NTM. Is it making users more cautious about AI tools, or are its highly specific keyword suggestions causing doubt in users when their decisions deviate?
