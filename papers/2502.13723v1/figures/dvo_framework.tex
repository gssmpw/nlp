    \caption{Overview of Direct Value Optimization. Compared with other self-improvement methods, DVO stands out by using MCTS to generate self-explored data and directly aligning the policy model with value estimations. This provides an efficient self-improvement framework that finely tunes the model to maximize total expected rewards.
