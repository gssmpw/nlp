Table \ref{tab:methods} summaries the existing PLS methods and highlights the differences between our proposed and other works.
When applying the radar sensing interference in PLS design in IoV, the sensing accuracy, transmission reliability and security should be considered simultaneously. Therefore, on the one hand, the performance analytical framework of ISAC systems considering communication-sensing coupled interference should be established, which describes the relationship between communication and sensing capabilities. On other hand, from the perspective of radar sensing interference utilization, no studies investigate the confidential communication by jointly designing transmission power and trajectory of the source.
This motivates our research in this work.
