\section{Introduction}
Age transformation of facial images is a task that aims to reproduce age-related appearance changes while preserving an individual's identity.
With advances in deep learning, realistic age editing has become possible using generative adversarial networks (GANs)~\cite{or2020lifespan,alaluf2021only,gomez2022custom} and diffusion models~\cite{li2023pluralistic,chen2023face}.
Existing methods learn typical age transformation from datasets containing facial images of diverse individuals. However, such typical age transformation often harms identity preservation and does not necessarily reflect the person-specific appearance transition resulting from the person's life history. 

To overcome this limitation, we propose the first diffusion model-based method for personalized age transformation that reflects individual characteristics (see Figure~\ref{fig:teaser}). To this end, we incorporate a few additional facial images of the target individual at different ages, \textit{self-reference images}, as supplementary supervision.
Specifically, inspired by Identity-Preserving Aging (IDP)~\cite{banerjee2023identity}, we fine-tune a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM)~\cite{rombach2022high} to learn identity information from self-reference images while capturing age transformations from an age-labeled facial dataset~\cite{jiang2021talk}. 
However, unlike IDP, which generates facial images for a specified rough age group, our framework aims to edit existing facial images to integer target ages. 

During inference, our fine-tuned model generates a face image at a specified target age given an input facial image. 
Following the approach of Face Aging via Diffusion-based Editing (FADING)~\cite{chen2023face}, we first embed the input image into the latent space of the pretrained model using Null-text Inversion~\cite{mokady2023null}.
Next, we apply Prompt-to-Prompt~\cite{hertz2022prompt}, a method that edits images using paired prompts corresponding to pre- and post-edit states, to generate the age-edited output from the embedded representation.
We refine the prompt design to further enhance the performance of face aging and identity preservation. 

In summary, our main contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first diffusion model-based method for personalized age transformation,
    \item Refinement of the regularization set to specify integer ages instead of age groups,
    \item Special adaptor to preserve a person's identity while avoiding overfitting on training data, and
    \item Careful prompt design for more accurate age transformation.
\end{enumerate}
We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that, compared to existing age editing methods, our method improves age editing accuracy while maintaining identity preservation.
