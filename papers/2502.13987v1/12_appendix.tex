\subsection{Additional Qualitative Comparison}
Figures~\ref{fig:more_1} and \ref{fig:more_2} present additional qualitative comparisons.
SAM~\cite{alaluf2021only} exhibits low inversion accuracy, resulting in inadequate modifications for both younger and older age transformations.
CUSP~\cite{gomez2022custom} demonstrates strong performance in editing for younger ages but struggles to maintain identity preservation across all target ages.
FADING~\cite{chen2023face} maintains identity well due to its high inversion accuracy, but it frequently fails to perform successful age modifications.
In contrast, our method achieves more consistent and stable age editing.
Furthermore, thanks to our prompt design, editing performance for both younger and older ages has significantly improved.
Notably, our method produces natural changes in hair volume and color, which are crucial for realistic age transformations.
