\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Location Data Tracking}
Location data can be collected using GPS sensors/Bluetooth beacons on mobile phone devices or smart-watches and using WiFi or IP addresses when surfing the web. Current app development toolkits offer the possibility of combining location data from multiple sensors to get better accuracy: for example, the Fused location Provider API ____ in Android development or the CLLocationManager ____ in iOS development. 
In addition, there exist several third-party Software development Kits (SDKs) (e.g., X-Mode, SafeGraph) that help app developers, tech companies and data brokers and aggregators collect, visualize and track location data ____.  

With data from data brokers and aggregators, 
many researchers have shown that location data characterizing the places visited by a person as well as their trajectories can be useful in a plethora of settings such as modeling the spreading of a pandemic through tracing apps ____, 
inferring socio-economic indicators ____, health outcomes ____, urban development and disaster risk ____, 
targeted marketing and advertising ____,
understanding migration patterns ____,
improving public transit ____, 
or modeling mobility patterns for public safety ____.

At the same time, there has been a lot of work focused on privacy preserving methods for location data. 
Primault et. al. ____ extensively outline the techniques for sharing location data in a privacy preserving manner either via anonymization or obfuscation approaches. While
obfuscation techniques directly change the location of a user to protect their privacy, anonymization mechanisms attempt to hide the actual location from an attacker. 
In this paper, we focus on obfuscation techniques, not on k-anonymization approaches, since obfuscation is the most common method used by data brokers, data aggregators and the researchers and analysts acquiring and analyzing location data from these companies.  


%Data brokers do not explicitly specify these Location Privacy preservation mechanisms (LPPM) in their terms and services. Also, the field is evolving rapidly and new algorithms for LPPM are being developed with better representability of annonimyzed data. Thus, location privacy perceptions need to be understood in the context of features that would be derived from the data and not simply in the context of type of LPPM.


\subsection{Privacy Perceptions for Location data}
Duckham et. al. ____ define location privacy as "special type of information
 privacy which concerns the claim of individuals to determine for themselves when,
 how, and to what extent location information about them is communicated to others".
 Our research builds on prior work investigating privacy perceptions around sharing personal location data in various contexts ____. Prior research has looked into the effects of different variables on the willingness of individuals to share their personal location data including the role of (1) Actors, defined as individuals accessing the location data ____ (2) Purposes, defined as how the location data is going to be used ____ (3) Time, defined as the duration of the access to location data ____ (4) Age  ____ (5) Privacy attitudes ____, and  (6) Socio-cultural aspects ____.

These works have shown that actors like the FBI, commercial entities, employers and data brokers are negatively perceived while local government and social media companies generate more positive perceptions when collecting and using location data. The duration of the location data collection as well as the purposes of using location data have also been associated with varying levels of comfort when sharing that data. For example, while the identification of sexual orientation or political views are perceived negatively, purposes related to public health or public safety are perceived more positively.

%Situations like longer duration of location tracking and objectives like identifying sexual orientation, political views and social circle of an individual are perceived as uncomfortable when compared to identifying places people visit, assessing their health, reducing spread of diseases, improving traffic, etc. Specific cases like comfortableness in sharing location data on social media platforms with images, posts and tweets was also observed. 

%\textcolor{yellow}{Naman, try to summarize here some of the findings e.g., certain actors are associate to more risk etc. Not two long, try to summarize}


There is also research exploring the use of location data for specific settings such as surveillance  ____, location tracking for advertisements ____, 
or location tracking for pandemic contexts. 
%They aim to understand people's nuanced perceptions of physical location tracking for different purposes.
Surveillance applications have been associated with some level of comfort in human-centered contexts like disaster recovery.
On the other hand, research during COVID-19 found strong opposition towards contact tracing apps ____, with over 50\% of the participants in both studies being unlikely to install such apps due to concerns around government intrusion. 

Finally, prior work has also examined how monetary incentives influence participants' willingness to share their location data for specialized research studies or market research ____; and the relationship between personality traits and privacy perceptions ____. Participants' positive perception of the service collecting their data, higher incentives, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to new experiences were also linked positively to comfort in sharing location data.  
%\textcolor{yellow}{here again, add one or two sentences explaining findings}

Building on these findings, we extend the state of the art by (1) evaluating user perceptions with respect to trajectory-based features extracted from location data, beyond current analyses focused on visits to points of interest (POI), (2) evaluating user privacy perceptions when using obfuscated location data vs. detailed (raw) location data, and (3) analyzing the effect of race, ethnicity and education on privacy perceptions with respect to trajectory and POI visit location data. 

\subsection{Predicting Privacy Preferences}
% There is no prior work focused on inferring levels of comfort with respect to location data. 
Privacy fatigue is an important issue highlighted in research. This fatigue stems from factors like ubiquitous collection of personal data, scarcity of alternatives and additional permission requirements people need to go through ____. 

Prediction models have been developed to explore people's perceptions around data collection and sharing like ____. In these paper, the authors model people's perceptions of comfort in sharing location data as a multi-class classification or regression problem and model the perceptions around different actors accessing location data for different purposes. Eg: ____ models people's perceptions in sharing IOT data as a binary classification task (predicting allow/deny); reporting accuracies of 77.6\% (0.70 recall) for a multi-class, 3-point Likert classification task, and 
81\% (0.78 recall) for the binary classification.
%\textcolor{yellow}{Naman, add one sentence with accuracy for these two tasks}
In another study, researchers created binary classifiers to determine privacy attitudes with regards to data sharing in several contexts including sharing biological data or personally identifying information (PII)____; achieving a mean recall of 0.46 for prediction of privacy concerns from contextual labels. 

In this paper, we explore binary and multi-class approaches, similarly to prior works.

\iffalse 
\textbf{Survey Design.} Research studies on privacy perceptions typically employ factorial vignette approaches to understand how different scenarios affect an individual's willingness to share location data.
Privacy risk perception studies highlight that impersonal, less detailed,
\textit{abstract} risk scenarios are often perceived as less risky____. 
Given that risk is a major factor in determining levels of comfort with sharing location data, vignette questions that present location data in abstract ways may underestimate people's privacy boundaries and perceptions. 
Hence, in our survey, we make an effort to explain to the survey participant, the types of location data we refer to, by providing extensive details about the location features and about what they represent.  
Interestingly, some privacy perception studies demonstrate that visualizing abstract data can help alleviate privacy risk concerns and increase people's comfort with data sharing ____. This suggests that the way data is presented can significantly impact privacy perceptions.
For that reason, in our survey, we accompany each vignette not only with extensive explanations, but also with map-based visualization to convey better location data information.
\fi 

%In our study, we have chosen to use map-based visualizations to convey feature information. This decision is supported by previous research demonstrating that visualizations can more effectively inform users about risk implications of data sharing ____.

% %We explore literature on modeling perceptions using the collected data. While insights can be gathered around which actors/features/purposes/attitude/awareness are linked to higher comfort, there are many practical benefits of having a classification/regression model for predicting comfortableness of a group of interest. To that effect, we explore literature on modeling privacy perceptions as classification/regression tasks. 
% %Indices for general privacy perceptions developed by Westin (Westin Privacy index) are not enough for understanding context specific attitudes and perceptions ____. Contextual integrity framework surveys need to be designed carefully to incorporate the context and convey the correct information for capturing true perceptions of surveys participants ____,____. In this study, we propose to create a classification model which can classify privacy perceptions of location data sharing in specific contexts.
% %Similar approach ahs been successfully developed previously.
