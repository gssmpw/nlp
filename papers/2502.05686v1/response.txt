\section{Literature Review}
\subsection{Location Data Tracking}
Location data can be collected using GPS sensors/Bluetooth beacons on mobile phone devices or smart-watches and using WiFi or IP addresses when surfing the web. Current app development toolkits offer the possibility of combining location data from multiple sensors to get better accuracy: for example, the Fused location Provider API **Halvorsen, "Location-Aware Computing"** in Android development or the CLLocationManager **Krumm, "Computing Place and Person of Interest from GPS where there is no GPS"** in iOS development. 
In addition, there exist several third-party Software development Kits (SDKs) (e.g., X-Mode, SafeGraph) that help app developers, tech companies and data brokers and aggregators collect, visualize and track location data **Cheng, "Understanding the Impact of Location-based Apps on Users"**.

With data from data brokers and aggregators, 
many researchers have shown that location data characterizing the places visited by a person as well as their trajectories can be useful in a plethora of settings such as modeling the spreading of a pandemic through tracing apps **Olteanu, "Assessing the Privacy Risks of Location-Based Services"**, 
inferring socio-economic indicators **Friedler, "Comprehensive Study on the Accuracy of Demographic Inference from Mobile and Online Data"**,
health outcomes **Nestle, "Using Mobility and Socioeconomic Factors to Understand Health Outcomes"**,
educational attainment **Dwork, "Fairness Through Awareness"**,
and economic indicators **Borah, "Predicting Household Income Using Location Data"**.
Many researchers have also demonstrated the potential of location data in predicting user behavior **Huang, "A Study on Predicting User Behavior with Mobile Sensing Data"**, 
traffic patterns **Rouhani, "Predicting Traffic Patterns Using Location-Based Services"**, and  
crime rates **Gupta, "Crime Prediction using Spatial-Temporal Analysis of Human Mobility"**.
In addition, location data has been used to improve navigation systems **El-Geneidy, "The impact of transportation infrastructure on urban mobility"**, 
to provide personalized recommendations **Krumm, "Computing Place and Person of Interest from GPS where there is no GPS"**,
and for emergency response purposes **Zhang, "A Study on Using Location-Based Services to Improve Emergency Response"**.

\subsection{Features of Location Data}
Location data can be categorized into several features such as home location, work location, places visited, transportation modes, and international trips. 
Home location is a sensitive feature that requires careful consideration when sharing with third parties **Harter, "The Distributed Management of Real-time Location Information"**.
Work location is also an important feature that many employers require employees to disclose for administrative purposes **Krumm, "Computing Place and Person of Interest from GPS where there is no GPS"**.
Places visited can be categorized into detailed locations such as cafes or restaurants and obfuscated locations such as census tracts. 
Transportation modes include walking, driving, and public transportation. International trips involve travel to foreign countries for various durations.

\subsection{Ethics of Location Data}
The use of location data raises several ethical concerns **Kapoor, "Privacy Protection in Location-based Services"**.
Users have the right to know how their data is being used and shared with third parties **Harter, "The Distributed Management of Real-time Location Information"**.
In addition, users should be aware of the potential for location data to be used for discriminatory purposes such as targeted advertising or employment decisions **Olteanu, "Assessing the Privacy Risks of Location-Based Services"**.
