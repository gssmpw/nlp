\paragraph{Video-to-Text Summarization} generates coherent summaries by integrating multimodal information ____, supported by datasets like MSS ____, VideoXum ____, MMSum ____, Hierarchical3D ____, and \mbox{LfVS-T} ____, spanning tasks from instructional videos to general web content ____. Technical advancements include hierarchical attention models ____, extractive methods using multimodal features ____, and hybrid extractive-abstractive frameworks ____. Transformer-based systems have further improved performance ____. However, challenges in summarizing academic videos remain under-explored.

\paragraph{Scientific Text Summarization} condenses complex scholarly content into concise formats ____, supported by datasets like TalkSumm ____ for academic video transcripts, SumSurvey ____ for survey papers, ACLSum ____ for ACL discourse, and SciNews ____ for simplifying research for broader audiences. M$^3$AV ____ supports tasks like ASR, TTS, and slide-script generation. Methods like HAESum ____ and SAPGraph ____ improve discourse and structural summarization, while CiteSum ____ and SSR ____ focus on scalability and audience-specific customization. Despite these efforts, scientific summarization remains a challenging domain due to the inherent complexity and diversity of scholarly texts. 

\paragraph{Plan-based Summarization} employs structured representations to improve summary quality and reduce hallucinations ____. Research focuses on text-only planning with elements like entities ____, keyword prompts ____, and question-answer pairs ____. Examples include PlanVerb ____, which converts task plans into natural language via semantic tagging, and domain-specific approaches in dialogue summarization that align with knowledge structures for improved quality ____. Blueprint-based frameworks utilize intermediate plans such as question-answer pairs to create coherent narratives for visual storytelling ____. However, plan-based strategies for multimodal tasks, particularly video-to-text summarization, have received limited attention.
