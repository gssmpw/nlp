\caption{(Illustration of \Cref{theorem:lemma1}, $n=4$) This figure states that the row sum $S_i^k$ of the $i$-th row of the profit matrix $\profitList$ remains constant every $n$ steps. The fluctuations in the row sum are bounded by the difference $S_i^{\text{max}} - S_i^{\text{min}} = d(n-1)b_i$, where $S_i^{\text{max}}$ and $S_i^{\text{min}}$ denote the maximum and minimum row sums during the cycle. The diagram highlights the periodic nature of the row sum across steps and the incremental fluctuations $db_i$ within each step.}
