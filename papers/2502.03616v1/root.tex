\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Noncooperative multi-agent systems often face coordination challenges due to conflicting preferences among agents. In particular, agents acting in their own self-interest can settle on different equilibria, leading to suboptimal outcomes or even safety concerns. We propose an algorithm named trading auction for consensus (\texttt{TACo}), a decentralized approach that enables noncooperative agents to reach consensus without communicating directly or disclosing private valuations. \texttt{TACo} facilitates coordination through a structured trading-based auction, where agents iteratively select choices of interest and provably reach an agreement within an \emph{a priori} bounded number of steps. A series of numerical experiments validate that the termination guarantees of \texttt{TACo} hold in practice, and show that \texttt{TACo} achieves a median performance that minimizes the total cost across all agents, while allocating resources significantly more fairly than baseline approaches.
