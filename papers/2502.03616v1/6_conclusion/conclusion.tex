\section{Conclusion}

We developed the trading auction for consensus (\texttt{TACo}) algorithm, a decentralized approach for coordinating decisions among noncooperative agents facing conflicting choices. \texttt{TACo} enables agents to reach consensus by trading secondary assets, ensuring procedural rationality without requiring centralized coordination, direct communication, or the disclosure of private information. This flexibility makes \texttt{TACo} an effective tool for resolving coordination challenges in multi-agent systems.

Future work includes improving scalability, evaluating performance in more complex environments, and tightening convergence bounds to ensure \texttt{TACo} terminates quickly in safety-critical settings. This will clarify the types of problems it can efficiently solve and inform strategies for faster convergence.

% establishing tighter bounds will be important for us to be able to enusre TACo will temrinate quickly enough in safety-critifcal seetings.
