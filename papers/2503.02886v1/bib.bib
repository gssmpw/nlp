abstract = {Campaign persuasion operates with notable consistency across political parties, message tone, and information environment. Evidence across social science indicates that average effects of persuasive messages are small. One commonly offered explanation for these small effects is heterogeneity: Persuasion may only work well in specific circumstances. To evaluate heterogeneity, we repeated an experiment weekly in real time using 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign advertisements. We tested 49 political advertisements in 59 unique experiments on 34,000 people. We investigate heterogeneous effects by sender (candidates or groups), receiver (subject partisanship), content (attack or promotional), and context (battleground versus non-battleground, primary versus general election, and early versus late). We find small average effects on candidate favorability and vote. These small effects, however, do not mask substantial heterogeneity even where theory from political science suggests that we should find it. During the primary and general election, in battleground states, for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, effects are similarly small. Heterogeneity with large offsetting effects is not the source of small average effects.}}

Our empirical strategy exploits FCC regulations that result in plausibly exogenous variation in the number of impressions across the borders of neighboring counties. Applying this approach to detailed data on television advertisement broadcasts and viewership patterns during the 2004–12 presidential campaigns, our results indicate that total political advertising has almost no impact on aggregate turnout. By contrast, we find a positive and economically meaningful effect of advertising on candidates’ vote shares. Taken at face value, our estimates imply that a one standard deviation increase in the partisan difference in advertising raises the partisan difference in vote shares by about 0.5 percentage points. Evidence from a regression discontinuity design suggests that advertising affects election results by altering the partisan composition of the electorate.},

abstract = {Online advertising can be used to mislead, deceive, and manipulate Internet users, and political advertising is no exception. In this paper, we present a measurement study of online advertising around the 2020 United States elections, with a focus on identifying dark patterns and other potentially problematic content in political advertising. We scraped ad content on 745 news and media websites from six geographic locations in the U.S. from September 2020 to January 2021, collecting 1.4 million ads. We perform a systematic qualitative analysis of political content in these ads, as well as a quantitative analysis of the distribution of political ads on different types of websites. Our findings reveal the widespread use of problematic tactics in political ads, such as bait-and-switch ads formatted as opinion polls to entice users to click, the use of political controversy by content farms for clickbait, and the more frequent occurrence of political ads on highly partisan news websites. We make policy recommendations for online political advertising, including greater scrutiny of non-official political ads and comprehensive standards across advertising platforms.},

To address this void, this paper presents a novel profile-based evaluation of the personalization experienced by carefully crafted user profiles. Our evaluation framework impersonates different users and captures how the personalization changes over time, how it changes when adding or removing an extension, and perhaps most importantly how the results differ depending on the profile's persona (e.g., interest, occupation, age, gender), geographic location (US East, US West, UK), what browser extension they use (none, AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, CatBlock), what browser they use (Chrome, Firefox), and whether they are logged in to their Google account. By comparing and contrasting observed differences we provide insights that help explain why some user groups may feel more targeted than others and why some people may feel even more targeted after having turned on their adblocker.},

abstract = {Personalization refers to the tailoring of products and purchase experience to the tastes of individual consumers based upon their personal and preference information. Recent advances in information acquisition and processing technologies have allowed online vendors to offer varieties of web-based personalization that not only increases switching costs, but also serves as important means of acquiring valuable customer information. However, investments in online personalization may be severely undermined if consumers do not use these services due to privacy concerns. In the absence of any empirical evidence that seeks to understand this consumer dilemma, our research develops a parsimonious model to predict consumers' usage of online personalization as a result of the tradeoff between their value for personalization and concern for privacy. In addition to this tradeoff, we find that a consumer's intent to use personalization services is positively influenced by her trust in the vendor. Our findings suggest that: 1. online vendors can improve their abilities to acquire and use customer information through trust building activities; 2. it is of critical importance that vendors understand and evaluate the different values consumers may place in enjoying various types of personalization.},

The mass reach of online advertising is often leveraged for information dissemination, at times with an objective to influence public opinion (e.g., election misinformation). We hypothesized that online advertising, due to its reach and potential, might have been used to spread information around the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Thus, to understand the online ad ecosystem during this conflict, we conducted a five-month long large-scale measurement study of online advertising in Ukraine, Russia, and the US. We studied advertising trends of ad platforms that delivered ads in Ukraine, Russia, and the US and conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of the conflict-related ad content. We found that prominent US-based advertisers continued to support Russian websites, and a portion of online ads were used to spread conflict-related information, including protesting the invasion, and spreading awareness, which might have otherwise potentially been censored in Russia.},

In this work, we present three primary contributions: (1) a framework for understanding the interaction between participatory disinformation and informal and tactical mobilization; (2) three case studies from the 2020 U.S. election analyzed using detailed temporal, content, and thematic analysis; and (3) a qualitative coding scheme for understanding how digital disinformation functions to mobilize online audiences. We combine resource mobilization theory with previous work examining participatory disinformation campaigns and "deep stories" to show how false or misleading information functioned to mobilize online audiences before, during, and after election day. Our analysis highlights how users on Twitter collaboratively construct and amplify alleged evidence of fraud that is used to facilitate action, both online and off. We find that mobilization is dependent on the selective amplification of false or misleading tweets by influencers, the framing around those claims, as well as the perceived credibility of their source. These processes are a self-reinforcing cycle where audiences collaborate in the construction of a misleading version of reality, which in turn leads to offline actions that are used to further reinforce a manufactured reality. Through this work, we hope to better inform future interventions.},

abstract = {The increased number of social media platforms allows different groups of people around the globe to express their thoughts and sentiments on such media. Such ideas and opinions might implicate the user's social and political perspectives. Those perspectives are subject-specific inputs that have been useful to data science researchers to do community detection and sentiment analysis studies. Research studies utilize the rich information from social media, such as Twitter, to gain a better knowledge of public opinion in societies. In our study, we proposed a machine learning-based algorithm to predict and classify the textual data from Twitter about the 2020 US election campaign. The opinion poll of the presidential elections might be inaccurate or bias, resulting in providing significant negative effects with voters. The dataset was collected during the 2020 presidential election campaign toward the voting day. In addition to the original tweets, we generated fake tweets added to the dataset. Before organizing the comprehensive data and validation, we have done data cleaning and screening to get a reasonable and sensible correlation. For comparison, we used a total of five classification algorithms, such as Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. The study found that Trump was more popular than Biden on Twitter. Even though he was more famous than his rival, the study suggested that Joe Biden has a higher average percentage of positive sentiments than Donald Trump nationally. On the other hand, Donald Trump has a higher average percentage of negative sentiments than Joe Biden. In favor of Joe Biden compared to Donald Trump during the 2020 US presidential election, which led to the prediction that Joe Biden would outperform Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Furthermore, adding fake tweets into the dataset has slightly decreased Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and LinearSVC model performances, but it slightly improved the Logistics Regression model classifier. Retrospectively, the Twitter data could have successfully predicted the US presidential election outcome by factoring in the proportion of positive and negative sentiment for the leading candidates. The study concludes that social media data-based sentiment analysis provides an accurate prediction model for American presidential elections.},

To date, it is unclear which political advertisers address this audience in their preferred language, and whether they do so differently than for English-speaking audiences. In this work, we study differences between political Facebook ads in English and Spanish during 2020, the latest U.S. presidential election. Political advertisers spent $&nbsp;1.48&nbsp;B in English, but only $&nbsp;28.8&nbsp;M in Spanish, disproportionately little compared to the share of Spanish speakers in the population. We further find a lower proportion of election-related advertisers (which additionally are more liberal-leaning than in the English set), and a higher proportion of government agencies in the set of Spanish ads. We perform multilingual topic classification, finding that the most common ad topics in English were also present in Spanish, but to a different extent, and with a different composition of advertisers. Thus, Spanish speakers are served different types of ads from different types of advertisers than English speakers, and in lower amounts; these results raise the question of whether political communication through Facebook ads may be inequitable and effectively disadvantaging the sizeable minority of Spanish speakers in the U.S. population.},

abstract = {With the Internet becoming the dominant channel for marketing and promotion, online advertisements are also increasingly used for illegal purposes such as propagating malware, scamming, click frauds, etc. To understand the gravity of these malicious advertising activities, which we call malvertising, we perform a large-scale study through analyzing ad-related Web traces crawled over a three-month period. Our study reveals the rampancy of malvertising: hundreds of top ranking Web sites fell victims and leading ad networks such as DoubleClick were infiltrated.To mitigate this threat, we identify prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their related content delivery paths, and leverage them to build a new detection system called MadTracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and utilizes them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and detect malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer was capable of capturing a large number of malvertising cases, 15 times as many as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront did together, at a low false detection rate. It also detected new attacks, including a type of click-fraud attack that has never been reported before.},

abstract = {Online display advertising on websites is widely disliked by users, with many turning to ad blockers to avoid “bad” ads. Recent evidence suggests that today’s ads contain potentially problematic content, in addition to well-studied concerns about the privacy and intrusiveness of ads. However, we lack knowledge of which types of ad content users consider problematic and detrimental to their browsing experience. Our work bridges this gap: first, we create a taxonomy of 15 positive and negative user reactions to online advertising from a survey of 60 participants. Second, we characterize classes of online ad content that users dislike or find problematic, using a dataset of 500 ads crawled from popular websites, labeled by 1000 participants using our taxonomy. Among our findings, we report that users consider a substantial amount of ads on the web today to be clickbait, untrustworthy, or distasteful, including ads for software downloads, listicles, and health \& supplements.},

Clickbait journalism attempts to entice attention with provocative and sensational headlines, but what are the implications when public opinion polls are the hook? Does the use of survey clickbait—news stories that make misleading claims about public opinion—have implications for perceptions of the public, journalists, or the polling industry? In two survey experiments conducted in the United States, we find that exposure to apolitical survey clickbait that makes exaggerated claims about the incompetence of the American public undermines perceptions of their capacity for democratic citizenship. At the same time, we find no evidence that this type of survey clickbait damages the reputations of the media or polling industry, suggesting that the media may have perverse incentives to use low-quality polls or to misrepresent polling results to drive traffic.},

abstract = {Malvertising is a malicious activity that leverages advertising to distribute various forms of malware. Because advertising is the key revenue generator for numerous Internet companies, large ad networks, such as Google, Yahoo and Microsoft, invest a lot of effort to mitigate malicious ads from their ad networks. This drives adversaries to look for alternative methods to deploy malvertising. In this paper, we show that browser extensions that use ads as their monetization strategy often facilitate the deployment of malvertising. Moreover, while some extensions simply serve ads from ad networks that support malvertising, other extensions maliciously alter the content of visited webpages to force users into installing malware. To measure the extent of these behaviors we developed Expector, a system that automatically inspects and identifies browser extensions that inject ads, and then classifies these ads as malicious or benign based on their landing pages. Using Expector, we automatically inspected over 18,000 Chrome browser extensions. We found 292 extensions that inject ads, and detected 56 extensions that participate in malvertising using 16 different ad networks and with a total user base of 602,417.},
