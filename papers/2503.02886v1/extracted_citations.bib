abstract = {The increased number of social media platforms allows different groups of people around the globe to express their thoughts and sentiments on such media. Such ideas and opinions might implicate the user's social and political perspectives. Those perspectives are subject-specific inputs that have been useful to data science researchers to do community detection and sentiment analysis studies. Research studies utilize the rich information from social media, such as Twitter, to gain a better knowledge of public opinion in societies. In our study, we proposed a machine learning-based algorithm to predict and classify the textual data from Twitter about the 2020 US election campaign. The opinion poll of the presidential elections might be inaccurate or bias, resulting in providing significant negative effects with voters. The dataset was collected during the 2020 presidential election campaign toward the voting day. In addition to the original tweets, we generated fake tweets added to the dataset. Before organizing the comprehensive data and validation, we have done data cleaning and screening to get a reasonable and sensible correlation. For comparison, we used a total of five classification algorithms, such as Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. The study found that Trump was more popular than Biden on Twitter. Even though he was more famous than his rival, the study suggested that Joe Biden has a higher average percentage of positive sentiments than Donald Trump nationally. On the other hand, Donald Trump has a higher average percentage of negative sentiments than Joe Biden. In favor of Joe Biden compared to Donald Trump during the 2020 US presidential election, which led to the prediction that Joe Biden would outperform Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Furthermore, adding fake tweets into the dataset has slightly decreased Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and LinearSVC model performances, but it slightly improved the Logistics Regression model classifier. Retrospectively, the Twitter data could have successfully predicted the US presidential election outcome by factoring in the proportion of positive and negative sentiment for the leading candidates. The study concludes that social media data-based sentiment analysis provides an accurate prediction model for American presidential elections.},

abstract = {Online advertising can be used to mislead, deceive, and manipulate Internet users, and political advertising is no exception. In this paper, we present a measurement study of online advertising around the 2020 United States elections, with a focus on identifying dark patterns and other potentially problematic content in political advertising. We scraped ad content on 745 news and media websites from six geographic locations in the U.S. from September 2020 to January 2021, collecting 1.4 million ads. We perform a systematic qualitative analysis of political content in these ads, as well as a quantitative analysis of the distribution of political ads on different types of websites. Our findings reveal the widespread use of problematic tactics in political ads, such as bait-and-switch ads formatted as opinion polls to entice users to click, the use of political controversy by content farms for clickbait, and the more frequent occurrence of political ads on highly partisan news websites. We make policy recommendations for online political advertising, including greater scrutiny of non-official political ads and comprehensive standards across advertising platforms.},

Clickbait journalism attempts to entice attention with provocative and sensational headlines, but what are the implications when public opinion polls are the hook? Does the use of survey clickbait—news stories that make misleading claims about public opinion—have implications for perceptions of the public, journalists, or the polling industry? In two survey experiments conducted in the United States, we find that exposure to apolitical survey clickbait that makes exaggerated claims about the incompetence of the American public undermines perceptions of their capacity for democratic citizenship. At the same time, we find no evidence that this type of survey clickbait damages the reputations of the media or polling industry, suggesting that the media may have perverse incentives to use low-quality polls or to misrepresent polling results to drive traffic.},

Our study reveals the rampancy of malvertising: hundreds of top ranking Web sites fell victims and leading ad networks such as DoubleClick were infiltrated.To mitigate this threat, we identify prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their related content delivery paths, and leverage them to build a new detection system called MadTracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and utilizes them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and detect malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer was capable of capturing a large number of malvertising cases, 15 times as many as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront did together, at a low false detection rate. It also detected new attacks, including a type of click-fraud attack that has never been reported before.},

abstract = {Personalization refers to the tailoring of products and purchase experience to the tastes of individual consumers based upon their personal and preference information. Recent advances in information acquisition and processing technologies have allowed online vendors to offer varieties of web-based personalization that not only increases switching costs, but also serves as important means of acquiring valuable customer information. However, investments in online personalization may be severely undermined if consumers do not use these services due to privacy concerns. In the absence of any empirical evidence that seeks to understand this consumer dilemma, our research develops a parsimonious model to predict consumers' usage of online personalization as a result of the tradeoff between their value for personalization and concern for privacy. In addition to this tradeoff, we find that a consumer's intent to use personalization services is positively influenced by her trust in the vendor. Our findings suggest that: 1. online vendors can improve their abilities to acquire and use customer information through trust building activities; 2. it is of critical importance that vendors understand and evaluate the different values consumers may place in enjoying various types of personalization.},

The mass reach of online advertising is often leveraged for information dissemination, at times with an objective to influence public opinion (e.g., election misinformation). We hypothesized that online advertising, due to its reach and potential, might have been used to spread information around the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Thus, to understand the online ad ecosystem during this conflict, we conducted a five-month long large-scale measurement study of online advertising in Ukraine, Russia, and the US. We studied advertising trends of ad platforms that delivered ads in Ukraine, Russia, and the US and conducted an in-depth qualitative analysis of the conflict-related ad content. We found that prominent US-based advertisers continued to support Russian websites, and a portion of online ads were used to spread conflict-related information, including protesting the invasion, and spreading awareness, which might have otherwise potentially been censored in Russia.},

To address this void, this paper presents a novel profile-based evaluation of the personalization experienced by carefully crafted user profiles. Our evaluation framework impersonates different users and captures how the personalization changes over time, how it changes when adding or removing an extension, and perhaps most importantly how the results differ depending on the profile's persona (e.g., interest, occupation, age, gender), geographic location (US East, US West, UK), what browser extension they use (none, AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, CatBlock), what browser they use (Chrome, Firefox), and whether they are logged in to their Google account. By comparing and contrasting observed differences we provide insights that help explain why some user groups may feel more targeted than others and why some people may feel even more targeted after having turned on their adblocker.},

Recent evidence suggests that today’s ads contain potentially problematic content, in addition to well-studied concerns about the privacy and intrusiveness of ads. However, we lack knowledge of which types of ad content users consider problematic and detrimental to their browsing experience. Our work bridges this gap: first, we create a taxonomy of 15 positive and negative user reactions to online advertising from a survey of 60 participants. Second, we characterize classes of online ad content that users dislike or find problematic, using a dataset of 500 ads crawled from popular websites, labeled by 1000 participants using our taxonomy. Among our findings, we report that users consider a substantial amount of ads on the web today to be clickbait, untrustworthy, or distasteful, including ads for software downloads, listicles, and health \& supplements.},
