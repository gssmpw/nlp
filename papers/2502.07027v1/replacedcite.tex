Existing molecular representational alignment methods rely on attention mechanisms to compute inductive bias, resulting in results that reflect statistical correlations and lack dynamic adaptability. Therefore, we incorporate chemical domain knowledge into ReAlignFit to dynamically align the representations between substructures based on simulated molecular conformational changes to identify substructure pairs with high functional compatibility.
