    \caption{(a) illustrates common issues with existing LLM unlearning methods, including insufficient unlearning or side effects such as hallucinations, gibberish, or an inability to generate coherent responses when prompted with unlearned data. To address these challenges, we propose \lunar, which achieves superior forgetting capability while ensuring controlled and coherent responses to forget set prompts. (b) provides a high-level overview of \lunar, which employs an activation recalibration technique to optimize the MLP down-projection, leveraging the modelâ€™s inherent ability to express its inability to answer when queried about unlearned data.}
