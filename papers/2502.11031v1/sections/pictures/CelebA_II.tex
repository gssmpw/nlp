\caption{Investigation of Type II Bias on CelebA. The evaluation of bias assessment metrics is conducted on \emph{unbiased} testing set. As bias strength diminishes ($H(Y|A)$ increases, rendering the attribute less predictive of the target), the accuracies of both \emph{unbiased} and \emph{bias-conflicting} enhance, and the bias assessed by metrics tailored to evaluate Type II Bias is also mitigated.}
