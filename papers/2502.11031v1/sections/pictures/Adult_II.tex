\caption{Illustration of Type II Bias on Adult which manifests as the dependence between model prediction and attribute. 
As Type II Bias intensifies ($H(Y|A)$ decreases, rendering the attribute more predictable of the target), the prediction probability in outputting a specific prediction diverges between females and males, \ie decision-making increasingly relies on the attribute.}
