  The enrichment of the concept ``bias" in machine intelligence with important milestones. Initially, ``bias" implied that human decision-making depends on protected attributes (Type II Bias). As machine intelligence began aiding human decision-making processes, the subject of ``bias" broadened from humans to algorithms. Along with the continued advances of machine intelligence, a new aspect of bias issues, performance disparity across demographic groups (Type I Bias), further enriched the meaning of ``bias".
  Currently, addressing both Type I Bias and Type II Bias becomes essential for ensuring Trustworthy AI.
