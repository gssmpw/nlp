\caption{Illustration of Type I Bias on Adult which manifests as uneven performance between the minority and majority groups. As Type I Bias becomes stronger (the minority size decreases), the accuracy for minority group diminishes while the accuracy for majority group remains unchanged, thereby enlarging the performance disparity across the minority and majority groups.}
