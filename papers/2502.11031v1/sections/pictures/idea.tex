  \caption{The same set of terminology about bias is interpreted differently by experts, which significantly confuses the understanding of the audience. By investigating \pc papers about prevalent bias issues, we discover that there exists significant confusion regarding these prevalent bias issues. The confusion is evident in several ways such as ambiguity of terminology, inaccurate motivation, and lack of terminology reuse.
  Most notably, several studies inaccurately motivate themselves on a particular bias while actually addressing a different type of bias. 
  This prevailing confusion considerably impedes the clarity of related work. 
  Thus, we propose new definitions to unify the existing literature and pave a clear path for future research.}
