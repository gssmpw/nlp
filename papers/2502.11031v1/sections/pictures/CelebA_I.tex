\caption{Investigation of Type I Bias on CelebA with males as minority group. As bias strength diminishes (the size of minority group enlarges), the accuracy of minority group enhances, leading to a reduction in the accuracy disparity between females and males, and the bias assessed by metrics tailored to evaluate Type I Bias is also mitigated.}
