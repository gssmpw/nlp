\label{sec:suggestion}
In this section, we propose several suggestions to elucidate how researchers engaged in bias-related work can avoid the existing confusion in~\cref{sec:confusion}.
First, we suggest that researchers explicitly and precisely specify the type of bias they address, and avoid vague terminology. 
In this sense, utilizing terminology which is unequivocally defined, \eg Type I Bias and Type II Bias, will provide clear and undisputed information.
Second, we recommend that researchers derive motivation for their own work from the work that addresses the identical type of bias.
By doing this, the existing confusion can be gradually diminished.
Third, we advise researchers to abstain from introducing new terminology for previously discussed biases, and clarify the difference between previous definitions and the newly proposed definition if the new definition is necessary.
Hereby, the reuse of established terms will help foster a clear and unified community.
