\label{sec:conclusion}
Through an investigation of \pc papers, we uncover the substantial confusion, surrounding two prevalent types of biases within the machine learning community, which amplifies the learning burden for new researchers.
Subsequently, we delve into the possible causes of the confusion.
Most notably, we observe that researchers from diverse backgrounds hold different preconceptions about bias, leading to a lack of unified terminology for the same type of bias over an extended period.
To alleviate the existing confusion and restore clarity in the literature, we present mathematical definitions for these two prevalent types of biases. 
Furthermore, we unify a comprehensive list of papers under these definitions and distinguish these two types of biases from multiple perspectives.
Through this endeavor, we seek to facilitate the discussion on bias-related issues among researchers with diverse backgrounds.
