In this paper, we studied a probabilistic model for a comparison-based recommender system: the concatenation of the classical matrix factorization framework with a Plackett-Luce-style comparison oracle.
We proved that, given a relatively sparse dataset, the parameters of the model can be recovered through an efficient, gradient descent based algorithm, despite the loss function being nonconvex.
Our proof rests on establishing that the loss function satisfies properties akin to smoothness and strong convexity in a neighborhood around the optimal solution.
For our analysis, we made two assumptions: we are given a warm start and we observe the exact choice probabilities (rather than binary outcomes).
We hope that our work will form the basis of further analysis of this problem that performs a global analysis or provides guarantees for data with noisy comparisons. 
Finally, we believe that this work is an important contribution in establishing the viability of comparison-based recommender systems.
