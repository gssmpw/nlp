Let there be $n_1$ users and $n_2$ items. %
Each user $u$ and each item $i$ has a $r$-dimensional feature vector. %
The inner product of these two feature vectors gives the utility (or score) $x^*_{u,i}$ that user $u$ has for item $i$. 
This modeling assumption implies that
the score matrix $X^* \in \Real{n_1 \times n_2}$ has rank $r$, and thus admits the following rank-$r$ SVD:
\begin{align}
    X^* = U^* \Sigma^* V^{*T},
\end{align}
where $U^* \in \Real{n_1 \times r}$ and $V^* \in \Real{n_2 \times r}$ are matrices that satisfy $U^{*T} U^* = V^{*T} V^* = I_r$, and $\Sigma^* \in \Real{r \times r}$ is a diagonal matrix with entries $\sigma_1^* \geq \ldots \geq \sigma_r^* > 0$. Let $\kappa \triangleq \sigma_1^*/\sigma_r^*$ denote the condition number of $\Sigma^*$.

Let $n = n_1 + n_2$. Define $Z^* \in \Real{n \times r}$ and $Y^* \in \Real{n \times n}$ as follows:
\begin{align}\label{eq:matrix_z}
    Z^* &= 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        U^* \\ V^*
    \end{bmatrix}
    \Sigma^{* 1/2}, \\ 
    Y^* &= Z^*Z^{*T} = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        U^*\Sigma^*U^{*T} & X^*\\
        X^{*T} & V^*\Sigma^*V^{*T}
    \end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}
From here on, we shall refer to $Z^*$ as the ground-truth matrix. Note that the singular values of $Z^*$ are $\sqrt{2\sigma_1^*}, \ldots, \sqrt{2\sigma_r^*}$.

We are given a dataset $\Dataset$ where each data point represents a comparison made by a user between two items. The size of the dataset, \textit{i.e.,} the number of data points, is represented by $m$. We index the dataset by $k$. Each data point $\Dataset_k$ is of the form $((u; i, j), w)$ and is sampled randomly as follows. The user index $u$ is chosen uniformly at random from $[n_1]$. The pair of item indices $(i,j)$ is chosen uniformly at random from the set of $n_2(n_2-1)$ pairs of distinct items. The item pair $(i,j)$ is sampled independently from $u$. The triplets for different datapoints are sampled independently of each other.

The variable $w$ reflects the outcome of the comparison made by the user $u$ between items $i$ and $j$. In the \textit{noisy} setting, $w$ is an indicator for the outcome of the comparison; it is one if $i$ is chosen and zero if $j$ is chosen. Given a triplet $(u; i, j)$, $w$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $g(x^*_{u,i} - x^*_{u,j})$, where $g: \Real{} \rightarrow (0,1)$ is a known \textit{link function} that translates real-valued preferences to a binary scale. In the \textit{noiseless} setting, $w$ is set to the expected value of the corresponding noisy case; \textit{i.e.}, $w = g(x^*_{u,i} - x^*_{u,j})$. 

In this work, we assume we are given noiseless data. We assume the link function is a smooth, strictly increasing function and is symmetric around zero in the following sense: $g(-x) = 1 - g(x)$. For example, $g(x)$ could be the logistic link function: $e^x/(1 + e^x)$; this is the link function found in the Bradley-Terry-Luce choice model. 


\subsubsection{Important Parameters}
 

\paragraph{Incoherence} For any matrix $Z$, let $\norm{Z}_{2, \infty}$ denote the maximum of the $\ell_2$ norm of its rows and let $\norm{Z}_{F}$ denote the Frobenius norm of $Z$. Define the \textit{incoherence parameter} of the ground-truth matrix as 
\begin{align}\label{eq:def_mu}
    \mu \triangleq n(\norm{Z^*}_{2, \infty}^2/\norm{Z^*}_{F}^2).
\end{align}
In principle, $\mu$ can take values from $1$ to $n$. However, the sample complexity worsens with $\mu$.

\paragraph{Link Function Bounds}  Let $I$ denote the interval {$[-{24 \mu (\norm{Z^*}_F^2}/{n}), {24 \mu (\norm{Z^*}_F^2}/{n})]$.} %
Let $\xi$ and $\Xi$ be lower and upper bounds for the following expression:
\begin{align}\label{eq:link_function_lower_bound}
    \xi &\triangleq  \min_{(x, y) \in I \times I} \frac{g'(x)g'(y)}{g(x)(1 - g(x))}, \\ 
    \Xi &\triangleq \max_{(x, y) \in I \times I} \frac{g'(x)g'(y)}{g(x)(1 - g(x))}. \label{eq:link_function_upper_bound}
\end{align}
By the assumptions on $g(\cdot)$ stated above, $\xi$ is strictly positive and $\Xi$ is finite.
For the logistic link function, $g'(x)=g(x)(1-g(x))$, which implies $\xi = g'(24 \mu (\norm{Z^*}_F^2/n))$ and $\Xi = 1/4$.
