\section{Conclusion}
This paper explores automating hardware generation with code language models and  High-Level Synthesis (\textit{HLS}).
We aim to investigate the suitability of \textit{HLS} over low-level hardware
description languages for hardware design generation.
To facilitate this, we propose benchmarks and code infrastructures for evaluating LLM-assisted \textit{HLS} design generation.
Our experimental findings reveal that, with the integration of advanced optimizations such as feedback loops and chain-of-thought techniques, 
LLM-assisted \textit{HLS} code generation shows substantial promise in designing complex hardware with high levels of
syntax and functional correctness.
