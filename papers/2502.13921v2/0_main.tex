\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming languages such as \textit{Python} and \textit{C++}, opening new opportunities for automating software development and enhancing programmer productivity. 
The potential of LLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring automated hardware generation and automation.
Although preliminary endeavors have been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages (HDLs) such as \textit{Verilog} and \textit{SystemVerilog}, several challenges persist in this direction.
First, the volume of available HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for software programming languages. 
Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored for software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone. 
Third, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens compared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy consumption.
To tackle these challenges,
this paper explores leveraging LLMs to generate High-Level Synthesis (\textit{HLS})-based hardware design.
Although code generation for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the literature,
we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and evaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of \textit{HLS} over low-level HDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation.
To achieve this, we first finetune pre-trained models for \textit{HLS}-based hardware generation, using a collected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference \textit{HLS} designs.
An LLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code generation, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback loops promoting techniques on \textit{HLS}- design generation.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
Limited by the timeframe of this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the future.
