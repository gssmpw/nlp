  abstract={In this paper, we present our preliminary experiments on tweets sentiment analysis. This experiment is designed to extract sentiment based on subjects that exist in tweets. It detects the sentiment that refers to the specific subject using Natural Language Processing techniques. To classify sentiment, our experiment consists of three main steps, which are subjectivity classification, semantic association, and polarity classification. The experiment utilizes sentiment lexicons by defining the grammatical relationship between sentiment lexicons and subject. Experimental results show that the proposed system is working better than current text sentiment analysis tools, as the structure of tweets is not same as regular text.},

  abstract={In natural language processing (NLP), Sentiment analysis is flourishing rapidly as it aims at finding the emotional tone behind a piece of text and helps in understanding the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within an online mention. The internet is flooded with large amounts of data such as texts, photos, audio, and video. With the help of sentiment analysis, we can find useful information from this data. This paper presents various approaches in sentiment analysis used by researchers and the major challenges faced in this field. By analyzing different papers, we came to know that the most widely used techniques in machine learning are Naïve Bayes and SVM and in NLP, the lexicon-based approach is used. With the advancement in technology, sentiment analysis will be available for the public and smaller companies as well.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a method within natural language processing that evaluates and identifies the emotional tone or mood conveyed in textual data. Scrutinizing words and phrases categorizes them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The significance of sentiment analysis lies in its capacity to derive valuable insights from extensive textual data, empowering businesses to grasp customer sentiments, make informed choices, and enhance their offerings. For the further advancement of sentiment analysis, gaining a deep understanding of its algorithms, applications, current performance, and challenges is imperative. Therefore, in this extensive survey, we began exploring the vast array of application domains for sentiment analysis, scrutinizing them within the context of existing research. We then delved into prevalent pre-processing techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics to enhance comprehension. We also explored Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Pre-trained models in sentiment analysis, providing insights into their advantages and drawbacks. Subsequently, we precisely reviewed the experimental results and limitations of recent state-of-the-art articles. Finally, we discussed the diverse challenges encountered in sentiment analysis and proposed future research directions to mitigate these concerns. This extensive review provides a complete understanding of sentiment analysis, covering its models, application domains, results analysis, challenges, and research directions.}

Accurate interpretation of emotions and actions is essential as it expresses the true meaning of messages. This study explores automating sentiment analysis using multimedia inputs—audio, video, and text—through Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Decision Trees (DTs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and K-Means Clustering are analyzed for sentiment classification. The research presents a comparison of previous studies and develops a real-time sentiment analysis system for assessing day-to-day attitudes and providing recommendations.},

Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), discovered in 2001, most commonly causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in young children, but is also a concern for elderly subjects and immune-compromised patients. hMPV is the major etiological agent responsible for about 5% to 10% of hospitalizations of children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections. hMPV infection can cause severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, and its symptoms are indistinguishable from those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus. Initial infection with hMPV usually occurs during early childhood, but re-infections are common throughout life. Due to the slow growth of the virus in cell culture, molecular methods (such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)) are the preferred diagnostic modality for detecting hMPV. A few vaccine candidates have been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease, but none are yet commercially available. Our understanding of hMPV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we will review the currently available information on the molecular biology and epidemiology of hMPV. We will also review the current therapeutic interventions and strategies being used to control hMPV infection, with an emphasis on possible approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against hMPV.}

ABSTRACT = {Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen that has gained increasing recognition due to advancements in molecular diagnostic tools, which have improved its detection and characterization. While severe disease manifestations are traditionally associated with pediatric, elderly, or immunocompromised patients, hMPV-related pneumonia in immunocompetent adults remains underexplored. Methods: This case report describes a 68-year-old male who developed severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by hMPV despite being immunocompetent and having no significant comorbidities. The diagnosis was confirmed via multiplex RT-PCR, excluding bacterial and viral coinfections. Laboratory and imaging findings supported a viral etiology, while empirical antibiotics were initially prescribed due to diagnostic uncertainty. Results: The patient presented with respiratory symptoms that progressed to hypoxia, productive cough, and fatigue, requiring hospitalization. Imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations typical of viral pneumonia. Molecular diagnostics enabled accurate pathogen identification and guiding appropriate management, and the patient fully recovered with supportive care. Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of rapid molecular diagnostics for hMPV, reducing unnecessary antibiotics and enhancing management. Routine incorporation of hMPV testing into clinical protocols could improve the diagnosis and resource use. The development of vaccines, such as the IVX-A12 in phase II trials, offers hope for targeted prevention, underscoring the need for further research and therapeutic innovations.},
