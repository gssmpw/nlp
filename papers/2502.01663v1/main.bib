ABSTRACT = {Background: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a respiratory pathogen that has gained increasing recognition due to advancements in molecular diagnostic tools, which have improved its detection and characterization. While severe disease manifestations are traditionally associated with pediatric, elderly, or immunocompromised patients, hMPV-related pneumonia in immunocompetent adults remains underexplored. Methods: This case report describes a 68-year-old male who developed severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by hMPV despite being immunocompetent and having no significant comorbidities. The diagnosis was confirmed via multiplex RT-PCR, excluding bacterial and viral coinfections. Laboratory and imaging findings supported a viral etiology, while empirical antibiotics were initially prescribed due to diagnostic uncertainty. Results: The patient presented with respiratory symptoms that progressed to hypoxia, productive cough, and fatigue, requiring hospitalization. Imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations typical of viral pneumonia. Molecular diagnostics enabled accurate pathogen identification and guiding appropriate management, and the patient fully recovered with supportive care. Conclusion: This case underscores the importance of rapid molecular diagnostics for hMPV, reducing unnecessary antibiotics and enhancing management. Routine incorporation of hMPV testing into clinical protocols could improve the diagnosis and resource use. The development of vaccines, such as the IVX-A12 in phase II trials, offers hope for targeted prevention, underscoring the need for further research and therapeutic innovations.},

abstract = {Summary
Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), discovered in 2001, most commonly causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in young children, but is also a concern for elderly subjects and immune-compromised patients. hMPV is the major etiological agent responsible for about 5% to 10% of hospitalizations of children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections. hMPV infection can cause severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children, and its symptoms are indistinguishable from those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus. Initial infection with hMPV usually occurs during early childhood, but re-infections are common throughout life. Due to the slow growth of the virus in cell culture, molecular methods (such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)) are the preferred diagnostic modality for detecting hMPV. A few vaccine candidates have been shown to be effective in preventing clinical disease, but none are yet commercially available. Our understanding of hMPV has undergone major changes in recent years and in this article we will review the currently available information on the molecular biology and epidemiology of hMPV. We will also review the current therapeutic interventions and strategies being used to control hMPV infection, with an emphasis on possible approaches that could be used to develop an effective vaccine against hMPV.}

Furthermore, properly identified reviews present a baseline of information as an input to different systems, such as e-learning systems, decision support systems etc. However, the data preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis, since selecting the appropriate preprocessing methods, the correctly classified instances can be increased. In view of the above, this research paper explains the necessary information to get preprocess the reviews in order to find sentiment and make analysis whether it is positive or negative. Extended comparison of sentiment polarity classification methods for Twitter text and the role of text preprocessing in sentiment analysis are discussed in depth. In the set of tests, possible combinations of methods and report on their efficiency were included, conducting experiments using manually annotated Twitter datasets.

We have summarized many preprocessing techniques which were performed to clean and normalize data, negation handling, intensification handling to improve the performances. Moreover, data augmentation techniques, which generate new data from the original data to enrich training data without user intervention, have also been presented. In experiments, we have performed various aspects and obtained competitive results which may motivate the next propositions.}

Generally the quality, relevancy and popularity of the video is maintained based on this rating. Sometimes irrelevant and low quality videos ranked higher in the search result due to the number of views or likes, which seems untenable. To minimize this issue, we present a Natural Language processing (NLP) based sentiment analysis approach on user comments. This analysis helps to find out the most relevant and popular video of YouTube according to the search. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been proved by a data driven experiment in terms of accuracy of finding relevant, popular and high quality video..}

The topic identification module processes each acquired data item and assigns it topics from a defined topic hierarchy. The topic hierarchy is quite extensive – it contains about 450 topics and topic categories. It can easily happen that for some narrowly focused topic there is not enough data for the topic identification training. Lemmatization is shown to improve the results when dealing with sparse data in the area of information retrieval, therefore the effects of lemmatization on topic identification results is studied in the paper. On the other hand, since the system is used for processing large amounts of data, a summarization method was implemented and the effect of using only the summary of an article on the topic identification accuracy is studied..}

Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, we first construct and empirically validate a gold-standard list of lexical features (along with their associated sentiment intensity measures) which are specifically attuned to sentiment in microblog-like contexts. We then combine these lexical features with consideration for five general rules that embody grammatical and syntactical conventions for expressing and emphasizing sentiment intensity. Interestingly, using our parsimonious rule-based model to assess the sentiment of tweets, we find that VADER outperforms individual human raters (F1 Classification Accuracy = 0.96 and 0.84, respectively), and generalizes more favorably across contexts than any of our benchmarks..}

So observing and identifying many contents, including threats and sexual harassment, are more accessible than traditional media. Online content with extreme toxicity can lead to online harassment, profanity, personal attacks, and bullying acts. As Bangla is the seventh most spoken language worldwide, the utilization of Bangla language in Facebook has raised current times. The use of abusive comments on Facebook with Bangla also has increased alarmingly, but the research regarding this is very low. In this research work, we concentrate on identifying abusive comments of Bangla language in social media (Facebook) that can filter out at the primitive stage of social media’s affixing. To classify abusive comments swiftly and precisely, we apply transformer-based deep neural network models. We employ pre-training language architectures, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and ELECTRA (Efficiency Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately). We have conducted this work with a novel dataset comprises 44,001 comments from multitudinous Facebook posts. In this classification process, we have exhibited an average accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score to evaluate our proposed models. The outcomes have brought a percipience of our applied BERT and ELECTRA architecture that performs notably with 85.00% and 84.92% test accuracy, respectively.}
