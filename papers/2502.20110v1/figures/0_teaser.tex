    We introduce \ourmodel, a novel approach that directly predicts 3D points in a scene with only one image as input. 
    \ourmodel incorporates a camera self-prompting mechanism and leverages a spherical 3D output space defined by azimuth and elevation angles, and depth($\theta$, $\phi$, $z$).
    This design effectively separates camera and depth optimization by avoiding gradient flowing to the camera module due to depth-related error ($\varepsilon_z$) compared to the standard Cartesian representation.}
