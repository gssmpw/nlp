    \caption{\textbf{Confidence invariance.} The uncertainty output of \ourmodel represents the predicted error. The confidence is obtained as the inverse uncertainty and the output is evaluated by taking into account only the pixels with a confidence higher than the corresponding x-axis. Y-axis reports the normalized RMSE to have a consistent scale among different datasets, where normalization involves dividing the RMSE by the value with threshold 0, namely evaluating over all pixels.}
