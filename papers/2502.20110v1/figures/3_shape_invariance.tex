    \caption{\textbf{Invariance to image shape.} \ourmodel is trained with a variable input shape pipeline in addition to random resizing for each of the image pairs. The proposed training strategy improves the robustness in terms of predicted depth scale and accuracy ($\delta_1$) to the input image's shape compared to two other state-of-the-art methods.}
