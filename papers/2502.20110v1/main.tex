}

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,clip,keepaspectratio]{images/luigi.pdf}}]{Luigi Piccinelli} is a Ph.D. candidate at ETH Z\"urich, Computer Vision Lab, supervised by Prof. Luc Van Gool and Dr. Christos Sakaridis.
His research focuses on 3D perception, particularly advancing generalization for ill-posed problems such as monocular depth estimation, both from single images and videos.
He has also explored tracking and domain adaptation.
He obtained his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical Engineering from University of Bologna and ETH Zurich, respectively.

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,clip,keepaspectratio]{images/christos.pdf}}]{Christos Sakaridis} is a lecturer at ETH Z\"urich and a senior postdoctoral researcher at Computer Vision Lab of ETH Z\"urich.
The focus of his research is on semantic and geometric visual perception, involving multiple domains, visual conditions, and visual or non-visual modalities. Since 2021, he has been the Principal Engineer in TRACE Zurich, a large-scale project on computer vision for autonomous cars and robots.
He received the ETH Z\"urich Career Seed Award in 2022.
He obtained his PhD from ETH Z\"urich in 2021, having worked at Computer Vision Lab.
Before that, he received his MSc in Computer Science from ETH Z\"urich in 2016 and his Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from National Technical University of Athens in 2014.
