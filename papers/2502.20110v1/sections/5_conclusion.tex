\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\blue{We introduced \ourmodel, a universal monocular metric depth estimation model that enhances generalization across diverse domains without requiring camera parameters at test time.
By improving both the model architecture and introducing new loss functions in the training objective, \ourmodel achieves state-of-the-art performance while enhancing computational efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations.
Additionally, our training strategy enables a flexible trade-off between inference speed and detail preservation by allowing variable input resolutions at test time while maintaining global scale consistency.}
