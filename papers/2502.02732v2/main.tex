\section*{Impact Statement}
The rapid advancement of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has enabled remarkable breakthroughs in natural language understanding and generation. However, these models also pose significant challenges, including concerns around safety, bias, and the computational cost associated with large-scale training. As LLMs become increasingly integral to various AI applications, ensuring their stability, efficiency, and accessibility remains a critical research focus.

Our work addresses these challenges by proposing a more stable and cost-effective large-scale training methodology. By improving training efficiency and reducing the associated computational overhead, we lower the barrier to entry for organizations seeking to develop or fine-tune foundation models. This democratization of LLM technology fosters broader participation in AI research and development, accelerating innovation while mitigating concerns over resource concentration in a few major players. Given the growing industry focus on optimizing LLM deployment costs, our contributions are particularly relevant in the current AI research landscape.


Another positive externality of improving the cost-effectiveness of large-scale training is the reduction in the environmental impact of AI research. Training state-of-the-art LLMs requires vast computational resources, leading to significant energy consumption and carbon emissions. By enhancing the efficiency of large-scale training, our approach helps mitigate these environmental costs, making AI research more sustainable. Lowering the energy footprint of training not only aligns with global efforts toward greener computing but also enables a wider range of institutions, including smaller research labs and academic groups, to participate in cutting-edge AI development without excessive resource constraints. This shift promotes a more inclusive and responsible AI ecosystem, ensuring that advancements in foundation models are both accessible and environmentally conscious.

% This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
