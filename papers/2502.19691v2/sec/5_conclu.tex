\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we demonstrate that focusing solely on either epistemic uncertainty (EU) or aleatoric uncertainty (AU) in open-world active learning scenarios does not yield satisfactory performance. We argue that the most informative examples should primarily belong to closed-set classes, exhibiting low EU scores, ensuring that the derived AU metric is meaningful, and secondarily, should show high AU scores. To achieve this, we propose EAOA, a novel framework for addressing the challenging active open-set annotation problem. In EAOA, both types of uncertainty are defined in the form of free energy: EU is evaluated by the detector from both learning-based and data-driven perspectives, while AU is measured by the target classifier through class confusion. Additionally, we introduce a margin-based energy loss to enhance the detector's ability to distinguish known from unknown classes and a target-driven strategy to adaptively adjust the size of the candidate set obtained in the first query stage. Extensive experimental results across various tasks demonstrate EAOA's superiority.
