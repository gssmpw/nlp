% \paragraph{Brief Conclusion.}
In this paper, we propose the first comprehensive benchmark, \textit{BackdoorDM}, for backdoor learning in DMs. It includes nine SOTA attacks, four SOTA defenses, and two effective visualization methods. 
%Notably, we systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, then provide a unified backdoor evaluation method based on GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments highlight several important conclusions for future work. We hope that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy DMs community.
Notably, we systematically classify and formulate the existing literature within a unified framework and provide a standardized backdoor evaluation method based on GPT-4o. Our extensive experiments yield several important conclusions to guide future research. We hope that BackdoorDM will help address current challenges and contribute to building a trustworthy DMs community.

\paragraph{Limitations.}
Until now, BackdoorDM has mainly focused on benchmarking unconditional diffusion and text-to-image diffusion models, which have been extensively discussed in the backdoor-learning literature. In the future, we plan to extend it to other essential domains, such as text-to-speech (TTS) and text-to-video (T2V).
