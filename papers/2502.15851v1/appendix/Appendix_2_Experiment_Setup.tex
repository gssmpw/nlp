\textcolor{red}{Instruction Following Baseline Example:} \\
\textcolor{mycolor}{System:} {} <Empty>

\textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain at least 10 sentences.}} \\

% \textcolor{mycolor}{System:} {} 

% \textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain less than 5 sentences.}} \\

\textcolor{red}{No Priority Baseline Example:} \\
\textcolor{mycolor}{System:} {} <Empty>

\textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain at least 10 sentences.}} \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain less than 5 sentences.} \\

\textcolor{red}{Pure Separation Configuration Example:} \\
\textcolor{mycolor}{System:} \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain at least 10 sentences.} 

\textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain less than 5 sentences.}} \\

\textcolor{red}{Pure Separation Configuration Example:} \\
\textcolor{mycolor}{System:} \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain at least 10 sentences.} 

\textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain less than 5 sentences.}} \\

\textcolor{red}{Task Repeated Separation Example:} \\
\textcolor{mycolor}{System:} 
{Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain at least 10 sentences.}}

\textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain less than 5 sentences.}} \\

\textcolor{red}{Emphasized Separation Example:} \\
\textcolor{mycolor}{System:} \textcolor{highlight}{You must always follow this constraint: Your response should contain at least 10 sentences.} 

\textcolor{mycolor}{User:} {Write a blog post about a trip to Japan. \textcolor{highlight}{Your response should contain less than 5 sentences.}} \\

\textcolor{red}{Note:} The Instruction Following Baseline tests constraints individually. The No Priority Baseline averages results across both possible constraint orderings to isolate ordering effects. For Separation Configurations, each constraint in a pair is evaluated as the primary constraint in the system message. Shown is one prioritization direction (10-sentence requirement as primary); our experiments test both directions for each constraint pair.
