\section{Problem Identification}\label{sec:problem}

% result first


Despite widespread adoption in deployed LLM systems, system/user prompt separation fails to provide a reliable instruction hierarchy, with models inconsistently getting confused by even simple formatting conflicts. In this section, we demonstrate how instruction hierarchy failures occur through controlled experiments.

To evaluate whether system/user prompt separation effectively manages instruction authority in LLMs, we propose constraint prioritization as a probe to reveal how models handle competing directives. This section presents a systematic framework (\Cref{fig:framework}) for investigating how LLMs handle conflicting directives through carefully designed constraint pairs. When presented with two contradictory but individually valid constraints, the model's output reveals which constraint exerts stronger control over the generation process. By varying how these constraints are presented in the model input, we can robustly investigate whether the system/user prompt separation effectively enforces the intended hierarchical control.

\subsection{Dataset Construction}\label{sec:dataset}
Our dataset construction process follows a hierarchical approach, building from basic tasks to complex prompts with conflicting constraints.


\paragraph{Base Tasks} We curated 100 diverse tasks covering common LLM applications such as writing emails, stories, advertisements, and analytical responses, based on \citet{zhou2023instruction}. Each task is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate various types of output constraints while maintaining its core objective. An example task is \ex{Write a blog post about a trip to Japan} as in \Cref{fig:example_instruction}, and more examples are provided in \Cref{fig:base_tasks} in \Cref{app:base_tasks}.

\paragraph{Output Constraints} In this study, we focus on explicitly conflicting constraints that are both mutually exclusive and programmatically verifiable. Previously, \citet{zhou2023instruction} created the IFEval dataset, which systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to follow different types of output constraints. Based on model performance on IFEval, we selected six types of constraints that models can reliably follow when presented individually.\footnote{The baseline instruction-following performance for individual constraints (averaged across the constraint pairs and across different conflicts) is presented in \Cref{tab:model_performance_filtered} as IF baseline.} 
See \Cref{tab:conflicts} for the conflicts (``conflicting constraint pairs'').

\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Task--Constraint Combinations} 
We combine each base task with each constraint pair, designating one constraint as primary (i.e., taking priority over the other). We include both possible priority designations, resulting in a total of $100\times6\times2 = 1,200$ unique test data points. 

\paragraph{Rich Context Enhancement} To enhance the robustness of our findings, we created enriched versions of each prompt with expanded task descriptions and constraints while preserving the core conflicts (via few-shot prompting). An author of the paper verified that the enrichments preserved the original semantics of the tasks while adding realistic complexity to the prompts. An example comparing a base prompt and its enriched version is shown in \Cref{fig:example_instruction}.

\subsection{Instruction Priority Mechanism}\label{sec:mechanism}

\paragraph{Baselines} \label{sec:baselines}
Before examining how models handle instruction conflicts, we establish two baseline conditions to understand their fundamental behavior:
\textbf{(1) Instruction Following Baseline (IF)} Tests each model's ability to follow individual constraints in isolation, establishing baseline performance for each constraint type without competing instructions.
\textbf{(2) No Priority Baseline (NP)} Places all instructions (base task and both constraints) in the user message without using the hierarchical structure, revealing the model's internal bias on different output constraints (\Cref{sec:bias}). The baseline is obtained by averaging over both priority designations to isolate the effects of instruction ordering. 


\paragraph{User/System Separation Configurations}
We examine multiple configurations of the system/user prompt separation to assess its effectiveness as a priority control mechanism:
\textbf{Pure Separation (Pure)} places the primary constraint in the system message as a system-level directive, while keeping the base task and the secondary constraint in the user message.
\textbf{Task Repeated Separation (Task)} repeats the task description in both messages while maintaining constraint separation, mirroring common deployment patterns where system messages define general roles that are instantiated by specific user requests.\footnote{For example, a system message might define an \ex{email-writing assistant that writes concise emails}, while the user requests \ex{a detailed project update email}, creating natural task--constraint conflicts.}
\textbf{Emphasized Separation (Emph.)} enhances the system message with explicit priority declaration (\ex{You must always follow this constraint}).\footnote{Examples of these baselines and separation configurations are in \Cref{fig:example_prompt_sep} in \Cref{app:example_prompt_sep}.}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\label{sec:evaluation}

\paragraph{Outcome Categories}
Given our set of prompts with conflicting constraints and some resolution policy, we programmatically verify constraint satisfaction in the responses to compute:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Primary Obedience Rate (R1): The proportion of responses where only the primary (i.e., prioritized) constraint is satisfied.
\item Secondary Obedience Rate (R2): The proportion of responses where only the secondary (not prioritized) constraint is satisfied.
\item Non-Compliance Rate (R3): The proportion of responses where neither constraint is satisfied,
\end{compactitem}
where R1 + R2 + R3 = 1. By design, our constraints are mutually exclusive. For output format constraints (e.g., all uppercase vs.\ all lowercase, or French vs.\ English), any partial satisfaction attempt (such as mixing cases or providing translations) contributes to R3, as it fails to fully satisfy either requirement. These rates are calculated from experimental observations across all conflict types.
Importantly, the constraint satisfaction is determined on the task-relevant output after removing the explicit conflict acknowledgement from the responses (e.g., \ex{I notice contradictory instructions asking for\ldots}) through few-shot prompting. The analysis of the these acknowledgement behaviors will be presented in \Cref{sec:conflict_acknowledgement}.

\subsection{The Failure of Instruction Hierarchies}\label{sec:result1}

We evaluated six state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open and closed-source models across different scales.\footnote{Check \Cref{app:model-mapping} for model versions and abbreviations.} For observation robustness, our evaluation covers both simple and rich instruction settings, with three different system/user prompt separation configurations: Pure separation (Pure), Task Repeated separation (Task), and Emphasized Separation (Emph.). The results are presented in \Cref{tab:model_performance_filtered}.




\paragraph{Instruction Following Baseline} First, we observe that all models demonstrate strong performance (ranging from 74.8--90.8\%) when following individual constraints without conflicts. This confirms that these models are capable of understanding and executing our selected constraints when presented in isolation.


\paragraph{Priority Adherence Performance} However, the Primary Obedience Rate (R1)  in \Cref{tab:model_performance_filtered} --- the percentage of responses that follow the primary constraint --- reveals concerning results about the effectiveness of system/user prompt separation as a priority mechanism. We observe the following: 
\textbf{(1)} Most models show dramatically lower performance (9.6--45.8\% average R1) when handling conflicting constraints, compared to their baseline instruction-following capabilities.
\textbf{(2)} Different separation configurations (Pure, Task, Emph.) show varying effectiveness, but none consistently maintains the intended hierarchy. Even for the emphasized separation configuration, where priority is explicitly stated, the obedience rate remains far from reliable priority control (GPT4o with 63.8\% average R1 performs the best on simple instructions and Claude with 47.5\% performs the best on rich-context instructions).
\textbf{(3)} Larger models don't necessarily perform better --- for example, Llama-70B (average 16.4\%) shows only modest improvements over its 8B counterpart (average 10.1\%), and GPT4o (average 40.8\%) is even worse than GPT4o-mini (average 45.8\%), despite their better instruction following performance.
\textbf{(4)} Performance patterns remain similar between simple and rich instructions, suggesting that the failure of the user/system prompt separation priority mechanism is a robust observation rather than context-dependent.

Our analysis suggests that the widely-adopted system/user separation fails to reliably enforce instruction hierarchies in LLMs.
