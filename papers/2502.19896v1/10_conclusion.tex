\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this study, we make the first attempt to leverage a pre-trained 3D generative model for zero-shot point cloud completion and introduce GenPC.
To capitalize on the generative modelâ€™s inherent generalization ability, our framework consists of two key components: Depth Prompting and Geometric-Preserving Fusion.
The Depth Prompting module prompts an image-to-3D generative model with the partial point cloud. Then, the Geometric Preserving Fusion module aligns the partial input with the generated 3D shape by dynamically adjusting its pose and scale. 
Experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate that GenPC achieves state-of-the-art performance. With the explicit geometric prior from the 3D generative model, GenPC takes a step closer towards robust real-world scan completion.
