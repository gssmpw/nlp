\section{Conclusion} 
\label{sec:conclude}
We have introduced \modis, 
a framework that generate skyline datasets to improve data science 
models on multiple performance measures. 
We have formalized skyline data generation 
with transducers %with an estimation model, 
equipped with augment and reduction operators. 
We show the hardness and fixed-parameter 
tractability of the problem. 
%and verified 
%%their properties in terms of terminating, 
%confluence and expressiveness. 
We have introduced three algorithms 
that compute approximate Skyline sets 
%of datasets  
in terms of $\epsilon$-Skyline set, 
with reduce-from-universal, bi-directional, 
and diversification paradigms. 
Our experiments have verified 
their effectiveness and efficiency.

A future topic is to 
enhance \modis with query optimization 
techniques to scale it for larger 
input with high-dimensional data.
%to adapt query optimization techniques, such as streamlining operators by minimizing redundant operations and reducing intermediate data sizes, to improve efficiency in handling large datasets.}
Another topic is to extend \modis 
%with parallel algorithms 
%to maintain the  
%datasets upon changes of the 
%source datasets. 
%Another topic is 
%to develop effective 
%with 
%parallel algorithms 
for distributed Skyline 
data generation.
