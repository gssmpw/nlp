\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose SNAP, an efficient method for discovering the relevant portion of the CPDAG for causal effect estimation between target variables.
SNAP does not require prior knowledge of ancestral relationships and identifies statistically efficient adjustment sets.
We introduce two variants: SNAP($k$), which can be used as a preprocessing step for other discovery algorithms, and SNAP($\infty$), a stand-alone sound and complete discovery algorithm.
Our experiments show that both variants significantly reduce the number of CI tests and computation time while maintaining a comparable intervention distance. 
Future work will explore extending SNAP to causally insufficient settings.
