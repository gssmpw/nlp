    \caption{\small \textbf{Qualitative example of \tot{} failing to encourage full subgoal coverage.} The video demonstration shows how to open a door by latching on the door handle, but it speeds through the movement after latching. \tot{} trains a slow agent that fails to complete the task due to its diagonal-like matching matrix, but \orca{} trains a successful agent that completes the task efficiently.
