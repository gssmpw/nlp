    \caption{\small \textbf{Failure case for OT reward in the Humanoid environment.} The OT optimal coupling matrix (left matrix) shows that when the learner's arms are moving downward (around timestep 60, denoted by $o^{L}_{60}$ on the left), the corresponding assignments in the matrix also progress forward along the demonstration trajectory. However, the OT reward increases from approximately $0.2$ to $0.6$, suggesting a higher reward when the humanoid's movements do not accurately match the intended complex motions.}
