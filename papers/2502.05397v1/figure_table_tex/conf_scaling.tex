    \caption{\textbf{The impact of confidence scaling on rewards for a trajectory where the robot falls down}. The ground truth trajectory is shown on top and renders of the model's joint predictions given the top frames are shown on the bottom. The rewards are computed with respect to the final reference image of the left arm wave task. Once the robot starts falling, there is a distribution shift in the images, and the model predicts that the robot is upright. This leads to high reward predictions, but also high uncertainty estimates. When corrected using the confidence function, the reward shape improves significantly.}
