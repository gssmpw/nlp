\paragraph{Agent-Based Models.}
Agent-based models (ABMs) provide a powerful framework for studying collective behavior and emergent phenomena in complex systems ____. By simulating agent interactions, ABMs capture macro-level patterns such as market fluctuations and social dynamics ____. They encode key behavioral traits—such as fundamentalist and chartist trading, herding tendencies, and decision-making heterogeneity—into simplified rules like strategy switching and structural stochastic volatility (SSV) ____. This abstraction effectively reproduces financial market stylized facts, including fat-tailed return distributions and volatility clustering ____. Recent advances integrate machine learning, enhancing ABMs' realism and predictive power ____.

\paragraph{LLMs for Behavioral Simulation.} 


Large language models (LLMs) excel at simulating complex human behaviors, from rational decision-making and financial market analysis to replicating behavioral biases like herding and overconfidence ____. Beyond behavioral simulation, they enable fine-grained modeling of individual actions and large-scale emergent phenomena ____. LLMs naturally exhibit demographic diversity, such as gender, age, and education, while engaging in rich social interactions ____. By automating text analysis, generating experimental stimuli, and designing multi-agent systems, they offer powerful tools for social science research ____.
