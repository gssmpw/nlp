\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we examine the privacy risk of using public datasets as the knowledge transfer medium in FD through the lens of label distribution information and membership information leakage, measured by attack success rates.
We evaluate three public-dataset-assisted FD frameworks (FedMD, DS-FL, and Cronus) using our proposed LDIA method and two MIA methods: Co-op LiRA and Distillation-based LiRA.
Our LDIA method performs considerably well measured in KL divergence (an average KL divergence of 0.10 in one setup), demonstrating a non-trivial risk level of label distribution information leakage. 
Co-op LiRA and Distillation-based LiRA, two MIA attacks for FD, achieve a state-of-the-art success rate evident by relatively high TPRs at low FPRs (up to 34.61\% TPR at 1\% FPR), indicating troublesome membership leakage risk.
These findings underscore the privacy vulnerabilities that persist in PDA-FD frameworks, highlighting the need for enhanced privacy-preserving mechanisms in FD environments.
