\begin{abstract}
Despite explicit alignment efforts for large language models (LLMs), they can still be exploited to trigger unintended behaviors, a phenomenon known as "jailbreaking." Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete prompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted prompt templates and persuasion rules. However, as the capabilities of open-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial. In such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient information by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak threats. To address this research gap, we propose a novel \underline{C}ontext-\underline{C}oherent \underline{J}ailbreak \underline{A}ttack (CCJA). We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization problem within the embedding space of masked language models. Through combinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success rate with semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations show that our method not only maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness. Additionally, by integrating semantically coherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box methodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when targeting closed-source commercial LLMs. This highlights the security threat posed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts. We will open-source our code if the paper is accepted.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
% Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed content generation.
The rise of commercial (eg., ChatGPT \cite{achiam2023gpt}) and open-source large language models (LLMs), including Llama3 \cite{llama3modelcard} and Claude2 \cite{Claude2modelcard}, not only improves human life but also drives paradigm shifts across various application domains \cite{wu2023bloomberggpt, mcduff2023towards}. While researchers use various alignment techniques to ensure LLMs adhere to human values \cite{achiam2023gpt, rafailov2024direct}, ensuring their safety remains a critical area of research \cite{zhuo2023red, huang2023catastrophic, Yang2023ShadowAT}.

With the rapid advancement of open-source LLMs, the performance disparity between them and state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs is rapidly diminishing  \cite{contributors2023opencompass}.  In open-source scenarios, attackers can access not only the outputs of LLMs but also the their weights and gradients. This undoubtedly provides attackers with additional potential information, thereby exacerbating the risk of malicious exploitation of open-source LLMs. Nevertheless, existing jailbreak attack methods predominantly concentrate on black-box scenarios, where only the output text of victim LLMs is available, leading to an overestimation of the safety robustness of open-source LLMs. 
AutoDAN \cite{zhu2023autodan} highlights that semantically interpretable jailbreak prompts pose a greater threat in transferability. This suggests that identifying such prompts in open-source LLMs with low computational costs to conduct transfer attacks on closed-source commercial models may emerge as a significant security concern.

Based on the granularity of text manipulation during the prompt search process, jailbreak attacks can be classified into two types. The first type is prompt-level attacks , which utilize carefully crafted instructions and principles of social engineering to construct jailbreak prompts that induce LLMs to generate unsafe content, primarily applied in black-box methods \cite{shen2023anything, wei2024jailbroken, greshake2023not}.
The second type is token-level attacks, which treat the search for jailbreak prompts as an optimization task, aiming to find effective jailbreak handles that prompt LLMs to respond affirmatively to harmful queries, thereby eliciting unsafe content. This approach is mainly applied in white-box methods \cite{zou2023universal, liu2023autodan}. Although token-level attacks reduce the reliance on human effort, they face challenges such as lengthy search processes and poor readability of the generated jailbreak triggers.

In light of the above considerations, we propose a jailbreak attack method specifically designed for open-source LLMs to analyze the lower bound of their safety robustness with reduced computational cost. To minimize human resource consumption and leverage the powerful text generation capabilities of LLMs, we first guide the victim LLM using a seed prompt to generate an instruction-following prefix, which can then direct the LLM to execute subsequent instructions. This prefix is closer to natural language and demonstrates a stronger tendency to direct the LLMâ€™s behavior. 
The head of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) \cite{devlin2018bert, liu2019roberta} can accurately reconstruct input sentences from hidden states \cite{kao2020bert}. Inspired by this, we frame the jailbreak attack as an optimization process in the continuous word embedding space and utilize the MLM head to decode perturbed latent representations. Leveraging the extensive linguistic knowledge of the MLM head ensures the coherence and grammaticality of the generated jailbreak prompts. 

By incorporating the jailbreak prompts we developed for targeting open-source LLMs into the existing mainstream black-box attack methods, we can significantly enhance the success rate of attacks against closed-source commercial LLMs. This not only demonstrates the scalability of our attack method but also indicates that widely used open-source LLMs pose a certain security threat to closed-source commercial LLMs.

We conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our jailbreak attack method. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieved a higher jailbreak success rate, with jailbreak prompts that are more semantically fluent. In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a jailbreak attack algorithm tailored for open-source models, aiming to identify their potential safety vulnerabilities in worst-case scenarios. We also extend this method to scenarios involving multiple harmful queries and multiple victim models.
    \item Leveraging multi-objective optimization, we achieve a balance between semantic readability and the success rate of jailbreak attacks.
    \item Experimental results show that our method can generate jailbreak prefixes with semantic readability and significantly improve the performance of jailbreak attack methods in black-box settings. This indicates the security threats posed by current open-source LLMs.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure*}

Jailbreak attacks can be categorized into black-box \cite{shen2023anything, wei2024jailbroken, mehrotra2023tree, greshake2023not} and white-box attacks \cite{zou2023universal, zhu2023autodan, sadasivan2024fast, guo2024cold} based on the degree of access to the internal parameters of the target LLM. Inspired by social engineering principles, black-box attacks primarily create complex malicious queries by manually crafting high-quality jailbreak prompt templates. Additionally, some studies  \cite{shah2023scalable, zeng2024johnny} employ persona customization and persuasion techniques to generate jailbreak prompts, leading LLMs to produce harmful responses. 

Jailbroken\cite{wei2024jailbroken} points out that existing jailbreak methods, such as prompt injection and refusal suppression, arise from the conflict between LLMs' instruction-following abilities and safety goals. 
Building on this, some white-box attacks optimize jailbreak prompts at the token level, forcing the LLM to affirmatively respond to harmful queries and produce unsafe outputs. GCG \cite{zou2023universal} uses greedy and gradient-based search techniques to optimize randomly initialized jailbreak suffixes, prompting the LLM to affirm harmful requests. However, the jailbreak prompts generated by this method lack readability. In contrast, AutoDAN  \cite{zhu2023autodan} employs a genetic algorithm to refine manually crafted jailbreak prompts. Although this method generates prompts with lower PPL, it depends on human-written templates and external models (e.g., GPT-4) for mutation, limiting scalability. BEAST  \cite{sadasivan2024fast} and COLD-Attack  \cite{guo2024cold} utilize beam search and gradient-based methods, respectively, to optimize the top $k$ tokens generated by the victim LLM. Since the initial jailbreak suffix is merely a simple concatenation of the LLMâ€™s output tokens, the generated jailbreak prompts, while theoretically having low PPL, still lack sufficient semantic readability. 

To better assess the safety vulnerabilities of open-source models in worst-case scenarios, we propose an efficient token-level jailbreak attack algorithm under the white-box setting. Unlike black-box attack algorithms, our method does not require manually crafted prompt templates or external large models for auxiliary computation. Compared to white-box attack methods like GCG, our approach achieves a higher success rate in jailbreak attacks while maintaining strong semantic readability.

\section{Jailbreak Method}
\label{sec:jailbreakAttack}

In this section, we first formulate the jailbreak attack task for open-source models and then elaborate on our proposed jailbreak attack method.

\subsection{Overview}

\subsubsection{Preliminary}
Let $V$ represent the vocabulary of the LLM, $x \in V$ denote a token, and $\mathbf{x}_{1:n} = \{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n\}$ signify a sequence of tokens. For an autoregressive LLM, the probability distribution for predicting the next token given a sequence of tokens is denoted as $p_{M}(\cdot | \mathbf{x}): \mathcal{V} \rightarrow [0, 1]$. The input prompt $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{x}_{1:n}$ to the LLM generates a response $\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{x}_{n+1:n+j}$. We express $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{J} \oplus \mathbf{Q}$ , where $\oplus$ indicates the concatenation of token sequences, $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{x}_{1:m}$  is the jailbreak prefix, and $\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{x}_{m+1:n}$ represents the malicious query. The goal of our jailbreak attack is to ensure that the response $\mathbf{R}$ contains harmful content closely related to the malicious query $\mathbf{Q}$. It is unrealistic to specify a unique response $\mathbf{R}$ for each malicious query $\mathbf{Q}$. Inspired by Jailbroken \cite{wei2024jailbroken}, we define $\mathbf{R}$ as an affirmative answer that incorporates $\mathbf{Q}$. Therefore, our objective for the jailbreak attack is to optimize the jailbreak prefix $\mathbf{J}$ to maximize the probability of the LLM delivering an affirmative response: 

\begin{align}
\label{equ:autoregressive}
    p_{M}(\mathbf{x}_{n+1:n+j}|\mathbf{x}_{1:n}) 
    = \prod_{i=1}^{j} p_{M} (x_i | \mathbf{x}_{1:n}).
\end{align}


\subsubsection{Continue word embedding space attacks}
\label{sec:word-embed}
In this paper, we frame the jailbreak attack problem as an optimization task in the continuous word embedding space. 
Specifically, we represent the continuous embedding vectors in the embedding space as $\mathbf{t} = \{t_1, t_2, \cdots , t_n\}$, where n represents the number of tokens and $t_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the $d$-dimensional embedding of the $i$-th token. Given the jailbreak prefix $\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{x}_{1:m}$, our goal is to find the adversarial perturbation $\mathbb{\delta} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d}$ in the embedding space that minimizes a predefined objective function, aiming to successfully execute the LLM jailbreak attack while ensuring that the decoded continuous vectors remain semantically readable.

\subsection{The propose of CCJA}
 We decompose the local proxy masked language model $\hat{f}$ into three components: the embedding layer $f_e$, the hidden layer $f_h$, and the remaining decoder head $\mathcal{H}$, which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:proxy}
\hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) = \mathcal{H}(f_h(f_e(\mathbf{x}))).
\end{equation}
For the input sequence $\mathbf{x}$, the forward process of the local proxy masked language model in Equation \ref{equ:proxy} can be described as:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:forward}
\textbf{e} = f_e(\textbf{x}), \textbf{h}=f_h(\textbf{e}), \Theta = \mathcal{H}(\textbf{h}),
\end{equation}
where \textbf{e} represents the embedding vector of the input sequence \textbf{x}, \textbf{h} stands for the hidden state in the continuous embedding space, and \textbf{$\Theta$} refers to the logistic distribution after decoding. 
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:main}, we decompose the continuous embedding space attack problem within the MLM model. We use $f_h$ and $f_e$ as the encoder to embed the instruction-following prefix as a whole into the MLM's hidden state. The perturbation $\delta$ within the hidden state is then globally optimized through gradient-based methods. Afterward, $\mathcal{H}$ is used as the decoder to decode the optimized hidden state and obtain the jailbreak prefix.

\subsubsection{Jailbreak task}
To save manpower and fully leverage the general capabilities acquired by the LLM during pretraining, we first use a seed prompt to guide the LLM in generating an instruction-following prefix $\mathbf{x}$. According to Equation \ref{equ:forward}, the forward process of adding perturbations to the hidden state $\mathbf{h}$ of the initial prefix is as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:MLM_delta}
    \mathbf{\Theta} = \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}, \delta)= \mathcal{H}(f_h(f_e(\mathbf{x})) + \delta).
\end{equation}
To ensure that the sampling process of $\mathbf{\Theta}$ is differentiable, we use the reparameterized Gumbel-softmax  \cite{jang2016categorical} $\mathcal{G}$ to replace the traditional softmax for probability sampling. Samples $\boldsymbol{\pi} = \pi_1, \cdots, \pi_m$ from distribution $\mathbf{\Theta}$ are drawn according to the process:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:gumble-softmax}
    \pi_{i, j} := \frac{\exp \left(  \left(  \Theta_{i,j} + g_{i, j} \right) \right) / T}{\sum_{v=1}^V \exp\left( \left( \Theta_{i, v}  + g_{i, v} \right) / T \right)},
\end{equation}
where $V$ represents the size of the vocabulary, $g_{i, j} \sim \text{Gumbel(0, 1)}$ and $T > 0$ are temperature parameters that control the smoothness of the Gumbel-softmax distribution. As $T \to 0$, the distribution converges towards a one-hot distribution. 


Due to the significant difference between the LLM and MLM vocabularies, we use a mapping matrix $\mathcal{M}$ to establish a relationship between MLM and LLM token IDs. The construction of $\mathcal{M}$ is as follows:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:mappingVector}
\mathcal{M}(i, j)=\left\{\begin{matrix}
 1 & \text{if } i \in \mathbf{x}\\
 0 & \text{if } i \notin \mathbf{x}
\end{matrix}\right.,
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j=M(x_i)$. Using the mapping matrix $\mathcal{M}$, we obtain the token ID sequence $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\pi}} =  \boldsymbol{\pi} \cdot \mathcal{M}$ targeting the victim LLM. This method not only achieves the mapping of token IDs from the MLM to the LLM but also ensures the differentiability of the mapping process. 
For a jailbreak prompt and the affirmative response $\textbf{R}$, we define the loss function for the jailbreak task based on the autoregressive task described in Equation \ref{equ:autoregressive} as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:loss_jailbreak}
    \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{Q},\mathbf{R}, \delta) = -\log p_M(\tilde{\boldsymbol{r}}|\tilde{\mathbf{\pi}} \oplus \tilde{\mathbf{q}}),
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\mathbf{\pi}} = \mathcal{G}(\mathcal{H}(f_h(f_e(\mathbf{x}))+ \delta)) \cdot \mathcal{M}$ represents the token IDs of the jailbreak prefix, $\tilde{\mathbf{q}} = M(\mathbf{Q})$ represents the token IDs of the harmful query, and $\tilde{\mathbf{r}} = M(\mathbf{R})$ represents the desired affirmative response from the victim LLM. Through loss function $\mathcal{L}$, we continuously optimize the perturbation $\delta$ in the hidden state described in Equation \ref{equ:MLM_delta} to lead the victim LLM to produce the affirmative response $\mathbf{R}$ to the harmful query $\mathbf{Q}$.

\subsubsection{Reconstruction task}

The optimization of the perturbation $\delta$ based solely on jailbreak loss can successfully trigger jailbreak, but it results in a significant semantic divergence between the jailbreak prefix $\mathbf{J}$ and the initial prefix $\mathbf{x}$. Since $\mathbf{x}$ guides the LLM to perform subsequent instructions and is close to natural language, even a slight perturbation can trigger the jailbreak behavior. Therefore, in optimizing $\delta$, we constrain its search space to enhance the semantic similarity between $\mathbf{J}$ and $\mathbf{x}$. The loss function $\mathcal{L}$ is decomposed into two parts:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:jailbreakAttack}
    \mathcal{L} = (1-\beta) \mathcal{L}_j(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}, \delta) + \beta \mathcal{L}_d(\mathbf{x}, \delta),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{L}_j$ as the jailbreak loss originates from Equation \ref{equ:loss_jailbreak}, ensuring the jailbreak performance of the prefix, $\mathcal{L}_d = -\sum_{i=1}^n x_i log(\theta_i)$ represents the cross-entropy loss between the logistic distribution $\mathbf{\Theta}$ and $\mathbf{x}$, $\beta$ denotes the weight coefficients. We set the sum of the two loss components to 1 to ensure a more stable training process. We use the gradient descent optimization algorithm to optimize $
\delta$, which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{equ:derivation}
    \delta_i = \delta_{i - 1} - \lambda \frac{\nabla_{\delta}\mathcal{L}}{\| \nabla_{\delta}\mathcal{L} \|_F},
\end{equation}
where $F$ denotes the Frobenius norm, and $\lambda$ is the learning rate. 
As shown in step \Rmnum{3} of Figure 
\ref{fig:main}, we decode the embedding vector with added perturbations in the MLM hidden state using $\mathcal{H}$, generating the logistic distribution for the MLM. This distribution is then mapped to the token ID sequence of the victim LLM via Gumbel-softmax and a mapping vector $\mathcal{M}$. By adjusting the loss coefficients, we balance jailbreak performance and readability. The pseudocode for our jailbreak attack method is in Algorithm~\ref{alg:jailbreakAttack}.

\section{Experiment}

\subsection{Experiment Setups}

\subsubsection{Dataset} 

We evaluate the success rate of jailbreak attacks using the AdvBench Harmful Behaviors dataset introduced by  \citet{zou2023universal}. This dataset includes harmful requests paired with their respective target strings, encompassing a broad range of harmful topics such as profanity, threats, discrimination, cybercrime, and more.

\subsubsection{Metrics}

We evaluate jailbreak methods using two key metrics: the success rates of jailbreak attacks and the quality of jailbreak prompts.

\noindent \textbf{Attack Success Rate.} We employ two distinct metrics to measure jailbreak success rates. The first is the \textit{keyword-based attack success rate} (\textit{ASR}), based on keyword matching, as described by  \cite{zou2023universal}. This metric evaluates whether the response from the LLM avoids specific phrases. The detailed keyword string is in appendix \ref{app-sec:keyword}. The second metric is the \textit{Llama-based ASR} (\textit{ASR-L}), which utilizes the Llama-Guard3-8B \footnote{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-Guard-3-8B}. 
Compared to GPT-4, Llama-Guard3-8B performs better with a lower false positive rate. 
For detailed information and prompts used with Llama-Guard3-8B, please refer to Appendix \ref{app-sec:llamaGuard3}.

\noindent \textbf{Quality of Jailbreak Prompts.} We assess the quality of jailbreak prompts using two automated evaluation methods. To measure prompt fluency, we calculate  \textit{Sentence Perplexity} (\textit{PPL}) using the GPT-2 model \cite{radford2019language}. Additionally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization method, we utilize the Universal Sentence Encoder (\textit{USE}) \cite{cer2018universal} to calculate the similarity between the initial instruction-following prompt prefix and the jailbreak prefix.

\subsubsection{Language models}

To comprehensively evaluate the performance of various jailbreak attack methods, we select seven representative open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes. The models evaluated were Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Mistral-v0.2), Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 (Mistral-v0.3) \cite{jiang2023mistral}, Vicuna-7B-v1.5 (Vicuna7B), Vicuna-13B-v1.5 (Vicuna13B)  \cite{zheng2023judging}, Llama2-7B-chat (Llama2) \cite{touvron2023llama}, Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (Llama3) \cite{llama3modelcard}, and Guanaco-13B-HF (Guanaco13B)  \cite{dettmers2024qlora}. Hugging Face repository links for these models can be found in the Appendix Table \ref{app-tab:LLMslink}.

\subsubsection{Baseline methods} 

To validate the effectiveness of our jailbreak attack, we compare it against several baseline methods, including: 
(1) GCG \cite{zou2023universal}: Automatically generates jailbreak prompts using gradient search; (2) AutoDAN \cite{liu2023autodan}: Employ a hierarchical genetic algorithm to create semantically coherent jailbreak prompt. (3) BEAST \cite{sadasivan2024fast}: Controls the attack speed and the readability of adversarial tokens via beam search; (4) COLD-Attack \cite{guo2024cold}: Leverage Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics to produce controllable jailbreak prompts.
For fair comparisons, we integrated the chat format compatible with the LLM into COLD-Attack during the optimization process. 
For more information of the baseline methods and detailed experimental settings, please refer to Appendix \ref{app:baselineSetUp}.

\label{tab:mainJailbreakResults}
\end{table*}

The main results of jailbreak attack methods are summarized in Table \ref{tab:mainJailbreakResults}.

\noindent \textbf{Attack Success Rate.} 
For each malicious request in the dataset, we generated a jailbreak prefix and combined it with the harmful query to create a complete prompt. 
As shown in Table \ref{tab:mainJailbreakResults}, our method consistently achieves the best or second-best \textit{ASR} and \textit{ASR-L} across all LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our optimization approach.  Notably, while AutoDAN achieved second-best results, its genetic algorithm requires mutating a parent string from a third-party LLM and manually crafting the initial jailbreak prompt, significantly increasing implementation complexity.  For Llama2-7B-chat, the model with the strongest safety alignment, although our method's \textit{ASR} and \textit{ASR-L} ranks second, the PPL of the jailbreak prompts we generate is significantly lower than those generated by GCG.

\noindent \textbf{Jailbreak Prefix Quality.} 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization algorithm, we use \textit{Sentence Perplexity} (\textit{PPL}) to evaluate the quality of jailbreak prompts. By calculating the cross-entropy loss between the original and jailbreak prompts, and leveraging the contextual knowledge from MLMâ€™s pre-training, our method ensures a strong contextual association between tokens, thereby maintaining prompt quality. 
As shown in Table \ref{tab:mainJailbreakResults}, across all evaluated victim LLMs, our jailbreak prompt achieves the lowest \textit{PPL}, confirming the effectiveness of our initialization strategy and optimization algorithm. Notably, the initial prompt for AutoDAN is manually crafted to encourage an affirmative response, positioning it near the LLM's threshold for affirmation. However, as AutoDAN does not fully account for contextual relationships during its optimization process, the \textit{PPL} of its jailbreak prompt is slightly higher than that of our approach, though still significantly lower than random initialization methods like GCG.

\caption{Evaluation of attack performance with the initial prompt prefix. \textbf{\textit{ASR-i}}(\%) indicates the \textit{ASR} with the initial prompt prefix. \textbf{\textit{USE}} denotes the similarity between the initial and optimized prompt prefix, and \textit{\textbf{$\Delta$ PPL}} represents the change in \textit{PPL} before and after optimization.}
\label{tab:initPromptPrefix}
\end{table}

During the pre-training and alignment processes, LLMs have accumulated extensive general knowledge. 
To evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality instructions based on prompts, we combine the initial prefix with harmful instructions and input them into the victim LLM to compute the  \textit{ASR}.
The results in Table \ref{tab:initPromptPrefix} show that for models with weaker safety alignment, such as Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 and Vicuna-7B-v1.5 , the initial prompt prefixes they generate nearly reached the threshold for triggering affirmative responses. 
Even if the LLM refuses to execute the initial prompt, making minor optimizations to it can lead the LLM to give an affirmative response. Additionally, the \textit{USE} similarity between the optimized prompts and the initial prompts exceeds 0.9.
For models with stronger safety alignment, like Llama2-7B-chat, although the prompts they generate are further from the affirmative response boundary, these prompts are semantically crafted to persuade the model to execute subsequent instructions. By optimizing these prompts, it is possible to generate higher-quality jailbreak prompt prefixes that maintain high \textit{USE} similarity and low \textit{PPL}, significantly boosting the success rate of jailbreaking.
Compared to random initialization strategies (e.g., GCG) and simple concatenation methods (e.g., BEAST and COLD-Attack), the initial prompts generated by LLMs not only reduce the gap to the affirmative response region but also provide clear optimization direction, greatly enhancing the attack success rate and optimization efficiency.

\subsubsection{Effectiveness of optimization method}

\begin{figure}[t!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/bar-ran4.pdf}
    \caption{The impact of different initial propmt prefix initialization methods on ASR. \textbf{\textit{ASR-!}(\%)} represents the use of 30 "!" for prompt initialization, and \textbf{\textit{$\Delta$ASR}(\%)} represents the improvement of ASR after using our initialization method.}
    \label{fig:bar-ran.pdf}
\end{figure}

To validate our optimization method, inspired by GCG, we replace the initial prompt prefix with 30 exclamation marks, denoted as \textit{prefix-!}, which is semantically void and ineffective for jailbreaking. As shown by the \textit{ASR-!} metric in Figure \ref{fig:bar-ran.pdf}, our optimization method successfully identifies the correct optimization path, enabling the victim LLM to respond affirmatively to harmful queries, even with the semantically void \textit{prefix-!}. However, due to the considerable distance of \textit{prefix-!} from the affirmative response boundary and the lack of a clear initial optimization direction, there remains a notable gap in \textit{ASR} metric compared to our method after a limited number of optimization steps (1000 iterations). The \textit{$\Delta$ASR} metric indicates that, by initializing with a semantically meaningful prompt prefix, our approach can enhance the \textit{ASR} metric by over 20\% for victim LLMs with strong safety alignment. For the time efficiency of baselines under black-box and white-box settings, please refer to Appendix \ref{app-sec: timeEff}.

\subsection{Robustness of jailbreak prompts}

To evaluate the robustness of the jailbreak prompts generated by our method, we assessed the attack success rate under the SmoothLLM \cite{robey2023smoothllm} defense setting.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\caption{\textit{ASR} of various jailbreak attack methods under SmoothLLM defense mechanisms.}
\label{tab:smoothLLM}
\end{table}

SmoothLLM defends against adversarial inputs by first applying random perturbations to multiple copies of a given adversarial prompt, then aggregating the model's responses to these perturbed prompts, and finally identifying the adversarial input through a majority voting mechanism. 
Table \ref{tab:smoothLLM} presents the \textit{ASR} of various attack methods against different LLMs. The data indicates that while SmoothLLM effectively counters attacks like GCG, it struggles with jailbreak prompts that have strong semantic coherence, such as AutoDAN and our method. Given that our method was designed to emphasize the interrelation of textual context, it demonstrates superior adaptability and resilience compared to defenses relying solely on random token perturbation. The results show that when confronted with the SmoothLLM protection, our approach achieves the highest \textit{ASR}, attesting to its superiority. For additional robustness testing methods, please refer to Appendix \ref{app-sec:robustness}.


\subsection{One jailbreak prefix for multiple LLMs}
\label{sec:one4more-LLMs}

\noindent To investigate the commonality of safety vulnerabilities across different open-source models, we simultaneously attack multiple victim LLMs and integrate their gradient information to create a unified jailbreak prefix. For a detailed analysis of the transferability of jailbreak prompts generated using various methods across LLMs, please refer to Appendix \ref{app:transferability}.

\label{tab:oneJailMultiLLMs}
\end{table}

\noindent \textbf{Voting Mechanism:} We introduced a voting mechanism to fully leverage the generative capabilities of each victim LLM. This process begins with a seed prompt that guides each victim LLM in generating prefixes for instruction following. Then, each victim LLM is instructed to score these prefixes based on their semantics and instruction-following guidance capabilities, and the highest-scoring prefix is ultimately selected as the initial prompt prefix to be optimized.  

\noindent \textbf{Performance Results:} After selecting the initial prompt prefix, we use the following loss function:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mathcal{L}_{j_{i}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}, \delta) + \beta \mathcal{L}_d(\mathbf{x}, \delta)
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha_i$ represents the weight coefficient of the jailbreak loss for each victim LLM, $\mathcal{L}_{j_i}$ represents the jailbreak loss for each corresponding victim LLM, and $n$ denotes the number of victim LLMs in a single attack. The experimental setup and optimization results can be found in Appendix \ref{app-sec:multiLLMs}.

\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:oneJailMultiLLMs} presents the \textit{ASR} (blue) of the jailbreak prompts produced by our method against the target LLMs, alongside their cross-LLM \textit{ASR-t} (black). Although adding more victim LLMs results in a slight decrease in attack success rate, the \textit{ASR-t} shows an upward trend, with the gap between the two gradually narrowing. 
This suggests that while safety boundaries differ across LLMs, increasing the number of target models enhances the generalization ability of the prefix. It also indicates that there may be a certain degree of overlap in safety responses among different models, allowing our approach to effectively identify optimization directions. This suggests that the advancement of open-source models is likely to pose significant safety threats to closed-source LLMs. Future research will focus on developing more efficient algorithms to better capture and exploit this overlap, improving the cross-model transfer performance of jailbreak prompts. To evaluate the scalability of a single jailbreak prefix across different harmful queries, we conducted corresponding attack experiments. For detailed experimental procedures and results, please refer to Appendix \ref{app:oneJailMultiBeh}.

\subsection{Enhancing Black-Box Attack Methods}

Although our method cannot be directly applied to closed-source LLMs, we detail our efforts to enhance the transferability of jailbreak prompts in Sections \ref{sec:one4more-LLMs} and Appendix \ref{app:oneJailMultiBeh}. 
To demonstrate the applicability of our method in a black-box setting, we follow the multi-LLM attack approach described in Section \ref{sec:one4more-LLMs} to generate jailbreak prompts and integrated them into black-box jailbreak attack methods. Specifically, we select harmful queries from AdvBench and generate multi-LLM jailbreak prompts targeting Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Vicuna-7B-v1.5, and Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. These jailbreak prompts are then used as seed prompts integrated into the black-box jailbreak method to further improve the attack success rate.
We consider the following jailbreak attack methods: (1)  PAIR \cite{Chao2023JailbreakingBB}: Uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM; (2) PAP \cite{zeng-etal-2024-johnny}: Automatically generates persuasive adversarial prompts to jailbreak LLMs; (3) CipherChat \cite{Yuan2023GPT4IT}: Uses encrypted chat to bypass LLM safety alignment techniques; (4) ReNeLLM \cite{Ding2023AWI}: An automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. All third-party auxiliary models used in the methods employ GPT-4o.

Table \ref{tab:en-black-jailbreak} indicates that by integrating multi-LLM jailbreak prefixes generated by CCJA into the black-box jailbreak attack methods, we can further improve the jailbreak success rate against current advanced commercial closed-source LLMs. This not only demonstrates the generality of the semantically interpretable jailbreak prefixes generated by our method but also highlights the threat posed by open-source models to closed-source commercial LLMs. As the performance gap between open-source and closed-source LLMs narrows, the success rate of transfer attacks may further improve, which we will explore in future work.

\section{Conclusion}

As the gap between open-source LLMs and closed-source commercial LLMs rapidly narrows, the safety implications arising from their malicious exploitation are growing progressively more significant.
In this paper, we propose an automatic jailbreak attack method for aligned open-source LLMs,  referred to as CCJA. 
We model the jailbreak attack as a token-level optimization problem in the continuous word embedding space of MLM, enabling a finer-grained search for jailbreak text compared to discrete prompt manipulation.
By leveraging the MLM head for context-consistent decoding of hidden states and performing combinatorial optimization, we achieve a balance between the attack success rate and semantic readability. 
We extend this attack method to scenarios involving multiple malicious queries and multiple victim models. By integrating CCJA-generated jailbreak prompts into black-box jailbreak attack algorithms, we significantly improve their success rate against closed-source commercial LLMs. This research aims to raise awareness of safety vulnerabilities in open-source LLMs and highlight the security threats facing closed-source commercial LLMs.

\section*{Limitations and Ethics Statements}
Our jailbreak attack algorithm for open-source models enables victim models to generate unsafe content. However, we must acknowledge the limitations of our work and the potential ethical concerns it may raise.

\noindent \textbf{Limitations.}
In terms of evaluation, to align with other baselines, we conducted jailbreak attack experiments solely on the AdvBench dataset. With the advancement of LLM technology, the composition of harmful instructions has become increasingly complex. We hope that with community support, more comprehensive jailbreak instruction sets can be developed for comparative adversarial attack experiments in the future. Since our jailbreak method is tailored for open-source models, it may not be applicable in black-box scenarios. For LLMs with higher safety performance, such as LLaMA 2 and LLaMA 3, current white-box attack methods typically append affirmative response descriptions at the end of conversational instructions to guide the LLM in generating harmful content, and our approach follows this pattern. Looking ahead, we plan to explore jailbreak instruction algorithms fully based on conversational templates and aim to adapt them for black-box attacks. These are some of the directions we intend to investigate in future work.

\noindent \textbf{Ethics Statements.}
Our work aims to raise awareness of the safety risks associated with open-source models and to highlight the urgency of implementing safety safeguards. It is undeniable that our attack method does lead the model to generate some harmful content, resulting in a certain degree of negative impact. However, considering that the AdvBench dataset used in our experiments has been widely studied in numerous academic studies, this work does not amplify the inherent negative impact of the dataset itself. In the future, we plan to conduct more research on the safety of LLMs and explore defense mechanisms against jailbreak attacks targeting open-source models.

\section{Experimental Details}
\label{app:seed-prompt}
\subsection{Seed Prompt}

\subsection{Llama-Guard-3-8B}
\label{app-sec:llamaGuard3}

Llama-Guard3-8B is a pre-trained model based on Llama-3.1-8B, fine-tuned for content safety classification. It can classify content in both LLM prompts and responses to determine whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe. If unsafe, it also specifies the categories of violations. The model offers content moderation in eight languages and is optimized to ensure safety when utilizing search and code interpreter tools. It is trained to classify safety labels across 14 categories, derived from the 13 harm classifications by MLCommons, along with additional categories for code interpreter misuse related to tool invocation use cases. Llama-Guard3-8B outperforms GPT-4 in English, multilingual capabilities, and tool usage, with a significantly lower false positive rate. To eliminate the impact of jailbreak prompts on the classification of unsafe content by Llama-Guard3-8B, we only provided the outputs of the victim LLM as input to Llama-Guard3-8B in this experiment. Please refer to Table \ref{app-tab:llamaGuard3} for the specific prompt used in Llama-Guard3-8B.

\subsection{Baseline Setup}
\label{app:baselineSetUp}
To validate the effectiveness of our jailbreak attack, we compare it against several baseline methods 395
in a white-box setting, including(1) GCG \cite{zou2023universal}, a pioneering approach that automatically generates jailbreak prompts using gradient search; (2) AutoDAN \cite{liu2023autodan}, which employs a hierarchical genetic algorithm to create semantically coherent jailbreak prompts; (3) BEAST \cite{sadasivan2024fast}, a gradient-free optimization method that controls the attack's speed and the readability of adversarial tokens via beam search with adjustable hyperparameters; (4) COLD-Attack \cite{guo2024cold}, which leverages Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics to produce controllable jailbreak prompts; (5) GPTFuzz \cite{yu2023gptfuzzer}, generates adversarial text and uses a language model to fuzz the input, thereby evaluating and improving the model's robustness in the face of uncertainty and attacks; (6) PAIR \cite{chao2023jailbreaking}, generates a set of interpretable perturbations through adversarial attacks to enhance the robustness and interpretability of neural network models when handling text data.

The detailed hyperparameter settings of the baseline methods are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item GCG \cite{zou2023universal}: For GCG,  the hyperparameters were configured as follows: batch size = 128, top-k = 512, optimization steps = 500, and suffix tags = 20. The model ran on an 80G A100 GPU.
    \item AutoDAN \cite{liu2023autodan}: For AutoDAN, the hyperparameters were configured as follows: crossover rate = 0.5, mutation rate = 0.01, elite rate = 0.1, multi-point crossover = 5, total iterations = 10, using GPT-4-0613 as the base model for LLM-based mutation.
    \item BEAST \cite{sadasivan2024fast}: For BEAST, the hyperparameters as follows: attack iterations L = 40 , $k_1$ = 15, $k_2$ = 15 for all models, and a budget of 600,000. Attack run time was not considered.
    \item COLD-Attack \cite{guo2024cold}: For COLD-Attack, we configured the hyperparameters as follows: iterations = 2000, step size = 0.1, large\_gs\_std = {0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.001}, suffix length = 20.

    \item GPTFuzz \cite{yu2023gptfuzzer}, PAIR \cite{chao2023jailbreaking}: All third-party large models use GPT-4, with other parameters set to their default configurations.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent For our method, we selected BERT \footnote{https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased} as the local proxy model. We set the learning rate to 0.1, with the weight coefficient for the decode loss at 0.1 and the jailbreak loss at 0.9.

\caption{\textit{PPL} filtering thresholds for different jailbreak attack methods vary across distinct LLMs.}
\label{fig:PPLfilter}
\end{figure*}

\textbf{Perplexity Filtering Defense.} The PPL filtering defense implements a filter with a specified \textit{PPL} threshold, blocking any input prompt that exceeds this threshold. In our experiment, we progressively adjusted the \textit{PPL} threshold to {250, 200, 150, 100, 50}, and observed a corresponding decrease in \textit{ASR}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:PPLfilter}, our method consistently produced jailbreak prompts with the highest \textit{ASR} across all LLMs and \textit{PPL} thresholds, demonstrating its effectiveness. For AutoDAN, although its initial jailbreak prompts were semantically high-quality, it neglected token contextual relationships during optimization, resulting in a sharp \textit{ASR} decline at thresholds between 100 and 150. In contrast, our method ensures textual coherence by optimizing BERT's hidden state and utilizing the MLM head for decoding, while also employing cross-entropy loss to align the jailbreak prompt prefix with the original, thus maintaining the quality of the jailbreak prompts. This approach stabilizes \textit{ASR} as the \textit{PPL} threshold changes, preventing major fluctuations. 


\section{Time Efficiency}

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{The time taken by different methods to attack Llama2 using the top 100 harmful queries from AdvBench.}
\label{app-tab:timeEff}
\end{table}

As shown in the Table \ref{app-tab:timeEff}, the jailbreak attack algorithm under the white-box setting requires less computation time because it does not rely on third-party large models for auxiliary calculations. During the text optimization process, the white-box method can access the model's gradient information, guiding the optimization path and thereby shortening the optimization time. This is especially important when dealing with open-source models. Our proposed method effectively reduces the initial text optimization time and improves the readability of the jailbreak text by applying small perturbations to the instructions generated by the victim modelâ€™s tracking prompts. Therefore, our method demonstrates optimal performance in terms of time efficiency.

\section{Transferability Across LLMs}
\label{app:transferability}

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figs/heatmap.pdf}
    \caption{The transferability results of ASR for different jailbreak attack methods across various LLMs. The Y-axis represents the jailbreak prompts generated by a specific jailbreak attack method for a particular LLM, while the X-axis denotes different LLM models.}
    \label{app-fig:transferability}
\end{figure*}

To evaluate the generalizability of jailbreak prompts generated by different attack methods across various LLMs, we conducted transferability tests. As shown in Figure \ref{app-fig:transferability}, vertical analysis reveals that jailbreak prompts generated from models with higher safety alignment, such as Llama2 and Llama3, tend to remain effective against less safety alignment models like Mistral and Vicuna7B. Specifically, the  \textit{ASR} of jailbreak prompts derived from attacking Llama2 and Llama3, when used against Mistral and Vicuna7B, decreases by no more than 5\% compared to direct attacks.  Conversely, prompts generated from less securely aligned models experience a significant \textit{ASR} dropâ€”typically about 20\%â€”when transferred to more safety alignment models. In a horizontal comparison, our method-generated jailbreak prompts demonstrated the best cross-model transferability. This is primarily due to these prompts maintaining good semantic properties, effectively mitigating overfitting issues caused by optimization for specific LLMs.

\label{app-tab:oneJailMultiBeh}
\end{table*}

We randomly selected 100 data points from AdvBench as the training set to generate jailbreak prefixes, with the remaining data serving as the test set for evaluating the transfer attack effectiveness of these prefixes.  After generating the jailbreak prefixes from the training set, we randomly selected 5 of these prefixes and combined them with harmful queries from the test set, resulting in 2,100 sample data points. These samples were then input into the LLM to calculate their transfer ASR.  
The optimization formula is as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mathcal{L}_j(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{Q_i}, \mathbf{R_i}, \delta) + \beta \mathcal{L}_d(\mathbf{x}, \delta)
\end{equation*}
 where, $\alpha_i$ represents the jailbreak loss weight for each harmful query, while $n$ denotes the number of harmful queries included in a single jailbreak attack optimization. We selected varying numbers of harmful queries, with $n \in \{1, 10, 20\}$, resulting in the generation of \{100, 10, 5\} jailbreak prefixes, respectively. For the weight settings of each loss term in the combined optimization process, we used $\beta = 0.01$ and $\alpha_i = (1 - \beta) / n$. Table \ref{app-tab:oneJailMultiBeh} presents the attack effects of our method on the training set. As the number of harmful queries in a single attack increases, the \textit{ASR} shows a downward trend. However, as illustrated in Table \ref{tab:oneJailMulBeh}, the \textit{ASR-t} generated by jailbreak prefixes increased in the test set, while the gap between \textit{ASR} and \textit{ASR-t} narrowed. We posit that different harmful queries correspond to distinct optimal jailbreak prefixes. By integrating information from multiple harmful queries, our approach tends to yield a more balanced prefix. Although such a prefix may reduce semantic readability, it more effectively disrupts the attention mechanism of language models, inducing them to produce unsafe content.

\label{app-tab:oneJailMultiLLMs}
\end{table*}

To enhance the transfer performance of the jailbreak prefixes generated by our method across multiple LLMs, we simultaneously attack several victim LLMs in hopes of merging their gradient information. Our optimization formula is as follows:

\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i \mathcal{L}_{j_{i}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}, \delta) + \beta \mathcal{L}_d(\mathbf{x}, \delta)
\end{equation*}

\noindent where, $\alpha_i$ represents the jailbreak loss weights corresponding to different victim LLMs, and $n$ denotes the number of LLMs attacked in a single attempt. In the experiments, we set $n \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. The weight for the decode loss is set to $0.01$, while the jailbreak loss weights for different LLMs are given by $\alpha_i = (1 - \beta) / n$. The performance of our method when attacking varying numbers of LLMs is shown in Table \ref{app-tab:oneJailMultiLLMs}. The results indicate that as the number of LLMs attacked in a single attempt increases, the ASR exhibits a downward trend. This suggests that the affirmative response areas of different LLMs vary, making it challenging to find a high-quality jailbreak prefix that is effective across multiple LLMs simultaneously. However, as seen in Table \ref{tab:oneJailMultiLLMs}, the transfer ASR of the jailbreak prefix to other LLMs improves with an increase in $\Delta$PPL. This indicates that there may be an overlapping affirmative response area among different LLMs. Although this area is difficult to optimize, our method has indeed found the correct optimization path.

\section{Importance of Reconstruction Task}

\caption{The impact of varying $\beta$ on \textit{ASR} and \textit{USE} trends across different LLMs.}
\label{fig:abBeta}
\end{figure}

To investigate the impact of the reconstruction task on our method, we conducted an ablation study on the weight coefficient of the decode loss. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:abBeta}, increasing the weight of the reconstruction task enhances the \textit{USE} similarity between the generated jailbreak prefix and the initial prompt prefix, while the \textit{ASR} value decreases. This indicates that the reconstruction task indeed constrains the optimization of the jailbreak prefix. If the initial prompt prefix demonstrates strong instruction-following capability and high-quality jailbreak prefixes are desired, the weight of the decode loss can be increased accordingly. Conversely, if the focus is on achieving a high \textit{ASR} for jailbreak, the weight of the decode loss should be set lower. For the effect of the learning rate during optimization on both the attack performance and readability of jailbreak prompts, please refer to Appendix \ref{app-sec:lr}.

% \noindent \textbf{Importance of Learning Rate.} 
\noindent To investigate the impact of learning rate on the jailbreak prefixes generated by our method, we conducted an ablation study. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:abLr}, as the learning rate increases, the \textit{USE} of the jailbreak prefixes generated by our method decreases, while the \textit{ASR} increases, under a limited number of optimization steps (1300). This indicates that with a lower learning rate, the jailbreak prefixes can only be optimized around the initial prompt prefixes, which ensures high quality but limits \textit{ASR}. Therefore, if the goal is to improve \textit{ASR}, the learning rate can be appropriately increased; if the focus is on the quality of the jailbreak prefixes, the learning rate should be set lower.

\section{Case study}

We present the jailbreak prompts generated by our jailbreak attack method against different LLMs, along with their responses. To prevent the dissemination of harmful information, we have simplified the responses from the victim LLM.
