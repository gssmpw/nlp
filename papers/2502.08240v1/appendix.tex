\section{Ethics}
\label{app:ethics}
Our university does not implement a formal IRB process for the conducted study. Still, we have designed all experiments in accordance with ethical best practices outlined in the Menlo report~\citep{KenDit12} and legal regulations of the European GDPR~\citep{GDPR}. First, the collection of SPF and DMARC records is fully automated and does not involve human subjects. By design, the collected data is openly available and does not contain any private or sensitive information. Furthermore, we have taken measures to keep the load on DNS servers as low as possible.
To this end, we implemented a cache as described in \autoref{sec:measuring-in-the-wild}.
Second, we have notified all operators of domains with misconfigured SPF records via email, providing detailed descriptions of the identified issues.
Although this notification caused extra work for the operators, we argue that informing them about the misconfigurations and thereby improving email protection outweighs this disadvantage.
