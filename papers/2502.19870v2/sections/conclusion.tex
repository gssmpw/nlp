\section{Conclusion}

In this paper,  we propose a comprehensive multimodal knowledge editing
benchmark, named MMKE-Bench, designed to evaluate diverse semantic editing in real-world scenarios using free-form natural language representation. We propose to use free-form natural language representation combined with an image to represent knowledge instead of representing it with a triplet. Besides, we propose three kinds of editing to align with real-world scenarios. We conducted experiments on representative LMMs and knowledge editing methods and found that more advanced knowledge editing methods are needed for LMMs. We hope our work could inspire more multimodal knowledge editing research.
