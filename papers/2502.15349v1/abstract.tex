% Attention mechanisms form the backbone of transformers and large language models (LLMs), driving remarkable advancements in natural language processing and beyond. However, the increasing diversity of attention variants and their substantial computational demands present significant challenges for optimization. Existing optimization efforts are often fragmented and non-adaptable, requiring considerable effort even for minor changes in input configurations or hardware platforms.

% We present \oursys{}, a unified framework that abstracts attention mechanisms into two core operations: relevance scoring and aggregation, complemented by customizable functions. This abstraction provides a flexible foundation for designing diverse attention mechanisms across various hardware backends. Through customizable attention templates and a cross-backend scheduling policy, \oursys{} automates kernel optimization, delivering up to 10.4$\times$ speedups for configurations previously unsupported by state-of-the-arts. \oursys{} offers an efficient and adaptable solution to advance attention mechanism design and deployment.

% Attention mechanisms form the computational backbone of modern transformer models and large language models(LLM), catalyzing transformative progress across machine learning domains. Despite their widespread adoption, the proliferation of specialized attention variants combined with heavy computational requirements creates substantial optimization challenges for both researchers and developers. Existing optimization methodologies typically employ rigid, implementation-specific approaches that demand costly re-engineering when adapting to new architectural variations or different hardware environments.

% This paper presents \oursys{}, a systematic framework that automatically optimize customized Attention across hardware backends. \oursys{} reimagines attention computation into two operations: relevance scoring and aggregation, augmented through programmable customized functions. This abstraction provides a basis for crafting diverse attention mechanisms tailored to different hardware environments. \oursys{} facilitates kernel optimization through customizable attention templates and a cross-platform scheduling strategy. Our experimental results show up to 10.4 $\times$ speed improvements for configurations previously unsupported by existing state-of-the-art methods. \oursys{} delivers an efficient and flexible approach to advancing the design and deployment of attention mechanisms.

Transformers and large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized machine learning, with attention mechanisms at the core of their success. As the landscape of attention variants expands, so too do the challenges of optimizing their performance, particularly across different hardware platforms. Current optimization strategies are often narrowly focused, requiring extensive manual intervention to accommodate changes in model configurations or hardware environments.

In this paper, we introduce \oursys{}, a comprehensive framework designed to streamline the optimization of attention mechanisms across heterogeneous hardware backends. By decomposing attention computation into modular operations with customizable components, \oursys{} enables flexible adaptation to diverse algorithmic requirements. The framework further automates kernel optimization through a combination of programmable templates and a robust cross-platform scheduling strategy. Empirical results reveal performance gains of up to 10Ã— on configurations beyond the reach of existing methods. \oursys{} offers a scalable, efficient foundation for developing and deploying attention mechanisms with minimal manual tuning.
