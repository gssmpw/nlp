\begin{abstract}

\pzh{
Teaching literature under interdisciplinary (\eg science, art) contexts that connect reading materials has become popular in elementary schools. However, constructing such contexts is challenging as it requires teachers to explore substantial amounts of interdisciplinary content and link it to the reading materials. In this paper, we develop \name{} via an iterative design process involving 13 teachers to facilitate the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature. Powered by a large language model (LLM), \name{} can recommend interdisciplinary topics and contextualize them with literary elements (\eg paragraphs, viewpoints) in the reading materials. A within-subjects study (N=16) shows that compared to an LLM chatbot, \name{} can improve the integration depth of different subjects and reduce workload in this ideation task. Expert interviews (N=9) also demonstrate \name{}'s usefulness for supporting the ideation of interdisciplinary contexts for teaching literature. We conclude with concerns and design considerations for supporting interdisciplinary teaching with LLMs.  
}

  % Integrating knowledge from various disciplines within literature instruction at the elementary school level is beneficial yet challenging for teachers, especially in identifying suitable interdisciplinary contexts for reading materials. 
  % Large language models (LLMs) can facilitate this process by comprehensively analyzing reading materials, retrieving relevant interdisciplinary topics, and generating contexts, which would otherwise require extensive effort from teachers in terms of text analysis and selection. 
  % Through an iterative design process, which included a foundational study and formative evaluations with seven teachers, we developed \name{}. 
  % This tool supports elementary school teachers in creating interdisciplinary contexts for literature instruction with LLM-generated content.
  % Our within-subjects study ($N=16$) and expert interviews ($N=10$) suggest that \name{} can improve the quality of  interdisciplinary contexts and significantly improve the efficiency of this task.
  % We also address concerns and design considerations for supporting interdisciplinary teaching with LLMs.

}
The fixed questions for the \pzh{semi-structured} interviews in Experiment II (expert interviews) are shown below.

\penguin{
\textbf{RQ1: Ideation outcomes}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What do you think about the quality of the outcomes generated by \name{}?
    \item Do you think the results generated by our system can assist you in preparing lessons or designing a new interdisciplinary context in the classroom setting?
\end{itemize}

\penguin{
\textbf{RQ2: Ideation process}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Did you feel the task load is high while using \name{}? Specifically, did you feel any increased cognitive load or mental demands?
\end{itemize}

\penguin{
\textbf{RQ3: Perception of \name{}}
}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Do you think our system can assist you in ideating interdisciplinary topics more efficiently?
    \item Do you think our system can help you better explore connections between texts and the contexts?
    \item If you were to prepare an interdisciplinary reading case, compared to your usual preparation methods (\eg searching, meeting with other subject teachers, or using ChatGPT), do you think \name{} could support you better?
    \item Do you trust the output of our system compared to your previous experiences with web searching or using ChatGPT?
