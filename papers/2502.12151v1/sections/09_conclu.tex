In this paper, we present \name, a novel system that leverages LUT-based point cloud super-resolution for efficient and high-quality volumetric video streaming. Through combining accelerated dilated interpolation and Look Up table based refinement, \name achieves real-time performance even on mobile devices, significantly reduces bandwidth requirements, and enhances the user experience. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of \name in delivering high-quality volumetric video content while adapting to network conditions and user preferences. The contributions of our work lay the foundation for future research and development in the field of volumetric video streaming, opening up new possibilities for immersive and accessible volumetric experiences.
