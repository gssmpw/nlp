\textbf{Live streaming:} One promising direction is to explore the applicability of \name to live volumetric video streaming. Since \name requires minimal processing of point clouds at the server side, it has the potential to support low-latency live streaming scenarios. By leveraging the efficiency of our LUT-based super-resolution approach and the real-time performance of our optimized pipeline, \name could enable interactive and immersive live experiences, such as virtual concerts, sports events, or telepresence applications. However, live streaming introduces additional challenges, such as real-time point cloud acquisition, compression, and synchronization, which need to be carefully addressed.
\textbf{LUT for inter-frame compression:} Another interesting avenue for future research is to explore the use of LUTs for inter-frame compression in volumetric video streaming. Volumetric videos often exhibit temporal redundancy between consecutive frames, similar to traditional 2D videos. By exploiting this temporal correlation, we can potentially train an point-wise motion prediction network like pointFlowNet~\cite{behl2019pointflownet} for each video and make employs an LUT to record the referenced network for
