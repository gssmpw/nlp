% Volumnic video is becoming popular. But streaming volumetric videos are prohibitive (\eg, XXX bandwidth is required for a typical volumetric video). A natural approach to reduce the data rate is to downsample the signal before the transmission and upsample at the receiver using a super resolution (SR) algorithm. While there has been significant work on SR for 2D videos, there is little work on SR for volumnetric videos. Motivated by this need, we develop an efficient and accurate SR algorithm based by leveraging lookup table (LUT). Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness.  

3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach  to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos. 

To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed \name with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, \name is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows \name  can reduce bandwidth usage by  70\% , boost QoE by 36.7\% for volumetric video streaming and achieve $8.4\times$ 3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.
%Our extensive evaluation show that our system can significantly reduce the bandwidth required for streaming volumetric content with little impact on the video quality.
