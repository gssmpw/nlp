\subsection{Impact of Subfield Information}
\label{appendix:Impact of Subfield Information}

We conduct zero-shot evaluations under two conditions to investigate the impact of subfield information. 
1) zero-shot-with-subfield, where the prompt includes a description of the problemâ€™s subfield, and (2)zero-shot-without-subfield, where no subfield information is provided.The prompts employed for the zero-shot-with-subfield evaluation are presented below.


\begin{promptbox}{Zero-shot-with-subfield}
Answer the following multiple choice question about 
\begin{verbatim}
{subfield}
\end{verbatim}
There is only one correct answer. The last line of your response should be in the format 'Answer: \$LETTER' (without quotes), where LETTER is one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, or J.
\end{promptbox}

\subsection{Robustness of the Evaluation}
\label{appendix:robustness}
We employ 4 types of initial prompts and 6 types of question formats, resulting in a
combination of 24 different prompt styles to verify the robustness of our bench. The 4 initial prompts and 6 types of question formats are listed below.

\begin{promptbox}{Initial Prompt 1}
Answer the following multiple choice question. There is only one correct answer. The last line of your response should be in the format 'Answer: \$LETTER' (without quotes), where LETTER is one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, or J.
\end{promptbox}



\begin{promptbox}{Initial Prompt 2}
You are a helpful assistant. Answer the given multiple-choice question. Only one option is correct. The last line of your response should be in the format 'The correct answer is: \$LETTER', where LETTER is one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, or J.

\end{promptbox}


\begin{promptbox}{Initial Prompt 3}
Select the correct answer for the following multiple-choice question. There is only one valid choice. The last line of your response should be in the format 'Answer: \$LETTER' (without quotes), where LETTER is one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, or J.

\end{promptbox}


\begin{promptbox}{Initial Prompt 4}
Review the following multiple-choice question and choose the one correct answer. Ensure that your response concludes with a line exactly formatted as 'The correct answer is: \$LETTER', where LETTER represents one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, or J.
