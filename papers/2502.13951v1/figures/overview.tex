    Method overview for a 2-image composition scenario. (top) We use an LLM to generate texts describing possible variations of a concept we want to extract from the concept-image. We encode the responses using CLIP, and find the embedding-subspace that they span.
    (bottom) We generate a composite CLIP-embedding by replacing the projection of the reference image on this embedding-subspace with the matching projection of the concept-image. The composite embedding can be used by an off-the-shelf IP-Adapter to generate images combining the reference and the visual concept. The same approach can be applied with additional concept images.}
