\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we approach the factual inconsistency detection of long document summarization through the lens of discourse analysis. We find that discourse factors, with regard to sentence structure, are related to the factual consistency of sentences. We further propose a framework that leverages the source document structure and introduces re-weighting the sentence-level predictions on top of different NLI-based models, achieving performance gains across multiple long-document summarization evaluation datasets, including scientific articles and legal documents.
