\label{app:probe}


Figure~\ref{fig:confidence_trends} illustrates the probing results for the Qwen2.5 14B model, revealing that, similar to LLaMA models, the highest F1 scores are concentrated in the middle layers. However, the distribution of these high-performing heads differs between the two model families. While both models exhibit darker regions indicating stronger sufficiency signals in their intermediate layers, LLaMA3.2-1B shows a more dispersed pattern of high F1 scores across various heads within these layers. This suggests that although both LLaMA and Qwen models tend to encode context sufficiency signals primarily in their middle layers, the specific attention heads responsible and their activation patterns vary between architectures.
