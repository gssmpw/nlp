\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.5em}
Several approaches have recently been introduced for online conformal inference. A significant limitation of these methods is their neglect of quantifying extent of over/under coverage. In this work, we propose \textit{Error-quantified Conformal Inference} (ECI) to construct prediction sets for time series data. Compared with ACI \citep{aci_gibbs2021adaptive} and its variants, ECI introduces additional smooth feedback by measuring the magnitude of error $s_t - q_t$. ECI can rapidly adapt to the distributional shifts in time series, and yield more tight conformal prediction sets. Theoretically, we establish a finite-sample coverage guarantee for ECI with a fixed learning rate in a short interval and prove a miscoverage bound with arbitrary learning rate. Empirically, we verify our method's effectiveness and efficiency across extensive datasets.
