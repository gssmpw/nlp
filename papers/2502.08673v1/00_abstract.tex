\begin{abstract}
  In this work, we present a novel technique for GPU-accelerated Boolean satisfiability (SAT) sampling. Unlike conventional sampling algorithms that directly operate on conjunctive normal form (CNF), our method transforms the logical constraints of SAT problems by factoring their CNF representations into simplified multi-level, multi-output Boolean functions. It then leverages gradient-based optimization to guide the search for a diverse set of valid solutions. Our method operates directly on the circuit structure of refactored SAT instances, reinterpreting the SAT problem as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable technique enables independent bit-wise operations on each tensor element, allowing parallel execution of learning processes. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with significant runtime improvements ranging from $33.6\times$ to $523.6\times$ over state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. We demonstrate the superior performance of our sampling method through an extensive evaluation on $60$ instances from a public domain benchmark suite utilized in previous studies. 


  
  % Generating a wide range of diverse solutions to logical constraints is crucial in software and hardware testing, verification, and synthesis. These solutions can serve as inputs to test specific functionalities of a software program or as random stimuli in hardware modules. In software verification, techniques like fuzz testing and symbolic execution use this approach to identify bugs and vulnerabilities. In hardware verification, stimulus generation is particularly vital, forming the basis of constrained-random verification. While generating multiple solutions improves coverage and increases the chances of finding bugs, high-throughput sampling remains challenging, especially with complex constraints and refined coverage criteria. In this work, we present a novel technique that enables GPU-accelerated sampling, resulting in high-throughput generation of satisfying solutions to Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike conventional sampling algorithms that directly operate on conjunctive normal form (CNF), our method refines the logical constraints of SAT problems by transforming their CNF into simplified multi-level Boolean expressions. It then leverages gradient-based optimization to guide the search for a diverse set of valid solutions.
  % Our method specifically takes advantage of the circuit structure of refined SAT instances by using GD to learn valid solutions, reinterpreting the SAT problem as a supervised multi-output regression task. This differentiable technique enables independent bit-wise operations on each tensor element, allowing parallel execution of learning processes. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with significant runtime improvements ranging from $10\times$ to $1000\times$ over state-of-the-art heuristic samplers. Specifically, we demonstrate the superior performance of our sampling method through an extensive evaluation on $60$ instances from a public domain benchmark suite utilized in previous studies.
