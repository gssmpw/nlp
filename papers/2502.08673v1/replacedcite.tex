\section{Related Work}
Numerous SAT formula sampling methods have been explored in prior research. For example, {\sc UniGen3} provides approximate uniformity guarantees ____, while both {\sc CMSGen} and {\sc Quicksampler} ____ emphasize sampling efficiency. Other studies have also examined the use of data-parallel hardware for SAT solving, primarily focusing on parallelizing CDCL and various heuristic-based algorithms ____. Some recent efforts, such as {\sc MatSat} ____ and {\sc NeuroSAT} ____, have attempted to frame SAT instances as constrained numerical optimization problems. However, these methods have struggled to demonstrate the effectiveness of GPU-accelerated formula sampling on large and diverse standard benchmarks, typically focusing on small, random instances. Recently, a new differentiable sampling technique called {\sc DiffSampler} was proposed in ____, enabling GPU-accelerated SAT sampling on standard benchmarks and achieving competitive runtime performance compared to {\sc UniGen3} and {\sc CMSGen}. {\sc Demotic} is another GPU-accelerated, differentiable sampler specifically designed for CircuitSAT problems in CRV. It operates directly on circuit structures described in hardware description languages such as Verilog ____.

There have been only a few attempts in the literature that focus solely on extracting circuit structure from CNF descriptions ____, primarily to recover information lost during the Tseitin transformation. These approaches typically rely on pattern matching based on predefined gate structures. In contrast, our transformation method is more general, capable of restoring any combination of logical gates from CNF, and, more importantly, it enables high-throughput SAT sampling using GPUs.
