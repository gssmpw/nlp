\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have introduced a novel GPU-accelerated approach for SAT sampling that significantly outperforms traditional methods. By transforming CNF representations into simplified multi-level, multi-output Boolean functions and employing gradient-based optimization, our method reinterprets SAT as a supervised multi-output regression task. This enables parallel, bit-wise operations across tensor elements, leading to substantial runtime improvements. With speedups ranging from $33.6\times$ to $523.6\times$ compared to existing heuristic samplers, our extensive evaluation on $60$ benchmark instances demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of this new technique for SAT sampling. This performance gain is primarily attributed to the GPU's acceleration over CPU execution and the reduction in the number of logic operations resulting from our transformation.
