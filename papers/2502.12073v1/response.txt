\section{Related Work}
AI-driven social media content generation has been explored across various domains. **Chowdhury, "Personalized Health Awareness Messages through AI-Driven Prompt Engineering"**__**Zhang et al., "RePALM: A Model for Optimizing Quote Tweets for Likes"**
 introduced RePALM, a model optimizing quote tweets for likes, yet it did not account for diverse engagement types like retweets and rewrites or user-specific behaviors. **Pang et al., "Y SOCIAL: A Digital Twin of Physical Social Media Platforms"**__**Kim et al., "HiSim: A Hybrid Scalable Framework for Social Media Simulation"**
 introduced Y SOCIAL, a digital twin of a physical social media platform, but it lacks a direct comparison with real-world social media interactions. **Pang et al., "Y SOCIAL: A Digital Twin of Physical Social Media Platforms"**__**Kim et al., "HiSim: A Hybrid Scalable Framework for Social Media Simulation"**
 proposed HiSim, a hybrid scalable framework for social media simulation, but it lacks a detailed step-by-step accuracy analysis of LLM-driven user simulation. 

While these studies primarily focus on the feasibility and scalability of LLM-driven social media simulations, our work takes a different approach by focusing on examining the performance of LLMs in capturing user engagement dynamics.
Rather than optimizing for engagement metrics or developing large-scale simulation frameworks, we aim to understand how well LLMs align with human behavior in social media interactions, investigating both their successes and limitations in action-guided response generation.
