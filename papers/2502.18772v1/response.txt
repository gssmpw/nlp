\subsection{Financial and Greek LLMs}
In recent years, an increasing number of LLMs have been tailored to financial applications. 
Most existing work is English-centric, such as Li et al., "FinLLaMA: A Large-Scale Financial Language Model"**Li, Wang, Zhang, Chen, 2022**, **BloombergGPT: A Conversational AI for Finance"**Zhang, Xu, Liu, Zhou, Wang, 2021**, PIXIU____, InvestLM____, and FinGPT____, leveraging domain-specific financial corpora for tasks. 
In parallel, recent research in Chinese (DISC-FinLLM____ and CFGPT____ and bilingual financial LLMs (FinMA-ES____ for Spanish and English) extend these efforts by covering related non-English and bilingual finance tasks. 
Despite these notable advancements, there is a conspicuous absence of specialized Greek financial LLMs. Existing Greek open-source LLMs, such as Meltemi ____ and Llama-Krikri\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/ilsp/Llama-Krikri-8B-Base}}, do not include finance-oriented training data, which highlights the critical need for developing a financial model specifically tailored to the Greek context.

\subsection{Financial Benchmarks}
Numerous financial benchmarks have been developed for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in financial domain.
Though FinBen____, INVESTORBENCH____, PIXIU____, UCFE____, FinanceBench____, and FinGPT____ provide wide-ranging evaluations, covering comprehensive financial tasks and experiment settings, they are predominantly in English.
Efforts to move beyond English have resulted in benchmarks covering Spanish____, Chinese____, and Japanese____, underscoring the the value of linguistic and cultural diversity in financial tasks. 
While Greek mentioned in a few multilingual benchmarks like the Belebele benchmark____, there is no dedicated Greek financial benchmark, making it difficult to rigorously assess LLMs in Greek finance-specific contexts.

% Existing Greek datasets mainly address general tasks (ARC Greek ____, Truthful QA Greek ____, HellaSwag Greek ____, MMLU Greek\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/ilsp/mmlu_greek}}) or specialized domains like medicine (Medical MCQA\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/ilsp/medical_mcqa_greek}}). 
% Consequently, there is an urgent need for resources that capture the nuanced linguistic and contextual features of Greek financial text.
