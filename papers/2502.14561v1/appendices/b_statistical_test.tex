\section{Chi-Square Statistical Test}\label{sec:appendix-b-statistical-test}

To complement the parameter performance analysis outlined in Section~\ref{sec:parameter_performance}, we also conducted a \emph{Chi-Square Test of Independence} to evaluate the relationship between parameter settings and F1-scores. This approach allowed us to determine whether specific parameter settings were significantly associated with performance outcomes and validate the results of our primary analysis. The results of the test are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:chi-square-results}.

The test revealed several significant relationships between parameter settings and performance outcomes. Specifically, the \emph{Prompting Method} ($\chi^2 = 22.46$, $p = 5.23e-05$), \emph{System Prompt} ($\chi^2 = 14.97$, $p = 0.00056$), and \emph{Query Template} ($\chi^2 = 41.86$, $p = 9.79e-11$) were all found to have statistically significant associations with performance, indicating that these parameters play a critical role in influencing F1-scores. In contrast, \emph{Temperature} ($\chi^2 = 4.31$, $p = 0.230$) and \emph{Examples Method} ($\chi^2 = 0.01$, $p = 0.911$) did not show significant relationships, suggesting that these parameters may not independently affect performance outcomes. These results are aligned with the findings of our Quantile-based analysis.
