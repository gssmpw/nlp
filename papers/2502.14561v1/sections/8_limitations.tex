\section{Limitations}\label{sec:limitations}

While our study provides valuable insights into the performance of LLMs on the task of Citation Intent Classification, it is not without limitations. First, it was not feasible to evaluate all recent models comprehensively due to the rapid pace of advancements in the field. To address this, we plan to update our GitHub repository with any notable new models as they emerge. Second, the study did not consider the time, energy consumption, and compute costs associated with running LLMs compared to traditional methods, as this was deemed out of scope; instead, we focused solely on assessing the viability of the approach. Finally, due to computational constraints, our analysis was limited to only the small and medium parameter counts of the selected models (1-27B parameters).
