\section{PDLP Delta is always positive}\label{app:delta}
Note that
\begin{align}\label{eq:portfolio-delta}
\Delta(\tilde{V}) &= \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} V(p, \pi + \delta) + (1+F(p, w^{\star}, \pi, \delta)) \frac{\partial V}{\partial p} + f \ell
\end{align}
This implies that if we were to be Delta Neutral, \ie~$\Delta(\tilde{V})_i = 0$, for $i > 1$, then we need $\frac{\partial F}{\partial p} < 0$.
As we've seen in our examples, the form of $F$ is usually rectilinear (\eg~ReLu-like) in $w(p, \pi+\delta)$.
In particular, this means that $F$ as a function of $w(p, \pi+\delta)$ is affine with positive coefficients.
Note that we have
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weight-derivative}
\frac{\partial w_i(p, \pi)}{\partial p_j} = - \frac{p_i \pi_i \pi_j}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pi_i\right)^2} + \delta_{ij} \frac{\pi_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pi_i}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta, with $\delta_{ij} = 1$ if and only $i = j$.
Note that $\frac{\partial w_i(p, \pi)}{\partial p_j} < 0$ only if 
\begin{align*}
\frac{p_i \pi_i^2}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pi_i\right)^2} \geq \delta_{ij} \frac{\pi_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pi_i} &\iff \frac{p_i \pi_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pi_i} \geq 1  
\end{align*}
which is equivalent to $p_i \pi_i \geq \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \pi_i$, which only occurs if $\pi_j = \delta_{ij}$.
Therefore, if $F(w(p, \pi+\delta)) = a_0 + a_1 w(p, \pi + \delta)$ for $a_0, a_1 > 0$ (as in JLP), we can only be completely delta neutral if there is only one asset in the pool.
Given the nature of perpetuals exchanges, this will never occur and as such, PDLP holders will always be exposed to some principal spot risk.
