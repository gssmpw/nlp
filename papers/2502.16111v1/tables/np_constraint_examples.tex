Calendar Scheduling & You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.

------------

\textbf{TASK:} You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday.

------------

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day:

- Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00;

- Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00;

 -Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00;

------------

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

& 

\textbf{Instance-Specific Constraints and Details:}

Participants: Michelle, Steven, Jerry - The meeting must include all three.

------------

Meeting Duration: 1 hour - The meeting requires a contiguous 60-minute slot.

------------

Work Hours: 9:00 to 17:00 (Monday) -  The meeting must start and end within these working hours.  This acts as a global constraint.

------------

Individual Schedules (Existing Meetings/Blocked Times):

- Michelle: Busy from 11:00 to 12:00 on Monday.
    
- Steven: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, and 15:30 to 16:00 on Monday.
    
- Jerry: Busy from 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, and 15:30 to 17:00 on Monday (note this constraint ends at the end of the workday).
    
------------

While the problem states "Note there exists a solution," this isn't a constraint in itself; it's a guarantee that a feasible solution exists given the constraints. The actual constraints are the schedules, meeting duration, and working hours.

Meeting Planning & 
You are visiting San Francisco for the day and want to meet as many friends as possible. Solve the problem by considering various different schedules and picking the best one to optimize your goals.

------------

Travel distances (in minutes):

Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22.

Golden Gate Park to Bayview: 23.

------------

CONSTRAINTS: You arrive at Bayview at 9:00AM. Barbara will be at Golden Gate Park from 8:00AM to 11:30AM. You'd like to meet Barbara for a minimum of 90 minutes.

------------

Your response should start with 'SOLUTION:'

&  

\textbf{Instance-Specific Constraints and Details:}

Travel Times:
    
    - Bayview to Golden Gate Park: 22 minutes.
    
    - Golden Gate Park to Bayview: 23 minutes (Note: This information is provided but not strictly necessary for this specific problem as the return trip isn't relevant to meeting Barbara).

------------

Locations:
    
    - Starting Location: Bayview
    
    - Meeting Location: Golden Gate Park
    
------------

Scheduled Meeting Times/Participant Availability:
    
    - Barbara is available at Golden Gate Park from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM.

------------

Arrival Time:
    
    - You arrive at Bayview at 9:00 AM.

------------

Minimum Meeting Duration:
    
    - The meeting with Barbara must be at least 90 minutes long.

------------

Sequence Requirements:
    
    - Travel (Bayview to Golden Gate Park) $\rightarrow$ Wait (if necessary, due to arriving before Barbara's availability ends) $\rightarrow$ Meeting (with Barbara)

------------

Objective: Maximize the number of friends met (in this case, it's simplified to just meeting Barbara, so the objective is to determine IF a meeting is possible given the constraints).
