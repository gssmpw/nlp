Calendar Scheduling & You are an expert at scheduling meetings. You are given a few constraints on the existing schedule of each participant, the meeting duration, and possibly some preferences on the meeting time. Note there exists a solution that works with existing schedule of every participant.

------------

\textbf{TASK:} You need to schedule a meeting for Michelle, Steven and Jerry for one hour between the work hours of 9:00 to 17:00 on Monday.

------------

Here are the existing schedules for everyone during the day:

- Michelle has meetings on Monday during 11:00 to 12:00;

- Steven has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 11:30 to 12:00, 13:30 to 14:00, 15:30 to 16:00;

 -Jerry has blocked their calendar on Monday during 9:00 to 9:30, 10:00 to 11:00, 11:30 to 12:30, 13:00 to 14:30, 15:30 to 16:00, 16:30 to 17:00;
 
------------

Find a time that works for everyone's schedule and constraints.

& 

1. Analyze Constraints:

- Participants: Michelle, Steven, Jerry

- Duration: 1 hour

- Work hours: 9:00 - 17:00

- Day: Monday

------------

2. Identify Individual Availability:

- Michelle: 9:00-11:00, 12:00-17:00

- Steven: 9:30-11:30, 12:00-13:30, 14:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00

- Jerry: 9:30-10:00, 11:00-11:30, 12:30-13:00, 14:30-15:30, 16:00-16:30

------------

3. Determine Common Availability: Looking for 1-hour slots:

- Comparing Michelle and Steven: 9:30-11:00, 12:00-13:30, 14:00-15:30, 16:00-17:00

- Comparing the above with Jerry:  14:30-15:30

------------

4. Prioritize Earliest Time Slot: The earliest 1-hour slot is 14:30-15:30

------------

5. Ensure Solution Exists:  The slot 14:30-15:30 works for all three.

------------

6. Strict Format Requirement:

SOLUTION: Here is the proposed time: Monday, 14:30 - 15:30
