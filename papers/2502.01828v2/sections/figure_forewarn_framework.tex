    \caption{\textbf{Training FOREWARN.} In part A (Sec.~\ref{sec:foresight}), a world model is pretrained to learn good latent embeddings of the dynamics conditioned on the observations and actions. In part B (Sec.~\ref{sec:forethought}), the sequence of learned latent embeddings is projected through a linear layer to the text embedding space, similar to the original vision token processing in the Llama-3.2 Model. The projection layer and Llama model are finetuned together using LoRA \cite{hu2022lora}, but the world model remains frozen. }
