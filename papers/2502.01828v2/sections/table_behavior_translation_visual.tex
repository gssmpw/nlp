    \caption{\textbf{Examples of Behavior Narrations Predicted by Each Approach.} The top row displays the ground-truth robot observations and the prompt used for querying behavior narrations.
Only \ours and \oursoracle consistently produce accurate outcome narrations, effectively capturing nuanced motion details. In contrast, the baselines frequently hallucinate or fail to capture critical contact details between the gripper and objects. For instance, in the \textbf{Bag} task, \vlmact, \vlmimg, and \vlmimgoracle all hallucinate that the robot is grasping the edge of the bag, whereas it is actually grasping the middle.}
