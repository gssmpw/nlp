\section{Limitation}
\label{sec:futureWork}

The Gait-Net occasionally fails to produce reasonable and consistent one-step gait durations in edge cases, causing non-converging solutions that hit the maximum iteration limit. This limitation arises from two main factors: (1) Gait-Net training data is collected under idealized simulation conditions with minimal real-world sensor noise, leading to (possible) arbitrary predictions in edge cases; and (2) while SQP is robust, integrating a neural network into a sequential solver does not guarantee convergence, requiring further formal analysis. Our approach addresses this with a tailored solution, though it involves more sensitive control parameter tuning.

Currently, the direct foot position constraint relies on real-time CoM position feedback, which eliminates the need for if-else conditions within the optimization process. However, this approach limits consideration to only the immediate next step, as the one-step preview data is applicable solely to the upcoming step. As a result, constraints for subsequent steps within the prediction horizon must be intentionally deactivated, ensuring that only the next step location is constrained using the available preview terrain data.
