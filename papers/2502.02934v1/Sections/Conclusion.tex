\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
In conclusion, we propose a Gait-Net-augmented kino-dynamic MPC framework for controlling humanoid robot locomotion over discrete terrains, enabling variable-frequency walking behaviors while explicitly constraining foot locations. Our approach addresses the challenge of concurrently optimizing contact location, contact force, and step duration in periodic walking motions through a solving mechanism that relies solely on sequential CMPCs. To achieve this, we leverage a pre-trained Gait-Net to bridge the gap between contact location and step duration within a centroidal dynamics formulation. This integration allows the spatial momentum and pose trajectories to be iteratively updated during the solving process, providing implicit kinematic assurance through trajectory reference design. The simulation and hardware experiments demonstrated effective control performance for 3-D stepping stone locomotion in a highly dynamic manner. The proposed control framework allows superior perturbation-resistant locomotion capabilities over baseline approaches. We also successfully achieved walking on a small-sized humanoid robot at a speed of 0.75 m/s while safely avoiding undesired terrain gaps and obstacles, even in the presence of terrain height perturbations.
