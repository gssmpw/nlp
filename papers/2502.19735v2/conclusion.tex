In this paper, we revealed the benefits of performing general MT tasks with inference-time reasoning, by combining human-aligned translation CoTs and RL strategies tailored for MT tasks. The success of R1-T1, our proposed MT framework, on MT tasks across multiple domains and languages reflects the necessity and wide existence of the reasoning processes in human translations, which are ignored by existing methods. Moreover, the self-evolved CoTs in translation reasoning learning provide R1-T1 with high flexibility in generalizing its translation ability to unseen languages, domains and tasks, as indicated by the improved translation performances in these unseen scenarios. Future work include incorporating more languages and CoTs in training and testing R1-T1 in more scenarios.
