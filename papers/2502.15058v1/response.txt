(i) (ii)

(a) This is a significant limitation because it does not allow us to investigate various machine learning approaches and techniques for improving pose estimation in our application.

(b) For example, the approach can be modified to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or Diffusion Models (DMs) instead of DMPs.
