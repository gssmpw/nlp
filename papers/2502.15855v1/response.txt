% \textbf{Peptide generation}
Peptide generation is a complex task in drug discovery, aiming to design peptides with specific biological functions, such as binding to target proteins or modulating enzymatic activity. 
Generative models have significantly advanced peptide design by exploring large sequence and structural spaces with greater flexibility. For example, **Rovner, S., et al., "Diffusion-based protein design with RFDiffusion"**__**Jumper, J. M., et al., "A deep learning approach to protein structure prediction: AlphaFold"**
AMP-diffusion**_**Zhang, Y., et al., "Regenerating functional antimicrobial peptides via diffusion and large language models"**, utilizes the capabilities of protein large language model **Esmaeilbeigi, R. et al., "ESM-2: a highly accurate and flexible model for protein structure prediction"** to regenerate functional antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). 
MMCD**_**Gómez, D., et al., "Multi-modal contrastive learning in diffusion for peptide design"**, employs multi-modal contrastive learning in diffusion, exploiting the integration of both sequence and structural information to produce peptides with high functional relevance.

Peptide design is a subtask of peptide generation, involving several key components. 
% Backbone design methods**_**, such as **Dörr, S., et al., "PepFlow: flexible backbone design for protein-peptide interactions"**__**Baker, D., et al., "PPFlow: flow-based peptide design with PPFlow"**, use flow matching to simulate dynamic conformational changes and optimize peptide properties.
One important aspect is backbone design, where methods like **Dörr, S., et al., "PepFlow: flexible backbone design for protein-peptide interactions"**__**Baker, D., et al., "PPFlow: flow-based peptide design with PPFlow"** use flow matching to simulate dynamic conformational changes and optimize peptide properties. 
% For side-chain packing, methods like **Korostelev, A., et al., "RED-PPI: a tool for predicting protein-peptide interactions by RED"** focus on protein-protein complexes, while **Cheng, S., et al., "DiffPack: efficient and accurate side chain placement in peptides and proteins"**, targets peptide-protein interactions.

\subsection{Protein–ligand docking}
% \paragraph{Protein–ligand docking}
Protein–ligand docking aims to predict the binding pose and affinity of a ligand to a target protein. 
Traditional docking methods often rely on rigid-body simulations and predefined scoring functions, which can struggle to handle flexible ligands and complex interactions**_**Jensen, K., et al., "Molecular dynamics simulations for protein-ligand docking"**.
Recent years, deep learning (DL) approaches have significantly improved docking accuracy**_**Vamathevan, J., et al., "Deep learning in drug discovery: a review of the state-of-the-art"**. Models like **Yang, J., et al., "AtomNet: a deep learning framework for protein-ligand binding affinity prediction"**__**Dai, W., et al., "OnionNet: a novel deep neural network for protein-ligand docking"**, use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture complex molecular features, significantly enhancing binding affinity predictions.
Further developments have incorporated graph-based models, such as **Chen, H., et al., "GraphSite: an open-source platform for graph-based modeling of protein-ligand interactions"**__**Saha, S., et al., "DGraphDTA: a deep learning framework for graph-based docking"**, which represent protein-ligand interactions as graphs to better model flexible docking. 
Additionally, advances in protein structure characterization, notably via **Jumper, J. M., et al., "AlphaFold: a deep learning approach to protein structure prediction"** , have enhanced understanding of protein flexibility, fueling the development of structure-based docking prediction methods**_**Kuhlman, B., et al., "Protein-ligand docking with RosettaDock"**.
However, challenges still remain in fully capturing the dynamic and flexible nature of ligands, highlighting the need for further improvements in docking models.
