\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We present \system{}, a system that combines attestation and network traffic analysis to detect malware in IoT devices. \system{} stores benign traffic patterns from IoT devices that are usually limited and predictable. On the other hand, devices with malware infection exhibits network traffic patterns that are likely divergent from the usual traffic pattern. When unusual patterns are detected, \system{} performs \ra{} on the IoT device that produces suspicious traffic pattern. If malware infection is confirmed, \system{} will report this incident; otherwise, it will whitelist the traffic pattern as benign traffic. 
Our evaluation shows that \system{} is both effective and efficient in profiling and monitoring uninfected and infected devices. It achieves 100\% TPR with low false positive rate (FPR) in most cases with low runtime (\ie{} $\sim$1.6 ms traffic classification time) and storage overheads. Finally, it outperforms the other approaches in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
