\begin{abstract}
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are vulnerable to malware and require new mitigation techniques due to their limited resources. To that end, previous research has used periodic Remote Attestation (\ra) or Traffic Analysis (\ta) to detect malware in IoT devices. However, \ra is expensive, and \ta only raises suspicion without confirming malware presence. To solve this, we design \system, the first system that blends \ra{} and \ta{} to offer a comprehensive approach to malware detection for the IoT ecosystem. \ta builds profiles of expected packet traces during benign operations of each device and then uses them to detect malware from network traffic in real-time. \ra confirms the presence or absence of malware on the device. \system{} achieves 100\% true positive rate. 
It also outperforms other approaches with 160$\times$ faster detection time. Finally, without \system{}, effective periodic \ra can consume at least $\sim$14$\times$ the amount of energy that a device needs in one hour.
