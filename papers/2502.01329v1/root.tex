\begin{abstract}
\glspl{qp} are widely used in the control of walking robots, especially in \gls{mpc} and \gls{wbc}.
In both cases, the controller design requires the formulation of a \gls{qp} and the selection of a suitable \gls{qp} solver, both requiring considerable time and expertise. 
% While there are benchmarks on the computational performance of \gls{qp} solvers, comparative studies on which combination of computational \gls{hw}, \gls{qp} formulation, and \gls{qp} solver is optimal are currently lacking. 
While computational performance benchmarks exist for \gls{qp} solvers, studies comparing optimal combinations of computational \gls{hw}, \gls{qp} formulation, and solver performance are lacking.
In this work, we compare dense and sparse \gls{qp} formulations, and multiple solving methods on different \gls{hw} architectures, focusing on their computational efficiency in dynamic walking of four-legged robots using \gls{mpc}.
We introduce the \gls{sfpw} as a performance measure to enable a cross-hardware comparison of the efficiency of \gls{qp} solvers. 
We also benchmark different \gls{qp} solvers for \gls{wbc} that we use for trajectory stabilization in quadrupedal walking. 
As a result, this paper provides recommendations for the selection of \gls{qp} formulations and solvers for different \gls{hw} architectures in walking robots and indicates which problems should be devoted the greater technical effort in this domain in future.
