%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
% \begin{abstract}
% Automatically detecting unknown words can help drive interactive methods to support reading for English as a second language (ESL) learners. 
% Previous methods of unknown word detection methods rely on gaze features obtained through eye trackers, with their detection accuracy greatly affected by the accuracy of eye tracking devices. 
% In this work, we present a real-time and high-accuracy unknown word detection method by combining information about the text with gaze data. We locate a target area using gaze and utilize pre-trained language models and knowledge grounding to analyze text for unknown word probabilities in this area. We then combine this text data with gaze information through a transformer-based model. The accuracy of our unknown word detection method is 97.6\%, and the F1-score is 71.1\%. To demonstrate the robustness of our method, we applied our method to another dataset collected with a relatively inaccurate webcam-based eye-tracking system. Our model can achieve the accuracy of 97.3\% and the F1-score of 65.1\% opening the potential for more accessible solutions than previously possible. 
% We also implemented a real-time reading assistance prototype to evaluate our model in real-time setting and show the usability of our method. The explanations of unknown words detected by our model are presented automatically. The user study shows that the precision is xx.x\% and xx.x\% of users think our prototype is useful.

%We then combine this text data with gaze information through a transformer-based model. 
English as a Second Language (ESL) learners often encounter unknown words that hinder their text comprehension. Automatically detecting these words as users read can enable computing systems to provide just-in-time definitions, synonyms, or contextual explanations, thereby helping users learn vocabulary in a natural and seamless manner.
This paper presents \name, a transformer-based machine learning method that predicts the probability of unknown words based on text content and eye gaze trajectory in real time with high accuracy. 
A 20-participant user study revealed that our method can achieve an accuracy of 97.6\%, and an F1-score of 71.1\%.
We implemented a real-time reading assistance prototype to show the effectiveness of \name. The user study shows improvement in willingness to use and usefulness compared to baseline methods.
