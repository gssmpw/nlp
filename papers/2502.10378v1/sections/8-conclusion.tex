\section{Conclusion}
We propose a highly accurate and real-time unknown-word detecting method based on gaze trajectory and pre-trained language models (PLMs). The text embedding derived from the PLM and the knowledge grounding provides rich linguistic characteristics for candidate words, and the gaze data locates the region of interest and supplies behavior information to the model. The evaluation shows that it achieves an accuracy of 97.6\% and F1-score of 71.1\%. The latency is within 1 second. Our method also works on noisy gaze data acquired by webcam with an accuracy of 97.3\% and an F1-score of 65.1\%, which demonstrates the accessibility and applicability for daily use. The experimental results show that the PLM contributes most to the performance and gaze provides user-dependent features. The real-time evaluation shows that our method achieves the F1-score of 56.54\% and makes reading more fluent. It also shows an improvement in the willingness to use and usefulness compared to the traditional click method. Due to the growing number of embedded eye tracking in commercial devices, we believe that lots of language learners can ultimately benefit from our technique.
