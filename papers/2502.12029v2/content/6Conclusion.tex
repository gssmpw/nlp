\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, to enhance the ability of LLMs to provide factual answers, we propose the knowledge-enhanced reasoning framework KnowPath, driven by the collaboration of internal and external knowledge.
It focuses on leveraging the reasoning paths generated by the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to guide the trustworthy directed subgraph exploration of knowledge graphs.
Extensive experiments show that:
1) Our KnowPath is optimal and excels at complex multi-hop tasks.
2) It demonstrates remarkable cost-effectiveness, with a 55\% reduction in the number of LLM calls and a 75\% decrease in the number of tokens consumed compared to the strong baselines.
3) KnowPath can explore directed subgraphs of the KGs, providing an intuitive and trustworthy reasoning process, greatly enhancing the overall interpretability.
