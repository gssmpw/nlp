In this paper, we systematically investigate the position bias problem in the multi-constraint instruction following. To quantitatively measure the disparity of constraint order, we propose a novel Difficulty Distribution Index (CDDI). Based on the CDDI, we design a probing task. First, we construct a large number of instructions consisting of different constraint orders. Then, we conduct experiments in two distinct scenarios. Extensive results reveal a clear preference of LLMs for ``hard-to-easy'' constraint orders. To further explore this, we conduct an explanation study. We visualize the importance of different constraints located in different positions and demonstrate the strong correlation between the model's attention distribution and its performance.
