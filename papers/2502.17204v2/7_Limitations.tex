Our work mainly focuses on the position bias problem in the multi-constraint instruction following. We make a quantitative analysis of the influence brought by different constraint orders in the instructions. However, there are still some limitations. The constraints in our work are usually parallel to each other, which means the order change will not affect the semantic meaning of the instructions. The position bias problem for for those sequential constraints need to be further explored. Moreover, we only investigate the phenomenon of position bias in existing LLM without offering a solution. In further work, we will conduct a further probing task in sequential constraints to improve the generalization of our findings.
