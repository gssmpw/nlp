\subsection{Implementation Details}
We utilize 8 NVIDIA A800 80GB GPUs to conduct all the experiments. We employ the vLLM framework~\cite{kwon2023efficient} to accelerate the model inference. For reproducibility, we employ the greed search in the whole inference (i.e., setting the ``do$\_$sample'' to false.).


\subsection{More details for Comstraint Sampling} \label{appx:cons_tax}
In this work, We categorize the constraints into 8 different groups. The categorization is shown in the Tab.~\ref{tab:ifeval}. For each group, there are multiple types of constraints. Specifically, the constraints are designated to: (1) Keyword constraints. These constraints focus on controlling the inclusion or exclusion of specific words or phrases within the response. (2) Language constraints. Language constraints govern the linguistic properties of the response, including the language in which the response is written (e.g., English). (3) Length constraints. These constraints focus on controlling the overall length of the response, including the number of paragraphs, words, and sentences. (4) Content Constraints. Content-related constraints define additional rules to ensure the response contains specific elements. (5) Format constraints. Formatting constraints focus on how the response is structured and styled. For example. (6) ChangeCase Constraints. These constraints focus on adjusting the case of words in the response. They may require the entire response to be in uppercase letters (e.g., ALL CAPS), or entirely in lowercase letters (e.g., all lowercase). (7) StartEnd constraints. These constraints limit the very beginning or ending of the model outputs. (8) Punctuation constraints. These constraints limit the appearance of specific commas.

Considering the LLM is vulnerable to different descriptions of the constraints~\cite{yan2024contrastive}, we employ the GPT4o-mini to generate different descriptions of the same constraints. Specifically, given a description example, we leverage the prompt shown in the Tab.~\ref{tab:100diverse} to seven distinct variants. Overall, we obtain 8 distinct descriptions for a specific type of constraint.
