\caption{Visualization of the evasion images found by different evasion methods on a rivaGAN watermarked image (with $\gamma = 0.75$; top row) and the respective histograms of the pixel difference ($y-$axis in $\log$ scale) between the evasion image and the clean image (bottom row). The vertical dashed line marks the $90 \%$ quantile. We can observe that the evasion image produced by DIP has almost no loss of image quality.}%
