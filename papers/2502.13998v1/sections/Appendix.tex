\section{Ranges of hyperparameters of various evasion methods}
\label{App: hyperparam}
\input{tex-table/Tab-App-Benchmark-Hyper-Param}
\cref{App tab: evasion hyperparam} presents the range of each hyperparameter and the grid resolution in our exhaustive search. If we simply use these typical values without exhaustive search, it is very likely that we will overestimate the level of robustness and underestimate the evasion image quality. \cref{Fig: DIP evade algo 2} shows an example of the exhaustive search process on our DIP-based evasion.

In \cref{App tab: evasion hyperparam}, the quality index of VAE indexes the individual pretrained model (six provided in the original work). Thus, the minimal resolution for VAE search is $1$ and cannot be smaller. Moreover, the last column shows the typical value used in the existing literature for robustness evaluation as a reference, e.g., \cite{zhao2023invisible, saberi2023robustness}. To the best of our knowledge, the reason why these values are chosen as defaults is not well justified.

% \cref{Fig: DIP evade algo 2} presents several illustrative trajectories of image quality and evasion success by our DIP-based evasion. 
% as well as evasion images with the best quality found by the exhaustive search. Similar approaches are applied to other methods using their hyperparameters listed in \cref{App tab: evasion hyperparam}, respectively.
