Process mining methods are covered by a vast number of works. 
Most aspects of process mining are covered in the books Van der Aalst, "Process Mining" and in the subsequent handbook Van der Werf et al., "Process-Aware Information Systems". These works provide a solid foundation for the area with all the necessary definitions, methods, and algorithms.

The standard DFG discovery method is known to be problematic in some cases Rozenberg et al., "Formal Modeling of Business Processes". The work describes the problem with cycles that appear in process models containing parallel events or due to event names happening in different orders, even if in observable behaviour all event names appear at most once per trace. That implies that users should be aware of the features of the DFG discovery algorithm to avoid misleading interpretations.

BPMN models with repeated event nodes were considered La Rosa et al., "Advanced Topics in BPMN and Six Sigma", where the authors describe a discovery algorithm for exploratory data analysis. By allowing vertices to repeat in the models, the resulting models can be simplified. Repeating event nodes is also an alternative way to visualize parallel events. This creates less visual clutter and results in clearer and more accurate models.

The search for similarities and differences in process model patterns is present in many fields. Works that examine the area of concept drift focus on changes in the process over time Gunther et al., "Detecting Concept Drift from Temporal Data". This can also be described as finding the parts where the processes are the same and where they are different. Another area is the repair of process models Dijkman et al., "Graph-Based Detection of Inconsistent Data", where the goal is to improve the quality of a model by changing as few parts as possible. During the model repair process, the model is decomposed into parts Kumar et al., which are analysed separately. 
Bad parts can be repaired, and then all the parts are composed into a repaired model Berti et al.. In addition, process models can be decomposed into parts to make them easier to compare more accurately La Rosa et al..

Assessment of process models is covered by conformance checking techniques Van Dongen et al., "Conformance Checking", where alignments and token-based replay are the two main ways. The token-based replay approach was first mentioned in the work of Gunther, "Token-Based Replay for Conformance Checking". The trace alignment approach was first mentioned in the work of De Weerdt et al.. With the help of these algorithms, we can obtain the precision and fitness of a model based on a given event log. Conformance checking algorithms also relate to the question of similarities and differences between process models and event logs. One of the works Montali et al., described the conformance checking technique that can detect differences in model fragments through event relations.
