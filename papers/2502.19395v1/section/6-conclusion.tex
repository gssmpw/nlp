\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we propose an antibody sequence design framework, {\igseek}, from a new learning-based structure retrieval perspective. Specifically, {\igseek} first constructs a CDR vector database using a multi-channel equivariant graph neural networks. It then predicts CDR sequences from templates retrieved from isomorphic structures in the database. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of {\igseek}, providing insights into de novo antibody sequence design and can inspire further investigatino in this direction.
