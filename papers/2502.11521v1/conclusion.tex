\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced \tool, the first tool that utilizes LLMs specifically for detecting price manipulation attacks.
\tool employs LLMs to intelligently infer the trend of token price changes based on balance information within transaction executions.
To strengthen LLMs in this aspect, we simulated on-chain transaction data and fine-tuned a DeFi price-specific LLM.
We also proposed a graph-based method to recover high-level DeFi operations and systematically mined eight price manipulation patterns.
Our evaluation demonstrated \tool's superior performance over SOTA approaches and real-world impact.
