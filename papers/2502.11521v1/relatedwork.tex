Prior efforts~\cite{zhou2021high, qin2021attacking, qin2022quantifying, daian2020flash, zhou2023sok} have elucidated threats in blockchain and attacks against the DeFi ecosystem. Some transaction-based systems have been proposed to mine vulnerable transaction sequences~\cite{zhang2020txspector, so2021smartest}, explore arbitrage opportunities~\cite{zhou2021just}, detect malicious phishing~\cite{he2023txphishscope}, and simulate attacks to prevent intrusions~\cite{qin2023blockchain}.

Tools like FlashSyn~\cite{chen2024flashsyn}, DeFiRanger~\cite{DeFiRanger23}, DeFiTainter~\cite{DeFiTainter23}, and DeFort~\cite{DeFort24} are capable of detecting attacks associated with price manipulation. FlashSyn uses numerical approximation techniques to synthesize malicious contracts that target DeFi apps through price manipulation attacks. However, there is a gap between the synthesized contracts and those that launch attacks on the live blockchain.DeFiRanger generates cash flow trees (CFT) from a transaction, translates the semantics of CFT into high-level DeFi actions, and uses specific patterns to detect price manipulation attacks. Yet, DeFiRanger is significantly limited by its reliance on predefined templates. DeFiTainter constructs call graphs based on contract states and transactions, then performs inter-contract taint analysis to examine all execution paths and uncover price manipulation attacks. Nonetheless, DeFiTainter's approach requires manual analysis and labeling of taint sources and sinks, which is challenging. DeFort uses a price manipulation behavior model to guide detection and analysis but its boundary calculation mechanism lacks sensitivity to attacks characterized by minor price fluctuations.

\textbf{Program Analysis for Contract Security.}
Traditional tools such as Slither~\cite{feist2019slither}, Zeus~\cite{kalra2018zeus}, and Securify~\cite{tsankov2018securify} employ static analysis methods to detect vulnerabilities at the source code and bytecode levels. Symbolic execution has also shown significant potential in this area, with tools like Mythril~\cite{Mythril}, Oyente~\cite{luu2016making}, and Manticore~\cite{mossberg2019manticore} developed based on this technique. Dynamic analysis is another core methodology utilized by various tools~\cite{jiang2018contractfuzzer,liu2018reguard,shou2023ityfuzz,qin2023towards}. Some tools are specifically designed to detect particular types of vulnerabilities; for example, VetSC~\cite{duan2022towards} identifies business logic bugs by vetting inconsistencies between UI and contract code, SailFish~\cite{bose2022sailfish} focuses on state inconsistency issues, and JACKAL~\cite{gritti2023confusum} targets confused deputy vulnerabilities.

\textbf{LLMs for Smart Contract Security.}
LLMs have become formidable tools in the realm of blockchain security.
GPTScan~\cite{sun2024gptscan} uses LLMs for code understanding, incorporating static analysis to detect logical vulnerabilities in contracts.
BlockGPT~\cite{gai2023blockchain} serves as a real-time intrusion detection system, using LLMs to rank transaction anomalies.
LLM4Vuln~\cite{sun2024llm4vuln} refines the reasoning processes of LLMs when analyzing smart contract vulnerabilities.
iAudit~\cite{ma2024combining} combines fine-tuning with LLM-driven agents to provide intuitive smart contract auditing with explanations.
PropertyGPT~\cite{liu2024propertygpt} uses retrieval-augmented property generation for smart contracts, leveraging LLMs' in-context learning capabilities.
Similarly, SMARTINV~\cite{wang2024smartinv} employs Tier of Thought (ToT) to reason across different modalities of smart contracts, generating invariants in the process.
To the best of our knowledge, \tool is the first tool that uses LLMs specifically designed for detecting price manipulation attacks.
% ACFIX\cite{zhang2024acfix} is developed to efficiently address access control (AC) vulnerabilities in smart contracts by steering LLMs with established AC practices and relevant code context. 
% SMARTINV\cite{wang2024smartinv} utilizes Tier of Thought (ToT) to reason across various modalities of smart contracts, generating invariants in the process. It then identifies potential vulnerabilities by detecting violations of these generated invariants.
