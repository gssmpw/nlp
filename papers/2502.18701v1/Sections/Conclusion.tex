\section{Conclusion}

Accessibility in online shopping remains an open problem for BLV screen reader users. In this study, we investigated the issues experienced by screen reader users when shopping online and developed a web browser plugin that applies GenAI to improve the accessibility of the website for screen readers. Our evaluation shows improvement (as reported by accessibility checkers and self-reported by users) in the navigation and labeling of items and can potentially be used by both users and developers to improve the accessibility of their online shopping experience. 

We believe that our work proves that application of GenAI and LLMs in particular can automatically improve the web browsing accessibility and reduce the burden on both users and developers. We believe that our work contributes to the topic of web development and accessibility in the coming age of ubiquitous human-AI interactions, and we hope that our study would contribute to the work of researchers and practitioners in the fields of AI and HCI.
