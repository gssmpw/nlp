\begin{abstract}
%Online interactions and online shopping are ubiquitous in everyday life and are common among people with vision impairments. Despite the adoption of web accessibility standards, many e-commerce websites can still pose a challenge for screen reader users with vision impairments, especially when it comes to website navigation and category selection. Our study addresses this problem by investigating challenges of screen reader users in online shopping, proposes and evaluates a browser plugin prototype that restructures the website content using generative AI, and evaluates it in a series of semi-structured user interviews. Our results indicate that [INDICATE SOME RESULT]. We provide a further set of guidelines on how [EXPLAIN OUR CONTRIBUTION HERE]

% Online interactions and e-commerce are commonplace among people with visual impairments. However, despite the implementation of web accessibility standards, many e-commerce platforms continue to present challenges to screen reader users, particularly in areas such as website navigation and information retrieval. This study investigates the difficulties encountered by screen reader users during online shopping experiences. We conducted a formative study with Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users and designed a web browser plugin that uses Generative AI to restructure website content, with the aim of improving navigation for screen reader users. We evaluated the effectiveness of this solution using an automated accessibility tool and through user interviews. Our findings indicate that our approach creates an improved header hierarchy and provides correct labeling for essential information. Based on these insights, we discuss its potential usage as both a user and a developer tool that can significantly improve screen reader accessibility of websites. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to improve digital accessibility in e-commerce, potentially benefiting both users with visual impairments and website developers seeking to create more inclusive online shopping environments.

Our approach improved the header hierarchy and provided correct labeling for essential information. We evaluated the effectiveness of this solution using an automated accessibility tool and through user interviews. Our results show that the revised webpages generated by our system offer significant improvements over the original webpages regarding screen reader navigation experience.

    \caption[This image compares three versions of a web page: the original website, Option 1 (Regenerated HTML), and Option 2 (Reorganized HTML Tags). The original website, shown on the left, is the Mercari marketplace featuring a colorful layout with product categories, a search bar, and a prominent ``Mercari x Japan'' banner. In the center, Option 1 displays a text-only version of the site, with a hierarchical structure of headings and links, removing visual elements to focus on content accessibility. On the right, Option 2 appears visually identical to the original but with potential structural changes to improve screen reader navigation. Each version includes a zoomed-in section highlighting accessibility information: the original shows a ``Women'' heading with contrast ratio and role details; Option 1's zoomed section displays a ``Sign up'' link with improved contrast and keyboard accessibility; Option 2's zoomed area is similar to the original but with a ``generic'' role instead of ``heading''. This comparison illustrates different approaches to improving web accessibility: complete HTML regeneration for a text-focused experience, and HTML tag reorganization for improved structure while maintaining visual design.] {From left to right: the original website, Option 1 (Regenerated HTML), and Option 2 (Reorganized HTML Tags). Option 1 is generated using a GenAI-powered extension that rewrites the HTML to enhance accessibility, while Option 2 reorganizes the original HTML tags to address accessibility issues without altering the visual design. This example highlights the changes made in both versions compared to the original website. Both versions simplify navigation by removing single-category headings, reducing clutter and minimizing fatigue for screen reader users.}
