  %\caption{\textbf{noMAE} is the first multi-scale SSL paradigm for automotive point clouds. Using our three main components of: efficient \textbf{n}eighboring \textbf{o}ccupancy \textbf{MAE}, mutli-scale pretexts and a novel heirarechal mask generation, noMAE learns a strong hierarchal representation. Finetuning the pretrained models leads to SOTA downstream performance on three different benchmarks. As can be seen in the figure noMAE improves Nuscenes semseg by 1.4 mIoU, Waymo semseg by 1.0 mIou and Nuscenes objdet by \TODO{...} without the use of extra data.}
