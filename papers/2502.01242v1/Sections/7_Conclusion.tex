\section{Conclusion}

This work presents a decentralized strategy for sensing in \acf{DMS} using \acf{NCA} in combination with a newly developed soft inductive sensor. We demonstrated that this approach reliably infers global object properties, such as the geometric center, using purely local interactions. The system exhibits robustness to noise and sensor faults, maintaining performance under challenging conditions. 
Moreover, we have shown that these models scale without loss of accuracy to significantly larger sensor arrays, reinforcing the potential of decentralized methodologies to overcome the limitations of centralized sensing and control. This proof of concept lays the foundation for fully distributed, fault-tolerant manipulation architectures apable of dynamically responding to component failures.
The findings suggest a promising direction for future research in developing versatile, scalable, and efficient \ac{DMS}, particularly for applications in harsh environments or those requiring high reliability and adaptability.
