\section{Sampling Prompts}
\label{sec:appendix:sampling_prompts}
To produce prompts for our provenance testers, we use indiscriminately five popular LLMs: \texttt{gemini-pro-1.5},
 \texttt{claude-3.5-sonnet},
 \texttt{gemini-flash-1.5},
 \texttt{deepseek-chat}, and
 \texttt{gpt-4o-mini}. 
Each produced prompt is an incomplete sentence containing five to twenty words -- refer to Table~\ref{tbl:eval:prompts} for examples.
