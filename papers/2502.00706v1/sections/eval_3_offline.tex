We next evaluate strategies for reducing offline complexity, which refers to the number of queries made to pre-trained models during testing. We implement this reduction using BAI, as described in Section~\ref{sec:query} and given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:offline_mab}.
%
We test this approach on both benchmarks by setting a target budget of $T$ queries (prompts) per pre-trained model. For example, with $T=1000$ on \bencho, which contains $10$ pre-trained models, the BAI-based provenance tester has a maximum budget of $10 \cdot 1,000 = 10,000$ total queries to make its decision.

Table~\ref{tab:eval:bai} compares the performance of the base tester and the BAI-enhanced version across different query budgets $T\in \{500,1000,2000\}$. The results show that the BAI tester successfully reduces offline complexity by $10\%-30\%$ (as shown in the ``avg queries'' column). However, this reduction comes at a significant cost to recall, while precision remains largely unchanged.
%
For instance, with $T=1,000$ on \bencho, BAI reduces the average number of queries from $1,000$ to $605$, but recall drops from $0.86$ to $0.63$. Similarly, on \bencht, the average queries decrease from $1,000$ to $809$, but recall falls from $0.68$ to $0.42$. This pattern persists across different values of $T$ and both benchmarks, suggesting that the trade-off between query reduction and recall preservation is not favorable in most cases.
