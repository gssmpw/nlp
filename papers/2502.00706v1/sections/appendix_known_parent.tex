\section{Testing with Known Parent}
\label{sec:appendix:known_parent}


We evaluate the provenance tester for cases where the parent model is given, addressing whether a pair of models $(P,C)$ constitutes a provenance pair.
%
We construct test pairs from both \bencho and \bencht benchmarks. From \bencho, we take all 100 true pairs $(P_i,C_i)$ and create 100 false pairs $(\tilde{P_i},C_i)$ by selecting one random non-parent $\tilde{P_i}\neq P_i$ for each child $C_i$. This ensures a balanced dataset where random guessing would achieve 50\% accuracy. We similarly obtain 766 testing pairs from \bencht\footnote{Unlike \bencho, \bencht already contains (child) models that have no known parent among the 57 pre-trained models, and we use these as one of the negative pairs.}.

Results from testing both benchmarks are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:eval:known-parent-a} and~\ref{fig:eval:known-parent-b}. As expected, the tester performs better when the suspected parent is known compared to cases with unspecified parents. While recall remains unchanged, precision reaches 100\%.
This improvement occurs because false positives now require both that the statistical hypothesis test returns the wrong parent and that this wrong parent matches the suspected parent. The precision with known parents ($P_{known parent}$) is lower bounded by the precision with unspecified parents ($P_{unspecified}$), and depends on how we sample the incorrect parents. With uniform random sampling, it can be estimated as $P_{known parent} = 100 - \frac{100-P_{unspecified}}{n-1}$, where $n$ is the number of pre-trained models. For both benchmarks, this yields precision slightly below 100\%.
