\section{Reducing Offline Queries with Best Arm Identification}
\label{sec:appendix:offline_bai}
To reduce the offline queries to the parent and control models we replace the hypothesis tests with Best Arm Identification (BAI) algorithm (that provides as well theoretical guarantees on confidence). For practical purposes, in our implementation given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:offline_mab} we use the BAI proposed in~\cite{even2006action}.
