\section{Advanced Sampling of Prompts}
\label{sec:appendix:advanced_sampling}
We further give the rejection sampling of prompts used to reduce the online complexity of the tester. 
We present only the sampling procedure, i.e. how a set of prompts $x_1,\ldots,x_{T'}$ is produced given the original prompt sampler $\Omega$, and the two sets of models: the parent candidate set $F$, and the control set $C$. The tester that uses the new set is identical to the original tester, with the only difference that it samples prompts from the new set. 
The sampling is given in Algorithm~\ref{alg:advanced_prompts}.
