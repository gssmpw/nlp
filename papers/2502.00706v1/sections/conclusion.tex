\section{Conclusion}

Our work formulates the model provenance testing problem for large language models which has many applications such as in detection of misuse of licensing and terms of use or problematic customized models. We present an approach based on statistical testing with minimal assumptions that has high accuracy for real-world benchmarks. Our key insight is that models derived through standard customization approaches maintain a level of similarity to their parent model that is statistically distinguishable from unrelated parents. We evaluate this observation empirically, together with our approach and several optimizations in Section~\ref{sec:eval}. We find our proposed method to be practical for deciding LLM provenance.
