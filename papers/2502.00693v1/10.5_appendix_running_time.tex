\section{Running Time}\label{sec:appendix_running_time}
In this section, we provide the proof of running time for Algorithm~\ref{alg:init}. The running time for our algorithm consists of two parts: time for initialization in Section~\ref{sec:time_init} and time for query 
in Section~\ref{sec:time_query}. 
\subsection{Running time for initialization}\label{sec:time_init}
Now we calculate the time of initialization for our algorithm. 
\begin{lemma}[Running time for initialization]\label{lem:init_time}
Let $\mathcal{T}_h$ denote the time of evaluation of function $h$ at any point. 

It takes $O(|A| \cdot k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h + m)$ time to run the initialization function.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
 
{\bf Step 1} Let's consider the initialization of the standard Bloom filter. 

A single element $x$ needs $O(k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h)$ time to compute over $k$ hash functions. 

There are $|A|$ elements which need to be inserted. 

Combining the above two facts, it needs $O(|A| \cdot k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h)$ time to initialise the standard Bloom filter. 

{\bf Step 2} Let's consider the ``Flip each bit" part. 

Since there are $m$ bits in the Bloom filter, it takes $O(m)$ time to flip each bit.

Therefore, the initialization function needs $O(|A| \cdot k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h + m)$ time to run. 

\end{proof}

\subsection{Running time for query}\label{sec:time_query}
Then, we proceed to calculate the query time for our algorithm.

\begin{lemma}[Running time for query]\label{lem:query_time}
Let $\mathcal{T}_h$ denote the time of evaluation of function $h$ at any point. 
It takes $O(k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h)$ time to run each query $y$ in the query function.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

For each query $y$, the algorithm needs $O(k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h)$ time to compute the hash values of $y$ over $k$ hash functions. 

Therefore, it takes $O(k\cdot \mathcal{T}_h)$ time to run the query function for each query. 
\end{proof}

By combing the result of Lemma~\ref{lem:init_time} and Lemma~\ref{lem:query_time}, we can obtain the running of our entire algorithm is $O(|A|\cdot k \cdot \mathcal{T}_h + m)$.
