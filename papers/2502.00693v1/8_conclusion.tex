\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we propose DPBloomfilter, a novel method ensuring the privacy of the Bloom filter via random response. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying the random response mechanism to achieve DP on the membership query task of the Bloom filter. 
From the privacy side, we have proved that our method achieves $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP with the same running complexity as the standard Bloom filter. 
From the utility side, we demonstrate from both theoretical and experimental perspectives that the Bloom filter can ensure high utility while ensuring differential privacy.
