\caption{Evaluation results for translation and rephrasing. The first row shows the percentage of correct samples tagged by at least one evaluator. The second row refers to samples tagged as correct by two evaluators. The third row indicates samples labeled as correct by all three evaluators. The last row shows the agreement rate among the three evaluators.}
