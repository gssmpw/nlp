    \caption{t-SNE visualization of representations extracted by (a) ViT (b) MineCLIP and (c) Action-guided Behavior Encoder across \textit{Atomic Tasks}. The visualization results show that the representations in (a) and (b) cannot distinguish between different tasks, whereas our Action-guided Behavior Encoder clearly differentiates the behavior representations for the four tasks.}
