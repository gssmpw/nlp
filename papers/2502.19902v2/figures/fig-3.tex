    \caption{An illustration of VPT (text) \cite{vpt}, STEVE-1 \cite{lifshitz2024steve}, and Optimus-2 executing the open-ended instruction, ``I need some iron ores, what should I do?''. Existing policies are limited by their instruction comprehension abilities and thus fail to complete the task, whereas GOAP leverages the language understanding capabilities of the MLLM, enabling it to accomplish the task.}
