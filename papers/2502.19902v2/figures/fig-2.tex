    \caption{Overview of Optimus-2. Given a task and the current observation, Optimus-2 first uses an MLLM-based Planner to generate a series of sub-goals. Optimus-2 then sequentially executes these sub-goals through GOAP. GOAP obtains behavior tokens for the current timestep via the Action-guided Behavior Encoder, and these behavior tokens, along with image and text tokens, are fed into the LLM to predict subsequent actions.}
