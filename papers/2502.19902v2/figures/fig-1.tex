    \caption{\textbf{Left}: General agent framework. \textbf{Right}: Comparison between existing goal-conditioned policies and ours. Existing Transformer-XL-based policies \cite{cai2023groot,lifshitz2024steve} exhibit limited natural language understanding capabilities and rely solely on combining implicit goal embeddings with visual embeddings as inputs. In contrast, our GOAP achieves superior action prediction by 1) employing an Action-guided behavior encoder to strengthen causal modeling between observations and actions, as well as to improve historical sequence modeling capabilities, and 2) leveraging MLLM to enhance open-ended language comprehension.}

%Existing goal-conditioned policies combine implicit goal embeddings with visual embeddings as input. In contrast, Optimus-2 leverages a behavior encoder to capture the relationship between vision and action, interact with historical sequences, and utilize the MLLM's visual perception and language understanding capabilities for more accurate action prediction.
