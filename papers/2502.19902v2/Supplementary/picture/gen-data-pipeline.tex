    \caption{The pipeline for generating the MGOA dataset. First, we extracted item names from the Minecraft Wiki and employed GPT-4 to generate corresponding instructions. These instructions were then provided as input to STEVE-1, enabling it to interact with the environment to accomplish the tasks. During task execution, each observation was paired with its corresponding action, resulting in the creation of goal-observation-action pairs.}
