\section{Detailed Baselines Settings and Results}
\label{appendix:E}

For a fair comparison, we also report the performance under the optimal settings suggested by GCG and PAIR.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

As illustrated in Table~\ref{table:13}, our proposed PiF method still achieves superior ASR compared to GCG and PAIR on both Llama-2 and GPT-4 models.
