\section{One-Query Settings and Results}
\label{appendix:G}

We also consider the most stringent zero-shot transferability setting, which permits only one query to jailbreak the targeted LLM. 
To achieve this, we introduce an additional hyperparameter: Warm-up = 7. 
This hyperparameter entails initially optimizing our jailbreaking attack seven times on the source LLM, aiming to adequately disperse the modelâ€™s focus from malicious-intent tokens to neutral-intent tokens.

As detailed in Table~\ref{table:15}, in the one-query scenario, our method still achieves an ASR of over 72\% and an AHS of over 3, demonstrating reliable performance even under the most restrictive conditions.
