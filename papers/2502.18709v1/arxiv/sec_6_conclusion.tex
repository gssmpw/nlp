\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we developed multiple algorithms for online structured prediction  
under bandit and delayed feedback and analyzed their surrogate regret. 
Among several contributions, a noteworthy one is the algorithm for bandit feedback whose surrogate regret bound does not explicitly depend on the label set size $K$, which is achieved by leveraging the pseudo-inverse matrix estimator.  
Several interesting research directions remain.  
One is to investigate surrogate regret lower bounds under bandit feedback and delayed feedback. 
In the existing $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for bandit feedback, the optimal dependence on $d$ is unexplored.  
Investigating the tightness of the $O(D^{2/3} T^{1/3})$ upper bound for delayed and full information feedback is also an important question.  
Another key direction is extending our results to settings  
where the delay time is not constant in delayed feedback,  
which is crucial for some practical applications.
