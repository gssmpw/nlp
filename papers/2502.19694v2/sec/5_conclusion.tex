\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we present BEVDiffuser, a novel diffusion model that denoises BEV feature maps using ground-truth guidance. BEVDiffuser consists of a U-Net model trained on BEV feature maps generated by existing BEV models. The U-Net model predicts clean BEV feature maps conditioned on the ground-truth object layout, which then derives the denoising process. BEVDiffuser can be used as a training-only plug-and-play module to enhance the existing BEV models by providing denoised BEV feature maps as additional supervision to BEV predictions. Extensive experiments on challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate BEVDiffuser's exceptional denoising and generation capabilities, resulting in significant improvements to existing BEV models, without the need for architectural changes or additional computational overhead. Moreover, results on long-tail object detection and under challenging weather and lighting conditions further confirm the efficacy of BEVDiffuser in improving the BEV quality. In future work, we plan to investigate potential applications of BEVDiffuser for other autonomous driving tasks, such as motion prediction and data augmentation for corner cases.
