Each item belongs to a particular category and has an associated weight and value. The goal of this problem is to select a subset of items such that all categories are fairly represented, the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the capacity of the knapsack, and the total value is maximized. We study the fairness parameters such as the bounds on the total value of items from each category, the total weight of items from each category, and the total number of items from each category. We give approximation algorithms for these problems. We also give experimental validation for the efficiency of our algorithms. These fairness notions could also be extended to the min-knapsack problem. The fair knapsack problems encompass various important problems, such as participatory budgeting, fair budget allocation, and advertising.},
