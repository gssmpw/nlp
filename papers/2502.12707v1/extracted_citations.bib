abstract = {Learning graphical structures based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) is a challenging problem, partly owing to the large search space of possible graphs. A recent line of work formulates the structure learning problem as a continuous constrained optimization task using the least squares objective and an algebraic characterization of DAGs. However, the formulation requires a hard DAG constraint and may lead to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we study the asymptotic role of the sparsity and DAG constraints for learning DAG models in the linear Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases, and investigate their usefulness in the finite sample regime. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a likelihood-based score function, and show that one only has to apply soft sparsity and DAG constraints to learn a DAG equivalent to the ground truth DAG. This leads to an unconstrained optimization problem that is much easier to solve. Using gradient-based optimization and GPU acceleration, our procedure can easily handle thousands of nodes while retaining a high accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and show that the DAG-penalized likelihood objective is indeed favorable over the least squares one with the hard DAG constraint.},

abstract="ALARM (A Logical Alarm Reduction Mechanism) is a diagnostic application used to explore probabilistic reasoning techniques in belief networks. ALARM implements an alarm message system for patient monitoring; it calculates probabilities for a differential diagnosis based on available evidence. The medical knowledge is encoded in a graphical structure connecting 8 diagnoses, 16 findings and 13 intermediate variables. Two algorithms were applied to this belief network: (1) a message-passing algorithm by Pearl for probability updating in multiply connected networks using the method of conditioning; and (2) the Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter algorithm for local probability computations on graphical structures. The characteristics of both algorithms are analyzed and their specific applications and time complexities are shown.",

abstract = {SUMMARY A causal network is used in a number of areas as a depiction of patterns of ‘influence’ among sets of variables. In expert systems it is common to perform ‘inference’ by means of local computations on such large but sparse networks. In general, non-probabilistic methods are used to handle uncertainty when propagating the effects of evidence, and it has appeared that exact probabilistic methods are not computationally feasible. Motivated by an application in electromyography, we counter this claim by exploiting a range of local representations for the joint probability distribution, combined with topological changes to the original network termed ‘marrying’ and ‘filling-in‘. The resulting structure allows efficient algorithms for transfer between representations, providing rapid absorption and propagation of evidence. The scheme is first illustrated on a small, fictitious but challenging example, and the underlying theory and computational aspects are then discussed.},

abstract = {We establish a new framework for statistical estimation of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) when data are generated from a linear, possibly non-Gaussian structural equation model. Our framework consists of two parts: (1) inferring the moralized graph from the support of the inverse covariance matrix; and (2) selecting the best-scoring graph amongst DAGs that are consistent with the moralized graph. We show that when the error variances are known or estimated to close enough precision, the true DAG is the unique minimizer of the score computed using the reweighted squared l2-loss. Our population-level results have implications for the identifiability of linear SEMs when the error covariances are specified up to a constant multiple. On the statistical side, we establish rigorous conditions for high-dimensional consistency of our two-part algorithm, defined in terms of a "gap" between the true DAG and the next best candidate. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamic programming may be used to select the optimal DAG in linear time when the treewidth of the moralized graph is bounded.},

In this paper, we present a dataset from an industrial subsystem at the European Spallation Source along with its causal graph which has been constructed from expert knowledge. This provides a testbed for causal discovery from time series observations of complex systems, and we believe this can help inform the development of causal discovery methodology.}

Despite its importance in real-world applications, contemporary research still struggles with high-dimensional causal problems. Leveraging the efficiency of probabilistic circuits, which offer tractable computation of marginal probabilities, we introduce $\Psi$net, a probabilistic model designed for large-scale causal inference. $\Psi$net is a type of sum-product network where layering and the einsum operation allow for efficient parallelization. By incorporating interventional data into the learning process, the model can learn the effects of interventions and make predictions based on the specific interventional setting. Overall, $\Psi$net is a causal probabilistic circuit that efficiently answers causal queries in large-scale problems. We present evaluations conducted on both synthetic data and a substantial real-world dataset, demonstrating $\Psi$net’s ability to capture causal relationships in high-dimensional settings.}
