Generative models have shown great promise in recommendation systems due to their ability to capture complex user-item interactions. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FMRec}, a unified framework for leveraging flow-based generative models in recommendation systems. Our framework generalizes prior approaches, such as the Diffusion Recommender Model (DiffRec), showing that these methods are special cases within the broader paradigm of flow-based modeling. Building on this foundation, we propose \textbf{Discrete-FMRec}, a novel instantiation of FMRec that incorporates two key advancements: (1) the use of discrete flow matching to better align with the inherent discreteness of recommendation tasks, and (2) the integration of a prior distribution inspired by real-world human-item interaction patterns, enhancing the model's realism and performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Discrete-FMRec achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics, significantly outperforming existing generative and non-generative approaches. By unifying and extending flow-based methods, our work provides a flexible and effective framework for advancing recommendation systems.
