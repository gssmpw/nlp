\subsection{Collaborative Filtering}

\noindent \textbf{Non-Generative Collaborative Filtering.}
Non-generative collaborative filtering learns user and item representations in a discriminative manner. Most non-generative CF models rely on Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss____ along with the application of deep learning techniques____, such as graph neural networks____, contrastive learning____, and diffusion models____ to enhance more robust and informative representation learning.

\noindent \textbf{Generative Collaborative Filtering.}
The generative collaborative filtering methods take a different approach from learning user and item representations. These methods aim to directly reconstruct user-item interaction matrices by generating probability distributions. The denoising autoencoders (DAEs)____ and variational autoencoders (VAEs)____ have been prevalent in generative CF. The DAE-based CF models____ encode corrupted user-item interactions into latent representations and decode them to reconstruct the original input, learning to denoise and capture underlying patterns. The VAE-based recommenders____ encode user-item interactions into latent probability distributions and decode these distributions to predict user preferences and interactions.
Recently, diffusion models____ have also shown promise in generative CF. DiffRec____ is the pioneer in using diffusion models in collaborative filtering by modeling the distributions of user-item interaction probabilities. GiffCF____ and CF-Diff____ further advance and enhance diffusion-based CF models by incorporating graph signal processing and attention mechanisms, respectively.

\subsection{Generative Models}

\noindent \textbf{Diffusion Models}  
____ generate data by iteratively refining samples from Gaussian noise to meaningful outputs. These models have achieved strong results across domains, including images____, molecules____, and recommendation systems____. 

\noindent \textbf{Flow Matching}
____ is a flow-based method using continuous normalizing flows____ as alternatives to diffusion models. Conditional Flow Matching____ directly learns a vector field that defines the probability flow from a source distribution to the target distribution, conditioned on individual data points. Flow matching offers faster inference and improved efficiency and has been applied to various generative tasks such as images____, videos____, and proteins____. However, its potential in recommender systems remains unexplored, presenting opportunities for future research.
