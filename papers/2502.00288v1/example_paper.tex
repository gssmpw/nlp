% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
% \usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2025} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2025} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}


% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
% \usepackage{icml2025}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2025}

% For theorems and such
\usepackage{amsmath}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2025
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\section*{Impact Statement}

This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{langley00}

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
