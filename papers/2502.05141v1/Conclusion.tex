\section{Conclusion}
We study the existence of approximate MMS allocations in the case of subadditive valuations and few agents. We showed the existence of $1/2$-MMS allocations for at most four agents with subadditive valuations, as well as for multiple agents when they have one of two types of valuations.
The most challenging question of whether a constant-factor MMS approximations always exist for $n > 4$ agents, remains open. One hopes that our insights and technical lemmas might help pave the way for more general positive results. The study of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MMS(${\bf d}$) and $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MMS(${\bf P}$) was proved useful for providing approximate MMS guarantees, but we believe they are of independent interest and deserve further investigation.
