\paragraph{$\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MMS(${\bf d}$).} In order to show Theorem~\ref{thm:mainTheorem}, we find it useful to study a notion that we call $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MMS(${\bf d}$), where $\boldsymbol{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\ldots, \alpha_n)$ is a vector of threshold values $a_i\in [0,1]$, and  ${\bf d}=(d_1,\ldots, d_n)$ is a vector of positive integers. Roughly an allocation is $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MMS(${\bf d}$) if it guarantees to each agent $i$ an $\alpha_i$ approximation of the minimum value she could guarantee if she could partition all the items in $d_i$ parts  (see Definition~\ref{def:alpha-mms} for a formal definition).  This notion is very useful for showing approximate MMS guarantees using inductive arguments, as we demonstrate in the technical part. It effectively captures several previous studied notions, and we believe it is of independent interest. 
For example, $\mathbf{1}$-MMS($\mathbf{d})$ corresponds to ordinal approximations of the maximin share, i.e. the maximum value an agent $i$ can guarantee if she partitions the set of items into $d$ bundles \cite{BudishMMS}. 
Another example is the notion of $(\alpha, \beta)$-MMS introduced by \cite{HosseiniS21}, which guarantees to an $\alpha$ fraction of the agents a $\beta$ approximation of their MMS. This can be captured by our notation $\boldsymbol{\alpha'}$-MMS(${\bf d}$)  where $\boldsymbol{\alpha'}=(\beta, \ldots, \beta, 0,\ldots, 0)$ is a vector where $\alpha n$ of its elements are equal to $\beta$ and the rest are equal to $0$, and for $\mathbf{d} = (n, \dots, n)$. They further showed that the existence of $(\alpha, 1)$-MMS implies the existence of 1-out-of-$k$-MMS for $k \ge \lceil \frac{n}{\alpha} \rceil$. %thus establishing a connection between the $(\alpha, \beta)$ framework and ordinal approximations. 
Perhaps more closely related to our work, is the model of \cite{AkramiGST24} for approximate MMS guarantees with agent priorities, which captures both ordinal and multiplicative approximations as special cases, i.e. the concept of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MMS({\bf d}), (for $\mathbf{d} = (n, \dots, n)$).
