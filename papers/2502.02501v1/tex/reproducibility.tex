\section*{Reproducibility Statement}

In this section, we outline the efforts made to ensure the reproducibility of our work. All essential details necessary for reproducing our dataset, model, evaluation metrics, and results can be found in the main paper and the appendix. The data annotation process, including how we prepared the relation annotations, is detailed in Section~\ref{pipeline} and Appendix~\ref{detailed pipeline}. The model architecture and implementation specifics, including hyperparameters and training configurations, are described thoroughly in Section~\ref{DRGG} and~\ref{implementation} and detailed in Appendix~\ref{appendix_drgg} and~\ref{appendix:implementation} . Lastly, the calculations for the evaluation metrics, including all necessary references to ensure exact reproduction, are documented in Section~\ref{gdsa_eval},~\ref{eval_all} and Appendix~\ref{detail_eval}.
