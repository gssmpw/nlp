\section*{Impact Statement}

\ourmodel addresses the scalability and robustness challenges in multimodal speech processing, enabling more efficient and adaptive expert selection. This advancement highlights the potential for further scaling AVSR models in terms of capacity, training, and datasets while extending to more diverse real-world applications without incurring excessive computational costs.

While our research contributes to the broader field of multimodal learning and robust speech recognition, we do not foresee significant ethical concerns beyond those inherent to AVSR systems, such as potential linguistic biases in speech models trained on imbalanced datasets or privacy issues when handling human speech video data. Responsible data use and fairness in model deployment remain critical in AVSR systems for ensuring equitable applications.
