The latter challenge can be eliminated as a serious concern. For applications where dimension reduction techniques are not implemented, we propose a temporary transformation which accelerates computations with no loss of information. The algorithm can be applied for any statistical procedure depending only on Euclidean distances and can be implemented sequentially to enable analyses of data that would otherwise exceed memory limitations. The method is easily implemented in common statistical software as a standard pre-processing step. The benefit of our algorithm grows with the dimensionality of the problem and the complexity of the analysis. Consequently, our simple algorithm not only decreases the computation time for routine analyses, it opens the door to performing calculations that may have otherwise been too burdensome to attempt.R, Matlab and SAS/IML code for implementing lossless data reduction is freely available in the Appendix.}",

               initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all

               This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4
               and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between
               blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the
               most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking
               demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more
               extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently,
               decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the
               differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps
               safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following
               increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is
               lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of

               heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage,
               initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of
               pluripotency and differentiation.",

abstract = {Although genetic traits are often dominant or recessive, the impact of the same heterozygous genotype can vary quite a bit between individuals. Deng et al. (p. 193), analyzed global gene expression in hundreds of individual mouse cells and found that a substantial fraction of the genes only expressed one of the alleles, chosen randomly, at any given point in time. Such stochasticity in transcription increases the heterogeneity among cells and likely contributes to the phenotypic variance among individuals of identical genotype. Independent allelic transcription generates fluctuations in the single-cell transcriptome. Expression from both alleles is generally observed in analyses of diploid cell populations, but studies addressing allelic expression patterns genome-wide in single cells are lacking. Here, we present global analyses of allelic expression across individual cells of mouse preimplantation embryos of mixed background (CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J). We discovered abundant (12 to 24\%) monoallelic expression of autosomal genes and that expression of the two alleles occurs independently. The monoallelic expression appeared random and dynamic because there was considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells. Similar patterns of monoallelic expression were observed in mature cells. Our allelic expression analysis also demonstrates the de novo inactivation of the paternal X chromosome. We conclude that independent and stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression in the mammalian cell.}}

  abstract  = "The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing
               tissue in adult mammals. We have recently demonstrated the
               presence of about six cycling Lgr5(+) stem cells at the bottoms
               of small-intestinal crypts. Here we describe the establishment
               of long-term culture conditions under which single crypts
               undergo multiple crypt fission events, while simultanously
               generating villus-like epithelial domains in which all
               differentiated cell types are present. Single sorted Lgr5(+)
               stem cells can also initiate these cryptvillus organoids.
               Tracing experiments indicate that the Lgr5(+) stem-cell
               hierarchy is maintained in organoids. We conclude that
               intestinal cryptvillus units are self-organizing structures,
               which can be built from a single stem cell in the absence of a
               non-epithelial cellular niche.",
