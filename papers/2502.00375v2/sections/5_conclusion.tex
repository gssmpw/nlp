\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
This work presents a robust and scalable framework for the detection and classification of AI-generated content across text and image domains. By integrating perceptual hashing, similarity measurement, and pseudo-labeling, our method addresses the critical challenges posed by the rapid evolution of generative AI. Experimental results on the \texttt{Defactify4} dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves competitive performance while maintaining adaptability to new generative models. Importantly, the proposed method provides a flexible solution for continual learning, accommodating the growing diversity of AI-generated content without the need for retraining. This adaptability ensures relevance in real-world applications, where the landscape of generative AI is dynamic and ever-expanding. Future work includes exploring techniques to convert high-dimensional floating-point vectors into compact binary representations while maintaining classification performance.
