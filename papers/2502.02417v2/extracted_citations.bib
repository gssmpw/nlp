BibTeX bibliography string definitions of the ABBREVIATED titles of
IEEE journals and magazines and online publications.

This file is designed for bibliography styles that require 
abbreviated titles and is not for use in bibliographies that
require full-length titles.

USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEabrv,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{IEEE} Trans. Automat. Contr."


IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies -
this file is suitable for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.


For work that requires full-length titles, you should use the full
titles provided in the companion file, IEEEfull.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.
 
 3. Abbreviations follow IEEE's style.

 4. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).

 5. The following NEW/current journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been verified:
    
    STRING{IEEE_J_CBB        = "{IEEE/ACM} Trans. Comput. Biology Bioinformatics"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_CJECE      = "Canadian J. Elect. Comput. Eng."}
    STRING{IEEE_J_DSC        = "{IEEE} Trans. Dependable Secure Comput."}
    STRING{IEEE_O_DSO        = "{IEEE} Distrib. Syst. Online"}
    
 6. The following OLD journal definitions have been disabled because
    their abbreviations have not yet been found/verified:

    STRING{IEEE_J_BCTV       = "{IEEE} Trans. Broadcast Television Receivers"}
    STRING{IEEE_J_EWS        = "{IEEE} Trans. Eng. Writing Speech"}
