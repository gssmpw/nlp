\section*{Limitations}

% Since December 2023, a "Limitations" section has been required for all papers submitted to ACL Rolling Review (ARR). This section should be placed at the end of the paper, before the references. The "Limitations" section (along with, optionally, a section for ethical considerations) may be up to one page and will not count toward the final page limit. Note that these files may be used by venues that do not rely on ARR so it is recommended to verify the requirement of a "Limitations" section and other criteria with the venue in question.

% 和 ethical considerations 一块儿合计最多一页，且不算在最终页数里


% 并行路径的共享前缀可以通过 DEFT 等算法进一步减少数据搬运操作来减少 latency % 可以和其他reasoning方法结合

% 局限于 reasoning 任务，并没有在其他任务上做验证  % t* 的设置比较经验性，可能扩展到其他任务的时候会不适用。

% 我们认为这种方法可以用于online training, 通过提升生成质量来提升policy improvement的效果，但由于设备受限而没有实验证明。

Our DPTS framework focuses on selecting and refining the search paths, but does not involve hardware design. Therefore, it is orthogonal to low-level methods. For example, we can integrate DEFT~\cite{yao2024deft} to reduce the data transportation of the shared prefixes, leading to further acceleration. 
Also, our method is validated only on math reasoning tasks, and has not been tested on other domains, such as coding or scientific problems. However, we believe its generalizable capabilities make it applicable across a wide range of fields. 
Additionally, we envision that this method can also be applied to online training by improving generation quality. We leave these attempts to our future work.
