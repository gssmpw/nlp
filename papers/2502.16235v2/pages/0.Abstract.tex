Tree of Thoughts (ToT) enhances Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. 
It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by fine-grained cache management and alignment. 
Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions and have less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 with Math500 and GSM8K datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4$\times$ on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

% Tree of Thoughts~(ToT) enhances Large Language Model~(LLM) reasoning by structuring problem-solving as a spanning tree. However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooked the computational efficiency. 
% The challenges of accelerating the ToT lies in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration on suboptimal solutions. 
% % its sequential data structure limits the utilization of GPU parallelism. In particular, existing algorithms typically cause redundant exploration and frequent switching issues, which becomes even severer when paralleled. 
% To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search~(DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize reasoning path in inference. 
% % DPTS balances deep exploration and broad expansion through the search algorithm, and the bidirectional transition mechanism allows the tree to focus on high-confidence solutions. 
% % To this end, we design a flexible parallel framework to support arbitrary nodes with various path lengths for  simultaneous expanding. Meanwhile, the searching algorithm and bidirectional transition mechanism allows the trees to focus on high-confidence solutions with less redundant generation tokens.
