\section{Conclusion}

% In this paper, we propose DPTS (Dynamic Parallel Tree Search), which improves the computational efficiency of LLM-based reasoning. At the core of DPTS is the introduction of Parallelism Streamline, which ensures efficient execution despite varying path lengths and node selections. Also, the proposed Dynamic Search and Transition Mechanism prevents redundant rollouts and maintains the focus on more promising solutions. Experiments demonstrate that DPTS achieves the best reasoning accuracy with $2\times$ acceleration and fewer redundant expansions.

In this paper, we propose DPTS (Dynamic Parallel Tree Search) that effectively enhances the computational efficiency of LLM reasoning. DPTS introduces Parallelism Streamline, allowing efficient inference with arbitrary path lengths and nodes. The Dynamic Search and Transition Mechanism mitigates redundant rollouts and focuses on promising solutions. Experiments show that DPTS achieves the highest reasoning accuracy while delivering 2-4$\times$ speedup.
