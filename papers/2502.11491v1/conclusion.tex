In this paper, we simulate the cognitive paradigm that humans use to solve complex problems and propose the Ontology-Guided Reverse thinking method for knowledge graph question answering. We use LLMs to understand the intent of the question and generate the corresponding labels. By leveraging the knowledge graph ontology, we use Reverse-Thinking Reasoning to form label reasoning paths, followed by guided knowledge graph queries and answer aggregation. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the accuracy and answer coverage.
