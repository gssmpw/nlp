For this work, we want to address two areas for improvement in the future. First, when querying the knowledge graph along reasoning paths, there may be a large number of entities satisfying the label constraints, which could lead to irrelevant results. Second, when generating the final answer, inputting all entity paths into the LLMs may introduce irrelevant paths, potentially lowering the accuracy of the answer.
