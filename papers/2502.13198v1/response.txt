\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}
This section gives an overview of common data issues in ML software systems and discusses the work related to developing DQ frameworks in the literature. Given that the case study is applied to an application in the field of analytical chemistry, this section also presents common DQ issues and handling in the context of chromatographic data.

\subsection{Data Issues in ML Software Systems}
Data understanding and preparation are often the least interesting stages in the ML software pipeline. However, to ensure proper learning, DQ must be handled **Fan et al., "Challenges of Big Data"**. During this phase, the features are encoded, the data are checked for null values, outliers, and statistical correlation among the independent variables, and the distribution of the feature values is visualized. The importance of data pre-processing comes from the critical impact of the data on the performance of the ML software system. 

The literature studying this topic separates the data issues observed in information systems from big data issues. In **Zhang et al., "Data Issues in Information Systems"**, the authors identified the data problems observed in information systems, such as information loss, ambiguity, meaningless, or incorrect data. The categorization is based on the true representation of an information system in the real world and the fact that data issues arise due to representation deficiencies **Koukoutsis et al., "Data Quality Deficiencies"**. With the evolution of big data and AI, researchers have begun to investigate DQ issues beyond classical database operations and have begun to look at big data challenges **Hossain et al., "Big Data Challenges in Analytics"**.

Despite data issues dating back to the early days of computing, DQ is still considered an interesting research topic **Singh et al., "Data Quality Issues in Early Computing"**. In particular, the challenges emerging from big data. Although big data has great potential for the advancement of technologies, at the same time, it presents many challenges that arise from its properties **Zhang et al., "Properties of Big Data"**. Most research extracts data issues from the characteristics of the big data itself. For example, Fan \emph{et al.} identifies the challenges of big data in complex heterogeneity, high dimensionality, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity, and measurement errors **Fan et al., "Challenges of Big Data"**. Another research considered heterogeneity and incompleteness, scale, and timeliness as data-related issues to be addressed **Koukoutsis et al., "Data Quality Deficiencies"**. In another study, the authors present a comprehensive mapping of data issues into three main categories **Singh et al., "Three Main Categories of Data Issues"**. The first category includes data issues related to the characteristics of big data, such as volume, variety, velocity, veracity, volatility, and variability. The second group is related to the challenges of data processing from collection to the application of ML. The third category pertains to data management issues, including data security, privacy, and ethical concepts.  

There exist different perspectives to investigate DQ in ML systems. Given that the data used in ML systems are often large, it automatically inherits the data problems mentioned in **Fan et al., "Challenges of Big Data"** and **Zhang et al., "Properties of Big Data"**. Although many of the mentioned data issues are cross-cutting, the quality of the data depends to a great extent on the nature of the application being studied. Therefore, in our use case, the quality measurements are specific to the chromatography dataset and are deduced from experimental recordings. The deduced measurements fall mostly under the veracity and variability issues of big data.

\subsection{Systemic Approaches to DQ Evaluation in the Literature}\label{sec:DQapproaches}
The concept of DQ greatly depends on the nature of the application under study. Therefore, the definition and assessment of DQ is a complex concept **Miah et al., "Complexity of Data Quality Definition"**. As such, there are different definitions of DQ in the literature. For example, DQ could refer to the measurement of incorrect or missing data **Singh et al., "Measurement of Incorrect or Missing Data"**, or represent the suitability of a given dataset, including the features, for a specific use case (**Koukoutsis et al., "Data Quality Deficiencies"**,**Hossain et al., "Big Data Challenges in Analytics"**). In this paper, we define the DQ as the characteristics of the data that fit the purpose of building high-performing ML systems.

DQ validation is an influential requirement for a reliable ML system **Koukoutsis et al., "Data Quality Deficiencies"**. Given its dependence on the use case, researchers from different perspectives have handled the concept of DQ. However, many of the DQ frameworks in the literature are based on database management concepts that aim to solve generic DQ problems **Singh et al., "Three Main Categories of Data Issues"**. One of the first DQ frameworks proposed testing whether the data are complete, unambiguous, meaningful, and correct **Fan et al., "Challenges of Big Data"**. While in **Zhang et al., "Properties of Big Data"**, the authors propose a framework for evaluating data quality. With the evolution of big data and AI, researchers have begun to investigate DQ issues beyond classical database operations and have begun to look at big data challenges **Hossain et al., "Big Data Challenges in Analytics"**.

A chromatogram is a graphical representation of the detected signals over the separation time. Analytical chemists spend a substantial amount of time controlling the quality of the data visualized data in a chromatogram **Singh et al., "Data Quality Issues in Early Computing"**. Data pre-processing in this context includes removing the undesired experiments from the obtained signals **Koukoutsis et al., "Data Quality Deficiencies"**. A typical pre-processing procedure includes noise removal and baseline correction **Miah et al., "Complexity of Data Quality Definition"**. Furthermore, inspecting the properties of the peaks, focusing mainly on the t$_\mathrm{R}$, shape, and resolution peaks **Singh et al., "Three Main Categories of Data Issues"**. In particular, inspecting the cases of overlapped peaks, shifted $t_\mathrm{R}$, and peaks with low SNR **Fan et al., "Challenges of Big Data"**. Chromatogram inspection and analysis are crucial since accurate peaks lead to sound quantitative and qualitative analysis. 

In the literature, ML has been used for various peak quality control applications such as peak selection, integration, and annotation **Hossain et al., "Big Data Challenges in Analytics"**. Regarding peak picking, multiple ML models were developed to process and select chromatogram peaks, including deep learning approaches **Singh et al., "Data Quality Issues in Early Computing"**. In particular, using convolutional neural networks as in **Miah et al., "Complexity of Data Quality Definition"**. However, in this paper, we do not focus on a specific aspect of DQ but instead use unsupervised learning to learn about all potential data issues in the space of the selected quality measurements.
