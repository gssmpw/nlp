\section{\cite{HaitnerMST22}'s Protocol Cannot Imply $\OT$}\label{appendix:HaitnerMST22}

In this section, we show that for some carefully chosen $\CDP$ and accurate protocol $\Pi$, the joint view of the parties in \cite{HaitnerMST22}'s protocol (\cref{protocol:HaitnerMST22}) can be \emph{simulated} using a trivial protocol, without using $\Pi$ at all.

\begin{protocol}[\cite{HaitnerMST22}'s protocol]\label{protocol:HaitnerMST22}
    \item Oracle: An accurate $\CDP$ protocol $\Pi$ for the inner-product.
    \item Operation:~
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Ac$ and $\Bc$ choose random inputs $x\in \set{-1,1}^n$ and $y\in \set{-1,1}^n$, respectively.
        \item The parties interact using $\Pi$ to get approximation $z$ of $\langle x,y \rangle$.
        \item $\Ac$ chooses a random string $r \gets \zn$, and sends $r, x_r=\set{x_i \colon r_i=1}$ to $\Bc$. $\Bc$ replies with $y_{- r}=\set{x_i \colon r_i=0}$.
        \item Finally, $\Ac$ computes and outputs $\out_\Ac=\langle x_{-r},y_{-r} \rangle$, and $\Bc$ outputs $\out_\Bc=z-\langle x_{r},y_{r} \rangle$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{protocol}

To see this, assume that $\Pi$ is a protocol that on inputs $x$ and $y$, outputs $z=\langle x,y \rangle+e_\Ac+e_\Bc$, where $e_\Ac$ and $e_\Bc$ are independent samples from the $\Lap(2/\eps)$ distribution. Moreover, assume that $\Pi$ reveals $e_\Ac$ to $\Ac$ and $e_\Bc$ to $\Bc$ (and nothing else).  Such a protocol is indeed differential private, and it can be implemented using secure multi-party computation. Moreover, as we show in this work, such a protocol can be used to construct OT. However, when composed with the $\KA$ protocol of \cite{HaitnerMST22}, the resulting protocol can be simulated trivially.\footnote{More formally, and using the definition given in \cref{sec:protocol}, we claim that the channel induced by executing \cref{protocol:HaitnerMST22} with oracle access to the channel $$\Pi=\set{((x,(\langle x,y \rangle + e_A+e_B,e_A)),(y,(\langle x,y \rangle + e_A+e_B,e_B)))}_{x,y\gets \oo^n, e_A,e_B\gets \Lap(2/\epsilon)}$$ is a trivial channel.} 

Indeed, note that the view of $\Ac$ in $\Pi$ only contains $x,z$ and  $e_A$, while the view of $\Bc$ only contains $y,z$ and $e_B$. In this case, the view of $\Ac$ in the $\KA$ protocol of \cite{HaitnerMST22} contains $x,z, e_A, r$ and $y_{-r}$, while the view of $\Bc$ contains $y,z, e_B, r$ and $y_{r}$.
We next explain how to simulate this view without using $\Pi$. Consider the following protocol $\Pi'$ that  simulates the $\KA$ protocol in a reverse order:

\begin{protocol}[The simulation $\Pi'$]\label{protocol:trivial}
    \item Operation:~
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Ac$ and $\Bc$ choose random inputs $x\in \set{-1,1}^n$ and $y\in \set{-1,1}^n$, respectively.
               \item $\Ac$ chooses a random string $r \gets \zn$, and sends $r, x_r=\set{x_i \colon r_i=1}$ to $\Bc$. $\Bc$ replies with $y_{- r}=\set{x_i \colon r_i=0}$.
               \item $\Ac$ samples $e_A\gets \Lap(2/\eps)$ and sends $z_A=\langle x_{r},y_r\rangle + e_A$  to $\Bc$. $\Bc$ samples $e_B\gets \Lap(2/\eps)$ and sends $z_B=\langle x_{-r},y_{-r}\rangle + e_B$  to $\Ac$.
        \item The output of the protocol is $z=z_A+z_B$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{protocol}
Clearly, \cref{protocol:trivial} is a trivial protocol and does not use any cryptographic assumptions. However, the views of $\Ac$ and $\Bc$ in $\Pi'$ contain all the information learned by the parties in the $\KA$ protocol ($(x,z,e_A,r,y_{-r})$ and $(y,z,e_B,r,x_{r})$ respectively). Moreover, we claim that the parties in $\Pi'$ do not learn any information that the parties in the $\KA$ protocol did not learn. Indeed, the only new value learned by $\Bc$, $z_A,$ can be also computed by $\Bc$ in the $\KA$ protocol by computing $z-e_B-\langle x_r,y_r \rangle$. Similarly, $z_B$ can be already computed by $\Ac$. 

We note that every protocol that uses only a communication channel cannot be used to construct $\OT$ unless $\OT$ already exists, and similarly, every protocol that uses  $\Pi'$ as a subroutine (in a black-box manner) cannot be used to construct $\OT$. Since \cref{protocol:HaitnerMST22} (that is, the views and outputs of the parties when running \cref{protocol:HaitnerMST22}) are the same as $\Pi'$, we conclude that \cref{protocol:HaitnerMST22} could not be used to construct $\OT$ in a black-box manner.
