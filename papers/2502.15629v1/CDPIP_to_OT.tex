% \section{From CDP-IP to OT}\label{sec:CDPIP_to_OT}

% In this section we state and prove our results for the computational case: \CDP (computational differential private) protocols that estimate the inner product well. For such protocols, we prove the following result.


% \begin{theorem}\label{thm:DPIP-to-OT}
% There exist constant $c_1,c_2 > 0$ and an oracle-aided \ppt protocol $\Pi$ such that the following holds for large enough $n \in \bbN$ and for 
% $\eps \leq \log^{0.9} n$, $\delta \leq \frac1{3n}$, and $\ell = e^{-c_1  \eps}  c_2\cdot n^{1/8}$:
%     Let $\Lambda$ be an $(\eps,\delta)$-DP protocol that is $(\ell,0.999)$-accurate for the inner-product functionality. 
%     Then $\Pi^\Lambda$ is a computational oblivious transfer protocol.
% \end{theorem}









% \begin{lemma}[Main lemma, Â the computational case]\label{lem:KAProtocol:Comp}
% 	There exists a constant $c>0$ such that the following holds: Let $C = \set{C_\kappa}_{\kappa\in \N}$ be an $n$-size, $\eps$-\CDP channel ensemble, that is $(,)$-accurate for the inner-product functionality, and let $\Pi$ be according to \ref{??}. Then $???$ is an Oblivious transfer protocol. 
% \end{lemma}
