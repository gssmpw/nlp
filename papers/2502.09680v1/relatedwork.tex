% An Investigation into Pre-Training Object-Centric Representations  for Reinforcement Learning -- Our results provide empirical evidence for valuable insights into the effectiveness of OCR pre-training for RL and the potential limitations of its use in certain scenarios. Additionally, this study also examines the critical aspects of incorporating OCR pre-training in RL, including performance in a visually complex environment and the appropriate pooling layer to aggregate the object representations.

% Object-centric Video Representation for Long-term Action Anticipation: This study focuses on building object-centric representations for long-term action anticipation in videos. It proposes an approach to extract task-specific object-centric representations from general-purpose pretrained models without finetuning, highlighting the importance of objects in recognizing and predicting human-object interactions.
