\section{Related Work}
\paragraph{Learning from Feedback.}

Other than the heuristic binary feedback studied in this work, prior research has explored feedback from various sources, such as humans____, other models____, tools____, and knowledge bases____. This paper focuses on demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and other feedback types are beyond the scope of this paper.

\paragraph{Test-Time Training.}

Test-Time Training (TTT) has shown success in the image modality by addressing distribution shifts and enhancing model capacity through self-supervised fine-tuning on each test case____. Recent studies have extended TTT to the text modality____. The most relevant work, by____, uses TTT to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, their method relies heavily on human scaffolding for self-supervision and does not generalize beyond ARC-AGI____. In contrast, FTTT is generally applicable.

\paragraph{Learning to Optimize.}

Learning to Optimize (L2O) trains a network to act as an optimizer for another network____. Early approaches used reinforcement learning to train such optimizers____, while recent work focuses on discovering analytical white-box optimizers____. The most relevant work, MEND____, trains a network to predict weight updates from training gradients. \method{} builds on this idea, extending it to learn from test-time feedback with a distinct architecture.
