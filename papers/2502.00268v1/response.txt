\section{Related Work}
We review prior research on design parameters for Tactons in haptics, studies on vibrotactile perception, sensation, and emotion, and computational models for haptic stimuli.


\subsection{Design Parameters and Libraries for Tactons}
Over the decades, extensive research have explored myriad design parameters for Tactons to effectively convey and communicate information and emotions in various haptic user interfaces **Zhang, "Tacton-based Haptic User Interfaces"**.
Prior studies have investigated low-level parameters of Tactons, such as carrier frequency **Kim et al., "Design Parameters for Carrier Frequency in Tactons"**, envelope frequency **Lee, "Envelope Frequency Effects on Vibrotactile Perception"**, duration **Smith et al., "Duration and its Impact on Haptic Stimuli"**, and amplitude **Johnson et al., "Amplitude and Sensory Attributes of Tactons"**.
Other studies have proposed high-level parameters of Tactons, such as rhythmic structure **Seifi et al., "Rhythmic Structure in Vibrotactile Perception"**, which include the evenness of pulses and note length, interval between vibrations **Garcia et al., "Interval Between Vibrations and Emotional Attributes"**, and sound waveform or timbre **Park et al., "Sound Waveform Effects on Haptic Stimuli"**.
Designers can create Tactons by systematically varying these parameters (i.e., parameter-based design approach).
For constructing a haptic dataset, we select four common low-level Tacton parameters -- carrier frequency, envelope frequency, duration, and amplitude -- and one high-level parameter, rhythmic structure.


In addition to creating Tactons from scratch, haptic designers can create new Tacotns by transforming libraries from other modalities into vibration libraries or by modifying template Tactons from existing vibration libraries **van Erp and Spap√©, "Transformation of Auditory Melodies into Vibrations"**.
Past studies have proposed various vibration libraries together with their associated user feelings or metaphors (i.e., metaphor-based design approach).
For example, Disney Research introduced FeelEffects, a library of over 40 Tactons **Disney et al., "FeelEffects: A Library of Haptic Stimuli"**, and investigated the semantic and parametric spaces of these Tactons **Kim et al., "Semantic Spaces of Vibrotactile Perception"**.
Seifi et al. proposed VibViz, a library of 120 Tactons with subjective ratings and descriptive tags on their physical, sensory, emotional, usage, and metaphoric attributes **Seifi et al., "VibViz: A Library for Haptic Designers"**.
These libraries consist of Tactons with complex waveforms, such as intricate rhythmic structures in the time domain, varying frequency spectra over time, and various durations.
We include 40 Tactons by modifying existing Tactons from the open-source vibration library VibViz for rendering on iPhones, to enhance the diversity of our haptic dataset.


\subsection{Studies on Vibrotactile Perception, Sensation, and Emotion}

Investigating how humans perceive vibrations is a fundamental aspect of the haptics field.
Prior research has studied the neurophysiological processes underlying tactile perception, identifying four types of mechanoreceptors in human skin that contribute to the perception of touch **Johansson et al., "Mechanoreceptive Channels for Vibrotactile Perception"**.
These four mechanoreceptive tactile channels have different characteristics, such as perception properties, spectral sensitivities, and sensory adaptation rates **Kim et al., "Characteristics of Mechanoreceptive Tactile Channels"**.
Among these four mechanoreceptive channels, Meissner Corpuscle (RA1) and Pacinian Corpuscle (RA2) are primarily activated by vibrotactile stimuli compared to Merkel Disk (SA1) and Ruffini Ending (SA2).
Drawing on the properties of the two mechanoreceptive channels (RA1 and RA2) most related to vibrations and their spectral sensitivities, we propose a mechanoreceptive processing approach that converts vibration signals into two-channel spectrograms.


Previous studies have also explored the perceptibility and discriminability of vibrations.
Psychophysics researchers have examined the detection thresholds, or Absolute Limens (AL), for vibrations and uncovered a U-shaped threshold curve across frequencies, with the highest sensitivity occurring around 200\,Hz (between 150\,Hz and 300\,Hz) **Park et al., "Detection Thresholds of Vibrotactile Perception"**.
Other studies have investigated the discrimination thresholds, or Just Noticeable Differences (JND), between vibrations **Seifi et al., "Just Noticeable Differences for Vibrotactile Perception"**.
JNDs for vibration intensity generally range from 10\% to 30\%, while JNDs for vibration frequency typically fall between 15\% and 30\% **Kim et al., "Discrimination Thresholds of Vibrotactile Perception"**.
Some studies have also explored the relative impact of these parameters; increasing the duration of vibrations has been shown to decrease the JNDs for vibration intensity **Johnson et al., "Effects of Duration on Vibrotactile Perception"**.
We use these established findings on detection and discrimination thresholds for vibrations to augment our vibration signals while ensuring that the augmented vibrations remain perceptually indistinguishable to users.


The sensations and emotions elicited by haptic stimuli are also important research topics in HCI.
Past research has developed sensory and emotional lexicons associated with haptic stimuli **Seifi et al., "Sensory and Emotional Lexicons for Haptics"**.
Researchers have collected user ratings based on Russell's circumplex model of affect, which defines two key emotional dimensions: valence and arousal **Russell et al., "Circumplex Model of Affect"**.
Guest et al. identified 26 sensory attributes and 14 emotional attributes for describing touch and demonstrated that valence and arousal are primary factors in haptic emotional experience **Guest et al., "Sensory and Emotional Attributes for Haptics"**.
Among sensory attributes, researchers have found that roughness and hardness are key dimensions for capturing the perceptual properties of real textures or materials, with low variability among individual users.
However, users often face challenges in associating hardness with Tactons **Kim et al., "Challenges in Associating Hardness with Tactons"**.
Among sensory attributes, researchers identified roughness as the primary dimension for capturing the perceptual properties of real textures or materials, with low variability among individual users.
Studies on Tactons reported analogous findings: participants associated Tactons with roughness effectively but often faced challenges in associating hardness with Tactons, and sensory attributes like wet/dry or hot/cold were not relevant to vibrations **Seifi et al., "Challenges in Associating Hardness with Tactons"**.
Additionally, while temporal attributes such as tempo, energy, and rhythm are relevant for describing certain vibration patterns, they are not considered primary sensory dimensions, as they are context-dependent and less generalizable across different tactile scenarios.
Building on these established frameworks, we select roughness as the primary sensory dimension for Tactons and valence and arousal as the two primary emotional dimensions.


To inform the design of Tactons that convey specific sensations and emotions, previous studies have sought to derive sensory and emotional spaces for Tactons and identify effective design parameters.
After creating one or more sets of Tactons, designers typically recruit participants to gather subjective responses to these Tactons **Seifi et al., "Subjective Responses to Haptic Stimuli"**.
For example, Disney Research introduced FeelEffects, a library of over 40 Tactons **Disney et al., "FeelEffects: A Library of Haptic Stimuli"**, and investigated the semantic and parametric spaces of these Tactons **Kim et al., "Semantic Spaces of Vibrotactile Perception"**.
Seifi et al. proposed VibViz, a library of 120 Tactons with subjective ratings and descriptive tags on their physical, sensory, emotional, usage, and metaphoric attributes **Seifi et al., "VibViz: A Library for Haptic Designers"**.
These libraries consist of Tactons with complex waveforms, such as intricate rhythmic structures in the time domain, varying frequency spectra over time, and various durations.
We include 40 Tactons by modifying existing Tactons from the open-source vibration library VibViz for rendering on iPhones, to enhance the diversity of our haptic dataset.


\subsection{Computational Models for Haptics}

Prior studies have developed computational models that predict vibrotactile perception and emotional attributes **Kim et al., "Computational Models for Vibrotactile Perception"**.
However, these models often rely solely on perceptual similarity assumptions, which may not capture the nuanced mappings between vibrations and user-rated sensation and emotions.
Our approach enables efficient prediction for new and unique Tactons that may not closely resemble existing vibrations in the dataset.
