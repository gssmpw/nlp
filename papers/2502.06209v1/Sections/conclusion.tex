\section{Conclusion}
We have introduced candidate set query, an active learning framework that efficiently reduces the labeling cost by narrowing down the candidate set likely to include the ground-truth class.
We also have proposed a novel acquisition function that balances model performance and labeling cost by taking expected candidate set sizes into account.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet64x64 confirm the effectiveness of our framework.

\noindent\textbf{Limitations and future work.}
One limitation is that the proposed acquisition function lacks theoretical guarantee for label complexity~\citep{dasgupta2011two, hanneke2014theory} at this point.
Establishing a theoretical understanding to quantify the cost required to achieve a target performance remains an interesting direction for future work.
