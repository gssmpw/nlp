\section{Conclusion}

% SR-LLM represents a significant advancement in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through structured representations. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse NLP tasks demonstrated the potential of SR in generating novel implicit information. The systematic investigation into SR's role in LLMs' cognitive processes, spanning from prompt engineering to fine-tuning, has provided valuable insights into the integration of structured information. We have established a robust framework for incorporating SR into LLMs for downstream tasks, paving the way for future research and applications. Moreover, the proposal and validation of synthetic structured datasets have shown exceptional performance in augmenting LLM capabilities. These achievements have led to substantial improvements in both Training-Free and Training-Dependent settings, underscoring the effectiveness of integrating semantic, syntactic, and logical features into LLMs. As we continue to refine SR-LLM, we anticipate further progress towards more interpretable, accurate, and versatile language models capable of enhanced reasoning across a wide spectrum of NLP applications.
