\section{Background}
The structure representations of AMR, PST, and FOL each have their unique advantages and applications in semantic abstraction, syntactic parsing, and logical reasoning, respectively. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs) are rooted, labeled graph structures designed to abstract away from syntactic nuances, providing concise and semantically rich representations ~\citep{banarescu2013abstract}. Phrase Syntax Trees (PSTs) are hierarchical tree structures grounded in Chomskyâ€™s theory of generative grammar, commonly used to represent the syntactic organization of sentences, emphasizing the dependency between words~\citep{chomsky2014aspects}. First-Order Logics (FOLs) are symbolic logic systems that articulate objects, their relationships, and properties, making them essential tools in formal logic and logical reasoning~\citep{enderton2001mathematical, BARWISE19775}.
