\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a set of provocations for considering the uses, impact, and harms of generative AI from the perspective of humanities researchers. We provide a working definition of humanities research, summarize some of its most salient theories and methods, and apply these theories and methods to the current landscape of AI. Drawing from foundational work in critical data studies, along with relevant humanities scholarship, we elaborate eight claims with broad applicability to current conversations about generative AI: 1) Models make words, but people make meaning; 2) Generative AI requires an expanded definition of culture; 3) Generative AI can never be representative; 4) Bigger models are not always better models; 5) Not all training data is equivalent; 6) Openness is not an easy fix; 7) Limited access to compute enables corporate capture; and 8) AI universalism creates narrow human subjects. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of resisting the extraction of humanities research by computer science and related fields.

\section{Provocations from the Humanities for AI Research}

In the sections that follow, we employ boyd and Crawford’s framework of ``provocations'' for big data \citeyear{boyd_Crawford_2012} to develop a new set of provocations that encompass the expanded research landscape of generative AI. Ours are intended to establish a stronger foundation for future AI research and cross-disciplinary collaboration, to allow for the development of more informed research questions, and to prevent non-experts from making thin claims about the full breadth of human culture, past and present. We list the full set of provocations in Table \ref{table:provocations-list}.

%\section{Appendix: Research Ethics and Social Impact}
%\subsection{Ethical Considerations Statement}

%This paper is primarily a literature review and theory contribution, thus we did not engage in any human subjects research, systems development, or deployment. Our work has been guided by considerations for citational justice, and we have specifically sought to cite the work of scholars from marginalized backgrounds, especially BIWOC and queer people of color.

%\subsection{Researcher Positionality Statement}

%We are a three-person writing team that brings domain expertise in the humanities (including historical, literary, and media studies scholarship), digital humanities (including NLP/ML/AI), communication and rhetoric, software development, data science, and data visualization. As a multi-gender and multiracial project team, we share an interest in and commitment to gender and racial justice. This commitment draws us to the politically-engaged humanities scholarship that we seek to engage and amplify in this paper. WIth that said, there are many experiences of intersectional oppression that we do not have – we are all settler scholars, cisgender, (mostly) heterosexual, and (mostly) non-disabled. For these reasons, we have tried to include and learn from scholars who write from these intersections. 

%\subsection{Adverse Impact Statement}

%With this work, we seek to spark conversations across technical and humanities fields about the uses and limits of AI. We write in the spirit of true interdisciplinary collaboration and exchange, and we hope this work serves as an invitation to scholars across varied fields to join together on the basis of mutual respect, working towards a goal of building AI systems that enhance our collective knowledge of human experiences and cultures when appropriate, while resisting the extractive and outright harmful AI systems that have been provided to us.
