  abstract = "It is critical, but difficult, to catch the small variation in
              genomic or other kinds of data that differentiates phenotypes or
              categories. A plethora of data is available, but the information
              from its genes or elements is spread over arbitrarily, making it
              challenging to extract relevant details for identification.
              However, an arrangement of similar genes into clusters makes
              these differences more accessible and allows for robust
              identification of hidden mechanisms (e.g. pathways) than dealing
              with elements individually. Here we propose, DeepInsight, which
              converts non-image samples into a well-organized image-form.
              Thereby, the power of convolution neural network (CNN), including
              GPU utilization, can be realized for non-image samples.
              Furthermore, DeepInsight enables feature extraction through the
              application of CNN for non-image samples to seize imperative
              information and shown promising results. To our knowledge, this
              is the first work to apply CNN simultaneously on different kinds
              of non-image datasets: RNA-seq, vowels, text, and artificial.",
