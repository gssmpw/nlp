By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

              genomic or other kinds of data that differentiates phenotypes or
              categories. A plethora of data is available, but the information
              from its genes or elements is spread over arbitrarily, making it
              challenging to extract relevant details for identification.
              However, an arrangement of similar genes into clusters makes
              these differences more accessible and allows for robust
              identification of hidden mechanisms (e.g. pathways) than dealing
              with elements individually. Here we propose, DeepInsight, which
              converts non-image samples into a well-organized image-form.
              Thereby, the power of convolution neural network (CNN), including
              GPU utilization, can be realized for non-image samples.
              Furthermore, DeepInsight enables feature extraction through the
              application of CNN for non-image samples to seize imperative
              information and shown promising results. To our knowledge, this
              is the first work to apply CNN simultaneously on different kinds
              of non-image datasets: RNA-seq, vowels, text, and artificial.",

abstract = {Due to the unsupervised nature of anomaly detection, the key to fueling deep models is finding supervisory signals. Different from current reconstruction-guided generative models and transformation-based contrastive models, we devise novel data-driven supervision for tabular data by introducing a characteristic – scale – as data labels. By representing varied sub-vectors of data instances, we define scale as the relationship between the dimensionality of original subvectors and that of representations. Scales serve as labels attached to transformed representations, thus offering ample labeled data for neural network training. This paper further proposes a scale learningbased anomaly detection method. Supervised by the learning objective of scale distribution alignment, our approach learns the ranking of representations converted from varied subspaces of each data instance. Through this proxy task, our approach models inherent regularities and patterns within data, which well describes data "normality". Abnormal degrees of testing instances are obtained by measuring whether they fit these learned patterns. Extensive experiments show that our approach leads to significant improvement over state-of-the-art generative/contrastive anomaly detection methods.},

Those approaches which do exist involve networks trained to perform a task other than anomaly detection, namely generative models or compression, which are in turn adapted for use in anomaly detection; they are not trained on an anomaly detection based objective. In this paper we introduce a new anomaly detection method—Deep Support Vector Data Description—, which is trained on an anomaly detection based objective. The adaptation to the deep regime necessitates that our neural network and training procedure satisfy certain properties, which we demonstrate theoretically. We show the effectiveness of our method on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image benchmark datasets as well as on the detection of adversarial examples of GTSRB stop signs.}
