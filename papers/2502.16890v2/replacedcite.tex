\textbf{Advancement in Recent Deep Learning-based Time Series Forecasting \quad} Recent advancements in deep learning-based time series forecasting can be broadly categorized into three key areas: (1) the application of sequential models to time series data, (2) the tokenization of time series, and (3) the exploration of intrinsic patterns within time series. 
%
Efforts in the first area have focused on deploying various architectures for time series forecasting, including Transformer____, Mamba____, MLPs____, RNNs____, Graph Neural Networks____, TCNs____, and even Large Language Models (LLMs)____.
%
The second direction has witnessed groundbreaking developments, particularly in Patch Embedding____ and Variate Embedding____.
%
The final area explores modeling complex relationships, including the inter-series dependencies____, the dynamic evolution within a sequence____, or both____. 

\textbf{Time Series Modeling with Frequency \quad} Frequency as a key feature of time series data, has inspired numerous works____.
%
FITS____ employs a simple frequency-domain linear, getting results comparable to SOTA models with 10K parameters.
%
Autoformer____ introduces the auto-correlation mechanism, leveraging FFT to improve self-attention. FEDformer____ further calculates attention weights from the spectrum of queries and keys. FiLM____ applies Fourier analysis to preserve historical information while filtering out noise. FreTS____ incorporates frequency-domain MLP to model both channel and temporal dependencies. TimesNet____ utilizes FFT to extract periodic patterns. FilterNet____ proposes a filter-based method from the perspective of signal processing. 

However, they do not address the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap and shared Key-Frequency modeling. In contrast, our method employs `Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer' to improve mid-frequency feature extraction and introduces `Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block' with `Key-Frequency Enhanced Training' strategy to capture shared Key-Frequency across channels.
