\section{Conclusion}
This work addresses two critical challenges in multivariate time series forecasting: the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap and the efficient modeling of the shared Key-Frequency. We propose the `Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer', which effectively enhances mid-frequency extraction, and the `Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block' with the `Key-Frequency Enhanced Training' strategy, which efficiently captures shared frequency patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving up to 6\% MSE reduction on challenging benchmarks, thus advancing the SOTA in frequency-domain forecasting.
