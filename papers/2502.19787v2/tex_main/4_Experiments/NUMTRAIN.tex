    Transformer and Mamba trained on ICL-HCG tasks generalize to new hypothesis classes with only $4$ to $16$ training hypothesis classes.

%\zq{which model is more efficiently trainable using meta ICL....}
We evaluate how the number of training hypothesis classes affects ID and OOD hypothesis class generalization abilities.
\begin{highlight}
    \paragraph{Finding 3:} 
    \emph{Mamba is more sample efficient than Transformer on ICL-HCG tasks, and achieves near perfect generalization with only several pretraining hypothesis classes.}
\end{highlight}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:num_train_I_1x1}, we evaluate Mamba, Transformer, GRU, and LSTM. 
With only \(2^2\) and \(2^4\) training hypothesis classes, Mamba and Transformer 
achieve near-perfect (1.00 accuracy) ID hypothesis class generalization, while LSTM and GRU fail 
to fit the ICL-HCG tasks.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:num_train_O_1x1}, Mamba nearly achieves 
perfect OOD hypothesis class generalization with as few as \(2^2\) training classes, 
whereas Transformer's accuracy improves gradually with more training classes.
