\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced a novel instruction-based ICL framework that explicitly integrates a hypothesis class as the instruction, namely ICL-HCG.
Through a series of diverse experiments, we demonstrated that Transformers trained on ICL-HCG tasks can generalize to new hypothesis classes and new hypotheses, even when trained on only a few hypothesis classes.
Moreover, we show that the incorporation of such instructions significantly enhances the accuracy of ICL, thereby bridging the gap between synthetic ICL studies and real-world applications.
We also examined the effect of hypothesis diversity within this framework and found that increased hypothesis diversity substantially improves ICL accuracy especially when instructions are provided.
Our framework serves as a platform for diverse explorations, offering new insights and serving as a playground for research on ICL and LLMs.

We conclude our paper by acknowledging the limitations of our current framework: (i) Our study is confined to finite hypothesis binary classification problems, which can be extended to more complex scenarios;
(ii) The hypothesis prefix is assumed to provide an explicit hypothesis class, differing from the more implicit instructions used in real-world LLM applications.
