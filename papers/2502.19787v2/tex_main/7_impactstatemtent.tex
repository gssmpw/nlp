\section{Impact Statements}
By explicitly including instructions alongside training examples, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of in-context learning (ICL) and serves as a testbed for future theoretical and empirical research.
The primary goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning by demonstrating how models can leverage task descriptions to enhance generalization and reduce reliance on large labeled datasets.
In doing so, the findings may promote better insights into Large Language Models (LLMs) and inspire the development of more efficient, adaptable AI systems.
