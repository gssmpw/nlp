    \caption{A summary of SB problem setups and existing (D-)IMF-related results. The table lists theoretical statements characterizing the SB solution (\textit{as the unique both Markovian and reciprocal process between two given distributions}) which allows to apply the IMF (D-IMF) procedure to provably get the SB solution $q^{*}$, see [6]. The table also lists related computational algorithms.}
    \label{tab:sb_setups}
\end{table*}

In practice, the most commonly considered case of dynamic SB is when $q^{\text{ref}}\in\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X}^{N+2})\subset \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X}^{N+2})$, i.e., $q^{\text{ref}}$ is a \textit{Markovian process}. In this case, the solution $q^{*}$ to SB is also known to be a Markovian process. This feature motivated the researchers to develop the \textit{Iterative Markovian Fitting} (IMF) procedure for solving SB based on Markovian and reciprocal projections of stochastic processes.

Originally, the procedure [7] was considered the continuous time $(N=\infty)$, but recently it has been extended to the finite amount of time moments $N<\infty$. We recall their definitions of the projections for finite $N$. In this case, the procedure is called the \textbf{D-IMF} (discrete-time IMF).

\paragraph{Reciprocal projection.} Consider a process $q\!\in\! \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X}^{N+2})$. Then the reciprocal projection $\text{proj}_{\mathcal{R}^{\text{ref}}}(q)$ with respect to the reference process $q^{\text{ref}}$ is a process given by:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:recip_proj}
    \left[proj_{\mathcal{R}^{\text{ref}}}(q)\right](x_0, x_{\text{in}}, x_1) = q^{\text{ref}}(x_{\text{in}}| x_0, x_1)q(x_0, x_1)
    \nonumber.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Markovian projection.} Consider a process ${q\!\in \!\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X}^{N+2})}$. Then the Markovian projection $\text{proj}_{\mathcal{M}}(q)$ is given by:
\begin{multline}
    \left[proj_{\mathcal{M}}(q)\right](x_0, x_{\text{in}}, x_1) = \\ = \underbrace{q(x_0)\prod_{n=1}^{N+1}q(x_{t_{n}}|x_{t_{n-1}})}_{\text{forward representation}} = \\ = \underbrace{q(x_1)\prod_{n=1}^{N+1}q(x_{t_{n-1}}|x_{t_{n}})}_{\text{backward representation}}
    \label{eq:markov_proj}
\end{multline}

The reciprocal projection obviously preserves the joint distribution $q(x_0,x_1)$ of a process at time moments $t=0,1$. The Markovian projection, in general, alters $q(x_0,x_1)$ but preserves the joint distributions $\{q(x_{t_n},x_{t_{n-1}})\}_{n=1}^{N+1}$ at neighboring time moments and the marginal distributions $q(x_{t_{n}})$.

\textbf{The D-IMF procedure} is initialized with any process $q^0 \in \Pi_{N}(p_0, p_1)$. Then the procedure alternates between reciprocal $proj_{\mathcal{R}^{\text{ref}}}$ and Markovian $proj_{\mathcal{M}}$ projections:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:d_imf}
    \begin{gathered}
        q^{2l+1} = proj_{\mathcal{R}^{\text{ref}}}\left(q^{2l}\right),
        \\
        q^{2l+2} = proj_{\mathcal{M}}\left(q^{2l+1}\right).
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
Since both the Markovian and reciprocal projections preserve marginals $p_0,p_1$ at times $t=0,1$, respectively, we have that each $q^{l}\in\Pi_{N}(p_0,p_1)$. In certain configurations of $N$, $\mathcal{X}$, $q^{\text{ref}}$, IMF provably converges to the dynamic SB $q^{*}$ in KL, i.e., $\lim_{l\rightarrow\infty}\KL{q^{l}}{q^{*}}=0$. Specifically, the convergence easily follows from the generic proof argument in [8] \textit{as soon it is known that $q^{*}$ is the unique process in $\Pi_{N}(p_0,p_1)$ that is both Markovian and reciprocal}. We provide Table \ref{tab:sb_setups} summarizing the configurations for which this \textbf{characterization} of SB is known. We also list the related practical algorithms which implement the (D-)IMF procedure.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that the \textit{convergence rate of (D-)IMF procedure notably depends on the number $N$ of time steps}. In fact, for each $N$ it is its own separate procedure with different Markovian projection \eqref{eq:markov_proj}, see [9].

\subsection{Object of Study}
As it is clear from Table \ref{tab:sb_setups}, for the setup with the discrete space $\mathcal{X}=\mathbb{S}^{D}$ and finite amount of time moments $N<\infty$, there is still no theoretical guarantee that the SB is the unique Markovian and reciprocal process. This leaves a large gap in D-IMF usage in this case, and we close it in our paper. 

At the same time, we note that there is a very recent IMF-based algorithm DDSBM [10] for the discrete state space $\mathcal{X}$ but continuous time ($N=\infty$). However, since working with continuous time is infeasible in practice, the authors discretize the time grid to large finite $N$. Due to this, in fact, the authors apply the D-IMF procedure, although it still lacks any theoretical ground in this case. In contrast, our work shows that \textit{theoretically} even $N=1$ is enough.
