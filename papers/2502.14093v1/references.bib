This can in part be explained by a lack of standardized, generally applicable models, tools, and methodologies for evaluating how reverse engineering attack strategies are executed. The framework of related components proposed in this paper is an attempt to provide exactly that. It includes a meta-model and supporting tools for modeling the knowledge that reverse engineers acquire as they execute their strategies, a meta-model to estimate the required effort of those strategies, and tools to capture strategic activities from data streams collected during human reverse engineering experiments. Their use is demonstrated on three example reverse engineering strategies.},

abstract="Obfuscation is an important technique that renders it difficult to analyze programs and has been developed for copyright protection. When an obfuscation is applied to a program, the logic of a program can be very complex and de-obfuscation can be very difficult. However, obfuscation can be used to conceal malicious codes in malware. Therefore, de-obfuscation for binary codes is required for malicious code analysis. In addition, the type of obfuscation technique applied to a program must be identified as it determines the de-obfuscation solution. However, it is difficult to acquire information regarding obfuscation from binary codes, where various obfuscation techniques are mixed. Herein, we propose a lightweight neural network-based classifier (LOM) to detect obfuscation techniques. LOM involves only a lightweight procedure using an opcode histogram, which is designed based on the effects of obfuscation methods on opcodes. It is experimentally shown that LOM yields competitive performance compared with other obfuscation technique classifiers.",

By contrast to existing work, we provide a methodology that can detect multiple layers of obfuscation, without depending on knowledge of the underlying functionality of the training-set used. We also extend our work to detect constructions of obfuscation transformations, thus providing a fine-grained methodology. To that end, we provide several studies for the best practices of the use of machine learning techniques for a scalable and efficient model. According to our experimental results and evaluations on obfuscators such as Tigress and OLLVM, our models have up to 91\% accuracy on state-of-the-art obfuscation transformations.

abstract = {By restoring the program into an easier understandable form, deobfuscation is an important technique for detecting and analyzing malicious software. To enable deobfuscation, one must know if the target program is obfuscated and what types of obfuscation schemes may be used. However, obtaining such information is challenging without having access to the original program source code. This paper presents a new way to estimate the obfuscation scheme of a compiled binary. It achieves this by using semantic information of the disassembled binary to predict if the program has been obfuscated and if so, what type of obfuscation scheme may be used. At the core of our approach is a set of deep neural networks that can effectively characterize and leverage the contextual information available in the assembly code. Our models are first trained offline, and the learned models can then be applied to new previously unseen obfuscated binaries. We evaluate our approach by applying it to a large dataset of over 277,000 obfuscated samples with different individual obfuscation schemes and their combinations. Experimental results show that our approach is highly effective in identifying the obfuscation scheme, with a prediction accuracy of at least 83% (up to 98%).}

This work examines the status-quo of Android obfuscation, obfuscation detection and deobfuscation. Specifically, it first summarizes obfuscation approaches that are commonly used by app developers for code optimization, to protect their software against code theft and code tampering but are also frequently misused by malware developers to circumvent anti-malware products. Secondly, the article focuses on obfuscation detection techniques and presents various available tools and current research. Thirdly, deobfuscation (which aims at reinstating the original state before obfuscation) is discussed followed by a brief discussion how this impacts forensic investigation. We conclude that although obfuscation is widely used in Android app development (benign and malicious), available tools and the practices on how to deal with obfuscation are not standardized, and so are inherently lacking from a forensic standpoint.}

abstract="Code obfuscation is often utilized by authors of malware to protect it from detection or to hide its maliciousness from code analysis. Obfuscation stealth describes how difficult it is to determine which protection technique has been applied to a program and which parts of the code have been protected. In previous literature, most of the presented obfuscation identification methods analyze the program code itself (for example, the frequency and distribution of opcodes). However, simple countermeasures such as instruction substitution can have a negative impact on the identification rate. In this paper, we present a novel approach for an accurate obfuscation identification model based on a combination of multiple code complexity metrics. An evaluation with 4124 samples protected with 11 different obfuscations, combinations of obfuscations, and various compiler configurations demonstrates an overall classification accuracy of 86.5{\%}.",

abstract = {The obfuscation detection technology is an important auxiliary means of malware detection. Also, for security practitioners, it can carry out automatic obfuscation detection before manual reverse analysis, which helps reverse engineers to perform reverse analysis more specifically. Existing obfuscation detection methods are mainly for Android applications and based on traditional machine learning, whose detection granularity is coarse, generality is poor, and the performance is not good enough. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a function-level obfuscation detection method based on Graph Convolutional Networks for X86 assembly code and Android applications. Firstly, our method is function-level obfuscation detection, and we extract the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of each function as its feature, including the adjacency matrix and the basic block feature matrix. Secondly, we build a hybrid neural network model GCN-LSTM as our obfuscation detection model, which combines the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Finally, we conduct experiments using real-world open-source programs and compare results with baseline methods. For function-level detection, the accuracy of our method is 94.7575\% for X86 assembly code and 98.9457\% for Android applications, both of which are better than baseline methods. For APK-level detection, our method can almost completely detect the obfuscated APKs. Experimental results show that our method performs well for both X86 assembly code and Android applications and is superior to the baseline methods in both function-level detection and APK-level detection. Our research showcases a successful application of the Graph Convolutional Network and the Control Flow Graph on code obfuscation detection problems.}

We first present a general parameterized algorithm that encompasses many well-known and novel call graph construction algorithms. We have implemented this general algorithm in the Vortex compiler infrastructure, a mature, multilanguage, optimizing compiler. The Vortex implementation provides a "level playing field" for meaningful cross-algorithm performance comparisons. The costs and benefits of a number of call graph construction algorithms are empirically assessed by applying their Vortex implementation to a suite of sizeable (5,000 to 50,000 lines of code) Cecil and Java programs. For many of these applications, interprocedural analysis enabled substantial speed-ups over an already highly optimized baseline. Furthermore, a significant fraction of these speed-ups can be obtained through the use of a scalable, near-linear time call graph construction algorithm.},

abstract = {Daikon is an implementation of dynamic detection of likely invariants; that is, the Daikon invariant detector reports likely program invariants. An invariant is a property that holds at a certain point or points in a program; these are often used in assert statements, documentation, and formal specifications. Examples include being constant (x=a), non-zero (x≠0), being in a range (a≤x≤b), linear relationships (y=ax+b), ordering (x≤y), functions from a library (x=fn(y)), containment (x∈y), sortedness (xissorted), and many more. Users can extend Daikon to check for additional invariants. Dynamic invariant detection runs a program, observes the values that the program computes, and then reports properties that were true over the observed executions. Dynamic invariant detection is a machine learning technique that can be applied to arbitrary data. Daikon can detect invariants in C, C++, Java, and Perl programs, and in record-structured data sources; it is easy to extend Daikon to other applications. Invariants can be useful in program understanding and a host of other applications. Daikon’s output has been used for generating test cases, predicting incompatibilities in component integration, automating theorem proving, repairing inconsistent data structures, and checking the validity of data streams, among other tasks.

abstract = {Abstract interpretation is a sound-by-construction method for program verification: any erroneous program will raise some alarm. However, the verification of correct programs may yield false-alarms, namely it may be incomplete. Ideally, one would like to perform the analysis on the most abstract domain that is precise enough to avoid false-alarms. We show how to exploit a weaker notion of completeness, called local completeness, to optimally refine abstract domains and thus enhance the precision of program verification. Our main result establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal, locally complete refinement, called pointed shell. On top of this, we define two repair strategies to remove all false-alarms along a given abstract computation: the first proceeds forward, along with the concrete computation, while the second moves backward within the abstract computation. Our results pave the way for a novel modus operandi for automating program verification that we call Abstract Interpretation Repair (AIR): instead of choosing beforehand the right abstract domain, we can start in any abstract domain and progressively repair its local incompleteness as needed. In this regard, AIR is for abstract interpretation what CEGAR is for abstract model checking.},

abstract="In program analysis by abstract interpretation, backward-completeness represents no loss of precision between the result of the analysis and the abstraction of the concrete execution, while forward-completeness stands for no imprecision between the concretization of the analysis result and the concrete execution. Program analyzers satisfying one of the two properties (or both) are considered precise. Regrettably, as for all approximation methods, the presence of false-alarms is most of the time unavoidable and therefore we need to deal somehow with incompleteness of both. To this end, a new property called partial completeness has recently been formalized as a relaxation of backward-completeness allowing a limited amount of imprecision measured by quasi-metrics. However, the use of quasi-metrics enforces distance functions to adhere precisely the abstract domain ordering, thus not suitable to be used to weaken the forward-completeness property which considers also abstract domains that are not necessarily based on Galois Connections. In this paper, we formalize a weaker form of quasi-metric, called pre-metric, which can be defined on all domains equipped with a pre-order relation. We show how this newly defined notion of pre-metric allows us to derive other pre-metrics on other domains by exploiting the concretization and, when available, the abstraction maps, according to the information and the corresponding level of approximation that we want to measure. Finally, by exploiting pre-metrics as our imprecision meter, we introduce the partial forward/backward-completeness properties.",

abstract = {Malware analysis aims to understand how malicious software carries out actions necessary for a successful attack and identify the possible impacts of the attack. While there has been substantial research focused on malware analysis and it is an important tool for practitioners in industry, the overall malware analysis process used by practitioners has not been studied. As a result, an understanding of common malware analysis workflows and their goals is lacking. A better understanding of these workflows could help identify new research directions that are impactful in practice. In order to better understand malware analysis processes, we present the results of a user study with 21 professional malware analysts with diverse backgrounds who work at 18 different companies. The study focuses on answering three research questions: (1) What are the different objectives of malware analysts in practice?, (2) What comprises a typical professional malware analyst workflow, and (3) When analysts decide to conduct dynamic analysis, what factors do they consider when setting up a dynamic analysis system? Based on participant responses, we propose a taxonomy of malware analysts and identify five common analysis workflows. We also identify challenges that analysts face during the different stages of their workflow. From the results of the study, we propose two potential directions for future research, informed by challenges described by the participants. Finally, we recommend guidelines for developers of malware analysis tools to consider in order to improve the usability of such tools.},

Obfuscation techniques transform the original code to a new protected version which is harder for the attackers to understand but have the same function as the original one. Most of obfuscation techniques are not based on well-defined measurements to clarify their effectiveness in protecting the source code from reveres engineering attacks. This paper presents an experimental study to investigate the effectiveness of specific control flows obfuscation technique---A parameterized flattening---in software protection against human attacks. We conduct an experiment, where software developers participate to perform an attack task on two applications written in C sharp programming language where one of the applications is clear and the other one is obfuscated with control flow obfuscation technique. As a result of the statistical analysis used in this paper, it is shown that only the obfuscation treatment significantly affects the correctness of the attacker to perform a successful attack, where the obfuscation reduced the correctness of the attacker by 50{\%}. The complexity of the application has no significant effect on the correctness of the understanding tasks. Also, neither obfuscation treatment nor the complexity of the application has any effect on the correctness of the modification attack tasks.},

abstract = {Software obfuscation has always been a controversially discussed research area. While theoretical results indicate that provably secure obfuscation in general is impossible, its widespread application in malware and commercial software shows that it is nevertheless popular in practice. Still, it remains largely unexplored to what extent today’s software obfuscations keep up with state-of-the-art code analysis and where we stand in the arms race between software developers and code analysts. The main goal of this survey is to analyze the effectiveness of different classes of software obfuscation against the continuously improving deobfuscation techniques and off-the-shelf code analysis tools.The answer very much depends on the goals of the analyst and the available resources. On the one hand, many forms of lightweight static analysis have difficulties with even basic obfuscation schemes, which explains the unbroken popularity of obfuscation among malware writers. On the other hand, more expensive analysis techniques, in particular when used interactively by a human analyst, can easily defeat many obfuscations. As a result, software obfuscation for the purpose of intellectual property protection remains highly challenging.},

Polyvariant techniques come in a number of different flavors that represent alternative heuristics for managing the trade-off an analysis strikes between precision and complexity. For example, call sensitivity supposes that values will tend to correlate with recent call sites, object sensitivity supposes that values will correlate with the allocation points of related objects, the Cartesian product algorithm supposes correlations between the values of arguments to the same function, and so forth.  In this paper, we describe a unified methodology for implementing and understanding polyvariance in a higher-order setting (i.e., for control-flow analyses). We do this by extending the method of abstracting abstract machines (AAM), a systematic approach to producing an abstract interpretation of abstract-machine semantics. AAM eliminates recursion within a language’s semantics by passing around an explicit store, and thus places importance on the strategy an analysis uses for allocating abstract addresses within the abstract heap or store. We build on AAM by showing that the design space of possible abstract allocators exactly and uniquely corresponds to the design space of polyvariant strategies. This allows us to both unify and generalize polyvariance as tunings of a single function. Changes to the behavior of this function easily recapitulate classic styles of analysis and produce novel variations, combinations of techniques, and fundamentally new techniques.},

Call chains collected by stack tracing can be used to understand the behaviour of programmes. To hinder reverse analysis of stack tracing, a binary code obfuscation method based on random obfuscated table and hash coding is proposed. Random obfuscated table is used to map call addresses while call and ret instructions are executing. Hash coding and random value can be used to encode and decode the data of stack frames in the run-time programmes. Experiment and analysis show that the obfuscation can effectively impede stack trace analysis and increase the cost of reverse analysis for programmes.},

abstract = {Code deobfuscation, which attempts to simplify code that has been intentionally obfuscated to prevent understanding, is a critical technique for downstream security analysis tasks like malware detection. While there has been significant prior work on code deobfuscation, most techniques either do not handle control flow obfuscations that modify control flow or they target specific classes of control flow obfuscations, making them unsuitable for handling new types of obfuscations or combinations of existing ones. In this paper, we study a new deobfuscation technique that is based on program synthesis and that can handle a broad class of control flow obfuscations. Given an obfuscated program P, our approach aims to synthesize a smallest program that is a control-flow reduction of P and that is semantically equivalent. Since our method does not assume knowledge about the types of obfuscations that have been applied to the original program, the underlying synthesis problem ends up being very challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel trace-informed compositional synthesis algorithm that leverages hints present in dynamic traces of the obfuscated program to decompose the synthesis problem into a set of simpler subproblems. In particular, we show how dynamic traces can be useful for inferring a suitable control-flow skeleton of the deobfuscated program and performing independent synthesis of each basic block. We have implemented this approach in a tool called Chisel and evaluate it on 546 benchmarks that have been obfuscated using combinations of six different obfuscation techniques. Our evaluation shows that our approach is effective and that it produces code that is almost identical (modulo variable renaming) to the original (non-obfuscated) program in 86\% of cases. Our evaluation also shows that Chisel significantly outperforms existing techniques.},

Both companies and malware authors want to prevent such attacks. This has driven an arms race between attackers and defenders, resulting in a plethora of different protection and analysis methods. However, it remains difficult to measure the strength of protections because MATE attackers can reach their goals in many different ways and a universally accepted evaluation methodology does not exist. This survey systematically reviews the evaluation methodologies of papers on obfuscation, a major class of protections against MATE attacks. For 571 papers, we collected 113 aspects of their evaluation methodologies, ranging from sample set types and sizes, over sample treatment, to performed measurements. We provide detailed insights into how the academic state of the art evaluates both the protections and analyses thereon. In summary, there is a clear need for better evaluation methodologies. We identify nine challenges for software protection evaluations, which represent threats to the validity, reproducibility, and interpretation of research results in the context of MATE attacks and formulate a number of concrete recommendations for improving the evaluations reported in future research papers.},

However, software protection, which aims at mitigating MATE attacks, is dominated by fuzzy concepts and security-through-obscurity. This paper presents a rationale for adopting and standardizing the protection of software as a risk management process according to the NIST SP800-39 approach. We examine the relevant constructs, models, and methods needed for formalizing and automating the activities in this process in the context of MATE software protection. We highlight the open issues that the research community still has to address. We discuss the benefits that such an approach can bring to all stakeholders. In addition, we present a Proof of Concept (PoC) decision support system that instantiates many of the discussed construct, models, and methods and automates many activities in the risk analysis methodology for the protection of software. Despite being a prototype, the PoC’s validation with industry experts indicated that several aspects of the proposed risk management process can already be formalized and automated with our existing toolbox and that it can actually assist decision making in industrially relevant settings.}

abstract = {Anti-tampering is a form of software protection conceived to detect and avoid the execution of tampered programs. Tamper detection assesses programs' integrity with load or execution-time checks. Avoidance reacts to tampered programs by stopping or rendering them unusable. General purpose reactions (such as halting the execution) stand out like a lighthouse in the code and are quite easy to defeat by an attacker. More sophisticated reactions, which degrade the user experience or the quality of service, are less easy to locate and remove but are too tangled with the program's business logic, and are thus difficult to automate by a general purpose protection tool. In the present paper, we propose a novel approach to anti-tampering that (i) fully automatically applies to a target program, (ii) uses Remote Attestation for detection purposes and (iii) adopts a server-side reaction that is difficult to block by an attacker. By means of Client/Server Code Splitting, a crucial part of the program is removed from the client and executed on a remote trusted server in sync with the client. If a client program provides evidences of its integrity, the part moved to the server is executed. Otherwise, a server-side reaction logic may (temporarily or definitely) decide to stop serving it. Therefore, a tampered client application can not continue its execution. We assessed our automatic protection tool on a case study Android application. Experimental results show that all the original and tampered executions are correctly detected, reactions are promptly applied, and execution overhead is on an acceptable level.},

State space abstraction, having been essential for verifying designs of industrial complexity, is typically a manual process, requiring considerable creativity and insight.In this article, we present an automatic iterative abstraction-refinement methodology that extends symbolic model checking. In our method, the initial abstract model is generated by an automatic analysis of the control structures in the program to be verified. Abstract models may admit erroneous (or "spurious") counterexamples. We devise new symbolic techniques that analyze such counterexamples and refine the abstract model correspondingly. We describe aSMV, a prototype implementation of our methodology in NuSMV. Practical experiments including a large Fujitsu IP core design with about 500 latches and 10000 lines of SMV code confirm the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract="Recent studies on code protection showed that incompleteness, in the abstract interpretation framework, has a key role in understanding program obfuscation. In particular, it is well known that completeness corresponds to exactness of a given analysis for a fixed program semantics, hence incompleteness implies the imprecision of an analysis with respect to the program semantics. In code protection, if the analysis corresponds to attacker capability of understanding a program semantics, then to study incompleteness means to study how to make an attacker harmless. We recently showed that this is possible by transforming the program semantics towards incompleteness, which corresponds to a code obfuscation. In this paper, we show that incompleteness can be induced also by transforming abstract domains. In this way we can associate with each obfuscated program (semantics) the most imprecise, harmless, analysis. We show that, for both the forms of completeness, backward and forward, we can uniquely simplify domains towards incompleteness, while in general it is not possible to uniquely refine domains. Finally, we show some examples of known code protection techniques that can be characterized in the new framework of abstract interpretation incompleteness.",

abstract="Abstract interpretation offers sound and decidable approximations for undecidable queries related to program behavior. The effectiveness of an abstract domain is entirely reliant on the abstract domain itself, and the worst-case scenario is when the abstract interpreter provides a response of ``don't know``, indicating that anything could happen during runtime. Conversely, a desirable outcome is when the abstract interpreter provides information that exceeds a specified level of precision, resulting in a more precise answer. The concept of completeness relates to the level of precision that is forfeited when performing computations within the abstract domain. Our focus is on the domain's ability to express program behaviour, which we refer to as adequacy. In this paper, we present a domain refinement strategy towards adequacy and a simple sound proof system for adequacy, designed to determine whether an abstract domain is capable of providing satisfactory responses to specified program queries. Notably, this proof system is both language and domain agnostic, and can be readily incorporated to support static program analysis.",

abstract = {It is widely known that the precision of a program analyzer is closely related to intensional program properties,  
namely, properties concerning how the program is written.  
This explains, for instance, the interest in code obfuscation techniques, namely, tools  
explicitly designed to degrade the results of program analysis by operating syntactic program transformations.  
Less is known about a possible relation between what the program extensionally computes,  
namely, its input-output relation, and the precision of a program analyzer.  
In this paper we explore this potential connection in an effort to isolate program fragments  
that can be precisely analyzed by abstract interpretation, namely,  
programs for which there exists a complete abstract interpretation.  
In the field of static inference of numeric invariants, this happens for programs,  
or parts of programs, that manifest a monotone (either non-decreasing or non-increasing) behavior.  
We first formalize the notion of program monotonicity with respect to a given input and a set of numerical variables of interest.  
A sound proof system is then introduced with judgments specifying whether a  
program is monotone relatively to a set of variables and a set of inputs.  
The interest in monotonicity is justified because we prove that the family  
of monotone programs admits a complete abstract interpretation over  
a specific class of non-trivial numerical abstractions and inputs.  
This class includes all non-relational abstract domains that refine interval analysis  
(i.e., at least as precise as the intervals abstraction) and that satisfy a topological convexity hypothesis.},

In abstract interpretation this corresponds to the release of false alarms, e.g., when it is used for program analysis and program verification. As all alarming systems, a program analysis tool is credible when few false alarms are reported. As a consequence, we have to live together with false alarms, but also we need methods to control them. As for all approximation methods, also for abstract interpretation we need to estimate the accumulated imprecision during program analysis. In this paper we introduce a theory for estimating the error propagation in abstract interpretation, and hence in program analysis. We enrich abstract domains with a weakening of a metric distance. This enriched structure keeps coherence between the standard partial order relating approximated objects by their relative precision and the effective error made in this approximation. An abstract interpretation is precise when it is complete. We introduce the notion of partial completeness as a weakening of precision. In partial completeness the abstract interpreter may produce a bounded number of false alarms. We prove the key recursive properties of the class of programs for which an abstract interpreter is partially complete with a given bound of imprecision. Then, we introduce a proof system for estimating an upper bound of the error accumulated by the abstract interpreter during program analysis. Our framework is general enough to be instantiated to most known metrics for abstract domains.},

abstract = {Jones-optimality determines whether a specializer improves program performances. Reinterpreting this concept in terms of the precision of an abstract interpreter means to determine whether specializing a source program is able to improve the precision of a given static analysis. In the opposite direction, a specializer failing optimality (disoptimal) would decrease the precision of the analysis when applied to the specialized code. In this paper, we exploit this reinterpretation of Jones-optimality relatively to the precision of an abstract interpreter with the aim of systematically deriving obfuscated code. In line with the idea behind Futamura’s projections, we factorize the construction of the obfuscated code by separating specialization and interpretation. An interpreter specializer is then systematically made disoptimal by means of language transduction. The result is a language agnostic code obfuscator which is able to foil any given static analyzer.},

A major challenge in building an analysis tool for executables is in providing useful information about operations involving memory. This is difficult when symbol-table and debugging information is absent or untrusted. CodeSurfer/x86 overcomes these challenges to provide an analyst with a powerful and flexible platform for investig`ating the properties and behaviors of potentially malicious code (such as COTS components, plugins, mobile code, worms, Trojans, and virus-infected code) using (i) CodeSurfer/x86's GUI, (ii) CodeSurfer/x86's scripting language, which provides access to all of the intermediate representations that CodeSurfer/x86 builds for the executable, and (iii) GrammaTech's Path Inspector, which is a tool that uses a sophisticated pattern-matching engine to answer questions about the flow of execution in a program.",

abstract = {Softwares use cryptographic algorithms to secure their communications and to protect their internal data. However the algorithm choice, its implementation design and the generation methods of its input parameters may have dramatic consequences on the security of the data it was initially supposed to protect. Therefore to assess the security of a binary program involving cryptography, analysts need to check that none of these points will cause a system vulnerability. It implies, as a first step, to precisely identify and locate the cryptographic code in the binary program. Since binary analysis is a difficult and cumbersome task, it is interesting to devise a method to automatically retrieve cryptographic primitives and their parameters.In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically identify symmetric cryptographic algorithms and their parameters inside binary code. Our approach is static and based on DFG isomorphism. To cope with binary codes produced from different source codes and by different compilers and options, the DFG is normalized using code rewrite mechanisms. Our approach differs from previous works, that either use statistical criteria leading to imprecise results, or rely on heavy dynamic instrumentation. To validate our approach, we present experimental results on a set of synthetic samples including several cryptographic algorithms, binary code of well-known cryptographic libraries and reference source implementation compiled using different compilers and options.},

abstract = {Malware applies lots of obfuscation techniques, which are often automatically generated by the use of packers. This paper presents a packer identification of packed code based on metadata signature, which is a frequency vector of occurrences of classified obfuscation techniques. First, BE-PUM (Binary Emulator for PUshdown Model generation) disassembles and generates the control flow graph of malware in an on-the-fly manner, using concolic testing. Second, obfuscation techniques in the generated control flow graph are detected based on the formal criteria of each obfuscation technique. Last, the used packer is identified with the chisquare test on the metadata signature of a packed code. The precision is evaluated with experiments on 12814 malware from VX heaven and Virusshare, in which 608 examples are detected inconsistent with commercial packer identification at PEiD, CFF Explore, and VirusTotal. We manually confirm that, except for 1 example, BE-PUM is correct. The only case that BE-PUM misunderstands is between MEW and FSG, which are quite similar packers and current BE-PUM extension does not support MEW.},

abstract = {In this paper we show how abstract interpretation, and more specifically completeness, provides anadequate model for reasoning about code obfuscation and watermarking. The idea is that makinga program obscure, or equivalently hiding information in it, corresponds to force an interpreter (the attacker) to become incomplete in its attempts to extractinformation about the program. Here abstract interpretation provides the model of the attacker (malicious host) and abstract interpretation transformers provide driving methods for understanding and designing new obfuscation and watermarking strategies: Obfuscation corresponds to make the malicious host incomplete and watermarking corresponds to hide secrets where incomplete attackers cannot extract them unless some secret key is given.},

abstract = {Subgraph isomorphism can be determined by means of a brute-force tree-search enumeration procedure. In this paper a new algorithm is introduced that attains efficiency by inferentially eliminating successor nodes in the tree search. To assess the time actually taken by the new algorithm, subgraph isomorphism, clique detection, graph isomorphism, and directed graph isomorphism experiments have been carried out with random and with various nonrandom graphs.A parallel asynchronous logic-in-memory implementation of a vital part of the algorithm is also described, although this hardware has not actually been built. The hardware implementation would allow very rapid determination of isomorphism.},

abstract = {Third-party libraries on Android have been shown to be security and privacy hazards by adding security vulnerabilities to their host apps or by misusing inherited access rights. Correctly attributing improper app behavior either to app or library developer code or isolating library code from their host apps would be highly desirable to mitigate these problems, but is impeded by the absence of a third-party library detection that is effective and reliable in spite of obfuscated code. This paper proposes a library detection technique that is resilient against common code obfuscations and that is capable of pinpointing the exact library version used in apps. Libraries are detected with profiles from a comprehensive library database that we generated from the original library SDKs. We apply our technique to the top apps on Google Play and their complete histories to conduct a longitudinal study of library usage and evolution in apps. Our results particularly show that app developers only slowly adapt new library versions, exposing their end-users to large windows of vulnerability. For instance, we discovered that two long-known security vulnerabilities in popular libs are still present in the current top apps. Moreover, we find that misuse of cryptographic APIs in advertising libs, which increases the host apps' attack surface, affects 296 top apps with a cumulative install base of 3.7bn devices according to Play. To the best of our knowledge, our work is first to quantify the security impact of third-party libs on the Android ecosystem.},
