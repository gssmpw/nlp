\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

First, we analyzed four different definitions / interpretations of existing criteria for assessing the strength of sofware obfuscation techniques. Based on a literature study, we formulated 29 critiques on the existing definitions and uses of practical and theoretical potency, resilience, stealth, and cost criteria. 

Next, we formulated the eight new criteria of relevance, effectiveness, robustness,
concealment, stubbornness, sensitivity, predictability, and cost, plus one poor man's alternative of effectiveness in the form of efficacy. For those eight criteria, we formulated a total of 35 subcriteria. Our primary aim with these criteria is to provide guidance to researchers on how to improve the construct, internal, external, conclusion, and instantiation validity of their experiments and reported research results. We discussed how these criteria help to make conceptual recommendations formulated over the last five years more concrete.
