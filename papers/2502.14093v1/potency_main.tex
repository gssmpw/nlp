\begin{abstract}
In the domain of practical software protection against man-at-the-end attacks such as software reverse engineering and tampering, much of the scientific literature is plagued by the use of subpar methods to evaluate the protections' strength and even by the absence of such evaluations. Several criteria have been proposed in the past to assess the strength of protections, such as potency, resilience, stealth, and cost. We analyze their evolving definitions and uses. We formulate a number of critiques, from which we conclude that the existing definitions are unsatisfactory and need to be revised. We present a new framework of software protection evaluation criteria: relevance, effectiveness (or efficacy), robustness, concealment, stubbornness, sensitivity, predictability, and cost.

% The main focus of CheckMATE is on new models and techniques to defend software from tampering, reverse engineering, and piracy as well as to the development of new attack strategies that highlight the need of more complete defenses. We include both offensive and defensive techniques because of their close and intertwined relationship depending on the attack scenario. For instance, reverse engineering is defensive when the goal is to analyse obfuscated malware, but it is offensive when it is used to steal intellectual property and assets in legitimate software. Likewise, obfuscation is defensive when it aims for protecting a legitimate asset against reverse engineering, while it is offensive if it is used to hide that malware is embedded in an application. Both scenarios are of practical relevance, and therefore CheckMATE includes all attacks on/defenses of the confidentiality and integrity of software applications and assets embedded therein and exposed to MATE attacks. In such scenarios, attackers have full control over, and access to the hardware and/or software they are attacking in a controlled environment.

% Submission Guidelines
%
%     Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review.
%
%     Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.
%
%     Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format (see https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template, with a simpler version at https://github.com/acmccs/format).
%
%     Sumibssions may not exceed 12 pages long or 6 pages for short papers, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions are not required to reach the page limit. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.
%
%     One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to present the paper in person at the workshop.


% \section{Authors and Affiliations}
%
% Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
% identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
% affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
% names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
% possible.
%
% Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
% alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
%   \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
%   \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
% to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
% of an article contributed equally to the work.
%
% If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
% the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
% overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
% the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
% \end{verbatim}
% Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
% of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
% page headers.

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}
%
% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.
%
% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.
%
% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.
%
% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).
