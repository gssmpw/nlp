\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced the Quadratic Programming Enhanced Model (\gls{NewlayerName}). 
It uses discrete optimization to find an optimal feature selection and assignment of just $5$ to each class.
With this easy-to-understand assignment, the resulting \gls{NewlayerName} is more interpretable than previous methods, as it has contrastive faithfully interpretable class-representations, shows \cubsim{}, is steerable, and its features have excellent \loc{5}, \generality{}and \contrastiveness{}.
Additionally, it further closes the accuracy gap to the drastically less robust uninterpretable baseline.
\Cref{fig:RadarMax} shows that only \gls{NewlayerName} excels in all metrics, thus setting a new state of the art for compactness-based interpretable models, 
while delivering unprecedented global interpretability even to \imgnetheader{}.
