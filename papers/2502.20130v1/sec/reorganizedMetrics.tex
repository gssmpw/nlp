Following \gls{PIP-Net} as recent work, we evaluate the accuracy and compactness, measured as number of total features~\gls{nReducedFeatures} and number of features per class~\gls{nperClass}.
Additionally, our \gls{NewlayerName} learns interpretable class representations, summarized in~\cref{tab:ClassRepresent}, that are composed of features.
As discussed in \cref{sec:RelatedWork}, diversity, contrastiveness, generality and grounding are desired aspects of explanations.
While we believe that our sparse binary assignment is very well suited for a detailed analysis and alignment of the learned features, as it likely prohibits superposition, polysemantic neurons are still likely to occur and hard to measure for \gls{NewlayerName} and all end-to-end trained interpretable models.
Therefore, we omit measuring the grounding of features and instead focus on contrastive,  general and diverse as desirable \textit{and} quantifiable qualities of features as building blocks of our interpretable class representations, whose \cubsim{} we estimate using the attributes contained in \cubheader{}.
Specifically, every class $\cindex$ in \cubheader{} is annotated with a vector $\boldsymbol{a}_\cindex\in[0,1]^{312}$, where $a_{\cindex,j}$ indicates the fraction of images with label $\cindex$, in which a human perceives the attribute $j$ to be present. 
With these vectors,
we compute 
the ground truth structural class similarity
$\boldsymbol{\mathrm{\ClassSim}}^{gt}\in[0,1]^{\gls{nClasses}\times\gls{nClasses}}$ with ${\mathrm{\classSim}}^{gt}_{\cindex,\cindex'}$ being the cosine similarity between $\boldsymbol{a}_\cindex$ and $\boldsymbol{a}_{\cindex'}$.
Similarly,
$\boldsymbol{\mathrm{\ClassSim}}^{Model}\in[-1,1]^{\gls{nClasses}\times\gls{nClasses}}$
is
based on the class vectors in the interpretable classification layer.
We then report the similarity for the top $25$ most similar unique pairs of classes $C_\mathrm{Sim}$ in reality 
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{\cubsim} = 
  \frac{\sum_{\cindex,\cindex' \in C_\mathrm{Sim} } \mathrm{\classSim}^{Model}_{\cindex,\cindex'} }{\sum_{\cindex,\cindex' \in C_\mathrm{Sim} } \mathrm{\classSim}^{gt}_{\cindex,\cindex'}}.
\end{equation}
Models with high \cubsim{} offer an interpretable human-like class-similarity, \eg{} using the apparently different head to differentiate between Rottweiler and Doberman in \cref{fig:metrics_full} or differentiating shiny and bronzed cowbird by its only separating attribute, shown in \cref{fig:CubSim}.\\
