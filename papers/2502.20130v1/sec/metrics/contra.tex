To measure the contrastiveness of features, 
a Gaussian mixture model with two components 
is fit 
to every feature distribution $\boldsymbol{f}_{:,\findex}$, resulting in the 
normal distributions $\mathcal{N}_1^\findex$ and $\mathcal{N}_2^\findex$, visualized in \cref{fig:Contr}.
We then compute the \textit{\contrastiveness{}} as average of all features using the overlap~\citep{doi:10.1080/03610928908830127} between the two 
distributions: \begin{equation}
  \mathrm{\contrastiveness{}} =\sum_{\findex=1}^{\gls{nReducedFeatures}} 1 - \mathrm{Overlap}(\mathcal{N}_1^\findex, \mathcal{N}_2^\findex),\end{equation}
as bi-modal contrastive features can be represented by two non-overlapping distributions.
The binary quality of the features is also indicated in \cref{fig:metrics_full,fig:CubSim}, as the features are normed per column.\\
