\section{Preliminaries}
The task is to optimize the parameters of a function (RAG pipeline) for a workload with respect to multiple objective functions:
\begin{equation}
    \text{max}_{c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s} \; f_m(c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s; p), \; m=1,2,...,M
\end{equation}
where $c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s$ are parameters which define the RAG pipeline:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $c_s \in \mathbb{Z}^+$: Chunk size
    \item $c_n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$: Number of chunks
    \item $l_i \in \{l_1, l_2, ..., l_I\}$: Choice of LLM \andrew{I think you can drop the subscript in $l_i$}
    \item $e_i \in \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_{J}\}$: Choice of embedding model\andrew{I think you can drop the subscript in $e_i$}
    \item $p_s \in \mathbb{Z}^n$: System prompt (defined by the tokens) \andrew{maybe better to use $\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$? Also this representation isn't clicking for me. An alternative definition: A system prompt is a sequence of tokens $\mathbf{s} = \left[s_1, s_2, \dots, s_T \right]$, with $s_i \in \mathcal{V}$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the vocabulary of the model.}
\end{itemize}

and $p$ defines the workload as a probability distribution of input queries, defined as $q$.

Each objective function $f_m$ is used to evaluate one of the following dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Safety
    \item Alignment
    \item Cost
    \item Latency
\end{enumerate}
N.B. It is currently unclear if we want to define the multi-objective problem as optimizing a weighted sum of objectives, or optimizing one parameter with a set of constraints. For example, we may want to set minimum thresholds of safety, alignment and latency, and minimize cost.

However, we can't evaluate each objective function directly (i.e. can't evaluate the RAG pipeline for a workload). Instead, each objective function can be evaluated for a given query $\mathbf{q} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$:
\begin{equation}
    f_m^{\mathbf{q}}(\mathbf{q} ; c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s)
\end{equation}

Thus, each overall objective function can be defined as the expectation of the individual query function ($f_m^{\mathbf{q}}$) for the entire workload:
\begin{equation}
    f(c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s; p) = \int_{\mathbb{Z}^n} f_m^\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{q} ; c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s) p(\mathbf{q}) dq
\end{equation}

Assuming we can sample from $P$, we can use Monte Carlo to calculate an approximation for each objective function:
\begin{equation}
    f_m(c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s; p) \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N f_m^{\mathbf{q}}({\mathbf{q}}_j ; c_s, c_n, l_i, e_i, p_s)
\end{equation}
