Let's {\KS make blue} the things that non-Brians can do.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\KS pinch and archipelago discussion in Conclusion. Other conclusion edits.}
\item 3D smooth example, cowboy (not bunny), PH, betti 2 component; geometry fitting using sculpt for cowboy, or bunny. If doesn't work, then move to future work.
\item copyright software, BYU and Sandia, put on github, drivers for reproducing some of the results, mention reproducibility. status : scott has contacted Sandia copyright.
\item Obtain permission for use of figures 4 and 6 of Generalized Winding Number paper from ACM
\item Make Figure 22 bigger so the text is more readable
\item Fix one of the footnotes in the Results section---could fix using tinyurl
\item Potentially make a 3D figure for primal-dual-simplex conversion to Aleph
\item Upload the document with the appendix of the proof to arXiv on October 14.
\end{enumerate}
