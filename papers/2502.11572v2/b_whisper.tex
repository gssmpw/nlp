  \caption{\textbf{Overview of B-Whisper.} This figure depicts the train-time inputs and outputs for B-Whisper with an example. In the bottom-most sequence of squares, colored squares contain task-specifiers and transcript tokens, whereas colorless squares contain prompt tokens. In this case, the word ``spirometry'' is the true-bias word for the reference transcript ``spirometry measures lung function accurately''. As such, the tokens of ``spirometry'' are given weight $\beta > 1$ and the rest of the tokens are given weight $1$ in Cross Entropy Loss, as shown in the top-most sequence of squares. }\label{fig:AB}
