\section{Conclusions}
In this work, we propose \sketrag, a cost-efficient multi-granular indexing framework for Graph-RAG systems. By integrating a knowledge graph skeleton with a text-keyword bipartite graph, \sketrag improves retrieval and generation quality while significantly reducing indexing costs. Our approach matches or surpasses Microsoft's \graphrag in retrieval quality while reducing indexing costs by over an order of magnitude, and improves generation quality by up to 32.4\% with 20\% lower indexing costs.
For future work, we plan to extend \sketrag to global search scenarios and explore adaptive paradigms for real-world scalable deployment.
