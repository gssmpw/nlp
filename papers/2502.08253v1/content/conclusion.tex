This paper introduces NG-MV-RFLVM, a novel model designed to address two critical challenges in multi-view representation learning with MV-GPLVMs: limited kernel expressiveness and computational inefficiency.
%
Specifically, we first establish a duality between spectral density and kernel function, yielding a versatile kernel capable of modeling the non-stationarity in multi-view datasets.
%the expressive \MakeUppercase{ng-sm} kernel with universal approximation capability for any continuous kernel. 
%
%By integrating an unbiased differential RFF estimator and an efficient two-step reparameterization technique,
We then show that with the proposed RFF approximation and efficient sampling method, the inference of model and latent representations can be effectively performed within a variational inference framework. %significantly enhancing the computational efficiency. 
Experimental validations demonstrate that our model, NG-MV-RFLVM, outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as MV-VAE and MV-GPLVM in providing informative unified latent representations across diverse cross-domain multi-view datasets.
