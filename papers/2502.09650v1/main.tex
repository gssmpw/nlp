\begin{abstract}
The alignment of large language models (LLMs) often assumes that using more clean data yields better outcomes, overlooking the match between model capacity and example difficulty. Challenging this, we propose a new principle: \textit{``Preference data vary in difficulty, and overly difficult examples hinder alignment, by exceeding the model's capacity."} Through systematic experimentation, we validate this principle with three key findings: (1) preference examples vary in difficulty, as evidenced by consistent learning orders across alignment runs; (2) overly difficult examples significantly degrade performance across four LLMs and two datasets; and (3) the capacity of a model dictates its threshold for handling difficult examples, underscoring a critical relationship between data selection and model capacity. Building on this principle, we introduce \textit{Selective DPO}, which filters out overly difficult examples. This simple adjustment improves alignment performance by 9-16\% in win rates on the AlpacaEval 2 benchmark compared to the DPO baseline, suppressing a series of DPO variants with different algorithmic adjustments. 
Together, these results illuminate the importance of aligning data difficulty with model capacity, offering a transformative perspective for improving alignment strategies in LLMs.\footnote{Code is available at \url{https://github.com/glorgao/SelectiveDPO}.}
