    \caption{\textbf{\textsc{SYNTHIA}: Novel Concept Design with Affordance Composition.} SYNTHIA comprises three stages: (1) Affordance composition curriculum construction, (2) Affordance-based curriculum learning, and (3) Evaluation. In the first stage, we build a training curriculum through sampling affordance pairs from our ontology by gradually increasing the affordance distances. Using our curriculum, we fine-tune T2I models, where they first learn concept-affordance relation from easy data, then integrate multiple affordances into a single functional form from hard data. We employ a contrastive objective with positive (affordances), negative (concepts) constraints, and corresponding images, enforcing visual novelty different from existing concepts. Finally, we evaluate models through automatic evaluation and human evaluation with four metrics: faithfulness, and novelty, practicality, coherence.}
