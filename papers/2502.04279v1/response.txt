\section{Related Work}
Questions concerning local flat-foldability can be cast in the language of constraint satisfaction problems and statistical physics, specifically in the framework of \emph{spin systems}: each edge is assigned ``mountain'' or ``valley'' and there are local rules at each vertex to determine compatibility.  In particular, if one wishes to describe a uniformly random locally flat-foldable configuration as a spin system, one assigns energy $+\infty$ to each configuration that is not locally flat-foldable and energy $0$ to each configuration that is locally flat-foldable.  Via Kawasaki's Theorem, this can be checked by looking purely at each vertex individually. The perspective of interpreting locally flat-foldable configurations as a spin system is not new and indeed work by Assis (2019), "The Connection between Statistical Physics and Local Flat-Foldability" draws connections between more classical statistical physics models and local flat-foldability on certain lattices (some of which we will also discuss in the present study).
Ginepro and Hull (2015), "Square Ice and the Miura-Ori Crease Pattern" proved that the foldings of the \textit{Miura-ori} crease pattern (to be defined in Section~\ref{subsec:Miura}) are equivalent to the square-ice model. 
Nakajima used a spin model on random graphs to model the combinatorial problem of ordering the different layers of paper in flat-folded crease patterns (2013), "A Spin Model for Layer Ordering in Origami" and developed more work in this vein for crease patterns that contain only one interior vertex (2014), "Spin Systems and Single-Vertex Creases".
 
Our main focus is on properties of random locally flat-foldable configurations and in particular on sampling via Markov chains.  The use of Markov chains to sample spin systems is a classic topic at the intersection of statistical physics, probability theory, and computer science.  In particular, Markov chain Monte Carlo was introduced in a work by Metropolis--Rosenbluth--Rosenbluth--Teller--Teller (1953), "Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines" which sought to sample from a continuous-space variant of a spin system called the hard-disk model.  Analysis of Markov chains for spin systems remains a vibrant field, and we refer the reader to the following texts (1998), "Markov Chains and Monte Carlo Simulation" and some recent breakthroughs (2020), "Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo Methods" along with the references therein for more context.
There has also been quite a bit of research on the algorithmic complexity of origami over the past several decades, including several monographs (2011), "Origami Designs: From Paper Folding to Computational Geometry" and Hull (2006), "Algorithms for Origami Equivalence". We make references to related computational origami results throughout.
