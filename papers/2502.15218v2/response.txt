The ESPnet-SpeechLM toolkit builds upon prior works in two main directions:

\noindent\textbf{Text LLM ecosystem:} 
Some popular development tools in text LLM ecosystems can be generalized to any large-scale sequential modeling task, which means they are also suitable for SpeechLM training. Examples of this include DeepSpeed \textbf{Rajbhar et al., "DeepSpeed: A Scalable Zero-Gradient Optimizer"} and FlashAttention \textbf{Chen et al., "FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Attention through Hardware-Awareness"}. 
To preserve text capability, it is common to initialize SpeechLMs from pre-trained text LLMs, which can rely on open-source platforms like HuggingFace Transformers\footnote{\url{https://github.com/huggingface/transformers}}. These tools are integrated into ESPnet-SpeechLM. 
We also noticed that current text LLM training frameworks \textbf{Huang et al., "Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Layer, Multirate Deep Pre-Norm Transformers"} provide limited support for speech features. Our toolkit is presented as a supplement in this direction.

\noindent\textbf{Open-Sourced SpeechLMs and Speech Toolkits:} Current research on SpeechLMs and their transparency has been significantly advanced by prior open-source SpeechLM research works \textbf{Liu et al., "GLM-Voice: A Generalized Voice Conversion Model"}.
SpeechLM research also greatly benefits from general speech processing and sequence-to-sequence modeling toolkits \textbf{Sperber et al., "ESPnet: End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit"}, as they provide a wide range of components applicable to SpeechLM development. 
ESPnet-SpeechLM is presented as a combination of cutting-edge SpeechLM research and well-established speech processing techniques within the open-sourced community. 
More specifically, it is built upon the existing ESPnet \textbf{Watanabe et al., "ESPnet: End-to-End Speech Processing Toolkit"} codebase to better exploit prior community efforts and compare with existing non-SpeechLM works.
We summarize ESPnet-SpeechLM and related codebases in Tab.\ref{tab:comparison}.
