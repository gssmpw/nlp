\section{Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this work, we propose DITS, a novel multi-agent data self-training framework that integrates influence scores into MCTS to guide tree search and data selection. By leveraging influence scores, we effectively identify the most impactful data for system improvement, thereby enhancing model performance. Meanwhile, we derive an efficient influence score estimation method for non-differentiable metrics through gradient-to-inference conversion. This approach substantially reduces computational overhead through inference computation and allows us to estimate influence scores to achieve a more efficient data synthesis process. We further utilize an iterative data synthesis process, which enhances both the quality and efficiency of data synthesis. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art results across eight datasets in two tasks, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 2.1\%-2.5\% over existing methods.

In the future, we will further explore the application of data influence scores to influence the selection step within the tree search process, aiming to assist the algorithm in more efficiently identifying the most beneficial training data within a vast action space.
