  \caption{\textbf{Weight decay results, grouped by $\lambda$ as
      $\alpha$=$\eta\lambda$ varies} (111M, 20~TPP):
    %
    Same data as in \cref{fig:maxlr_wd:111M}, but now curves trace
    points with same weight decay $\lambda$ (in color) and LR $\eta$
    varies across each curve.  Only $\dtoz$ models significantly
    improve as we increase weight decay.  $\dtoz$ models are also less
    sensitive to choice of $\lambda$.  See
    \cref{fig:maxlr_wdgroups:610M} for 610M-model
    results.\label{fig:maxlr_wdgroups:111M}}
