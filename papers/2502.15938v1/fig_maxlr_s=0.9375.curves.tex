  \caption{\textbf{Comparison of decay schedules when using 93.75\%
      weight sparsity} (610M): Validation losses for different LR and
    decay combinations, for a model trained with $\supar$, with
    93.75\% unstructured weight sparsity.  As the decay rate
    increases, loss improves, while the optimal peak LR is much more
    stable when using $\dtoz$.\label{fig:maxlr_s=0.9375.curves}}
