  \caption{Validation loss for different LR and decay combinations,
    for a 610M-parameter model trained with $\supar$, with 93.75\%
    unstructured weight sparsity.  As the decay rate increases, loss
    improves, while the optimal peak LR is much more
    stable.\label{fig:maxlr_s=0.9375.heatmap}}
