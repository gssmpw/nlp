Validation loss for models trained with $\supar$, with 93.75\%
unstructured weight sparsity, as we vary the LR decay ratio.  The
x-axis plots the \emph{minimum} LR, i.e., the LR at the final training
step.  As the ratio increases from $\tenx$ (right-most point), where
the minimum LR is 10\% of the proxy-tuned rate, to 0\% ($\dtoz$,
left-most point), validation loss decreases roughly
linearly.\label{fig:different_ratios}}
