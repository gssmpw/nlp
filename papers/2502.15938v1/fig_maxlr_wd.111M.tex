  \caption{\textbf{Weight decay results, grouped by $\hateta$ as
      $\alpha$=$\eta\lambda$ varies} (111M, 20~TPP):
    %
    Validation losses for different settings of decay schedule
    (separated by subplot), maximum learning rate ($\hateta$, marked
    by color), and weight decay ($\lambda$, corresponding to points on
    the LR curves).  Loss is plotted relative to
    $\alpha$=$\eta\lambda$.  The optimal loss is obtained when
    $\hateta$ is high, but not too high, typically around $\maxlr$ to
    $3.2$e-$02$.  As in \cref{fig:maxlr_wd:610M}, only $\dtoz$ models
    further improve as $\lambda$ increases.\label{fig:maxlr_wd:111M}}
