    Subset of the data in \cref{fig:maxlr_wd:610M}, but now curves
    trace points with same weight decay $\lambda$ (in color) and LR
    $\eta$ varies across each curve.  Only $\dtoz$ models
    significantly improve as we increase weight decay.  $\dtoz$ models
    are also less sensitive to choice of
    $\lambda$.\label{fig:maxlr_wdgroups:610M}}
