In this section, we provide the convex conjugate of the GLM loss functions.
This information is crucial for calculating the safe lower bound in the branch-and-bound framework.

Recall that for our GLM problem, the Fenchel Duality Theorem states that:
\begin{align}
    \label{appendix_eq:fenchel_duality_theorem}
    \inf_{\bbeta} F_y(\bX \bbeta) + G(\bbeta) = \sup_{\bzeta} -F_y^*(-\bX^T \bzeta) - G^*(\bX^T \bzeta),
\end{align}
where $F_y(\bX \bbeta) = f(\bX \bbeta, \by)$, $G(\bbeta) = 2 \lambda_2 g(\bbeta)$.
For the pair of optimal primal-dual solutions $(\bbeta^*, \bzeta^*)$, we have the following relationship:
\begin{align}
    \label{appendix_eq:fenchel_duality_optimality_condition}
    \bzeta^*  = - \nabla F(\bX \bbeta^*). 
\end{align}
From our FISTA algorithm discussed in the main paper (or any iterative algorithm), we have an estimated primal solution $\hat{\bbeta}$, and we can calculate the safe lower bound through the following formula:
\begin{align}
    \label{appendix_eq:dual_bound_via_fenchel_duality_theorem}
    P^*_{\text{MIP}} & \geq -F_y^*(-\hat{\bzeta}) - G^*(\bX^T \hat{\bzeta}),
\end{align}
where $P^*_{\text{MIP}}$ is the optimal value of the MIP problem, and $\hat{\bzeta} = -\nabla F_y(\bX \hat{\bbeta})$. 

From Lemma~\ref{lemma:fenchel_conjugate_of_g_closed_form_expression} in Section~\ref{sec:methodology}, we already know the closed-form expression for the convex conjugate of $g(\cdot)$, i.e., $g^*(\cdot) = \text{TopSum}_k(H_M(\cdot))$.
The convex conjugate of $G(\cdot)=2\lambda g(\cdot)$ is just $G^*(\cdot) = 2\lambda_2 g^*(\frac{\cdot}{2\lambda_2})$ by the Calculus Rules of Convex Conjugates in Appendix~\ref{appendix_sec:convex_conjugate_calculus_rules}.
Therefore, we only need to calculate the convex conjugate of $F_y(\bX \bbeta)$, i.e., $F_y^*(-\bzeta)$, to compute the safe lower bound in the branch-and-bound framework.

The convex conjugates of GLM loss functions are already well-known in the literature~\cite{}.
We provide the closed-form expressions for these convex conjugates in the Table~\ref{table:convex_conjugates_glm_loss_functions}.
