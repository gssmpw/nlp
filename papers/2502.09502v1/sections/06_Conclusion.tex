In summary, we introduce a first-order proximal algorithm to solve the perspective relaxation of cardinality-constrained GLM problems.
By leveraging the problemâ€™s unique mathematical structure, we design a customized PAVA to efficiently evaluate the proximal operator, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional settings.
Further acceleration is achieved through an efficient value-based restart strategy and compatibility with GPUs, which collectively enhance convergence rates and computational speed.
Extensive empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art solvers by 1-2 orders of magnitude, establishing it as a practical, high-performance component for integration into next-generation MIP solvers.
