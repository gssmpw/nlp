\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The present work proposes stable port-Hamiltonian NNs for accurate, robust, and reliable identification of nonlinear dynamic systems.
They leverage the port-Hamiltonian framework, which provides a basis for model interpretation and the adherence to an energy conservation or dissipation balance with respect to a learned Hamiltonian energy function.
Additionally, the approach guarantees the global asymptotic stability of the identified dynamics by constraining the Hamiltonian to be a convex, positive definite Lyapunov function.
We demonstrate the viability of the approach using data from synthetic examples, real-world measurements, and complex multiphysics simulation models. 
While \sPHNNs are limited to dynamic systems with a single equilibrium, when applicable, the stability constraint promotes robust and physically sensible predictions, even with limited training data. 
We observe superior extrapolation with physically sensible predictions and the capability to exploit augmented dimensions where unconstrained alternative models struggle with instabilities.
