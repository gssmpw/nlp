\section{Conclusions}

This paper introduces \disco{}, a device-server cooperative scheduler that addresses QoE and cost challenges in LLM serving for real-time conversational applications for end users. \disco{} uses cost-aware scheduling and token-level migration to dynamically optimize Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Token (TBT) across device and server endpoints. Our evaluations on real-world traces from platforms like GPT and DeepSeek show that \disco{} significantly improves both TTFT and TBT while reducing costs.
