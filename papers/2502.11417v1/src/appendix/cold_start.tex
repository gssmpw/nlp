\section{Cold Start Evaluation}\label{appendix:cold_start}

This section presents cold start performance measurements for the Qwen-2.5 model series across different hardware configurations.
The experiments were conducted on two platforms: Windows 10 with NVIDIA RTX 3060 12GB and Linux with NVIDIA A40 48GB. A fixed prompt "How to use GitHub?" was used throughout all experiments. We measured two critical metrics: model loading time and TTFT for Qwen-2.5 models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters, all using FP16 precision. The experimental setup consisted of 10 measurement runs, with 2 additional warmup runs to ensure measurement stability. It is worth noting that such warmups can potentially mask the true gap between model loading and prompt prefill time due to various optimizations, including OS page cache. To maintain authentic cold start conditions, we explicitly cleared the CUDA cache and performed garbage collection before each run.

The results revealed several significant patterns. On the RTX 3060, the loading time exhibits an approximately linear increase with model size, ranging from 1.29s for the 0.5B model to 4.45s for the 3B model. While TTFT follows a similar trend, the processing time is substantially lower, ranging from 0.051s to 0.145s. On the A40 GPU, despite observing longer loading times, TTFT is significantly reduced across all models, maintaining a remarkably consistent value regardless of model size. These findings indicate that while model loading remains more resource-intensive on our Linux setup, the inference performance benefits substantially from the A40's superior computational capabilities.
