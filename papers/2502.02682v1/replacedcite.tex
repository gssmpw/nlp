However, existing methods demand one should know the physics laws beforehand, which might not be feasible in many practical applications or complex systems. Our method offers a simple and effective framework, enabling the extraction of implicit physics laws directly from data, even when the data is scarce. Empirically, these pseudo physics laws have proven to be highly beneficial in enhancing the performance of operator learning, as demonstrated in Section \ref{sect:expr}. Many methods have been developed specifically for discovering differential equations from data, including SINDy____  and its variants____, PINN-SR____, Bayesian spline learning____, and kernel-based equation discovery____. To ensure interpretability, these approaches typically assume a specific equation form and perform sparse selection from a set of candidate operators. In contrast to these methods, which prioritize interpretability, our approach focuses on enhancing the prediction accuracy of operator learning under limited data. To this end, we utilize a black-box neural network to represent PDEs. While this offers greater flexibility, it comes at the cost of reduced interpretability. Our method employs an alternating update strategy to jointly refine the PDE representation and improve operator learning.


Our work is also related to the cycle consistence framework____ for image-to-image translation. A critical difference is that cycle-consistence performs \textit{unpaired} image-to-image translation, while our method aims for accurate paired translation (mapping). In cycle-consistence, the translation is viewed successfully as long as the translated images follow the target distribution. Hence, cycle-consistence has a much more relaxed objective. Another key difference is that our method aims to improve the learning of a function-to-function mapping with very limited data--- that motivates us to learn a ``pseudo'' physics representation. The cycle-consistence framework relies on adversarial training which typically requires a large amount of data to obtain successful learning outcomes.


 

%However, all the existing methods demand one should know the physics law beforehand, which might not be feasible in many practical applications or complex systems. Our method provides a simple and effective framework such that one can extract implicit physics laws outright from data (even when the data is sparse). These pseudo physics laws are shown empirically very helpful to improve the operator learning perofrmance (see Section \ref{sect:expr}).
