%% article.
\begin{abstract}
%   Virtual Reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) provide immersive experiences while limiting the user’s awareness of their physical surroundings. Video see-through (VST) HMDs address this by using outward-facing cameras to reconstruct the user's environment, creating an Augmented Reality (AR) experience. However, relying on video capture from HMD cameras for perception raises concerns about visual discomfort and cybersickness. Since the cameras are positioned outwards and are not located at the eye position, VST HMDs rely on complex image reprojection techniques to create a natural view from the user’s perspective. We first show that direct passthrough (i.e displaying the raw camera feed) leads to exaggerated movements and inaccurate object distances due to inaccurate depth information. Instead, estimating geometry and performing depth-based reprojection can help address these issues but may introduce additional latency and warping artifacts. Using fundamental principles, we discuss a structured approach to designing depth-based passthrough algorithms and introduce metrics to capture warping and perceived geometrical errors. We also design and conduct a user study across 24 participants to compare direct passthrough and depth-based passthrough. Our results demonstrate reduced nausea and disorientation symptoms with depth-based passthrough and uncover several potential avenues to further mitigate visually-induced discomfort.
Virtual Reality headsets isolate users from the real-world by restricting their perception to the virtual-world. Video See-Through
(VST) headsets address this by utilizing world-facing cameras to create Augmented Reality experiences. However, directly displaying
camera feeds causes visual discomfort and cybersickness due to the inaccurate perception of scale and exaggerated motion parallax.
This paper demonstrates the potential of geometry aware passthrough systems in mitigating cybersickness through accurate depth
perception. We first present a methodology to benchmark and compare passthrough algorithms. Furthermore, we design a protocol to
quantitatively measure cybersickness experienced by users in VST headsets. Using this protocol, we conduct a user study to compare
direct passthrough and geometry aware passthrough systems. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first one to reveal significantly reduced nausea, disorientation, and total scores of cybersickness with geometry aware passthrough. It also
uncovers several potential avenues to further mitigate visually-induced discomfort.

%   \caption{A typical Video See-Through Headset utilizes high resolution cameras to reveal the physical world to the user. However, due to hardware constraints, these cameras don't capture the same viewpoint as the user's eyes would see without the headset and directly showing camera-feed (direct passthrough) requires solving for disocclusion (1a). Moreover, this difference in viewpoints can also change the perceived objects scale and exaggerate their perceived motion depending on the distance to the cameras (1b). Therefore, geometry aware passthrough algorithms are needed for performing accurate view synthesis that minimizes such errors, and this paper presents metrics to evaluate the perceived object location and any warping induced due to imperfect depth estimation (1c). While these algorithms can improve the accuracy of reprojection, this paper proposes a comprehensive user study based on real-life AR applications and shows the significant impact of this reprojection on cybersickness.}
\caption{Video see-through headsets typically employ high resolution cameras to display the user's physical environment. However, due to inherent hardware limitations, the camera's perspective deviates from the user's natural viewpoint. Hence, directly displaying camera feeds (direct passthrough) can result in visual artifacts such as disocclusion (1a), inaccurate perception of object positions, and exaggerated motion parallax (1b). In this work, we demonstrate that geometry aware passthrough algorithms can circumvent these artifacts, enabling precise view synthesis tailored to the user's eyes. We present metrics for evaluating errors in perceived object location and warping artifacts arising from imperfect depth estimation, fundamental to a seamless passthrough experience (1c). Furthermore, a comprehensive user study is presented to investigate the impact of reprojection algorithms on cybersickness in real-world augmented reality scenarios, highlighting the significance of geometry aware passthrough systems (1d).}
  \Description{Paper Overview: Sub-figure (a) shows a passthrough headset and demonstrates the difference between eye and camera visibility. The difference in viewpoints creates a region of disocclusion where objects are not visible to the camera but visible to the eye. Sub-figure (b) shows three head positions and the corresponding image of a laptop as seen through eyes versus direct passthrough. Passthrough exaggerates motion. Sub-figure (c) demonstrates how we evaluate passthrough algorithms with different metrics. It shows the input image, ground truth depth, estimated depth, and error maps. These are used to calculate object location errors. It also shows a reference and passthrough image. These images are used to calculate warping errors. Sub-figure (d) represents our user study for evaluating cybersickness in VST. It visualizes the three tasks of typing (a person wearing a headset types on a laptop), navigation (a person wearing a headset navigates waypoints and collects cones), and interaction (puzzle). }
