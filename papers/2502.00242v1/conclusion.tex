This work presents several network energy-saving strategies by optimizing network resources at local and global levels during low-traffic or idle-mode operations in mm-Wave band. These solutions advance the literature on energy-efficient operation in 5G and beyond. Using the developed digital twin, our analysis demonstrates significant improvements in the energy and cost efficiency, as well as the sustainability, of telecommunication networks.
In the future, the proposed optimization and digital twin framework can be expanded to incorporate different objectives and support multiple levels of traffic load and multiple frequency layers.
