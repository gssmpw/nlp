A large set of works propose methods to more reliably find better prompts. Prompt engineering, e.g.\  \citet{liu2023pre,chen2023unleashing,marvin2023prompt,sahoo2024systematic,song2024communication}, can improve performance on many tasks by handcrafting prompts using intuitions from system design, search and planning, and empirical trial and error. Prompt optimization, e.g.\ \citet{pryzant2023automatic,wang2023promptagent,fernando2023promptbreeder,guo2023connecting}, instead employs variants of discrete optimization and search techniques.
%
Another approach for prompt optimization, particularly in agentic or robotic tasks, is to find the best set of demonstrations for in-context learning~\citep{dong2022survey}.

While much focus has been put on the performance of the resulting prompts, we do not know whether they are actually optimal. It has been challenging to \emph{interpret} the prompts by relating to the desired tasks, and to understand concretely why some prompts work better than others~\citep{webson2022prompt,daras2022discovering,murr2023testing,he2024does,chen2023many,battle2024unreasonable,anagnostidis2024susceptible}. These difficulties are exacerbated by the variations across architectures, pretraining mixtures, fine-tuning processes, and nuanced parameters that vary across publicly available LLMs~\citep{chen2023chatgpt}
%
This has led to the question why some prompts work better than others, despite no obvious difference to humans~\citep{kojima2022large,mizrahi2024state}, and why some prompts that are intuitively expected to work may disappoint~\citep{zamfirescu2023johnny,khurana2024and}. The unreliability and unintuitive nature of prompting have caused safety and ethical concerns~\citep{wei2024jailbroken,wu2023jailbreaking,xu2024comprehensive}.
