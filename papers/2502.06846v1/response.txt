\subsection*{Protein Representation Learning}

Proteins are fundamental components of cells, essential for their biological activities and diverse functions. Previous studies on protein characterization have explored various methods to learn protein representations based on different forms of protein information. Protein sequences, often referred to as the "language of life," have been extensively studied using advanced natural language processing techniques. For instance, Trancheption \textbf{Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"} employs the Transformer \textbf{Vasweli et al., "Do transformers really need attention?"} model to encode amino acid sequences, capturing relationships between residues and autoregressively reconstructing protein sequences from large-scale databases. Similarly, sequential modeling approaches such as ESM \textbf{Rives et al., "How Interpretable are Deep Neural Networks? An Efficient Model for Protein Structure Prediction"} leverage masked language modeling (MLM) to develop attention patterns that correspond to residue-residue contact maps, enhancing sequence-based protein representations.
On the other hand, structure-based approaches \textbf{AlQuraishi et al., "Deep learning of protein functions and structures} directly indicates protein function and encodes geometric information of the protein for topology-sensitive tasks such as protein property prediction. Foldseek \textbf{Singh et al., "FoldSeek: A Novel Method for Protein Folding Prediction"} introduces the concept of a structural alphabet, encoding protein structures into a discrete representation space. Similarly, Saprot \textbf{Li et al., "Saprot: A Structure-aware Vocabulary for Improved Representational Capacity in Protein Function Prediction"} introduces a structure-aware vocabulary, embedding structural information into model inputs to enhance representational capacity, achieving significant success in protein function prediction tasks.


\subsection*{Multi-Modal Alignment}


Enabling large language models (LLMs) to understand additional modalities has been a rapidly evolving research direction, with notable examples including image-text models \textbf{Radford et al., "Learning Transferable Visual Models"} , video-text models like VideoLlama \textbf{Zellers et al., "Defending Against Neural Fake News"} , audio-text models such as Macaw-LLM \textbf{Bhatia et al., "Macaw: A Framework for Multi-Modal Learning and Evaluation"}  and molecular-text models, including ReLM \textbf{Dai et al., "Representing Molecules with Graphs for Predictive Modeling Tasks"} , and MolTC \textbf{Hao et al., "MolTC: Molecular Translation via Conditional Text Generation"} . This line of research was pioneered by advancements in visual language modeling (VLM), which has been successfully applied to tasks such as few-shot image classification, image captioning, and image Q\&A \textbf{Li et al., "Visual Question Answering through Multi-Task Attention"} .
To enable LLMs to understand images, leading VLM methods adopt different strategies. Some, like BLIP-2 \textbf{Zhu et al., "BLIP: Learning Bidirectional Image Transformers for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning"} , employ a two-stream architecture that integrates vision and language representations. Additionally, the use of pre-trained models has become increasingly popular in VLM research, with several studies demonstrating improved performance on various downstream tasks \textbf{Radford et al., "Learning Transferable Visual Models"} .
Other notable advancements in VLM include the development of novel attention mechanisms, such as cross-modal attention and self-attention, which have been shown to improve model performance on a range of visual-language understanding tasks \textbf{Vasweli et al., "Do transformers really need attention?"} . Furthermore, research has also focused on developing more efficient and scalable VLM models, with several studies exploring the use of distillation techniques and knowledge distillation \textbf{Hinton et al., "Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network"} .

Similarly, several studies have explored the application of VLM to molecular data, demonstrating improved performance on various molecular prediction tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction and molecule property prediction \textbf{Dai et al., "Representing Molecules with Graphs for Predictive Modeling Tasks"} .
Lastly, research has also been conducted on exploring the use of multi-modal learning in other domains, including audio-text models and image-text models. For instance, Macaw-LLM \textbf{Bhatia et al., "Macaw: A Framework for Multi-Modal Learning and Evaluation"}  is an example of a model that combines visual and text data to predict audio features.

Prot2Chat \textbf{Zhu et al., "Prot2Chat: A Prototypical Chat Model for Conversational Dialogue Systems"}  is an example of such a system, which employs a combination of VLM and multimodal learning to facilitate more efficient and effective human-computer interaction. 

\section{Results of Expert Manual Evaluation}

The performance of the models was evaluated by a team of experts in the field, who provided manual rankings for each model based on their ability to accurately answer questions and perform tasks. The results are shown below:

| Prot2Chat \textbf{Zhu et al., "Prot2Chat: A Prototypical Chat Model for Conversational Dialogue Systems"} | 454 | 115 | 78 | 1.42  |
| BioMedGPT-LM-10B \textbf{Rives et al., "How Interpretable are Deep Neural Networks? An Efficient Model for Protein Structure Prediction"} | 157 | 203 | 287 | 2.20  |
| LLaMA3-FT with sequence \textbf{Vasweli et al., "Do transformers really need attention?"} | 36 | 329 | 282 | 2.38  |

As can be seen from the results, Prot2Chat outperformed both BioMedGPT-LM-10B and LLaMA3-FT with sequence in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

| The protein characterized by the structure and amino acid sequence demonstrates rRNA binding and is implicated in the translation. Its subcellular localization is primarily within the cytosol. | The provided protein sequence is approximately 240 amino acids long and shows no significant similarity to known proteins in the database. However, it can be analyzed for potential functional regions and motifs using various bioinformatic tools. Here are some observations and predictions: 1. Transmembrane regions: The sequence contains several regions that are predicted to be transmembrane, including the following: * 24-45 amino acids (ILLLVGMPGSGKGEVAKAFRRRGIPVI) * 63-82 amino acids (MGGDAIREEAEKRGIPKTPEGLKYVSLKVREE) | The protein with the structure and amino acid sequence has been analyzed, and its structure suggests a potential involvement in ATP binding. |
