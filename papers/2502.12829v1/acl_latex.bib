State-of-the-art machine learning models to automatise Kazakh named entity recognition were also built, with the best-performing model achieving an exact match F1-score of 97.22{\%} on the test set.

While state-of-the-art models are partially trained on large Arabic texts, evaluating their performance in Arabic remains challenging due to the limited availability of relevant datasets. To bridge this gap, we present ArabicMMLU, the first multi-task language understanding benchmark for the Arabic language, sourced from school exams across diverse educational levels in different countries spanning North Africa, the Levant, and the Gulf regions. Our data comprises 40 tasks and 14,575 multiple-choice questions in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and is carefully constructed by collaborating with native speakers in the region. Our comprehensive evaluations of 35 models reveal substantial room for improvement, particularly among the best open-source models. Notably, BLOOMZ, mT0, LLama2, and Falcon struggle to achieve a score of 50{\%}, while even the top-performing Arabic-centric model only achieves a score of 62.3{\%}."

In this work, we introduce IndoMMLU, the first multi-task language understanding benchmark for Indonesian culture and languages, which consists of questions from primary school to university entrance exams in Indonesia. By employing professional teachers, we obtain 14,981 questions across 64 tasks and education levels, with 46{\%} of the questions focusing on assessing proficiency in the Indonesian language and knowledge of nine local languages and cultures in Indonesia. Our empirical evaluations show that GPT-3.5 only manages to pass the Indonesian primary school level, with limited knowledge of local Indonesian languages and culture. Other smaller models such as BLOOMZ and Falcon perform at even lower levels."

In order to achieve this goal, we asked participants in a survey questionnaire to provide answers about health related topics. We used these answers to measure the health education status ofour participants. In this paper, we summarize the results from our NLP-application on the participants' answers. In the first experiment, we use embeddings-based tools to measure the semantic similarity between participants' answers and {\textquotedblleft}expert{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}reference{\textquotedblright} answers. In the second experiment, we use synonym-based methods to classify answers under topics. We compare the results from both experiments with human annotations. Our results show that the tested NLP-methods reach a significantly lower accuracy score than human annotations in both experiments. We explain this difference by the assumption that human annotators are much better in pragmatic inferencing necessary to classify the semantic similarity and topic classification of answers."
