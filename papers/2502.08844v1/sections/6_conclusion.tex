\section{Conclusion}

MuJoCo Playground is a library built upon the open-source MuJoCo simulator and Madrona batch renderer with implementations across several reinforcement learning and robotics environments. We demonstrate policy training on various GPU topologies using JAX and pytorch-based reinforcement learning libraries. We also demonstrate sim-to-real deployment on several robotic tasks and embodiments, from locomotion to both dexterous and non-prehensile manipulation from proprioceptive state and from pixels. We look forward to seeing the community put this resource to use in advancing robotics research and its applications.
