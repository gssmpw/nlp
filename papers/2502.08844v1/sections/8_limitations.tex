\section{Limitations}

MuJoCo Playground inherits the \href{https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html#mjx-the-sharp-bits}{limitations of MJX} due to constraints imposed by JAX. First, just-in-time (JIT) compilation can be slow (1-3 minutes on Playground's tasks). Second, computation time related to contacts does not scale like the number of \emph{active} contacts in the scene, but like the number of \emph{possible} contacts in the scene. This is due to JAX's requirement of static shapes at compile time. This limitation can be overcome by using more flexible frameworks like Warp~\cite{macklin2022warp} and Taichi~\cite{Genesis}. This upgrade is an active area of development. Finally we should note that the vision-based training using Madrona is still at an early stage.
