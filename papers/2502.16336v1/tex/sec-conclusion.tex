We present a new approach to improve the conditional coverage of the conformal prediction set while preserving marginal convergence.
Our method constructs prediction sets by adjusting the conformity scores using an appropriately defined conditional quantile, allowing \RCP\ to automatically adapt the prediction sets against heteroscedasticity.
Our theoretical analysis supports that this approach produces approximately conditionally valid prediction sets; furthermore, the theory provides lower bounds on the conditional coverage, which explicitly depends on the distribution of the conditional quantile estimator $\widehat{\tau}(x)$.
