This work contributes to the broader effort to improve the interpretability and statistical reliability of machine learning algorithms. Prediction intervals with exact marginal and approximate conditional coverage offer a useful tool for conveying uncertainty regarding the accuracy of ML models, which is essential for increasing their fairness, and fostering wider acceptance.

%This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.
