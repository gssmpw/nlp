 \todo[inline]{Combine the two examples}

  \begin{example}
  \label{ex:running-example}
    Consider a 1-dimensional regression  problem with heteroscedastic noise, where the conditional distribution of \(Y \mid X = x\) is given by \(\mu(x) + \sigma(x) Z\), with \(Z\) independent of \(X\). In this setting, the standard deviation-adjusted score function \(\tilde{V}(x, y) = \frac{|y - \pred(x)|}{\sigma(x)}\) can be employed. Notably, the conditional distribution of \(\tilde{V}(X, Y) | X=x \) does not depend on $x$, ensuring that the score function is independent of the conditional mean and variance structure of the data.
  \end{example}

 \begin{example}[revisited]
    We reformulate \Cref{ex:running-example} within the proposed framework. In this case, the standard score function \(V(x, y) = |y - \pred(x)|\) can be employed, with \(\adj{t}(v) = \tilde{f}_v(t) = vt\) and \(\varphi = 1\). Under this setup, we have \(\tilde{f}_\varphi(t) = \tilde{f}_\varphi^{-1}(t) = t\), resulting in \(\tilde{V}_\varphi(x, y) = V(x, y)\). Using~\eqref{eq:definition-tau}, it follows that 
    \[
      \tau(x) = \sigma(x) Q_{1-\alpha}(P_{|Z|}),
    \]
    where \(P_{|Z|}\) denotes the distribution of \(|Z|\).  With these definitions, we verify that:
    \begin{align*}
      &\prob(Y \in \mc{C}_{\alpha}^*(X) \mid X = x) \stackrel{(a)}{=} \prob(V(X, Y) \leq \tau(X) | X=x) \\
      &\quad \stackrel{(b)}{=} \prob(|Z| \leq Q_{1-\alpha}(P_{|Z|})) \stackrel{(c)}{\geq} 1-\alpha,
    \end{align*}
    where \((a)\) follows from the definition of \(\mc{C}_{\alpha}^*(x)\), \((b)\) from the definition of \(\tau(x)\), and \((c)\) from the definition of the quantile. Note that the choice of $\varphi$ in this case is arbitrary. The choice for another value of $\varphi > 0$ will not affect the definition of $\mc{C}_{\alpha}^*(x)$. This is the case for most of the examples considered below.
