\section{Conclusion}
We introduced a Neural Preconditioning Operator (NPO) for large-scale PDE solvers, integrating neural attention mechanisms with classical algebraic multigrid (NAMG) to address both high- and low-frequency errors. Theoretical analysis confirms that NAMG inherits two-grid convergence guarantees, ensuring rapid error reduction independent of problem size, while spectral analysis shows eigenvalue clustering near 1 for faster convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NPO outperforms traditional preconditioners and existing neural operators across varying domains, resolutions, and PDE types.

Several promising directions remain open. First, we plan to expand NPO through \textbf{adaptive parameterization}, allowing the framework to cope with rapidly changing PDE coefficients or boundary conditions by leveraging online or continual learning. Another key direction involves \textbf{multilevel neural architectures}, where deeper or more sophisticated attention-based models can be deployed at each grid level for improved coarse-grid representations. We also aim to explore \textbf{parallel and distributed implementations}, bringing NPO into high-performance computing environments to handle extremely large grids efficiently. 

We envision that progress in these areas will broaden the impact of neural operators in multigrid methods, enhancing both efficiency and scalability for next-generation PDE solvers.
