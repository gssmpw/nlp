The Hyperledger Fabric platform has been extensively discussed in previous research, focusing on performance metrics.
This paper seeks to update the state of the art and fill gaps left by existing studies.

In **Sukhwani et al., "Quantifying the Performance Impact of Hyperledger Fabric Components"**, we introduced models to assess the use of computational resources in the context of HLF.
Using Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) and Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs), we demonstrated the effectiveness of these formalisms in modeling and evaluating HLF-based applications, particularly in detecting infrastructure bottlenecks.
However, the model proposed in this paper extends the scope of the previous work, assessing metrics such as throughput and transaction latency not addressed by previously proposed models.

In other studies like **Jiang et al., "Hierarchical Modeling Approach for Hyperledger Fabric 1.4"**, the authors modeled general system performance metrics from the perspective of HLF.
**Wu et al., "Queue Theory-Based Model for Hyperledger Fabric 2.0"**__**Ke and Park, "Queue Models for Hyperledger Fabric with Different Service Rates"**
Whereas **Wu et al., "Queue Theory-Based Model for Hyperledger Fabric 2.0"**__**Ke and Park, "Queue Models for Hyperledger Fabric with Different Service Rates"**

Finally, in other works like **Yuan et al., "Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets for Hyperledger Fabric"**, the authors evaluated the influence of arrival rates and block sizes on HLF throughput and latency. Still, as we will see in the present work, these are not the only factors significantly impacting these metrics.
Furthermore, in **Sukhwani et al., "Quantifying the Performance Impact of Hyperledger Fabric Components"**__**Jiang et al., "Hierarchical Modeling Approach for Hyperledger Fabric 1.4"**, the authors modeled the platform using Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPN). In contrast, in **Ke and Park, "Queue Models for Hyperledger Fabric with Different Service Rates"**, the authors used Stochastic Reward Networks (SRN); both models are isomorphic to the SPNs presented in this work, that is, they have the same symbolic power; however, they do not contemplate the transaction flow for more recent versions of HLF.

This work extends those studies, especially directly extends our previous work **Sukhwani et al., "Quantifying the Performance Impact of Hyperledger Fabric Components"**, by presenting an SPN model for the Hyperledger Fabric platform, focusing on the HLF 2.5+ version addressing the concept of the gateway and the possibility of it being a single point of failure and a pre-platform bottleneck.
% The methodology proposed in developing this work includes a formal validation and bottleneck identification in the proposed model, increasing the practical relevance of the findings through case studies.
