%\section{Biography Section}
%If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
% your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
% simpler here.)

%\bf{If you include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
%\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{fig1}}]{Michael Shell}
%Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiography\}}} and then for the 1st argument use %$\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} to declare and link the author photo.
%Use the author name as the 3rd argument followed by the biography text.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

%\bf{If you will not include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiographynophoto\}}} and the author name as the argument followed by the %biography text.
