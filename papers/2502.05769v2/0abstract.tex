Urban digital twins are virtual replicas of cities that use multi-source data and data analytics to optimize urban planning, infrastructure management, and decision-making. Towards this, we propose a framework focused on the single-building scale. By connecting to cloud mapping platforms such as Google Map Platforms APIs, by leveraging state-of-the-art multi-agent Large Language Models data analysis using ChatGPT(4o) and Deepseek-V3/R1, and by using our Gaussian Splatting-based mesh extraction pipeline, our Digital Twin Buildings framework can retrieve a building's 3D model, visual descriptions, and achieve cloud-based mapping integration with large language model-based data analytics using a building's address, postal code, or geographic coordinates.
