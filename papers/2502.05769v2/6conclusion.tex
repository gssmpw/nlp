\section{Conclusion}
We have presented Digital Twin Buildings, a framework for extracting the 3D mesh of a building, for connecting the building to Google Maps Platform APIs, and for Multi-Agent Large Language Models data analytics. We demonstrate this by extracting visual description keywords and captions of the building from multi-view multi-scale images of the building. The framework can also be used to process different data modalities sourced from Google Cloud Services. This approach enables richer semantic understanding, seamless integration with geospatial data, and enhanced interaction with real-world structures, paving the way for advanced applications in urban analytics, navigation, and virtual environments.
