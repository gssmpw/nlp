\section{Introduction}
\input{pipeline}
In this manuscript, we present Digital Twin Building (DTB), a framework which allows for the extraction of the 3D mesh model of a building, along with Cloud Mapping Service Integration and Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLM) for data analysis. In the scope of this paper, we use the framework to retrieve Gaussian Splatting models and 3D mesh models. We also retrieve fundamental geocoding information, mapping information and 2D images, and perform visual analysis on the 2D images using the Multi-Agent LLM module. This is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:framework}.

Depending on need, the Google Maps Platform Integration can also retrieve local elevation maps, real-time traffic data, air quality data and access other data sources and services, which can then be analyzed. 

Our contributions are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce Digital Twin Building (DTB), a framework for extracting 3D mesh models of buildings. We integrate Cloud Mapping services for retrieving geocoding, mapping information, and 2D images.
    \item We designed a Multi-Agent Large Language Models (LLM) module for data analysis.
    \item We performed extensive visual analysis experiments of multi-view/multi-scale images of the building of interest using the LLM module. We also assessed the performance of the popular ChatGPT(4o/mini) and Deepseek-V3/R1 models.
\end{itemize}
