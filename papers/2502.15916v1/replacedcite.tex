The growing demand for speech data sets in underrepresented languages has driven various resource creation efforts. This section reviews existing community-centered initiatives and African speech datasets.

Multiple projects have aimed to address resource gaps in African languages through community involvement. ____ introduced the Oshiwambo data set project, which created more than 5000 sentences in the Oshindonga dialect along with their English translations. This participatory and cost-effective approach highlighted the potential for collaborative resource creation in underrepresented African languages, but they were not able to release the dataset due to the lack of an African-centered data license that would benefit the data creators ____. Similarly, AfroDigit presented the first audio digit dataset in 38 African languages enabling speech recognition applications such as telephone and street number recognition ____. BibleTTS provides 86 hours of high-fidelity Bible recordings in 10 African languages____, and AfricanVoices focuses on collecting high-quality speech datasets for African languages while also providing speech synthesizers____. AfriSpeech-200 extends these efforts by providing a 200-hour pan-African speech corpus for English-accented ASR in the clinical and general domains~ ____. Meanwhile, Kencorpus features 5.6 million words and 177 hours of speech of 3 Kenyan languages; Swahili, Dholuo, and Luhya____.

Several datasets have been developed to increase ASR resources for isiXhosa. ____ collected a spontaneous monolingual corpus of isiXhosa and five other South African languages. This data, sourced from first-language speakers via an annotated telephone-based database. Although this work demonstrated the potential of African language resources, its scale and scope were limited. ____ captured linguistic diversity of isiXhosa by emphasizing the importance of including regional accents and tonal variations. Lastly, ____ curated a multilingual dataset of four South African languages, including isiXhosa, in a code-mixed setting with English. This resource advanced acoustic modeling and multilingual ASR systems ____, demonstrating the potential of code-mixed datasets. However, its scope remained task-specific, limiting its utility for downstream applications.
