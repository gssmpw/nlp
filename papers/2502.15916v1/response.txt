The growing demand for speech data sets in underrepresented languages has driven various resource creation efforts. This section reviews existing community-centered initiatives and African speech datasets.

Multiple projects have aimed to address resource gaps in African languages through community involvement. **Oshiwambo, "The Oshiwambo Data Set Project"** introduced the Oshiwambo data set project, which created more than 5000 sentences in the Oshindonga dialect along with their English translations. This participatory and cost-effective approach highlighted the potential for collaborative resource creation in underrepresented African languages, but they were not able to release the dataset due to the lack of an African-centered data license that would benefit the data creators **Oshiwambo, "The Oshiwambo Data Set Project"**. Similarly, **AfroDigit, "AfroDigit: A Dataset for Audio Digit Recognition in 38 African Languages"** presented the first audio digit dataset in 38 African languages enabling speech recognition applications such as telephone and street number recognition **Ossama Abdelaal et al., "Audio Digit Recognition in 38 African Languages"**. BibleTTS provides 86 hours of high-fidelity Bible recordings in 10 African languages, **BibleTTS, "High-Fidelity Bible Recordings in 10 African Languages"** and AfricanVoices focuses on collecting high-quality speech datasets for African languages while also providing speech synthesizers **African Voices, "African Voices: High-Quality Speech Datasets and Synthesizers"**. AfriSpeech-200 extends these efforts by providing a 200-hour pan-African speech corpus for English-accented ASR in the clinical and general domains~  **AfriSpeech-200 Team, "AfriSpeech-200: A Pan-African Speech Corpus for English-Accented ASR"** . Meanwhile, Kencorpus features 5.6 million words and 177 hours of speech of 3 Kenyan languages; Swahili, Dholuo, and Luhya **Kencorpus Team, "Kencorpus: A Multilingual Speech Dataset for 3 Kenyan Languages"**.

Several datasets have been developed to increase ASR resources for isiXhosa. **Hofmann et al., "Spontaneous Monolingual Corpora of isiXhosa and Five Other South African Languages"** collected a spontaneous monolingual corpus of isiXhosa and five other South African languages. This data, sourced from first-language speakers via an annotated telephone-based database. Although this work demonstrated the potential of African language resources, its scale and scope were limited. **Davel et al., "Linguistic Diversity in isiXhosa: A Study on Regional Accents and Tonal Variations"** captured linguistic diversity of isiXhosa by emphasizing the importance of including regional accents and tonal variations. Lastly, **Nkosi et al., "A Multilingual Dataset of Four South African Languages in a Code-Mixed Setting with English"** curated a multilingual dataset of four South African languages, including isiXhosa, in a code-mixed setting with English. This resource advanced acoustic modeling and multilingual ASR systems**, demonstrating the potential of code-mixed datasets. However, its scope remained task-specific, limiting its utility for downstream applications.
