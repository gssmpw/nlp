\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposed the \textbf{D}\textbf{e}li\textbf{b}er\textbf{a}te \textbf{T}hinking based Dens\textbf{e} \textbf{R}etriever (\method{}), a novel method designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based dense retrievers via deliberation-augmented embedding. 
Through the integration of Chain-of-Deliberation (CoD) and Self Distillation (SD), \method{} significantly improves retrieval performance by capturing different views of documents before generating final embeddings. 
Our experimental results demonstrate that \method{} outperforms existing dense retrievers by implementing with the LLM of a smaller scale.
