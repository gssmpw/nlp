    We train an RL policy to open doors and drawers in simulation that adapts its action according to the motion of objects by leveraging history observations (left). We directly transfer this policy to reach 80\% joint limit in the real world with closed-loop variable impedance control and achieve 84\% success rate, using only one first-frame RGBD image (right).
