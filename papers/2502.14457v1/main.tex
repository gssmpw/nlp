\section{CONCLUSIONS}
In this work, we introduce a novel RL framework equipped with variable impedance control for end-to-end articulated object manipulation, which adaptively learns the object movement from observation and action history instead of naively executing a trajectory predicted before any robot-object contact. We demonstrate great sim-to-real transfer capability on diverse test objects in the real world and achieve 80\% and 84\% success rate for OpenDoor+ and OpenDrawer+ tasks, respectively, outperforming all existing works. Along with quantitative results, our policy can generate smooth and dexterous motion thanks to our well-designed training settings and reward functions. We hope our work can suggest an alternative way to leverage vision information, as well as other potential modalities (e.g. tactile grasp signal), to better bridge the sim-to-real gap for future RL-based manipulation works.

                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.

                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
