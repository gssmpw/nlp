\section{Demographics}
\label{xhw_study::app::demographics}
%See \autoref{xhw_study::tab::demographics} for the demographics of our 250 participants, consisting of gender, age, highest level of education, prior practical experience with microchips, and affinity for technology interaction~\cite{franke2019personal}.

    \label{xhw_study::tab::demographics}
    \Description{The table provides demographic information and is split into two major columns, each comprising three sub-columns. The first row spans both major columns and reads "Demographics (n=250)". Next, in the left major column, the "Gender" and "Age" demographics are provided. "Gender" comprises a header row and five content rows. The header row only spans minor columns 2 and 3 and says "n" and "\%". The next five rows give numbers for "Male", "Female", and "Non-binary" participants, as well as those that chose "Describe yourself" or "No answer". Following the same structure, the "Age" demographics are described using a header row and seven content rows. The header row only spans minor columns 2 and 3 and says "n" and "\%". The next seven rows give numbers for the age brackets from "18-24" up to "65 and older", as well as "No answer". The first demographic in the right major column (starting at minor column 4) is "Education", comprising a header row and nine content rows. The header row only spans minor columns 5 and 6 and says "n" and "\%". The next nine rows give numbers for the different levels of education from "High school or equivalent" to "Doctoral degree", as well as "No answer". Next, the "Prior Experience" demographics are provided, comprising a header row and three content rows. The header row only spans minor columns 5 and 6 and says "n" and "\%". The next three rows give numbers for participants that responded with "Yes", "No", as well as "No answer". Finally, a row describing the participants' "ATI" score spans the entire table across both major columns. It comprises a single row and reads (from left to right) "ATI", "mean", "4.05", "sd", and "0.91".}

    \label{xhw_study::tab::detailed_regression_information}
    \Description{The table is organized in six columns. In the first column on the left, the predictors for multilevel regression analysis are given. Each of the other five major columns provides details on a type of information about microchips, starting with "which functionality" on the left and ending with "how manufactured" on the right. Each row of the five major columns gives the Estimate ("Est.") for one predictor. Here, "*" means p<0.05, "**" means p<0.01, and "***" means p<0.001, and respective entries are highlighted in boldface. Next, the intercept of regression analysis is given for each kind of information. Next, a sub-header spanning the entire table titled "interactions (baseline=car x ethical standards)" opens the section with the analysis results for the interactions between settings and desiderata. The estimates for these interactions are given in the next 24 rows. In the next section, the first row is titled "desire to understand more about microchips" and lists respective estimates. The second and final row of this section is titled "ATI score" and lists respective estimates. Finally, in the last section of the table, the first row lists results for "marginal R^2" and the second row "conditional R^2".}
