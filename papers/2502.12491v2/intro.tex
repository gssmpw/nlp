\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\paragraph{Secure key leasing.}
Encryption with secure key leasing (SKL) enables a secret key holder to generate a quantum decryption key and lease it securely to another party.
Once the lessee returns the quantum decryption key, they lose their ability to decrypt ciphertexts.
Since its introduction by Kitagawa and Nishimaki for secret key functional encryption (SKFE)~\cite{AC:KitNis22}, SKL has been extensively studied~\cite{EC:AKNYY23,TCC:AnaPorVai23,EPRINT:CGJL23,EPRINT:MorPorYam23,TCC:AnaHuHua24,EC:BGKMRR24,myEPRINT:KitMorYam24} due to its strong security guarantee and practical applications.

\paragraph{Collusion-resistant SKL.}
Most prior works~\cite{EC:AKNYY23,TCC:AnaPorVai23,EPRINT:CGJL23,EPRINT:MorPorYam23,TCC:AnaHuHua24} study how to achieve public-key encryption (PKE) with SKL schemes from standard cryptographic assumptions. All prior works on PKE-SKL have explored the setting where an adversary can obtain \emph{only one} quantum decryption key.
However, this single-key security model does not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. In practice, once a lessee returns their decryption key and it is verified (i.e., after revocation), the lessor may lease another decryption key, even to the same lessee. Moreover, in realistic settings, a single secret key holder may need to generate and lease \emph{multiple} quantum decryption keys to various entities. To accurately capture this setting, we consider adversaries capable of obtaining \emph{an unbounded number of quantum decryption keys}, even in the standard PKE setting.
We define this model as \emph{collusion-resistant} SKL.

Previous works~\cite{TCC:AnaPorVai23,TCC:AnaHuHua24} presented delegation tasks as a compelling application like the following:
Consider a scenario where a system administrator unexpectedly needs to take leave and must temporarily assign their responsibilities---including access to encrypted data---to a colleague by providing decryption keys.
In such cases, the single-key security model is inadequate, as the administrator may need to take leave multiple times or assign their responsibilities to different colleagues.
Another potential application of collusion-resistant PKE-SKL is in streaming services.
Encrypted videos are made accessible to subscribers through quantum decryption keys.
When a user unsubscribes, they return their leased keys, losing access to the content, and their subscription fees are canceled. By utilizing an attribute-based encryption~\cite{EC:SahWat05} variant of collusion-resistant PKE-SKL, it becomes possible to precisely control video access based on user attributes, such as location-restrictions or premium and basic subscription plans.

\paragraph{Our goal: collusion-resistant SKL from weaker assumptions.}
The notion of collusion-resistant SKL is both natural and compelling. However, it has yet to be achieved from well-established assumptions.  
All known PKE with SKL schemes based on standard assumptions~\cite{EC:AKNYY23,TCC:AnaPorVai23,EPRINT:CGJL23,TCC:AnaHuHua24,myEPRINT:KitMorYam24} do not remain secure in the collusion-resistant setting.  
While some existing constructions seem to imply collusion-resistant SKL, such as public-key functional encryption (PKFE) schemes with SKL~\cite{EC:AKNYY23,EC:BGKMRR24} and collusion-resistant single decryptor encryption (SDE)\footnote{In short, SDE is PKE where the decryption keys are copy-protected (i.e., unclonable). In general, SDE implies encryption with SKL (see the discussion by Agrawal et al.~\cite{EC:AKNYY23} for details).}~\cite{TCC:CakGoy24}, they rely on strong assumptions. These include post-quantum secure indistinguishability obfuscation (IO) or collusion-resistant PKFE, which in turn implies IO, albeit with a sub-exponential security loss~\cite{JACM:BitVai18,C:AnaJai15,EPRINT:AnaJaiSah15a}. Achieving them from well-established assumptions still remains elusive.
In this work, we aim to construct the first collusion-resistant SKL schemes based on weaker assumptions.

%Achieving post-quantum secure IO (or collusion-resistant PKFE) from well-founded assumptions is a big open problem.
% Agrawal et al.'s PKFE with SKL scheme can be instantiated with bounded collusion-resistant (standard) PKFE, which standard PKE implies. However, that instantiation is secure in the \emph{bounded} collusion-resistant setting.

%\paragraph{Single-decryptor encryption.}
%A closely related notion to SKL is single-decryptor encryption (SDE), where the decryption keys are copy-protected (i.e., unclonable). In general, SDE implies encryption with SKL (see the discussion by Agrawal et al.~\cite{EC:AKNYY23} for details).
%\c{C}akan and Goyal~\cite{TCC:CakGoy24} constructed public-key SDE and SDFE schemes with fully collusion-resistant copy-protected keys from subexponetially secure IO, OWFs, and LWE. That is, they consider security against adversaries that receive many quantum decryption keys.
%
%As we see above, all previous works that achieve PKE with collusion-resistant SKL require IO (or collusion-resistant PKFE), which we want to avoid. In this work, our goal is to achieve PKE and attribute-based encryption (ABE) with \emph{collusion-resistant SKL} from \emph{weaker} assumptions.


\subsection{Our Results}
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Definition of collusion-resistant PKE-SKL (PKE-CR-SKL):} We formally define PKE-CR-SKL, ensuring that if all quantum decryption keys are returned and successfully verified, users lose decryption capabilities. We extend the indistinguishability against key leasing attacks (IND-KLA) security definition~\cite{EC:AKNYY23} to the collusion-resistant setting. One notable feature of this definition is that the adversary can send multiple queries to the verification oracle, which confirms the validity of returned decryption keys. Another important feature is that the public key and ciphertext size are independent of the number of leased decryption keys (up to logarithmic factors).
 % These features are important in the collusion-resistant setting since many lessees return quantum decryption keys.

    \item \emph{Construction of IND-KLA secure PKE with collusion-resistant SKL:} We propose an IND-KLA secure PKE-CR-SKL scheme based on the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.

     \item \emph{Attribute-based encryption with collusion-resistant SKL:} We construct an ABE-CR-SKL scheme, also based on the LWE assumption. Since PKE is a special case of ABE, ABE-CR-SKL trivially implies PKE-CR-SKL. We first present the PKE-CR-SKL scheme separately to provide a clearer foundation for understanding the ABE-CR-SKL construction.

     \item \emph{PKE and ABE with collusion-resistant SKL and
         classical certificates:} We also propose an IND-KLA secure
         ABE-CR-SKL scheme that utilizes \emph{classical} certificates, whereas the constructions above rely on quantum
         certificates.\footnote{Quantum decryption keys function as quantum certificates.} In this model, a classical certificate can be derived from a leased quantum decryption key, and successful verification guarantees security. Our scheme is based on multi-input ABE (MI-ABE), which is a potentially weaker assumption than collusion-resistant PKFE. We specify required properties for MI-ABE and discuss the relationship between MI-ABE and other primitives in \cref{sec:def-mi-abe}. ABE-CR-SKL with classical certificates trivially implies PKE-CR-SKL with classical certificates.
\end{enumerate}

We introduce fascinating techniques to achieve our results. These
include the classical decryption property and the notion of key-testability for secret key encryption with collusion-resistant SKL (SKE-CR-SKL) and secret key functional encryption with collusion-resistant SKL (SKFE-CR-SKL). Then, we transform SKE-CR-SKL (resp. SKFE-CR-SKL) into PKE-CR-SKL (resp. ABE-CR-SKL) by using classical ABE and compute-and-compare obfuscation~\cite{FOCS:WicZir17,FOCS:GoyKopWat17}. In these transformations, we use decryption keys of SKE-CR-SKL (resp. SKFE-CR-SKL) as key attributes of ABE in a superposition way.
See~\cref{sec:technical_overview} for the details.

\subsection{Related Work}\label{sec:related_work}
\paragraph{Encryption with SKL.}
Agrawal et al.~\cite{EC:AKNYY23} presented PKE-SKL, ABE-SKL, and PKFE-SKL schemes.
Their PKE-SKL scheme is based on standard PKE, and its certificate is quantum. This scheme is not collusion-resistant.
Their ABE-SKL scheme is based on PKE-SKL and standard (collusion-resistant) ABE, and its certificates are ones of the underlying PKE-SKL.
This scheme is bounded collusion-resistant, that is, the adversary can
obtain an a-priori bounded number of quantum decryption keys that can decrypt target ciphertexts.
Their PKFE-SKL scheme is based on PKE-SKL and standard (collusion-resistant) PKFE, and its certificates are ones of the underlying PKE-SKL.
This scheme is collusion-resistant. (If we instantiate the PKFE-SKL scheme with bounded collusion-resistant PKFE, the scheme is bounded collusion-resistant with respect to both standard PKFE and SKL.)
All schemes mentioned above are secure in the presence of the verification oracle for certificates.

Bartusek et al.~\cite{EC:BGKMRR24} also presented a PKFE-SKL scheme.
Their scheme is collusion-resistant in the selective model, where the target plaintext is declared at the beginning of the game. In addition, their certificates are classical and publicly verifiable. However, their scheme relies on IO.

Ananth, Poremba, and Vaikuntanathan~\cite{TCC:AnaPorVai23} presented a PKE-SKL scheme with classical certificates based on the LWE assumption and an unproven conjecture.
Since the encryption algorithm of this scheme is essentially the same as the Dual-Regev PKE scheme~\cite{STOC:GenPeiVai08}\nikhil{Needs citation?}\ryo{done.}, their scheme achieves fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) with SKL. Later, Ananth, Hu, and Huang~\cite{TCC:AnaHuHua24} present a new security analysis for Ananth et al.'s scheme and removed the conjecture.
Chardouvelis, Goyal, Jain, and Liu~\cite{EPRINT:CGJL23} presented a PKE-SKL scheme with classical certificates based on the LWE assumption. Their scheme is based on the Regev PKE scheme~\cite{JACM:Regev09}\nikhil{Needs citation?}\ryo{done.}, so it also achieves FHE with SKL. In addition, their scheme also achieves classical communication, where all messages between senders and receivers are classical.
Kitagawa, Morimae, and Yamakawa~\cite{myEPRINT:KitMorYam24} presented
a PKE-SKL scheme with classical certificates based on PKE.
These three works do not achieve collusion resistance.
Ananth et al.~\cite{TCC:AnaPorVai23,TCC:AnaHuHua24} and Chardouvelis et al.~\cite{EPRINT:CGJL23} do not consider the verification oracle in their security definitions, while Kitagawa et al.~\cite{myEPRINT:KitMorYam24} does.\footnote{More precisely, the work considers adversaries that receive a verification key after they output a valid certificate. Kitagawa et al. show that their scheme can be converted to satisfy IND-KLA by Agrawal et al.~\cite{EC:AKNYY23}.}
We summarize the works on encryption with SKL in~\cref{tbl:comparison_PKE-SKL}.

\paragraph{Secure software leasing.}
Ananth and La Placa~\cite{EC:AnaLaP21} introduced secure software
leasing, which encodes classical programs into quantum programs that
we can securely lease. We can view SKL as secure software leasing for
decryption functions. However, previous works on secure software
leasing consider a sub-class of evasive
functions~\cite{EC:AnaLaP21,ARXIV:ColMajPor20,TCC:KitNisYam21,TCC:BJLPS21}
or PRFs~\cite{TCC:KitNisYam21}, which do not support decryption
functions. Moreover, they consider a weak security model in which
pirated programs use \emph{honest} evaluation
algorithms~\cite{EC:AnaLaP21,TCC:KitNis23,TCC:BJLPS21} or rely on the
quantum random oracle model~\cite{ARXIV:ColMajPor20}. Bartusek et
al.~\cite{EC:BGKMRR24} achieve secure software leasing supporting all
differing inputs circuits\footnote{Roughly speaking, a pair of
circuits $(C_0,C_1)$ is differing input if it is hard to find an input
$y$ such that $C_0(y)\ne C_1(y)$.} in a strong security model where
pirated programs can use arbitrary evaluation algorithms. However, their scheme relies on IO.



\paragraph{Multi-input ABE.}
Roughly speaking, MI-ABE is ABE that can support multiple ciphertext-attributes (or multiple key-attributes).
To achieve our classical certificates scheme, we need MI-ABE for polynomial-size circuits where the number of slots is polynomial, and we can generate ciphertexts for one slot using a public key. See~\cref{def:miabe} for the definition.
However, as we review previous works on MI-ABE for general circuits\footnote{Francati, Fior, Malavolta, and Venturi~\cite{EC:FFMV23} and Agrawal, Tomida, and Yadav~\cite{C:AgrTomYad23} proposed MI-ABE for restricted functionalities.} below, none of them achieves what we need without using IO.\footnote{IO implies multi-input functional encryption~\cite{EC:GGGJKL14}, which implies MI-ABE.}

Agrawal, Yadav, and Yamada~\cite{C:AgrYadYam22} proposed \emph{two-input} ABE for polynomial-size circuits based on lattices. However, the scheme is heuristic (no reduction-based security proof) and needs a master \emph{secret key to generate ciphertexts for all slots}.
Agrawal, Rossi, Yadav, and Yamada~\cite{C:ARYY23} proposed MI-ABE for
$\NCone$ from the evasive LWE assumption and MI-ABE for
polynomial-size circuits from the evasive LWE and tensor LWE
assumptions. Their scheme allows to generate ciphertexts for one slot using a public key. However, the number of slots is \emph{constant}.
Agrawal, Kumari, and Yamada~\cite{myEPRINT:AgrKumYam24a} proposed MI-ABE\footnote{Precisely speaking, their scheme is predicate encryption, which satisfies privacy for attributes.} for polynomial-size circuits based on the evasive LWE assumption.
In their scheme, the number of slots is polynomial. However, we need a master \emph{secret key to generate ciphertexts for all input-attributes}.

\paragraph{Broadcast encryption.}
Broadcast encryption~\cite{C:FiaNao93} enables a sender to generate ciphertexts intended for a specific subset of users.
Only the designated users can decrypt the ciphertexts, while even if all other users collude, they cannot recover the message. A key performance metric for broadcast encryption is the size of the public key and ciphertexts.
Several works have proposed optimal broadcast encryption schemes, where these sizes are $\poly(\log{N})$ and $N$ is the total number of users.
The constructions by Agrawal and Yamada~\cite{EC:AgrYam20} and Agrawal, Wichs, and Yamada~\cite{TCC:AgrWicYam20} rely on the LWE assumption and \emph{pairings}, which are not post-quantum secure. The construction by Wee~\cite{EC:Wee22} relies on the \emph{evasive LWE assumption}, which is a non-falsifiable assumption and has known counterexamples~\cite{AC:BrzUnaWoo24}. The construction by Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan~\cite{ITCS:BraVai22} relies on \emph{heuristics} and lacks a reduction-based proof.

While broadcast encryption is particularly well-suited for streaming services, PKE-CR-SKL can also be applied in this domain. Each approach has its own advantages and limitations. One advantage of broadcast encryption is that it allows the sender to specify recipients at the encryption phase, whereas PKE-CR-SKL does not.
However, PKE-CR-SKL offers three notable advantages over optimal broadcast encryption.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Efficient revocation:} Since decryption keys in broadcast encryption are classical, the system requires maintaining a revocation list, which senders use to revoke users, whereas PKE-CR-SKL eliminates the need for such lists.
    \item \textbf{Seamless user expansion:} In broadcast encryption, the user set is fixed during the setup phase, meaning that adding new users requires updating the encryption key. In contrast, PKE-CR-SKL allows new users to be added without requiring any key updates.
    \item \textbf{Weaker cryptographic assumptions:} Our PKE-CR-SKL scheme is based on the standard LWE assumption, whereas post-quantum secure optimal broadcast encryption relies on the evasive LWE assumption, which has counterexamples~\cite{AC:BrzUnaWoo24}.
\end{enumerate}
In terms of  asymptotic efficiency, both optimal broadcast encryption and PKE-CR-SKL achieve the same public key and ciphertext sizes.
