\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed \textbf{DCT-Mamba3D}, a framework for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification designed to address spectral redundancy and complex spatial-spectral dependencies. The architecture integrates three core modules: a \textbf{3D Spatial-Spectral Decorrelation Module (3D-SSDM)} that utilizes a 3D DCT basis functions to reduce redundancy and enhance feature clarity; a \textbf{3D-Mamba module} that captures intricate spatial-spectral relationships through a bidirectional state-space model; and a \textbf{Global Residual Enhancement (GRE) module} to stabilize feature representation for improved robustness and convergence. Our experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrated that DCT-Mamba3D surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with high spectral similarity or spectral variability.

\textbf{Future Work:}  
Future improvements could focus on exploring adaptive frequency selection to further enhance the generalizability of DCT-Mamba3D across diverse HSI datasets, potentially making it more robust to varying data characteristics and environmental conditions.
