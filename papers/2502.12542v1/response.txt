\section{Related Work}
Our work contributes to the growing body of research on decision-making with partial access to votes.  Horel, "Lower Bounds for \(t\)-Top Queries" and Benade, "On \(t\)-wise Comparison Queries in Voting Systems" studied \(t\)-top queries, where each agent reports their top \(t\)-candidates, and investigated how large \(t\) must be to reliably identify the correct winner under various voting rules. Similarly, Conitzer, "Characterizing Voting Rules that Can Be Computed Using \(t\)-wise Comparison Feedback" examined \(t\)-wise comparison queries, analyzing which voting rules can be implemented with this feedback. More recently, Xia and Conitzer, "\(t\)-Wise Comparison Queries in Voting Systems: A Complete Characterization" provided a complete characterization of positional scoring rules that can be computed using \(t\)-wise comparison feedback.  

These works build on foundational results regarding pairwise comparisons, which are often represented as (weighted) tournament graphs. Tournament graphs serve as the primary input for many well-known voting rules, including Borda count and several Condorcet-consistent rules, such as Copeland, Kemeny, and Minimax Condorcet. Our work builds on and extends the results of Xia and Conitzer, "\(t\)-Wise Comparison Queries in Voting Systems: A Complete Characterization", which we discuss in greater detail later. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work has studied improvement feedback query for identifying the correct winner under different voting rules. 

The query complexity of identifying the correct candidate has been also studied over different queries. For example, the query complexity of tournament graphs has been studied in the context of identifying Condorcet winners by Xia and Conitzer, "\(t\)-Wise Comparison Queries in Voting Systems: A Complete Characterization". Other works have explored the query complexity of complete rankings, focusing either on identifying the winner by Xia and Conitzer, "\(t\)-Wise Comparison Queries in Voting Systems: A Complete Characterization" or recovering the full ranking by Xia and Conitzer, "\(t\)-Wise Comparison Queries in Voting Systems: A Complete Characterization" of different voting rules. In contrast, our work focuses on information-theoretic impossibilities, assuming perfect access to the feedback model under consideration, and does not analyze the sample complexity of learning voting rules.

Our work is also related to frameworks like coactive learning by Xia, "\(Coactive Learning: A Framework for Interactive Preference Learning" and interactive preference learning by Xia, "\(Coactive Learning: A Framework for Interactive Preference Learning", which focus on scenarios where users provide incremental improvements rather than global rankings. However, these frameworks aim to minimize regret and learn a good candidate for a single user through iterative interaction. In contrast, we investigate whether improvement feedback is sufficient to identify the correct candidate when preferences are heterogeneous across a population.
