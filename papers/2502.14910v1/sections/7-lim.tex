\section{Limitations}

The search time is the main limitation of the proposed EvoP, which is longer than existing pruning methods and usually takes about hours to run on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.
However, this search time should be accepted.
The reasons are: 
1) This is an offline process and only requires running once for multiple deployments; 
2) With the searched pruning pattern, the pruned model can consistently improve its performance, making it worthwhile to spend the time cost;
3) Furthermore, parallel or distributed computing can accelerate the evolutionary pruning pattern searching process, while existing implementations lack parallelism.
