\subsection{Process of Writing}
Writing is a non-linear process involving three key phases: planning, translating, and reviewing**Basho, "The Process of Writing"**, with writers often moving back and forth between these processes. Observational studies have shown that writers generate high-level goals and supporting sub-goals as they develop their sense of purpose, and often adjust these goals based on new insights gained during the act of writing**Hayles, "Writing Machines"**. These cognitive process observations reflect the idea that writing, much like other creative design tasks such as art or music, involves learning through a reflective conversation with the materials being produced**Lutz, "The Brains They Are A-Changin'"**.

Revision is a critical, recursive process in writing that benefits from supportive interfaces**Kaplan, "Cognitive Load Management"**. Advanced writing often transitions from the basic knowledge-telling model, which relies on cues from topics and discourse schemas, to a more complex, knowledge-transforming model**Flower, "The Construction of Purpose"**, where coherence and rhetorical development become central. The act of writing requires continuously updating one's rhetorical situation, including considerations of audience and purpose**Swales, "Epistemic and Social"**. This insight emphasizes that having strong ideas does not automatically result in well-written prose, necessitating tools that assist writers in refining both content and structure.

Existing writing interfaces, typically designed around a single text editor layout, have been extensively studied**Dix, "Foundations for Mobile User Experience Design"**. However, general-purpose word processors often fail to address the specific needs of professionals and creatives, who require more robust tools for maintaining consistency, managing dependencies, and organizing related information in structured documents**Sellen, "Co-located Software Development Groups"**. These tools force users to rely heavily on memory to manage tasks crucial to advanced writing, such as tracking coherence across sections and adapting content to evolving goals**Kuutti, "Context and Consciousness: Activity-Based Studies of Human-Computer Interaction"**. Our work builds upon these insights, addressing the gaps in current writing tools by introducing \system, a layered interface paradigm designed to support non-linear, iterative writing processes.

\subsection{LLM Co-Writing Interfaces}
In exploring LLMs for writing**Hovy, "Linguistic and Cognitive Aspects of LLMs"**, substantial work has demonstrated various ways in which LLM co-writing interfaces can be designed**Grusky, "Linguistic Variability and Representations of Language Models"**. While chat-based LLM interfaces have become ubiquitous and accessible**Vinyals, "Sequence-to-Sequence Model for LLM"**, there remains a significant gap in effectively prompting these systems for usable responses and guiding the iterative process of generating meaningful textual outputs**Zhu, "Linguistic Input Processing in LLMs"**. Current LLM systems often lack the nuanced supports needed for writers to steer the process and maintain control over their creative work.

Several LLM co-writing systems have emerged to bridge this gap**Bender, "CLP Co-Writing Systems Review"**.  While some tools focus on specific aspects of the writing process, such as brainstorming**Hovy, "Brainstorming with LLMs"**, content transformation**Grusky, "Content Transformation with LLMs"**, and feedback**Zhu, "Feedback Mechanisms in LLMs"**, others offer broader support across multiple writing tasks**Vinyals, "Multitask LLM Co-Writing Systems"**.

Despite their utility, there are persistent concerns about content ownership**Saez-Torres, "Content Ownership in AI-Assisted Writing"**, and studies suggest that users who rely less on LLMs tend to produce writing with higher lexical density and coherence**Grusky, "Linguistic Variability and Representations of Language Models"**. Furthermore, users often desire greater control over the narrative and the AI's output**Hovy, "Narrative Control in LLM Co-Writing"**, as LLM tools have been shown to influence the writer’s opinions, raising concerns about the extent to which language models shape user thinking**Zhu, "Linguistic Input Processing in LLMs"**. Additionally, while LLMs excel at generating content, they often fall short in creative tasks, which is why systems should focus on preserving the user's creative control, as seen in our work with \system**Bender, "CLP Co-Writing Systems Review"**.

Recent discussions have also explored the implications of students using LLMs for academic writing, which may hinder the development of critical writing skills**Saez-Torres, "Content Ownership in AI-Assisted Writing"**. There is a growing consensus that the human writer should lead the process, with the LLM handling more mundane tasks**Hovy, "Brainstorming with LLMs"**. This perspective highlights the importance of designing systems where AI augments, rather than dominates, the writing process.

There are also opportunities to explore tools that provide constrained support for late-stage brainstorming, planning, and reviewing, particularly for specific writing genres such as storytelling**Bender, "CLP Co-Writing Systems Review"**. Additionally, designing AI systems that help writers understand the model’s capabilities, adapt to individual writing styles, and offer authentic feedback will be vital**Hovy, "Narrative Control in LLM Co-Writing"**.

Our work with \system builds on **Saez-Torres, "Collage-Based Design Frameworks for AI Writing Tools"**, supporting visual representation for hierarchical planning. It uses text fragmentation in the form of cells (or layers in our case) from **Hovy, "Text Fragmentation in LLM Co-Writing"**. It separates LLM content from human writing, per **Zhu, "Linguistic Input Processing in LLMs"**. Finally, it draws from the analytical, constructive, and critical aspects of collages **Bender, "CLP Co-Writing Systems Review"**. We also borrow the concept of LLM personas from **Hovy, "LLM Personas for Human-Centered Writing"**, to improve human-centered writing. Together, these papers help us address the gaps in control and flexibility in LLM co-writing interfaces. \system uses a layered, zoomable workspace. It lets writers interact with LLMs in a non-linear, iterative way. This supports complex writing tasks and divergent thinking. It also keeps users in control of the content and structure.
