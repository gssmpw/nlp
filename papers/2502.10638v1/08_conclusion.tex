\section{Conclusion}

\system introduces a novel \textit{layered interface paradigm} designed to overcome the limitations of traditional writing tools. By allowing writers to manage content development and structural organization through a flexible, zoomable workspace, \system supports seamless interaction between micro and macro writing tasks. Its layered design enables non-linear editing, divergent thinking, and the integration of LLM-generated content without disrupting the writer's workflow. Features like stacking, folding, and the use of Writer's Friends help reduce the cognitive load and improve the fluidity of writing to create knowledge-in-action \cite {bamberger1983learning}. Our user study demonstrated that participants appreciated these capabilities, which facilitated their more exploratory and efficient writing process than what they usually experienced. This highlights \systems potential to enhance creativity and streamline complex writing tasks.
