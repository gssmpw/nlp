\section{Conclusion}
We introduce the Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, a novel scoring metric designed for cost-effective pruning. The DUAL score is the first metric to integrate both difficulty and uncertainty into a single measure, and its effectiveness in identifying the most informative samples early in training is further supported by theoretical analysis. Additionally, we propose pruning-ratio-adaptive sampling to account for sample diversity, particularly when the pruning ratio is extremely high. Our proposed pruning methods, DUAL score and DUAL score combined with Beta sampling demonstrate remarkable performance, particularly in realistic scenarios involving label noise and image corruption, by effectively distinguishing noisy samples.

Data pruning research has been evolving in a direction that contradicts its primary objective of reducing computational and storage costs while improving training efficiency. This is mainly because the computational cost of pruning often exceeds that of full training. By introducing our DUAL method, we take a crucial step toward overcoming this challenge by significantly reducing the computation cost associated with data pruning, making it feasible for practical scenarios. Ultimately, we believe this will help minimize resource waste and enhance training efficiency.
