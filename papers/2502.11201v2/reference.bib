%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

It consists of 10,181 questions and 5,693 unique complex SQL queries on 200 databases with multiple tables covering 138 different domains. We define a new complex and cross-domain semantic parsing and text-to-SQL task so that different complicated SQL queries and databases appear in train and test sets. In this way, the task requires the model to generalize well to both new SQL queries and new database schemas. Therefore, Spider is distinct from most of the previous semantic parsing tasks because they all use a single database and have the exact same program in the train set and the test set. We experiment with various state-of-the-art models and the best model achieves only 9.7{\%} exact matching accuracy on a database split setting. This shows that Spider presents a strong challenge for future research. Our dataset and task with the most recent updates are publicly available at \url{https://yale-lily.github.io/seq2sql/spider}.",

Originally motivated by Web 2.0 applications, these systems are designed to scale to thousands or millions of users doing updates as well as reads, in contrast to traditional DBMSs and data warehouses. We contrast the new systems on their data model, consistency mechanisms, storage mechanisms, durability guarantees, availability, query support, and other dimensions. These systems typically sacrifice some of these dimensions, e.g. database-wide transaction consistency, in order to achieve others, e.g. higher availability and scalability.},

abstract = {applications has created the need to store large amount of data in distributed databases that provide high availability and scalability. In recent years, a growing number of companies have adopted various types of non-relational databases, commonly referred to as NoSQL databases, and as the applications they serve emerge, they gain extensive market interest. These new database systems are not relational by definition and therefore they do not support full SQL functionality. Moreover, as opposed to relational databases they trade consistency and security for performance and scalability. As increasingly sensitive data is being stored in NoSQL databases, security issues become growing concerns. This paper reviews two of the most popular NoSQL databases (Cassandra and MongoDB) and outlines their main security features and problems.},

abstract = {As big data becomes the norm of various industrial applications, the complexity of database workloads and database system design has increased significantly. To address these challenges, conventional relational databases have been constantly improved and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra have been proposed and implemented to compete with SQL databases. In addition to traditional metrics such as response time, throughput, and capacity, modern database systems are posing higher requirements on energy efficiency due to the large volume of data that need to be stored, queried, updated, and analyzed. While decades of research in the database and data processing communities has produced a wealth of literature that optimize for performance, research on optimizations for energy efficiency has been historically overlooked and only a few studies have investigated the energy efficiency of database systems. To the best our knowledge, there are currently no comprehensive studies that analyze the impact of query optimizations on performance and energy efficiency across both relational and NoSQL databases. In fact, the energy behavior of many basic database operations (e.g. insertion, deletion, searching, update, indexing, etc) remains largely unknown due to the lack of accurate power measurement methodologies for various databases and queries. In this paper, we investigate a series of query optimization techniques for improving the energy-efficiency of relational databases and NoSQL databases. We use both widely acceptable benchmarks (e.g. Yahoo! Cloud Server Benchmark) and customized datasets (converted from ˜100GB of Twitter data) in our experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of various optimization techniques. We conduct cross database analysis on relational database (MySQL) and NoSQL based databases (MongoDB and Cassandra) to compare their performance and energy efficiency. Additionally, we study a variety of optimization techniques that can improve energy efficiency without compromising performance on the databases derived from the Twitter data. Using these techniques, we are able to achieve significant energy savings without performance degradation. Moreover, we investigate the impact of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on the performance and energy efficiency of MySQL, MongoDB and Cassandra.}

abstract = {A common problem with adopting Text-to-SQL translation in database systems is poor generalization. Specifically, when there is limited training data on new datasets, existing few-shot Text-to-SQL techniques, even with carefully designed textual prompts on pre-trained language models (PLMs), tend to be ineffective. In this paper, we present a divide-and-conquer framework to better support few-shot Text-to-SQL translation, which divides Text-to-SQL translation into two stages (or sub-tasks), such that each sub-task is simpler to be tackled. The first stage, called the structure stage, steers a PLM to generate an SQL structure (including SQL commands such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE and SQL operators such as <", ?>") with placeholders for missing identifiers. The second stage, called the content stage, guides a PLM to populate the placeholders in the generated SQL structure with concrete values (including SQL identifies such as table names, column names, and constant values). We propose a hybrid prompt strategy that combines learnable vectors and fixed vectors (i.e., word embeddings of textual prompts), such that the hybrid prompt can learn contextual information to better guide PLMs for prediction in both stages. In addition, we design keyword constrained decoding to ensure the validity of generated SQL structures, and structure guided decoding to guarantee the model to fill correct content. Extensive experiments, by comparing with ten state-of-the-art Text-to-SQL solutions at the time of writing, show that SC-Prompt significantly outperforms them in the few-shot scenario. In particular, on the widely-adopted Spider dataset, given less than 500 labeled training examples (5\% of the official training set), SC-Prompt outperforms the previous SOTA methods by around 5\% on accuracy.},

abstract = {Querying a relational database is difficult because it requires users to be familiar with both the SQL language and the schema. However, many users possess enough domain expertise to describe their desired queries by alternative means. For such users, two major alternatives to writing SQL are natural language interfaces (NLIs) and programming-by-example (PBE). Both of these alternatives face certain pitfalls: natural language queries (NLQs) are often ambiguous, even for human interpreters, while current PBE approaches limit functionality to be tractable. Consequently, we propose dual-specification query synthesis, which consumes both a NLQ and an optional PBE-like table sketch query that enables users to express varied levels of domain knowledge. We introduce the novel dual-specification Duoquest system, which leverages guided partial query enumeration to efficiently explore the space of possible queries. We present results from user studies in which Duoquest demonstrates a 62.5\% absolute increase in query construction accuracy over a state-of-the-art NLI and comparable accuracy to a PBE system on a limited workload supported by the PBE system. In a simulation study on the Spider benchmark, Duoquest demonstrates a >2x increase in top-1 accuracy over both NLI and PBE.},

abstract = {Natural Language Interfaces to Databases (NLIDB) systems eliminate the requirement for an end user to use complex query languages like SQL, by translating the input natural language (NL) queries to SQL automatically. Although a significant volume of research has focused on this space, most state-of-the-art systems can at best handle simple select-project-join queries. There has been little to no research on extending the capabilities of NLIDB systems to handle complex business intelligence (BI) queries that often involve nesting as well as aggregation. In this paper, we present Athena++, an end-to-end system that can answer such complex queries in natural language by translating them into nested SQL queries. In particular, Athena++ combines linguistic patterns from NL queries with deep domain reasoning using ontologies to enable nested query detection and generation. We also introduce a new benchmark data set (FIBEN), which consists of 300 NL queries, corresponding to 237 distinct complex SQL queries on a database with 152 tables, conforming to an ontology derived from standard financial ontologies (FIBO and FRO). We conducted extensive experiments comparing Athena++ with two state-of-the-art NLIDB systems, using both FIBEN and the prominent Spider benchmark. Athena++ consistently outperforms both systems across all benchmark data sets with a wide variety of complex queries, achieving 88.33\% accuracy on FIBEN benchmark, and 78.89\% accuracy on Spider benchmark, beating the best reported accuracy results on the dev set by 8\%.},

In this paper, we consider a special case in machine translation problems, targeting to convert natural language into Structured Query Language (SQL) for data retrieval over relational database. Although generic CNN and RNN learn the grammar structure of SQL when trained with sufficient samples, the accuracy and training efficiency of the model could be dramatically improved, when the translation model is deeply integrated with the grammar rules of SQL. We present a new encoder-decoder framework, with a suite of new approaches, including new semantic features fed into the encoder, grammar-aware states injected into the memory of decoder, as well as recursive state management for sub-queries. These techniques help the neural network better focus on understanding semantics of operations in natural language and save the efforts on SQL grammar learning. The empirical evaluation on real world database and queries show that our approach outperform state-of-the-art solution by a significant margin.},

Our model can incorporate almost all types of existing relations in the literature, and in addition, we propose introducing co-reference relations for the multi-turn scenario. Experimental results on three widely used text-to-SQL datasets, covering both single-turn and multi-turn scenarios, have shown that RASAT could achieve competitive results in all three benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art execution accuracy (75.5{\%} EX on Spider, 52.6{\%} IEX on SParC, and 37.4{\%} IEX on CoSQL).",

abstract = {The task of text-to-SQL parsing, which aims at converting natural language questions into executable SQL queries, has garnered increasing attention in recent years. One of the major challenges in text-to-SQL parsing is domain generalization, i.e., how to generalize well to unseen databases. Recently, the pre-trained text-to-text transformer model, namely T5, though not specialized for text-to-SQL parsing, has achieved state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks targeting domain generalization. In this work, we explore ways to further augment the pre-trained T5 model with specialized components for text-to-SQL parsing. Such components are expected to introduce structural inductive bias into text-to-SQL parsers thus improving model's capacity on (potentially multi-hop) reasoning, which is critical for generating structure-rich SQLs. To this end, we propose a new architecture GRAPHIX-T5, a mixed model with the standard pre-trained transformer model augmented by specially-designed graph-aware layers. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPHIX-T5 across four text-to-SQL benchmarks: SPIDER, SYN, REALISTIC and DK. GRAPHIX-T5 surpass all other T5-based parsers with a significant margin, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, GRAPHIX-T5-large reaches performance superior to the original T5-large by 5.7\% on exact match (EM) accuracy and 6.6\% on execution accuracy (EX). This even outperforms the T5-3B by 1.2\% on EM and 1.5\% on EX.},

We present a unified framework, based on the relation-aware self-attention mechanism, to address schema encoding, schema linking, and feature representation within a text-to-SQL encoder. On the challenging Spider dataset this framework boosts the exact match accuracy to 57.2{\%}, surpassing its best counterparts by 8.7{\%} absolute improvement.

In this work, we propose a History Information Enhanced text-to-SQL model (HIE-SQL) to exploit context dependence information from both history utterances and the last predicted SQL query. In view of the mismatch, we treat natural language and SQL as two modalities and propose a bimodal pre-trained model to bridge the gap between them. Besides, we design a schema-linking graph to enhance connections from utterances and the SQL query to database schema. We show our history information enhanced methods improve the performance of HIE-SQL by a significant margin, which achieves new state-of-the-art results on two context-dependent text-to-SQL benchmarks, the SparC and CoSQL datasets, at the writing time.",

IRNet aims to address two challenges: 1) the mismatch between intents expressed in natural language (NL) and the implementation details in SQL; 2) the challenge in predicting columns caused by the large number of out-of-domain words. Instead of end-to-end synthesizing a SQL query, IRNet decomposes the synthesis process into three phases. In the first phase, IRNet performs a schema linking over a question and a database schema. Then, IRNet adopts a grammar-based neural model to synthesize a SemQL query which is an intermediate representation that we design to bridge NL and SQL. Finally, IRNet deterministically infers a SQL query from the synthesized SemQL query with domain knowledge. On the challenging Text-to-SQL benchmark Spider, IRNet achieves 46.7{\%} accuracy, obtaining 19.5{\%} absolute improvement over previous state-of-the-art approaches. At the time of writing, IRNet achieves the first position on the Spider leaderboard.",

abstract = {One of the recent best attempts at Text-to-SQL is the pre-trained language model. Due to the structural property of the SQL queries, the seq2seq model takes the responsibility of parsing both the schema items (i.e., tables and columns) and the skeleton (i.e., SQL keywords). Such coupled targets increase the difficulty of parsing the correct SQL queries especially when they involve many schema items and logic operators. This paper proposes a ranking-enhanced encoding and skeleton-aware decoding framework to decouple the schema linking and the skeleton parsing. Specifically, for a seq2seq encoder-decode model, its encoder is injected by the most relevant schema items instead of the whole unordered ones, which could alleviate the schema linking effort during SQL parsing, and its decoder first generates the skeleton and then the actual SQL query, which could implicitly constrain the SQL parsing. We evaluate our proposed framework on Spider and its three robustness variants: Spider-DK, Spider-Syn, and Spider-Realistic. The experimental results show that our framework delivers promising performance and robustness.},

abstract = {The importance of building text-to-SQL parsers which can be applied to new databases has long been acknowledged, and a critical step to achieve this goal is schema linking, i.e., properly recognizing mentions of unseen columns or tables when generating SQLs. In this work, we propose a novel framework to elicit relational structures from large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) via a probing procedure based on Poincar\'{e} distance metric, and use the induced relations to augment current graph-based parsers for better schema linking. Compared with commonly-used rule-based methods for schema linking, we found that probing relations can robustly capture semantic correspondences, even when surface forms of mentions and entities differ. Moreover, our probing procedure is entirely unsupervised and requires no additional parameters. Extensive experiments show that our framework sets new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks. We empirically verify that our probing procedure can indeed find desired relational structures through qualitative analysis.},

In this work, we examine the challenges that still prevent these techniques from practical deployment. First, we present KaggleDBQA, a new cross-domain evaluation dataset of real Web databases, with domain-specific data types, original formatting, and unrestricted questions. Second, we re-examine the choice of evaluation tasks for text-to-SQL parsers as applied in real-life settings. Finally, we augment our in-domain evaluation task with database documentation, a naturally occurring source of implicit domain knowledge. We show that KaggleDBQA presents a challenge to state-of-the-art zero-shot parsers but a more realistic evaluation setting and creative use of associated database documentation boosts their accuracy by over 13.2{\%}, doubling their performance.",

abstract = {Language models have shown promising performance on the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL). However, most of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches rely on powerful yet closed-source large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, which may have the limitations of unclear model architectures, data privacy risks, and expensive inference overheads. To address the limitations, we introduce CodeS, a series of pre-trained language models with parameters ranging from 1B to 15B, specifically designed for the text-to-SQL task. CodeS is a fully open-source language model, which achieves superior accuracy with much smaller parameter sizes. This paper studies the research challenges in building CodeS. To enhance the SQL generation abilities of CodeS, we adopt an incremental pre-training approach using a specifically curated SQL-centric corpus. Based on this, we address the challenges of schema linking and rapid domain adaptation through strategic prompt construction and a bi-directional data augmentation technique. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including the widely used Spider benchmark, the newly released BIRD benchmark, robustness-diagnostic benchmarks such as Spider-DK, Spider-Syn, Spider-Realistic, and Dr.Spider, as well as two real-world datasets created for financial and academic applications. The experimental results show that our CodeS achieves new SOTA accuracy and robustness on nearly all challenging text-to-SQL benchmarks.},

abstract = {Text-to-GraphQL (Text2GraphQL) is a task that converts the user's questions into Graph + QL (Query Language) when a graph database is given. That is a task of semantic parsing that transforms natural language problems into logical expressions, which will bring more efficient direct communication between humans and machines. The existing related work mainly focuses on Text-to-SQL tasks, and there is no available semantic parsing method and data set for the graph database. In order to fill the gaps in this field to serve the medical Human–Robot Interactions (HRI) better, we propose this task and a pipeline solution for the Text2GraphQL task. This solution uses the Adapter pre-trained by “the linking of GraphQL schemas and the corresponding utterances” as an external knowledge introduction plug-in. By inserting the Adapter into the language model, the mapping between logical language and natural language can be introduced faster and more directly to better realize the end-to-end human–machine language translation task. In the study, the proposed Text2GraphQL task model is mainly constructed based on an improved pipeline composed of a Language Model, Pre-trained Adapter plug-in, and Pointer Network. This enables the model to copy objects' tokens from utterances, generate corresponding GraphQL statements for graph database retrieval, and builds an adjustment mechanism to improve the final output. And the experiments have proved that our proposed method has certain competitiveness on the counterpart datasets (Spider, ATIS, GeoQuery, and 39.net) converted from the Text2SQL task, and the proposed method is also practical in medical scenarios.},

    abstract = "To be informative, an evaluation must measure how well systems generalize to realistic unseen data. We identify limitations of and propose improvements to current evaluations of text-to-SQL systems. First, we compare human-generated and automatically generated questions, characterizing properties of queries necessary for real-world applications. To facilitate evaluation on multiple datasets, we release standardized and improved versions of seven existing datasets and one new text-to-SQL dataset. Second, we show that the current division of data into training and test sets measures robustness to variations in the way questions are asked, but only partially tests how well systems generalize to new queries; therefore, we propose a complementary dataset split for evaluation of future work. Finally, we demonstrate how the common practice of anonymizing variables during evaluation removes an important challenge of the task. Our observations highlight key difficulties, and our methodology enables effective measurement of future development."
