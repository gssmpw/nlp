\begin{abstract}
%% YWv1
%Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize interactive storytelling by concretizing the creator's narrative intent according to the audience's actions in the story world. However, this requires the creator to relinquish some authorial control on the details of the narrative. Instead of crafting a specific narrative, the creator needs to author a possibility space of narratives, while the final narrative seen by the audience emerges from their interaction with AI within the space. In contrast to most existing tools assisting interactive storytelling creation, which focus on authoring specific narratives, we present WhatELSE, a proof-of-concept workflow for authoring possibility spaces of narratives. WhatELSE assists creators to perceive and sculpt a narrative possibility space utilizing coordination between three different representations of the space: narrative instance, narrative outline and narrative variants. Technical evaluations and user study show that WhatELSE helps the creators effectively shape the narrative possibility space and balance between authorial intent expression and emergent narrative content. We also demonstrate how the output from WhatELSE can be used to drive actual gameplay by grounding narrative content to function calls supported by a game environment.

%% Qv1
%Interactive narratives let players make choices that impact the story that they are reading. Creating interactive narratives requires authors to craft a narrative space by enumerating player choices and possible outcomes. Large language models have the potential to generate rich interactive textual output but they lack the control that authors desire, and it is challenging for authors to perceive and edit the generated narrative space. In this paper, we present WhatELSE, an authoring system that generates an interactive narrative using a linear story as an example. It encodes the authorial intent of the example into a narrative space by abstracting meaningful events, and unfolds the narrative space into executable gameplots  using LLM-based narrative planning. The system provides three views (narrative outline, variant, and example) and two abstraction tools (abstraction ladder and tooltip) to help authors perceive and edit the space . Through a user study and technical evaluation, we found that WhatELSE supports creation of interactive narrative through authorial controls and prevents deviations beyond the original authorial intent.

%% YWv3
% Generative AI enables just-in-time narrative content generation in games, which significantly enhances player agency by allowing the generated narrative to respond to the player's actions in the game. However, this reduces author's control over the space of possible narratives - within which the final story experienced by the player emerges from their interaction with AI. It is challenging for authors to understand and control what could be generated from the space. In this paper, we present WhatELSE, an  interactive narrative authoring system that creates narrative possibility spaces from examples. WhatELSE leverages linguistic abstraction to control the boundary of the narrative space, and LLM-based simulation to generate estimated variations in the space as well as corresponding executable character actions. WhatELSE helps creators perceive and edit this space through three representations of the narrative space: plot instance, narrative outline, and plot variants. We conducted a user study and technical evaluation. Technical evaluations and a user study (N = 12) show that WhatELSE enables game plot generation to reach balanced authorial expression and player agency.

% ZL v3.3


Generative AI significantly enhances player agency in interactive narratives (IN) by enabling just-in-time content generation that adapts to player actions. While delegating generation to AI makes IN more interactive, it becomes challenging for authors to control the space of possible narratives - within which the final story experienced by the player emerges from their interaction with AI. In this paper, we present WhatELSE, an AI-bridged IN authoring system that creates narrative possibility spaces from example stories. WhatELSE provides three views (narrative pivot, outline, and variants) to help authors understand the narrative space and corresponding tools leveraging linguistic abstraction to control the boundaries of the narrative space. Taking innovative LLM-based narrative planning approaches, WhatELSE further unfolds the narrative space into executable game events. Through a user study (N=12) and technical evaluations, we found that WhatELSE enables authors to perceive and edit the narrative space and generates engaging interactive narratives at play-time.
