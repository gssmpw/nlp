LLM as the narrative generator/narrative writing assistant

\noindent \textbf{Methods}
\begin{itemize}

    \item LLM-based narrative generation technique via the agent-based simulation (ABS). \cite{10488290}
    \item human-LLM collaborative story editing \cite{kelly2023there}
    \item SCENECRAFT, a narrative scene generation framework that automates NPC interaction crucial to unfolding plot events. \cite{kumaran2023scenecraft}
    \item NarrativePlay, a novel system that allows users to role-play a fictional character and interact with other characters in narratives in an immersive environment. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses, guided by personality traits extracted from narratives. \cite{zhao-etal-2024-narrativeplay}
    \item generating and evaluating visual novel (VN) game stories in the context of global warming \cite{gursesli2023chronicles}
    \item a state space planning algorithm to plan coherent multi-agent stories in symbolic domains, with a language model acting as a guide to estimate which events are worth exploring first. \cite{farrell2024planning}
    \item LLM in creative narrative writing support.\cite{kreminski-martens-2022-unmet}
    \item taxonomy of llm prompts for benchmarking complex tasks \cite{santu2023teler}
    \item gossip simulation as an open problem in intelligent narrative technologies and present an abstract approach to informationally and socially rich gossip simulation for emergent narrative-oriented social simulations\cite{10333140}
    \item collaborative game design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. \cite{lanzi2023chatgpt}
    \item LLM for serious board game design\cite{junior2023chatgpt}
    \item Story variations and design space \cite{suh2024luminate} (QZ-added)
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Qualitative experience of users playing LLM-generated D\&D games \cite{yong2023playing}. 
    \item Player Perceptions of LLM-Generated Dialogue in Commercial Video Games \cite{akoury2023framework}
    \item \cite{wang2023playing}

    

\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLM Agents (NPC)}
\noindent \textbf{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LLM evaluating user interaction.\cite{isaza2024prompt}
    \item prompt engineering for LLM-enhanced social chatbots \cite{sun2023fictional}
    \item Interactive Planning with LLMs Enables Open-World Multi-Task Agents


\end{itemize}
\noindent \textbf{Evaluation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  player feedback to the use of LLM-driven NPC responses in a commercially available video game.\cite{cox2023conversational}
        \item Evaluating llms with interactive multi-agent negotiation games \cite{abdelnabi2023llm}
        \item  Evaluating LLMs' Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent Environments \cite{huang2024far}
        \item context-aware LLM-based NPC conversations have high potential in increasing player engagement in RPGs \cite{csepregi2021effect}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A novel psychological assessment paradigm in the form of an interactive
game instead of a traditional self-report scale.\cite{yang2024llm}
    \item Human interaction patterns with LLM\cite{li2024map}
    \item film plot excerpts as an example initial narrative context and explore how different prompt formats might affect narrative choice generation by open-source LLMs\cite{harmon2023prompt}

    
    \item 3D game design\cite{roberts2022surreal}
    \item LLM playing Jubensha\cite{wu2023deciphering}
    \item LLM playing Avalon\cite{lan2023llm}
    \item LLM + video games survey \cite{sweetser2024large}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LLM as Experience Manager}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Language Model-Based Player Goal Recognition in Open World Digital Games \cite{kim2023language}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interactive Narrative Before LLM}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Causal Necessity as a Narrative Planning Step Cost Function \cite{ware2023causal}
