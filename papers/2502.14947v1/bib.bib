    abstract =  {This memorandum describes RTP, the real-time transport protocol. RTP provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. RTP does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of- service for real-time services. The data transport is augmented by a control protocol (RTCP) to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks, and to provide minimal control and identification functionality. RTP and RTCP are designed to be independent of the underlying transport and network layers. The protocol supports the use of RTP-level translators and mixers. Most of the text in this memorandum is identical to RFC 1889 which it obsoletes. There are no changes in the packet formats on the wire, only changes to the rules and algorithms governing how the protocol is used. The biggest change is an enhancement to the scalable timer algorithm for calculating when to send RTCP packets in order to minimize transmission in excess of the intended rate when many participants join a session simultaneously. {[}STANDARDS-TRACK{]}},

abstract = {Video conferencing applications require low latency and high bandwidth. Standard TCP is not suitable for video conferencing since its reliability and in order delivery mechanisms induce large latency. Recently the idea of using the delay gradient to infer congestion is appearing again and is gaining momentum. In this paper we present an algorithm that is based on estimating through a Kalman filter the end-to-end one way delay variation which is experienced by packets traveling from a sender to a destination. This estimate is compared to an adaptive threshold to dynamically throttle the sending rate. The control algorithm has been implemented over the RTP/RTCP protocol and is currently used in Google Hangouts and in the Chrome WebRTC stack. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the algorithm performance in the case of variable link capacity, presence of heterogeneous or homogeneous concurrent traffic, and backward path traffic.},

abstract = {Existing ABR algorithms face a significant challenge in estimating future capacity: capacity can vary widely over time, a phenomenon commonly observed in commercial services. In this work, we suggest an alternative approach: rather than presuming that capacity estimation is required, it is perhaps better to begin by using only the buffer, and then ask when capacity estimation is needed. We test the viability of this approach through a series of experiments spanning millions of real users in a commercial service. We start with a simple design which directly chooses the video rate based on the current buffer occupancy. Our own investigation reveals that capacity estimation is unnecessary in steady state; however using simple capacity estimation (based on immediate past throughput) is important during the startup phase, when the buffer itself is growing from empty. This approach allows us to reduce the rebuffer rate by 10-20\% compared to Netflix's then-default ABR algorithm, while delivering a similar average video rate, and a higher video rate in steady state.},

abstract = {For Real-time Communication (RTC), Bandwidth Estimation (BWE) is crucial for enhancing user Quality of Experience (QoE) by ensuring efficient bandwidth utilization and low latency. Recent advancements have shifted towards machine learning based algorithms, particularly online reinforcement leanring (RL), to dynamically infer future bandwidth using statistical data. However, challenges such as dependency on training settings, the necessity for extensive trial and error, and instability in complex state spaces hinder their efficacy. To address these limitations, we propose Pioneer, a novel offline RL framework for BWE in RTC systems. Unlike its predecessors, Pioneer eliminates the need for real-time environment interaction during training and achieves good performance through lightweight training. Our framework consists of a Trajectory Sampler for state information preprocessing and a Bandwidth Estimator based on offline RL model. Our test results on offline datasets show that Pioneer can achieve better performance than expert algorithms. We also tested Pioneer on online simulation platforms, and Pioneer can improve QoE by 9\% compared to other offline algorithm, demonstrating good robustness.},

abstract = {The increasing demand for real-time communication (RTC) applications necessitates robust and reliable systems. Seamless media delivery depends on an accurate assessment of the network conditions, with bandwidth estimation (BWE) being crucial for maintaining system reliability and achieving good quality of experience (QoE) for the users. BWE poses a significant challenge due to dynamic network conditions, limited information availability and computational complexity. The Second Bandwidth Estimation Challenge, organized within ACM MMSys 2024, aims to enhance RTC user QoE by developing a deep learning-based bandwidth estimator using offline reinforcement learning. This paper presents our solution, ranked second in the grand challenge. This solution employs an actor-critic approach to achieve accurate real-time BWE by relying solely on observed network statistics. Due to the offline setting of the challenge, the critic network is trained separately from the actor network to estimate the action quality without interacting with the real environment. Furthermore, the quality prediction by the critic is adjusted by a predefined conservation factor to address overshooting the bandwidth values. The solution's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/streaming-university/FARC.},
