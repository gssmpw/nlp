abstract = {Video conferencing applications require low latency and high bandwidth. Standard TCP is not suitable for video conferencing since its reliability and in order delivery mechanisms induce large latency. Recently the idea of using the delay gradient to infer congestion is appearing again and is gaining momentum. In this paper we present an algorithm that is based on estimating through a Kalman filter the end-to-end one way delay variation which is experienced by packets traveling from a sender to a destination. This estimate is compared to an adaptive threshold to dynamically throttle the sending rate. The control algorithm has been implemented over the RTP/RTCP protocol and is currently used in Google Hangouts and in the Chrome WebRTC stack. Experiments have been carried out to evaluate the algorithm performance in the case of variable link capacity, presence of heterogeneous or homogeneous concurrent traffic, and backward path traffic.},

abstract = {Existing ABR algorithms face a significant challenge in estimating future capacity: capacity can vary widely over time, a phenomenon commonly observed in commercial services. In this work, we suggest an alternative approach: rather than presuming that capacity estimation is required, it is perhaps better to begin by using only the buffer, and then ask when capacity estimation is needed. We test the viability of this approach through a series of experiments spanning millions of real users in a commercial service. We start with a simple design which directly chooses the video rate based on the current buffer occupancy. Our own investigation reveals that capacity estimation is unnecessary in steady state; however using simple capacity estimation (based on immediate past throughput) is important during the startup phase, when the buffer itself is growing from empty. This approach allows us to reduce the rebuffer rate by 10-20\% compared to Netflix's then-default ABR algorithm, while delivering a similar average video rate, and a higher video rate in steady state.},
