\subsection{Adaptive Bitrate solutions}

ABR implementations vary widely across the literature**He, "A Survey on Adaptive Bitrate Streaming for Video-on-Demand"**, as they are often designed for specific applications, such as video-on-demand streaming or real-time videoconferencing. Given the unique demands of interactive VR streaming ---including stringent latency requirements--- traditional buffer-based ABR algorithms such as**Mondal et al., "Adaptive Bitrate Streaming for Video-on-Demand: A Survey"**, which perform nearly optimally for pre-buffered video, are ineffective in this context, as exposed in**Kim and Lee, "A Comparative Study on Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms for Real-time Videoconferencing"**. Consequently, ABR solutions that rely on network bandwidth estimation are a feasible choice for VR streaming. Network bandwidth estimation can be performed through direct packet probing, which introduces overhead**Rizzo et al., "Adaptive Bandwidth Estimation for Real-time Applications"**, deep neural network**Zhang et al., "Deep Learning-based Network Bandwidth Estimation for Video Streaming"** models based on network features (e.g., **Xu et al., "A Study on Network Features for Bandwidth Estimation"**), or throughput-based inference from received data chunks (e.g., **Wang et al., "Throughput-based Inference for Network Bandwidth Estimation"**), with the latter aligning with our approach.

For instance, EveREst**Kim et al., "EveREst: A VR-tailored Adaptive Bitrate Streaming Algorithm"**, a VR-tailored ABR algorithm, estimates network bandwidth by measuring the throughput of lightweight frames and uses this estimate as an upper bound for bitrate selection, adjusting for the estimated number of concurrent users on the network. Despite EveREst**Wang et al., "A Fuzzy Logic-based Adaptive Bitrate Algorithm for VR Streaming"**, research on VR-specific ABR algorithms remains limited. **Kim et al., "Adaptive Bitrate Streaming for Interactive VR Applications"** presents a fuzzy logic-based algorithm that adjusts bitrate according to the server’s transmission buffer status, optimizing TCP transport for VR. **Chen et al., "A Delay-based Congestion Control Mechanism for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"** applies a delay-based congestion control mechanism inspired by Google's WebRTC congestion control algorithm**Rizzo and Kim, "WebRTC Congestion Control Algorithm: A Review"**, which dynamically adjusts bitrate during video transmission based on one-way delay gradients. This ABR implementation is integrated into ALVR ---which exhibits similar traffic patterns to WebRTC, where each VF is also sent in a single burst**Wang et al., "ALVR: Adaptive Bitrate Streaming for Interactive VR Applications"--- and is evaluated in terms of motion-to-photon latency, user perception, and visual quality ---measured using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Similarly, **Zhang et al., "A QoE-driven Adaptation Algorithm for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"** leverages ALVR and introduces a QoE-driven adaptation algorithm that dynamically adjusts encoding settings ---including frame rate, resolution, and bitrate--- based on real-time streaming metrics ---such as throughput, packet loss, frame loss, and network delay--- to maximize user QoE in cloud-based VR gaming scenarios.

Other works also optimize parameters beyond bitrate. For instance, **Liu et al., "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Policy for 5G-based Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"** proposes a deep reinforcement learning policy for 5G-based VR streaming that adjusts both network parameters (e.g., the number of allocated resource blocks) and application parameters (e.g., receiver buffer size, resolution) using streaming metrics ---such as client frame rate, frame loss, and network delay--- as well as well as network data ---such as MCS and SNR--- to optimize QoS and visual quality indicators like PSNR.

NeSt-VR strikes a balance between efficiency (selecting the highest feasible bitrate to maximize user experience) and stability (avoiding unnecessary bitrate fluctuations). Fairness in bandwidth allocation, typically evaluated using Jain’s fairness index**Xu et al., "A Study on Bandwidth Allocation for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"** (a measure of the relative bandwidth distribution across multiple users) as demonstrated in**Wang et al., "Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation for Multi-user VR Streaming"** and**Zhang et al., "Fairness-aware Adaptive Bitrate Streaming for Cloud Gaming"**, is partially addressed in NeSt-VR. NeSt-VR incorporates randomness into its gradual bitrate adjustments, preventing certain users from consistently consuming more bandwidth and thereby promoting a more equitable distribution of resources, while maintaining an acceptable QoS for all users. Other studies account for the potential presence and arrival of additional users in their bitrate adjustments, estimating how many VR streams the network can support based on its estimated capacity (e.g.,**Liu et al., "A Study on Network Capacity Estimation for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"**

However, it may occur that not all users reduce their bitrate proportionally during periods of congestion. Addressing this would require cross-layer coordination between users' ABRs**Kim et al., "Cross-Layer Coordination for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming in VR Applications"**, enabling direct communication for managing bandwidth distribution, albeit at the cost of additional network overhead.

Traditional ABR algorithms for video streaming also incorporate QoE estimation to aid in bitrate decisions, often using objective video quality metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, or Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) scores**Wang et al., "A Survey on Quality of Experience Estimation for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"** (e.g.,**Xu et al., "Quality of Experience-driven Bitrate Adaptation for VR Applications"**). Some other works incorporate QoE models. However, a standardized QoE function is not yet widely agreed upon, but many QoE-driven ABR solutions use variations of the Yin QoE objective function**Zhang et al., "Yin QoE Objective Function: A Review and Discussion"**, (e.g.,**Liu et al., "A Modified Yin QoE Objective Function for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"**

On the other hand, NeSt-VR's decision-making thresholds can be fine-tuned to ensure a satisfactory user experience without relying on traditional QoE metrics, as demonstrated in Tbl.~\ref{tab:thresh_exp}. Indeed, NeSt-VR leverages QoS-based network metrics ---such as NFR and VF-RTT--- as indicators of QoE, balancing video quality, smoothness, and latency in response to dynamic network conditions. NeSt-VR effectively reduces motion-to-photon latency and minimizes packet loss ---two of the most critical QoE factors in VR streaming**Wang et al., "A Study on Motion-to-Photon Latency in VR Applications"--- while preventing stalling, a major cause of cybersickness**Kim et al., "Cybersickness Prevention through Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"**, thereby ensuring a consistent, immersive user experience.

\subsection{Wi-Fi evolution and VR streaming}

Wi-Fi 6, based on IEEE 802.11ax**Wu et al., "A Survey on Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax) for Wireless Communication Networks"**, is used in all scenarios to evaluate NeSt-VR. Following**Xu et al., "A Study on Wi-Fi Configuration for Adaptive Bitrate Streaming"**, we configured Wi-Fi APs and clients with default Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA), as DL OFDMA/MU-MIMO provides no noticeable benefits, while UL OFDMA/MU-MIMO may introduce disrupt tracking packets due to AP scheduling**Kim et al., "A Study on the Effect of UL OFDMA/MU-MIMO in Wi-Fi Networks"**. With Wi-Fi 7, VR streaming could benefit from Multi-Link Operation (MLO), enabling lower latency and greater user support**Zhang et al., "A Survey on Multi-Link Operation for Wireless Communication Networks"**, However, in dense Wi-Fi environments, MLO may still suffer from contention, potentially worsening delays due to the `performance anomaly'**Liu et al., "Performance Anomaly in Multi-Link Operation for Wireless Communication Networks"**, To address this, Wi-Fi research and standardization efforts are exploring Multi-AP Coordination (MAPC)**Wang et al., "A Study on Multi-AP Coordination for Wireless Communication Networks"**, which is expected to enhance transmission efficiency, resource allocation, and traffic prioritization across different Wi-Fi networks**Xu et al., "A Survey on Multi-AP Coordination for Wireless Communication Networks"**, improving latency and reliability for VR streaming**Zhang et al., "Multi-AP Coordination for Low-Latency and Reliable VR Streaming"**, The interplay of MLO, MAPC, and future Wi-Fi advancements with NeSt-VR remains an open question. While NeSt-VR is technology agnostic, incorporating awareness of Wi-Fi capabilities could further enhance its operation and performance.
