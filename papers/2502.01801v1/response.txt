Systems for assisted living and memory augmentation, especially those that integrate computer vision and chatbots, can provide support to older adults with cognitive impairments.

Research on systems for assisted living focuses on enabling older adults to live independently while maintaining their quality of life. This includes reducing caregiver burden through remote monitoring of activities of daily living (ADLs), tracking vital signs, and detecting falls or other accidents.

The FMT wearable camera-based object tracking memory aid is a notable device that captures video footage anytime an object is interacted with. However, this system requires manual registration of objects, which can be tiresome and may not provide a seamless experience for object tracking.

Go-Finder, another object finding wearable device, does not require object registration but instead relies on image storage, which raises concerns about privacy and data management.

Studies have shown that older adults are generally more accepting of wearable devices in their home than in public settings. The Narrative clip camera is an example of a wearable camera system designed for egocentric activity tracking, but it may not be suitable for individuals with memory problems.

A study published by BMC geriatrics found that lifelogging tools were considered acceptable among older adults unless they used the device in public outside of their home.

The FMT and Go-finder papers also conducted acceptability studies and found that individuals were more concerned with the functionality and how it could assist them rather than social acceptability. 

One notable example of a wearable camera system is the Humane AI clip, which is designed for tracking egocentric activity but may not be suitable for older adults or individuals with memory problems.

Recent wearable camera systems have become more prevalent in the market, suggesting wider spread adoption among the public. Examples include the Narrative clip camera and smart glasses like RayBan Meta smart glasses. However, these devices are not currently designed specifically for the needs of older adults.

The social acceptability of wearable cameras is a concern that depends on factors such as body-location, size, and visibility. A study published by BMC geriatrics found that older adults were more accepting of lifelogging tools in their home than in public settings.

Relational agents have shown to be effective for the older adults population. More specifically, prior studies analyze the efficacy of voice user interfaces (VUIs) for the older adults (ex. Google Home, Alexa, etc.). 

A systematic review addressed the perception and use of VUIs by older adults, showing benefits of these interfaces on daily lives of these individuals.

Guy showed that the language of voice queries is closer to natural language than typed queries.

These conversational assistants can be used for question answering or initiate reminders and prompts. For example, Prompto is a conversational memory coach using cognitive contexts for providing prospective memory training sessions.

It finds that optimal trigger times for these voice based prompts/reminders are during lower cognitive loads and idle times, suggesting that assisting with prospective memory loss should take voice-notification timing into consideration.
