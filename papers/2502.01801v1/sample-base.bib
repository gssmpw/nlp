abstract = {We designed and implemented an Augmented Reality system, called the My Daily Routine (MDR) system, to demonstrate technology that may aid people living with dementia and their care partners. Although people with dementia are often dependent on their care partners in their daily lives, their independence may be enhanced using Augmented Reality. The MDR system consists of a website and a HoloLens Augmented Reality (AR) application. The care partner can display and customize reminder content using the website. When wearing a Microsoft HoloLens AR device running MDR, a person with dementia will be able to receive personalized reminders in the form of text, images, videos, displayed three dimensional models, voice messages, or music. Customization controls the choice of reminders and their timing; for example, reminders can be issued when an object is detected, at a certain time, or when a command is voiced. MDR can also display the names of common objects and navigation instructions. Through use of the HoloLens’ powerful spatial mapping capabilities and Microsoft’s experimental World Locking Tools, the indoor navigation system in MDR is accurate and easy to set up.},

While existing solutions mostly focus on supportive memory aids and reminders, it is also crucial to maintain PM functions and independent living for older adults. We present ProspecFit, which digitises implementation intentions, a lab-based memory intervention, making it available on smartphones through iterative design that draws insights from a focus group and preliminary studies. We evaluated its usability and effectiveness in enhancing PM through user studies that included a 12-day in situ study, and pre- and post-testing with 10 adults (61 to 80 years old). Participants in the digital PM training group were more prompt in performing the in situ PM tasks, compared to the control group without digital training, and reported improvement in their PM compared to before the training. We also show findings from diary entries, reports on forgetful moments and user reactions. Our work provides implications for creating digital memory training tools in HCI.},

Memory augmentation technology could improve and support our memory by facilitating memory training and providing memory assistance respectively. However, there remains a lack of research on utilising users' internal states to enable just-in-time delivery of these interventions to improve receptivity and effectiveness. With the focus on helping older adults, my research involves the design, development and evaluation of memory training and memory assistance artifacts which infer users' internal and cognitive context through physiological signals (biosignals). This work will contribute new concepts that build on previous research in the field of mobile computing and design guidelines for future work on augmenting human memory.},

However, designing such interfaces and investigating how the familiarity of kin voices affect user perceptions remain under-explored. Our surveys and interviews with 25 users revealed that VUIs using kin voices were perceived as more engaging, persuasive and safer yet eerier than VUIs using common virtual assistant voices. We then developed a technology probe, KinVoice, an Alexa-based VUI that was deployed in three households over two weeks. Users set reminders using KinVoice, which in turn, gave the reminders in synthesised kin voices. This was to explore users' needs, uncover challenges involved and inspire new applications. We discuss design guidelines for integrating familiar kin voices into VUIs, applications that benefit from its usage, and implications for balancing voice realism and usability with security and diversification.},
