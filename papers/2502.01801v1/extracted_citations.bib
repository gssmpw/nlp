abstract = {Memory is necessary for our daily lives and activities, yet it is often fallible. Memory augmentation technology could improve and support our memory by facilitating memory training and providing memory assistance respectively. However, there remains a lack of research on utilising users' internal states to enable just-in-time delivery of these interventions to improve receptivity and effectiveness. With the focus on helping older adults, my research involves the design, development and evaluation of memory training and memory assistance artifacts which infer users' internal and cognitive context through physiological signals (biosignals). This work will contribute new concepts that build on previous research in the field of mobile computing and design guidelines for future work on augmenting human memory.},

abstract = {We designed and implemented an Augmented Reality system, called the My Daily Routine (MDR) system, to demonstrate technology that may aid people living with dementia and their care partners. Although people with dementia are often dependent on their care partners in their daily lives, their independence may be enhanced using Augmented Reality. The MDR system consists of a website and a HoloLens Augmented Reality (AR) application. The care partner can display and customize reminder content using the website. When wearing a Microsoft HoloLens AR device running MDR, a person with dementia will be able to receive personalized reminders in the form of text, images, videos, displayed three dimensional models, voice messages, or music. Customization controls the choice of reminders and their timing; for example, reminders can be issued when an object is detected, at a certain time, or when a command is voiced. MDR can also display the names of common objects and navigation instructions. Through use of the HoloLens’ powerful spatial mapping capabilities and Microsoft’s experimental World Locking Tools, the indoor navigation system in MDR is accurate and easy to set up.},
