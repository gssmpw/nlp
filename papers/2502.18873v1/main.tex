\begin{abstract}
Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to their limitations in addressing the vast reasoning space and inherent ambiguities of natural language. 
We propose the Mixture-of-Search-Agents (\mosa{}) paradigm, a novel approach leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs to enhance search-based reasoning. 
\mosa{} integrates diverse reasoning pathways by combining independent exploration with iterative refinement among LLMs, mitigating the limitations of single-model approaches. 
Using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) as a backbone, \mosa{} enables multiple agents to propose and aggregate reasoning steps, resulting in improved accuracy. 
Our comprehensive evaluation across four reasoning benchmarks demonstrates \mosa{}'s consistent performance improvements over single-agent and other multi-agent baselines, particularly in complex mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks.

\section*{Impact Statement}
This work aims to contribute to the advancement of reasoning with LLMs. 
While our research could have various societal implications, none are deemed significant enough to warrant specific mention at this stage.
% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% % In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% % references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
% \nocite{langley00}

% \section{You \emph{can} have an appendix here.}

% You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most $8$ pages long.
% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.  

% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.
