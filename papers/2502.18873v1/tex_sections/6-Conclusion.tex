\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated a novel paradigm called \mosa{}.
\mosa{} combines independent exploration and iterative refinement among multiple LLMs to enhance reasoning diversity and accuracy. 
Experiments across benchmarks demonstrate its consistent advantages over single-LLM and multi-agent baselines, especially in complex tasks. 
This work underscores the potential of multi-agent collaboration in advancing search-based reasoning.
