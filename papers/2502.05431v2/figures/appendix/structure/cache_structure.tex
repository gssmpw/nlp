    \caption{Beyond the parallel cache structure discussed in the main paper, APE can be extended to handle more complex cache structures from external sources, where each context forms a tree-like hierarchy. In this setup, computations can be performed hierarchically along each branch, progressively merging intermediate results into the final value state.}
