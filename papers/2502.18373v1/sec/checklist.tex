%%% BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS %%%
% The checklist follows the references.  Please
% read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these
% questions.  For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to \answerYes{},
% \answerNo{}, or \answerNA{}.  You are strongly encouraged to include a {\bf
% justification to your answer}, either by referencing the appropriate section of
% your paper or providing a brief inline description.  For example:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerYes{See Section~\ref{gen_inst}.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNo{The code and the data are proprietary.}
%   \item Did you include the license to the code and datasets? \answerNA{}
% \end{itemize}
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers.  Note that the Checklist section does not count towards the page
% limit.  In your paper, please delete this instructions block and only keep the
