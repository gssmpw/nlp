\paragraph{Logical Reasoning Datasets}
Logical reasoning is a fundamental ability of intelligent systems and researchers have proposed a number of datasets to evaluate logical reasoning abilities of language models. 
These datasets can be divided into two groups: manually crafted ones and automatically generated ones. 
Human-crafted datasets are typically sourced from existing examinations~\citep{reclor, logiqa, logiqa2, arlsat} or directly written by domain experts~\citep{falseqa, folio}. 
Although they often exhibit higher quality and complexity, they also suffer from limited quantity and high creation costs.
Automatically generated datasets are often created using rules and predefined natural language templates~\citep{clutrr, ltl, ruletaker, tafjord2021proofwriter, logicnli, prontoqa1, prontoqaood, conditionalqa}. 
While these datasets enable automatic problem generation, they often lack linguistic diversity and are constrained by rigid, monotonous rules. 
None of them cover all aspects of first-order logic, and they cannot be used to generate problems with more complex rules.


\paragraph{Symbolic Prover Augmented LLMs}
Symbolic provers are computer programs used to generate proofs and solutions of mathematical theorems automatically. 
In logical reasoning problems, symbolic provers, such as SymPy~\citep{sympy}, Z3~\citep{z3}, Lean~\citep{lean}, Pyke~\citep{pyke} and Prover9~\citep{prover9}, stand out with faithful solutions and traceable intermediate processes. 
Recent works~\citep{logicllm, linc, satlm, zhang2024sola} combine LLMs and symbolic provers to solve logic reasoning problems. 
They use LLMs to translate problems from natural language into symbolic representations and then solve that problem with a symbolic prover. 
In contrast to previous works that utilize symbolic provers solely as problem solvers, our approach integrates symbolic provers into the generation process of first-order logic (FOL) problems. 
This integration allows us to bypass the intricate interrelations and couplings among logical relations, enabling the generation of diverse rules and their correct chaining to form comprehensive problems.
