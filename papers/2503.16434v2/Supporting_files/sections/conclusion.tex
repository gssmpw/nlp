\section{Conclusion}
We introduce \name, a multimodal collaborative problem-solving system that empowers large multimodal models (LMMs) to provide interactive, visual assistance for education. By integrating code-generated visualizations with step-by-step textual hints, \name\ bridges the gap between traditional text-based learning and intuitive, visual reasoning, transforming how students engage with complex problems. Our user studies demonstrate that this approach significantly improves task comprehension, problem-solving accuracy, and student engagement across mathematical domains. We believe that \name\ opens new pathways for multimodal human-AI collaboration in learning and sets the stage for more human-centered educational tools.
