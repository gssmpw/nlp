\title{\name: A Multimodal Tutoring System for Collaborative, Visual Problem-Solving}

%%
%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Humans have long relied on visual aids like sketches and diagrams to support reasoning and problem-solving. Visual tools, like auxiliary lines in geometry or graphs in calculus, are essential for understanding complex ideas. However, many tutoring systems remain text-based, providing feedback only through natural language. Leveraging recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), this paper introduces \name, a tutoring system that combines language-based explanations with interactive visualizations to enhance learning. Built on a pre-trained LMM, \name\ is fine-tuned to provide step-by-step guidance in both text and visuals, enabling natural multimodal interaction with the student. Accurate and robust diagrams are generated by incorporating code execution into the reasoning process. User studies conducted on math problems such as geometry, calculus, and trigonometry demonstrate that \name\ leads to improved task comprehension, problem-solving accuracy, and engagement levels, highlighting its potential for transforming educational technologies. All code is available at: \url{https://stevenshinechen.github.io/interactivesketchpad/}.

    \caption{\name\ enhances GPT-4oâ€™s ability to provide step-by-step, visual hints for problem-solving. Given a student query and problem statement, \name\ generates both textual hints and dynamic visual diagrams, allowing students to engage with the problem iteratively. Without \name, GPT-4o struggles to offer effective interactive guidance, frequently revealing the answer and not providing any visual aids, whereas \name\ enables a natural, multimodal learning experience that improves conceptual understanding.}
