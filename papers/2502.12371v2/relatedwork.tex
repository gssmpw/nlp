\section{Related Work}
Creating capable robots without requiring explicit programming of behaviors is a longstanding challenge in the field \cite{atkeson1997robot, argall2009survey, ravichandar2020recent}.
%In pursuit of this goal, imitation learning and behavior cloning  \cite{hussein2017imitation} have seen significant interest due to their appealing workflow. 
While conceptually simple, behavior cloning has shown surprising promise on an array of real-world robot tasks, including manipulation \cite{zhang2018deep, florence2019self, mandlekar2020learning, mandlekar2020iris, zeng2021transporter, rahmatizadeh2018vision, avigal2022speedfolding} and autonomous driving \cite{pomerleau1988alvinn, bojarski2016end}. Current behavior cloning approaches can be categorized into two groups, depending on the policy's structure.
