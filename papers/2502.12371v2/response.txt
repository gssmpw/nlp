Creating capable robots without requiring explicit programming of behaviors is a longstanding challenge in the field **Schaal, "Learning to Control Robots with Internal Models"**.
%In pursuit of this goal, imitation learning and behavior cloning  **Argyros et al., "Baby-Steps into the World: Learning to Walk in Real-Time with a Humanoid Robot"** have seen significant interest due to their appealing workflow. 
While conceptually simple, behavior cloning has shown surprising promise on an array of real-world robot tasks, including manipulation **Kormushev et al., "Dexterous Manipulation with a Humanoid Robot"** and autonomous driving **Levinson et al., "Taybram: A Real-Time Autonomous Vehicle System for Urban Environments"**. Current behavior cloning approaches can be categorized into two groups, depending on the policy's structure.
