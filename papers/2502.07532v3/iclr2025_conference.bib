abstract = {Abstract Forecasting for wind and solar renewable energy is becoming more important as the amount of energy generated from these sources increases. Forecast skill is improving, but so too is the way forecasts are being used. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the state-of-the-art of forecasting wind and solar energy. We describe approaches in statistical and physical modeling for time scales from minutes to days ahead, for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting. Our focus changes then to consider the future of forecasting for renewable energy. We discuss recent advances which show potential for great improvement in forecast skill. Beyond the forecast itself, we consider new products which will be required to aid decision making subject to risk constraints. Future forecast products will need to include probabilistic information, but deliver it in a way tailored to the end user and their specific decision making problems. Businesses operating in this sector may see a change in business models as more people compete in this space, with different combinations of skills, data and modeling being required for different products. The transaction of data itself may change with the adoption of blockchain technology, which could allow providers and end users to interact in a trusted, yet decentralized way. Finally, we discuss new industry requirements and challenges for scenarios with high amounts of renewable energy. New forecasting products have the potential to model the impact of renewables on the power system, and aid dispatch tools in guaranteeing system security.

abstract = {Systems that harvest environmental energy must carefully regulate their usage to satisfy their demand. Regulating energy usage is challenging if a system's demands are not elastic, since it cannot precisely scale its usage to match its supply. Instead, the system must choose how to satisfy its demands based on its current energy reserves and predictions of its future energy supply. In this paper, we show that prediction strategies that use weather forecasts are more accurate than prediction strategies based on the past, and are capable of improving the performance of a variety of systems. We analyze weather forecast, observational, and energy harvesting data to formulate a model that translates a weather forecast to a solar or wind energy harvesting prediction, and quantify its accuracy. We then compare the performance of three types of energy harvesting systems—a lexicographically fair sensor network, an off-the-grid sensor testbed, and a solar-powered smart home—using prediction models based on both forecasts and the past. In each case, forecast-based predictions significantly improve system performance.}

  abstract={In the last two decades, renewable energy forecasting progressed toward the development of advanced physical and statistical algorithms aiming at improving point and probabilistic forecast skill. This paper describes a forecasting framework to explore information from a grid of numerical weather predictions (NWP) applied to both wind and solar energy. The methodology combines the gradient boosting trees algorithm with feature engineering techniques that extract the maximum information from the NWP grid. Compared to a model that only considers one NWP point for a specific location, the results show an average point forecast improvement (in terms of mean absolute error) of 16.09% and 12.85% for solar and wind power, respectively. The probabilistic forecast improvement, in terms of continuous ranked probabilistic score, was 13.11% and 12.06%, respectively.},

New developments in this framework include an off-line volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it currently does not compete with operational weather forecasting models, our data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.},

              and climate prediction1,2. GCMs are physics-based simulators that
              combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned
              representations for small-scale processes such as cloud
              formation. Recently, machine-learning models trained on
              reanalysis data have achieved comparable or better skill than
              GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting3,4. However, these
              models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or
              shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate
              simulations. Here we present a GCM that combines a differentiable
              solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components
              and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather,
              ensemble weather and climate on par with the best
              machine-learning and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is
              competitive with machine-learning models for one- to ten-day
              forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
              Forecasts ensemble prediction for one- to fifteen-day forecasts.
              With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately
              track climate metrics for multiple decades, and climate forecasts
              with 140-kilometre resolution show emergent phenomena such as
              realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For
              both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude
              computational savings over conventional GCMs, although our model
              does not extrapolate to substantially different future climates.
              Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with
              tasks performed by conventional GCMs and can enhance the
              large-scale physical simulations that are essential for
              understanding and predicting the Earth system.",

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",
