\section{Related Work}
Ensemble MLWP can be done in multiple ways, such as perturbations to the input data \citep{chen2023fuxi, pathak2022fourcastnet, pangu, graubner2022calibration, bulte2024uncertainty} or by generative models based on latent variable formulations \citep{oskarsson2024probabilistic, SwinVRNN}, diffusion \citep{gencast, andrae2024continuousensembleweatherforecasting, shi2024codicastconditionaldiffusionmodel}, or flow-matching \citep{couairon2024archesweatherarchesweathergendeterministic}.

While directly using global MLWP forecasts (possibly with downscaling) for a specific region is possible, few works actually simulate the physics at high resolution only over a region of interest.
\citet{stretch_grid_norway} propose a stretched-grid approach to make regional forecasts with a global model. They focus on the Nordic region, where they use a higher resolution. 
The method is however deterministic and less modular and scalable, as it also necessitates learning to simulate global dynamics.
Existing deterministic LAM models include YingLong \citep{xu2024yinglongskillfulhighresolution} and Hi-LAM \citep{oskarsson2023graph-lam}.
StormCast \citep{stormCast} generates regional ensemble forecasts by deterministically predicting a mean and then applying diffusion to residuals for creating ensemble members. Unlike our work, StormCast conditions on a lower-resolution global model for the entire region rather than only the boundary. While StormCast has a high temporal resolution of \SI{1}{\hour}, their experiments are limited to forecasts up to only \SI{12}{\hour}.
\citet{oskarsson2024probabilistic} propose Graph-EFM, that produce probabilistic LAM forecasts based on a latent variable formulation. In contrast to our work, all methods above only leverage past boundary information $X^{t-1:t}_B$ up to the current time step $t$, resulting in discontinuities at the edge of the forecasting region (as we show for Graph-EFM in \cref{sec:results}). 
%We argue that this approach is suboptimal and propose a new method that integrates the boundary area of the next time step $X^{t+1}_B$ as well into each inference step, improving accuracy and consistency in limited area forecasting. 
Our method, as well as \citet{oskarsson2023graph-lam, oskarsson2024probabilistic}, extend to \SI{57}{\hour} forecasts, albeit at a temporal resolution of \SI{3}{\hour}. We explore related work in more detail in \cref{apx:related_work}.
