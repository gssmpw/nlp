\section{Conclusion}
% 在这篇论文中，我们提出了YoCo，一个仅使用click标注进行点云实例分割的框架。该框架意图缩小click-level的标注与全监督方法的性能差距。Our YoCo 主要从两个方向来进行优化，第一个是伪标签的生成，对此我们提出了VFM-PLG模块利用VFM模型的zero-shot能力结合点云的几何约束生成高质量的伪标签。第二个是标签更新，我们提出了TSU和ILE模块利用神经网络的泛化能力，对标签分别进行在线和离线的更新。大量的实验表明，我们的方法对比之前的弱监督方法实现了最好的性能，且超过了基于Cylinder3D的全监督方法。仅使用0.8%的标注数据得到与baseline相当的性能
In this paper, we introduce YoCo, a novel framework for LiDAR point cloud instance segmentation using only click-level annotations. YoCo aims to minimize the performance gap between click-level supervision and full supervision. We achieve this through two key components: the VFM-PLG module, which generates high-quality pseudo labels using the zero-shot capability of the VFM model combined with geometric constraints from the point cloud, and the TSU and ILE modules, which refine labels online and offline, leveraging neural network robustness and generalization.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that YoCo not only outperforms previous weakly supervised methods but also surpasses fully supervised methods based on the Cylinder3D, significantly reducing labeling costs while maintaining high segmentation performance. Additionally, our framework exhibits strong generality, making it applicable to various networks. These results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a practical solution for reducing annotation overhead in large-scale point cloud segmentation tasks.

% In this paper, we introduce the YoCo, a novel framework designed for LiDAR point cloud instance segmentation using only click-level annotations. The primary aim of YoCo is to reduce the performance gap between click-level supervised and fully supervised methods. Our YoCo framework focuses on two main aspects for optimization. First, for pseudo label generation, we propose the VFM-PLG module, which utilizes the zero-shot capability of the VFM model in conjunction with geometric constraints from the point cloud to generate high-quality pseudo labels. Second, we address label refinement by introducing the TSU and ILE modules, which leverage the generalization and robustness of neural networks for online and offline label updates, respectively.
% Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that YoCo not only outperforms previous weakly supervised methods but also surpasses fully supervised approaches based on Cylinder3D. Remarkably, our framework achieves performance comparable to the fully supervised baseline using only 0.8\% of the annotated data, significantly reducing labeling costs while maintaining high segmentation performance. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong generality, making it applicable to various network architectures. These results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a practical solution for reducing annotation overhead in large-scale point cloud segmentation tasks.
