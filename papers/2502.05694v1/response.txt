% LLMs have shown significant potential in zero-shot information extraction and knowledge graph construction. Wei et al. **Wei, "Zero-Shot Information Extraction with ChatIE"** introduced ChatIE, utilizing ChatGPT for zero-shot information extraction via conversational prompts. Zhu et al. **Zhu, "Knowledge Graph Reasoning and Construction with LLMs"** highlighted LLMs' capabilities in knowledge graph reasoning and construction, emphasizing their semantic understanding. Wu et al. **Wu, "Zero-Shot Construction of Chinese Medical Knowledge Graphs using GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4"** demonstrated the use of GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 in zero-shot construction of Chinese medical knowledge graphs, addressing domain-specific challenges. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs released by one specific company, leaving the performance of other LLMs in zero-shot end-to-end RE for Chinese unexplored.
