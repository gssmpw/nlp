\section{Related Work}
% LLMs have shown significant potential in zero-shot information extraction and knowledge graph construction. Wei et al.~\cite{wei2023chatie/chatie} introduced ChatIE, utilizing ChatGPT for zero-shot information extraction via conversational prompts. Zhu et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/www/ZhuWCQOYDCZ24/llms} highlighted LLMs' capabilities in knowledge graph reasoning and construction, emphasizing their semantic understanding. Wu et al.~\cite{wu2024zero/medical} demonstrated the use of GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 in zero-shot construction of Chinese medical knowledge graphs, addressing domain-specific challenges. However, most existing studies focus on LLMs released by one specific company, leaving the performance of other LLMs in zero-shot end-to-end RE for Chinese unexplored.
