    abstract = "Dialogue systems can leverage large pre-trained language models and knowledge to generate fluent and informative responses. However, these models are still prone to produce hallucinated responses not supported by the input source, which greatly hinders their application. The heterogeneity between external knowledge and dialogue context challenges representation learning and source integration, which further contributes to unfaithfulness. To handle this challenge and generate more faithful responses, this paper presents RHO (ρ) utilizing the representations of linked entities and relation predicates from a knowledge graph (KG). We propose (1) local knowledge grounding to combine textual embeddings with the corresponding KG embeddings; and (2) global knowledge grounding to equip RHO with multi-hop reasoning abilities via the attention mechanism. In addition, we devise a response re-ranking technique based on walks over KG sub-graphs for better conversational reasoning. Experimental results on OpenDialKG (Moon et al., 2019) show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both automatic and human evaluation by a large margin, especially in hallucination reduction (17.54{\%} in FeQA (Durmus et al., 2020)).",

abstract = {ChatGPT has enabled third-party developers to create plugins to expand ChatGPT's capabilities. These plugins are distributed through OpenAI's plugin store, making them easily accessible to users. With ChatGPT as the backbone, this app ecosystem has illustrated great business potential by offering users personalized services in a conversational manner. Nonetheless, many crucial aspects regarding app development, deployment, and security of this ecosystem have yet to be thoroughly studied in the research community, potentially hindering a broader adoption by both developers and users. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of the ChatGPT app ecosystem, aiming to illuminate its landscape for our research community. Our study examines the distribution and deployment models in the integration of LLMs and third-party apps, and assesses their security and privacy implications. We uncover an uneven distribution of functionality among ChatGPT plugins, highlighting prevalent and emerging topics. We also identify severe flaws in the authentication and user data protection for third-party app APIs integrated within LLMs, revealing a concerning status quo of security and privacy in this app ecosystem. Our work provides insights for the secure and sustainable development of this rapidly evolving ecosystem.},
