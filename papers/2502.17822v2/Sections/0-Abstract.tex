\begin{abstract}
Recent advancements in 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) have predominantly relied on tracking-by-detection pipelines. However, these approaches often neglect potential enhancements in 3D detection processes, leading to high false positives (FP), missed detections (FN), and identity switches (IDS), particularly in challenging scenarios such as crowded scenes, small-object configurations, and adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, limitations in data preprocessing, association mechanisms, motion modeling, and life-cycle management hinder overall tracking robustness. To address these issues, we present \textbf{Easy-Poly}, a real-time, filter-based 3D MOT framework for multiple object categories. Our contributions include: (1) An \textit{Augmented Proposal Generator} utilizing multi-modal data augmentation and refined SpConv operations, significantly improving mAP and NDS on nuScenes; (2) A \textbf{Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO)} data association algorithm that effectively manages uncertainties and occlusions through optimal assignment and multiple hypothesis handling; (3) A \textbf{Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM)} incorporating a confidence-weighted Kalman filter and adaptive noise covariances, enhancing MOTA and AMOTA in challenging conditions; and (4) An extended life-cycle management system with adjustive thresholds to reduce ID switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly~\cite{li2024fast}, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30\% to 64.96\% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1\% to 74.5\%), while also running in real-time. These findings highlight Easy-Poly's adaptability and robustness in diverse scenarios, making it a compelling choice for autonomous driving and related 3D MOT applications. The source code of this paper will be published upon acceptance.

% 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is essential for autonomous driving systems, contributing significantly to vehicle safety and navigation. Despite recent advancements, existing 3D tracking methods still face significant challenges in accuracy, particularly when dealing with small objects, crowded environments, and adverse weather conditions. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{Easy-Poly}, a novel and efficient multi-modal 3D MOT framework. \textbf{Easy-Poly} employs the Focal Sparse Convolution (\textbf{FocalsConv}) model for object detection. By optimizing convolution operations and augmenting data with multiple modalities, we significantly enhance detection precision.
% \textbf{Easy-Poly} introduces several key innovations: (1) an optimized Kalman filter in the pre-processing stage, (2) integration of the Dynamic Track-Oriented (\textbf{DTO}) Data Association algorithm with confidence-weighted motion models for data association, (3) Dynamic Motion Modeling (\textbf{DMM}) with Adaptive Noise Covariances, and (4) enhanced trajectory management throughout the tracking life-cycle. These improvements increase the robustness and efficiency of tracking, especially in complex scenarios such as crowded scenes and challenging weather conditions. Experimental results on the \textbf{nuScenes} dataset demonstrate that in the pre-processing stage of \textbf{Easy-Poly}, the optimized \textbf{FocalsConv} model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of \textbf{64.96\%} for object detection. Furthermore, the multi-object tracking performance reaches a high AMOTA of \textbf{75.0\%}, surpassing existing methods across multiple performance metrics.
