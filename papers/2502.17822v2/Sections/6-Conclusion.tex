In this paper, we presented Easy-Poly, a real-time 3D multi-object tracking system that integrates refined detection and robust tracking within a unified pipeline. By employing an augmented proposal generator with improved sparse convolutions and multi-modal data augmentation, we significantly enhanced detection accuracy and speed, especially in dense traffic and small-object scenarios. Our framework also incorporates score filtering, non-maximum suppression, a dynamic track-oriented association module, and a dynamic motion modeling strategy with adaptive Kalman filtering and confidence weighting. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that Easy-Poly outperforms existing baselines in both detection and tracking metrics, demonstrating stronger robustness in challenging and adverse conditions.
