\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Book-Based Datasets for LLMs:} The accessibility and diversity of books has encouraged their adoption in dataset creation for pre-training LLMs \cite{goldberg-orwant-2013-dataset, gao2020pile800gbdatasetdiverse, devlin2019bertpretrainingdeepbidirectional}. Curating books used in training can promote better performance on complex tasks such as long-form text summarization \cite{kryściński2022booksumcollectiondatasetslongform, ladhak-etal-2020-exploring}, narrative question answering \cite{kočiský2017narrativeqareadingcomprehensionchallenge}, and even multilingual text summarization \cite{scire-etal-2023-echoes}. This better performance carries over to fine-tuning as well, especially in genre-specific and creative writing tasks \cite{basyal2023textsummarizationusinglarge, agarwal-etal-2022-creativesumm, wang2024weaverfoundationmodelscreative}. Our work extends this research by developing a decade-stratified book corpus for temporal bias analysis.

\textbf{Temporal Bias in Language Models:} Data collected at different points in time reflect the evolving behaviors and attitudes of the populations studied \cite{olteanu2019social}. These temporal shifts introduce biases, known as \textit{temporal concept drifts}, into LLM training processes \cite{zhao-etal-2022-impact}, which impact tasks such as rumor detection \cite{mu-etal-2023-time}, abusive language detection \cite{jin2023examiningtemporalbiasabusive}, first story detection \cite{Wurzer_2020}, and creative writing \cite{10.1145/3532106.3533526}. Our decade-stratified dataset enables a novel approach to examining these temporal biases in LLMs.

\textbf{Bias Perpetuation in Book-Trained LLMs:} Negative bias perpetuation is a common issue with LLMs \cite{nissim-etal-2020-fair}, targeting specific social groups like women and minorities within text generation tasks \cite{abid2021persistentantimuslimbiaslarge, gonen-goldberg-2019-lipstick, sheng-etal-2019-woman}. Training on books can exacerbate this problem as they have been shown to perpetuate outdated social norms, influencing representations of gender in children's literature and movies \cite{toro-isaza-etal-2023-fairy, gooden2001gender, xu2019cinderella}, reinforcing antisemitic ideas \cite{tripodi-etal-2019-tracing}, and sustaining negative African American stereotypes \cite{kocyigit2023novelmethodanalysingracial}. Our work builds on these findings by evaluating biases across a broader range of demographics and roles, offering a comprehensive analysis of bias evolution in literature over time.
