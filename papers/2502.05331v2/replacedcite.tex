\textbf{Book-Based Datasets for LLMs:} The accessibility and diversity of books has encouraged their adoption in dataset creation for pre-training LLMs ____. Curating books used in training can promote better performance on complex tasks such as long-form text summarization ____, narrative question answering ____, and even multilingual text summarization ____. This better performance carries over to fine-tuning as well, especially in genre-specific and creative writing tasks ____. Our work extends this research by developing a decade-stratified book corpus for temporal bias analysis.

\textbf{Temporal Bias in Language Models:} Data collected at different points in time reflect the evolving behaviors and attitudes of the populations studied ____. These temporal shifts introduce biases, known as \textit{temporal concept drifts}, into LLM training processes ____, which impact tasks such as rumor detection ____, abusive language detection ____, first story detection ____, and creative writing ____. Our decade-stratified dataset enables a novel approach to examining these temporal biases in LLMs.

\textbf{Bias Perpetuation in Book-Trained LLMs:} Negative bias perpetuation is a common issue with LLMs ____, targeting specific social groups like women and minorities within text generation tasks ____. Training on books can exacerbate this problem as they have been shown to perpetuate outdated social norms, influencing representations of gender in children's literature and movies ____, reinforcing antisemitic ideas ____, and sustaining negative African American stereotypes ____. Our work builds on these findings by evaluating biases across a broader range of demographics and roles, offering a comprehensive analysis of bias evolution in literature over time.
