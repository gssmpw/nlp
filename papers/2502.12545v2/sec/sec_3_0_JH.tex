Given a set of equirectangular projection (ERP) images, our goal is to reconstruct the geometry and texture of real-world scenes. In Fig. \ref{fig:pipeline}, 
our pipeline is composed of three primary components: Spherical Structure from Motion (SfM), geometry reconstruction, and texture optimization. To address challenges associated with limited overlap and frequent occlusions in indoor environments, our method leverages the wide field of view inherent in spherical imagery. We perform SfM utilizing a spherical camera model and dense features to estimate camera poses from sparsely scanned images in textureless regions. For 3D geometric reconstruction accurately, we converted ERP images into cubemaps and conducted training on the resulting perspective images. Then, we employ a neural model \cite{xiao2024debsdf} that represents a signed distance function (SDF). After training the model, we extract the mesh using the Marching Cubes algorithm \cite{marchingcube} and apply classical texture mapping \cite{waechter2014TexRecon} to initialize texture. Finally, we optimize the texture for diffuse, specular and small MLP components using differentiable rendering \cite{nvdiffrast}.    
% Initially, we attempted to define rays using the spherical camera model for training but observed a decline in reconstruction quality. Similarly, OmniSDF did not yield accurate results. 
% Then, we converted ERP images into cubemaps and conducted training on the resulting perspective images.

% For texture map optimization, we leverage differentiable rasterization techniques by integrating Multi-View Stereo Texturing (MVS-Texturing) and Gaussian Splatting. 
% MVS-Texturing is particularly effective in sparse scenes where details are not prominently visible, while Gaussian Splatting excels in densely scanned scenes. 
% By potentially combining these two methods, we aim to capitalize on their respective strengths. 
% Additionally, the use of differentiable rendering allows us to reduce noise in areas where seams occur, enhancing overall texture quality.
