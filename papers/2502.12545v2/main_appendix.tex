In this supplementary material, we provide additional qualitative results, highlighting the superior performance of our method compared to other approaches.
Appendix \ref{sphericalsfm} highlights the advantages of the spherical camera model and the dense matching algorithm for indoor reconstruction. Appendix \ref{texture} demonstrates the effectiveness of our novel texturing method.

\section{Spherical Structure from Motion}
\label{sphericalsfm}
Due to page limitations, we present our spherical structure from motion results in the supplementary material: 1) \textbf{OpenMVG:} An open-source SfM pipeline that supports spherical camera models \cite{moulon2017openmvg}.
2) \textbf{SPSG COLMAP:} SuperPoint \cite{detone2018superpoint} and SuperGlue \cite{sarlin2020superglue} are used with cubemap and equirectangular projection.
3) \textbf{DKM COLMAP:} This method leverages DKM \cite{edstedt2023dkm} to establish dense correspondences, utilizing cubemap and equirectangular projection.
4) \textbf{SphereGlue COLMAP:} SuperPoint \cite{detone2018superpoint} with a local planar approximation \cite{eder2020tangent} and SphereGlue \cite{gava2023sphereglue} are utilized to mitigate distortion in ERP images.
The experimental results discussed in the main paper for Matterport3D \cite{chang2017matterport3d} and Stanford2D3D \cite{Stanford2d3d} are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sfm_mp3d} and Fig. \ref{fig:sfm_stfd}, respectively.

\section{Texture Map Optimization}
\label{texture}
We compare our method with several recent rendering approaches, including \textbf{TexRecon} \cite{waechter2014TexRecon}, \textbf{SparseGS} \cite{xiong2023sparsegs}, and \textbf{ZipNeRF} \cite{barron2023zip}. 
Our method outperforms these approaches by delivering higher frequency details and producing seamless texture maps.
The results of the textured mesh and rendering are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:textured_mesh} and Fig. \ref{fig:render1} - \ref{fig:render4}.

% \section{Rationale}
% \label{sec:rationale}
% % 
% Having the supplementary compiled together with the main paper means that:
% % 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The supplementary can back-reference sections of the main paper, for example, we can refer to \cref{sec:intro};
% \item The main paper can forward reference sub-sections within the supplementary explicitly (e.g. referring to a particular experiment); 
% \item When submitted to arXiv, the supplementary will already included at the end of the paper.
% \end{itemize}
