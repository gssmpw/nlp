    \caption{IBURD pipeline: The source image with its pixel-level annotation and background image are fed as inputs. The first pass resizes and rotates the source object and selects a location for blending it. Poisson editing smooths the boundary between the object and the background. The second pass changes the style to produce the final image. In the zoomed-in region of the object, the style difference between the appearance of the first and second pass image is visible.}
