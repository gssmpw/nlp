  \caption{Demonstration of object detection on board the LoCO AUV~\cite{loco_paper_2020} in the Caribbean sea. The detection model is only trained on a synthetic dataset generated with our proposed pipeline. Magenta denotes starfish detection and green denotes can detection, where the color corresponds to the illuminated LEDs on the left ``eye''~\cite{fulton2023hreyes} of the robot. Both objects are successfully detected.}
