The proposed method, Activation by Interval-wise Dropout (AID), improves neural network adaptability by mitigating plasticity lossâ€”a critical challenge in continual and reinforcement learning. This enhancement enables better generalization in dynamic environments, making AID applicable across both domains. These advancements contribute to more robust AI systems capable of efficiently handling real-world tasks, such as autonomous systems and personalized user experiences.
