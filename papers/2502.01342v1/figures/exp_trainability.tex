    \caption{\textbf{Results for Trainability Experiments.} We plot the train accuracy comparisons across different optimizers on Permuted MNIST and Random Label MNIST for each method, with the x-axis representing tasks. For visibility, we did not show the region using standard deviation. Notably, AID consistently achieves high accuracy across all conditions, demonstrating its robustness in maintaining trainability.}
