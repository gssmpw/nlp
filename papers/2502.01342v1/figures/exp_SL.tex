\caption{\textbf{Learning Curves on Standard Supervised Learning.} The figure presents training and test accuracy curves for CIFAR-10 (CNN), CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and TinyImageNet (VGG-16). We divide learning rate by 10 at 100th and 150th epochs. AID not only effectively mitigates plasticity loss but also reduces the generalization gap, demonstrating its robustness in both continual and standard supervised learning settings.}
