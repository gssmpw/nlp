    \caption{\textbf{Results on Reinforcement Learning.} We train DQN model with a replay ratio of 1.  The plot presents the IQM Human Normalized Score for 17 Atari games, with shaded regions representing the 95\% confidence intervals across 5 random seeds. The results indicate that AID significantly improves sample efficiency compared to the vanilla model.}
