\input{tables/trustreporting}
We evaluate the effect of asking users to report trust on their decision-making performance and reliance on the AI assistant, finding that user performance stays largely the same (Table~\ref{tab:trustreporting}).

\input{tables/aiexperience}

Table~\ref{tab:userfamiliarity} and Table~\ref{tab:userusage} show how user experience with AI, and specifically using it for fact checking, affects user reliance on AI assistance, again finding that reliance behavior is similar.
