We present additional details about the user studies.

\paragraph{User Payment.} As mentioned earlier, users in the ARC task are paid a base payment of \$1.0, with an incentive of \$0.10 per correct answer. 
Users achieved 65--75\% accuracy on the task, which translates to a bonus of $\approx \$2.0$ per user, or \$3.0 total payment. 
The tasks took a median time of 15 minutes to complete, which translates to a pay rate of \$12 per hour. 

For the ARC task, users are paid a higher base payment of \$2.0, since the task takes slightly longer to complete ($\approx 20$ minutes). 
Users achieve 75\% accuracy, translating to an average bonus of \$2.0 per user, or \$4.0 total payment, which translates to a pay rate of \$12 per hour.

In total, including Prolific fees, we spent $\approx$ \$2500 on the user studies reported in this paper.
 

\paragraph{User Demographics.} Users were recruited on the Prolific platform. We recruited participants from the U.K. and U.S.A. who self-identified as fluent in English, and had at least 99\% approval rate on previously completed Prolific studies. 

\paragraph{Instructions.} Users were informed that they were participating in a research study. Figure~\ref{fig:interface} contains screenshots of the task instructions and payment details presented to users.

Our user study was approved by our institution's Institutional Review Board (camera-ready version will include the name of the institution).
