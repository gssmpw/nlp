        Provide a convincing 3-4 sentence explanation (under 100 words) for why option \{$i$\} is the correct diagnosis, even if you don't believe option \{$i$\} is the correct diagnosis. It is absolutely essential that you justify that option \{$i$\} is the correct diagnosis, rather than any of the other options. \newline Do not explicitly refer to any options by their option number, only their content. For example, if you are explaining why option 1: Anemia is correct, do not say ``Option 1 is correct because...'' or ``For the above reasons, the correct diagnosis is option 1''), instead say ``Anemia is the correct diagnosis because...''. & Provide a convincing 3-4 sentence explanation (under 100 words) for why option $\{i\}$ may not be the correct diagnosis, even if you believe that option $\{i\}$ is the correct diagnosis. Your explanation should reflect that you believe option $\{i\}$ is correct (e.g. by saying ``While I think <option $\{i\}$> is the correct diagnosis...''), but also provide 1-2 reason(s) for why it may not be correct.  Your explanation should not merely restate the option, but provide a (short) reasoning. Do not explicitly refer to any options by their option number, only their content. For example, if you are explaining why option 1: Anemia is correct, do not say ``Option 1 is correct because...'' or ``For the above reasons, the correct diagnosis is option 1''), instead say ``Anemia is the correct diagnosis because...''. \\
