\section{Related Work}
The framework we based our work on was developed by McCall and Kölling based on thematic analysis of student submissions that were automatically collected____. In subsequent studies, this framework was evaluated and refined____. Thus, it is a well-tested and established framework, making it the best choice for describing errors of students. It consists of 11 categories of errors, of which 4 describe syntactical errors and 6 semantic errors (one additional category contains unspecified errors). Each of the 11 categories is described by several subcategories. For example, the category \emph{9.0 Simple syntactical errors} consists of subcategories, such as \emph{9.8 Extraneous closing curly brace} and \emph{9.3 ; missing}. In its original version, it does not contain categories for logical errors.

Several other frameworks exist, as well. Hristova and others were the first to propose a framework to describe students errors beyond compiler-based analysis____. Based on interviews with educators and students, they described the most common errors, which they divide into syntax, semantic, and logical errors, each of which are refined in several subcategories. This framework was tested and extended by Brown and Altamdri as well as Mase and Nel____. However, it lacks the modular extensibility of the framework developed by McCall and Kölling, due to its flat hierarchy and more rigid categorization. Additionally, while McCall and Kölling's error categorization encompasses all error types identified by Brown and Altamdri, the reverse does not hold true____. Their framework has fewer specific subcategories, while the super categories are not meant to contain unspecified programming errors.

There is considerable further research on how to categorize student errors, focusing on logical errors____, static analysis errors____, or compiler messages____. However, none of these frameworks are sufficiently detailed or focused on concrete programming errors to describe the variety of student errors that can be observed.
