\section*{Limitations}
In this work, we employed LLMs to simulate students at different knowledge levels, serving as a proxy for real-world learners. While these simulated students offer convenience and scalability, their representation of the human learning process is inherently limited. The role-playing behavior may differ from that of actual students in tutoring scenarios. Future research should focus on improving the reliability of student simulation to better align with real-world human learning.

In addition, the tutor agents were primarily evaluated by interacting with simulated students in our experimental setup. It remains unclear how these agents would perform when guiding humans toward completing target coding tasks. An important direction for future work is to extend our evaluation protocol by incorporating human-in-the-loop assessments, where tutor agents interact directly with actual students with necessary programming backgrounds. This would offer deeper insights into the practical effectiveness of the developed agents in real-world settings.


\section*{Ethics Statement}
We strictly follow the protocols governing the academic use of all LLMs. Our experimental datasets are publicly available and contain no sensitive or private information. We acknowledge that utterances generated by these LLMs may exhibit hallucinations or biases. By highlighting these issues, we aim to raise awareness among practitioners if the tutor agents are deployed to interact with real-world students in the future. Additionally, we used AI assistants, such as Github Copilot and ChatGPT, to assist with our experimentation.
