\section{Conclusion}

We introduced \sys, a system that efficiently manages precomputed states corresponding to the chunks of the knowledge base for RAG. 
We presented several in-depth analyses of real production workloads showing several interesting characteristics of RAG-systems that show significant opportunities for \textit{chunk-cache} reuse but also highlight the technical challenges. 
With our novel technique for identifying reusable chunks, selective recompute, and cache management policies, we show that \sys can provide a significant speed-up without compromising the quality for real production workloads as well as popular RAG datasets.
