Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. 
%
The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both the inherent data properties and the specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a crucial research problem.
%
Existing solutions typically involve sampling and validating numerous candidate structures; this is computationally expensive, limiting their practical applications.
%
We address this challenge by formulating tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and proposing a highly efficient validation method that is based on constraint solving. 
%
Specifically, we design a domain specific language: it builds the correspondence between programs and network structures, and uses a novel idea of \emph{output-directed splits} to compress the search space without hindering the expressiveness. 
We then propose a synthesis algorithm that can prioritize  promising candidates through constraint solving. 
%
%
Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios by $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art.
%
Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are out of reach by prior work. 
Finally, we demonstrate that the discovered topologies generalize to data from the same source, achieving compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than hierarchical Tuckers while maintaining the runtime around $110$ seconds.
