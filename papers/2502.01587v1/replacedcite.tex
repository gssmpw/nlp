\subsection{Game-Theoretic Solvers with LLMs}
The combination of a game-theoretic solver with prompt optimization, which we use in this work, is not the only paradigm for utilizing LLMs to solve games. 
Widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning____, agentic workflow____, as well as the recent trend of improving reasoning and problem-solving capabilities for complex and mathematical problems by having LLMs generate longer chains of thought prior to making decisions____, are also very promising directions.

Recent advancements in LLMs have shown their impressive potential in the realm of persuasion. 
A growing body of research highlights how these models can enhance human communicative abilities and even autonomously generate persuasive content across various contexts.

For instance, ____ demonstrated that refining complaint narratives with ChatGPT significantly improved consumers' chances of obtaining redress from financial institutions, showcasing the role of LLMs in boosting human persuasive efforts.

These studies illustrate that LLMs are not only capable of enhancing human persuasion but also of autonomously refining and executing persuasive strategies.

The impact of LLM-generated persuasive text on human behavior has been demonstrated across a diverse range of domains. 
For example, ____ showed that GPT-3.5 could influence political attitudes, while ____ found that GPT-3’s vaccine campaign messages were more effective than those created by professionals. 
Additionally, LLM-powered romantic chatbots have been shown to sustain human engagement longer than human-to-human conversations____. 
In strategic contexts, LLMs have achieved human-level negotiation capabilities in games like Diplomacy____, and algorithmic suggestions have been shown to shape emotional language in messaging____. 
These examples collectively highlight the broad applicability of LLMs in persuasive tasks and their significant influence on human decision-making.

However, the increasing persuasive power of LLMs also raises concerns about potential misuse. 
____ found that LLMs outperform humans in personalized debates, achieving a higher rate of belief change in one-on-one discussions. 
This raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding the risks of misinformation and manipulation. 
For instance, ____ demonstrated that LLMs can convincingly fabricate medical facts, further complicating the ethical landscape. 
The ability of LLMs to produce persuasive yet misleading content underscores the need for stronger oversight, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, politics, and public discourse.
Recent studies have thus emphasized the necessity of ethical frameworks as LLMs become more adept at persuasion. 
While LLMs have shown persuasive power across various tasks and domains____, they also pose risks, particularly for vulnerable populations. 
____ highlighted that characteristics such as race, gender, and sexual identity may subject certain groups to greater risks of algorithmic persuasion and bias, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities. 
% Therefore, while LLMs offer significant benefits in persuasive interactions, their deployment demands careful ethical and societal consideration.

From a computational standpoint, ____ provided a novel proof showing that discovering persuasive messages is NP-hard, while adopting persuasive strategies provided by others is NP-easy. 
This insight adds to our understanding of the complexity involved in generating persuasive content and demonstrates why LLMs, with their vast data-processing capabilities, are particularly adept at these tasks.
Building on these insights, our work explores how game-theoretic methods can be leveraged to enhance the persuasive capabilities of LLMs in purely multi-agent LLM systems. 
Unlike previous studies that primarily measure the impact of LLM-generated persuasive text on humans, we investigate how multiple LLMs can engage in persuasive interactions with one another, optimizing their strategies using game-theoretic approaches.

\subsection{LLMs in Strategic Interactions}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have showcased their potential in reasoning and planning, particularly in strategic interactions. 
LLMs have demonstrated strong capabilities in in-context learning, allowing them to reason about possible outcomes____ and plan their actions to achieve strategic objectives____. 
However, their performance in game environments can vary significantly depending on the type of game, as shown by ____, where LLMs struggled in different ways across various games. 
To address these challenges, ____ introduced an automated ``prompt compiler'' that facilitates strategic reasoning by constructing demonstrations, enabling LLMs to solve games through in-context learning. 
Similarly, ____ designed an action space of ``intents'' to control a generative language model, also leveraging in-context learning, which aligns closely with the approach taken in our work here. 
Additionally, game-theoretic models have been employed to improve the factual accuracy of LLMs____ and enhance their security____. 
For a broader overview of LLMs in strategic reasoning, ____ provides a comprehensive survey.

The BP problem, however, goes beyond mere reasoning or planning. 
It requires the ability to anticipate and account for the intentions, beliefs, and goals of other participants-a hallmark of game-theoretic settings. 
While some initial studies have begun to explore how LLMs perform in game environments, most of this work focuses on leveraging in-context learning. 
For example, research has examined LLMs' behavior in matrix games____, repeated games____, economic mechanisms like auctions____, and collective decision-making scenarios____. 
These studies collectively illustrate the potential of LLMs to navigate complex environments that require both strategic thinking and interaction with other agents.

In contrast to prior work that primarily evaluates LLMs' reasoning or game-playing capabilities through in-context learning or agentic workflows, our approach focuses specifically on solving the BP problem. 
Our key contribution lies in providing a general interface that integrates LLMs with game-theoretic solvers to address BP problems effectively. 
Based on this interface, we propose a solution framework called VBP, which combines prompt optimization with game-theoretic methods. 
This framework offers a convergence guarantee to equilibrium solutions, ensuring robust performance.

\paragraph{Remark 1}  

While both our work and____ leverage BP, they address fundamentally different problem spaces. 
____ apply classic BP as a tool for model alignment, optimizing signaling strategies between a smaller ``Advisor'' model and a larger ``Receiver'' model to improve downstream task performance in areas like mathematical reasoning and code generation. 
In contrast, our work extends BP into natural language settings by introducing a verbalized BP framework, enabling strategic communication through real-world dialogue. 
This involves novel methods such as transforming agents' policy optimization into prompt optimization and developing equilibrium-finding algorithms in the language space. 
These differences highlight the complementary nature of the two approaches: ____ focus on BP-driven alignment for structured tasks, while our contributions advance BP for complex, dialogue-based applications.
