\paragraph{Dynamic Interacting System \& Graph ODEs}
%Dynamic system modeling has been recognized and extensively studied for decades.
Early practices leverage the recurrent models  to study the sequential pattern of the objects.
Given the correlation among objects, GNNs ____ are then incorporated with the recurrent models ____.
%____.
In recent years, graph ODEs show encouraging results for modeling the correlation and evolvement collaboratively ____.
____ introduce second-order ODE on graphs,
 while  ____ consider the structural evolvement to model the dynamic correlation, and
____ reconsider the graph structure of dynamic systems.
% In parallel, physics-informed neural nets primarily focus on solving PDEs ____, and have not been related to graph dynamics yet.
Recently, ____ study  time-reversal symmetric systems. ____ present a new parameterization of brackets for learning irreversible dynamics. ____ further develop a  graph attention mechanism  to enable the irreversibility in deep GNNs.
%So far, existing methods work with the Euclidean space to model system dynamics. 
Different from previous works, we build the differential system upon Riemannian manifold, considering the entropy increasing of dynamic systems.

\paragraph{Riemannian Deep Learning on Graphs}
%Riemannian manifold is  drawing increasing attentions in recent years for its alignment to graph geometry.
Categorized by the geometry, 
hyperbolic space is suitable to hierarchical structures and show the superiority to the Euclidean counterpart ____.
Hyperspherical space achieves remarkable success to embed cyclical structures ____.
Recent studies further investigate the constant curvature spaces ____, product spaces ____, quotient spaces ____, SPD manifolds ____, etc. 
%Grassmann manifold ____
For dynamic graphs, there exist Riemannian models focusing on link prediction and/or node classification ____.
%, which is essentially different from the regression of dynamic system as ours.
Recently, Ricci curvature is introduced to structure learning ____ or clustering ____, while its physics aspects are not explored.
Also, we notice that ____ studies Riemannian ODEs or SDEs as generative models.

% However, they present as continuous normalizing flows or denoising diffusion models for data generation, and thereby are orthogonal to our study.
