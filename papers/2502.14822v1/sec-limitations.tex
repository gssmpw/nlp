\section*{Limitations}
This survey examines the evolution of IR models, with particular emphasis on challenges arising from LLMs and their implications for future architectures. 
Due to space constraints, we focus on representative works rather than providing an exhaustive review, with supplementary discussions of interdisciplinary research included in the Appendix. 

\section*{Ethical Considerations}
As this paper solely reviews existing IR developments and future research directions, we believe it presents no direct ethical concerns.
