    \caption{\textbf{Shape from Semantics Pipeline.} For given semantics, we first adopt a 2D generative model to supervise and design a rough geometric shape, and then use diffusion models for image restoration and video generation to generate more high-quality images. Finally, we use SDF representation to reconstruct the detailed shape under the supervision of generated images and Gaussian masks. Our shape is fabricable and can be produced by 3D printing.}
