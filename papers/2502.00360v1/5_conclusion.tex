\section{Conclusion \& Discussion}
We proposed and addressed a novel problem: generating shapes from multi-view semantics. The core of our approach is to leverage generative models for design and optimization. Experimental results demonstrated that our method successfully produced impressive shapes that are aesthetically pleasing, semantically aligned with the input, and easy to manufacture.

Our method still has some limitations. Despite several strategies that have been designed to align geometry and semantics, satisfactory results cannot be guaranteed under all semantic conditions. 
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:limitation}, this case achieves semantic alignment in rendering, but their geometry remains suboptimal. One potential solution is to consider the primary views as optimizable parameters, allowing them to adjust moderately during the generation process. This could enhance the compatibility of shapes with different semantics. We leave it for future work.
