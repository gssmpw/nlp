	abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs - extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

The approach is based on a bootstrap technique that uses a combination of observed and artificially generated data. The latter serves to induce a prior distribution which, as we will demonstrate, is critical to effective exploration. We explain how the approach can be applied to multi-armed bandit and reinforcement learning problems and how it relates to Thompson sampling. The approach is particularly well-suited for contexts in which exploration is coupled with deep learning, since in these settings, maintaining or generating samples from a posterior distribution becomes computationally infeasible.},

	abstract = {The containment rate of query Q1 in query Q2 over database D is the percentage of Q1's result tuples over D that are also in Q2's result over D. We directly estimate containment rates between pairs of queries over a specific database. For this, we use a specialized deep learning scheme, CRN, which is tailored to representing pairs of SQL queries. Result-cardinality estimation is a core component of query optimization. We describe a novel approach for estimating queries result-cardinalities using estimated containment rates among queries. This containment rate estimation may rely on CRN or embed, unchanged, known cardinality estimation methods. Experimentally, our novel approach for estimating cardinalities, using containment rates between queries, on a challenging real-world database, realizes significant improvements to state of the art cardinality estimation methods.},

MSCN is a multi-set convolutional network, tailored to representing relational query plans, that employs set semantics to capture query features and true cardinalities. MSCN builds on sampling-based estimation, addressing its weaknesses when no sampled tuples qualify a predicate, and in capturing join-crossing correlations. Our evaluation of MSCN using a real-world dataset shows that deep learning significantly enhances the quality of cardinality estimation, which is the core problem in query optimization.},

We present a novel approach using neural networks to learn and approximate selectivity functions that take a bounded range on each column as input, effectively estimating selectivities for all relational operators.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

Although it has been shown that these models obtain good performance on this task, often superior to other state-of-the-art techniques, they suffer from some important drawbacks, including a very long training time and limitations on the number of context words that can be taken into account in practice. Recent extensions to recurrent neural network models have been developed in an attempt to address these drawbacks. This paper gives an overview of the most important extensions. Each technique is described and its performance on statistical language modeling, as described in the existing literature, is discussed. Our structured overview makes it possible to detect the most promising techniques in the field of recurrent neural networks, applied to language modeling, but it also highlights the techniques for which further research is required.},

In this paper, we implement both progress indicators in the same commercial RDBMS to investigate their performance. We summarize common cases in which they are both accurate and cases in which they fail to provide reliable estimates. Although there are differences in their performance, much more striking is the similarity in the errors they make due to a common simplifying uniform future speed assumption. While the developers of these progress indicators were aware that this assumption could cause errors, they neither explored how large the errors might be nor did they investigate the feasibility of removing the assumption. To rectify this we propose a new query progress indicator, similar to these early progress indicators but without the uniform speed assumption. Experiments show that on the TPC-H benchmark, on queries for which the original progress indicators have errors up to 30X the query running time, the new progress indicator is accurate to within 10 percent. We also discuss the sources of the errors that still remain and shed some light on what would need to be done to eliminate them.},

Due to the well known NP hardness of subgraph queries, those queries may sometimes take a long time to complete. Our recent investigation on real- world datasets revealed that the performance of queries on graphs generally varies greatly. In other words, query clients may occasionally encounter “unexpectedly” long execution from a subgraph query processor. This paper aims to demonstrate a tool that alleviates the problem by monitoring subgraph query progress. Specifically, we present a novel subgraph query progress indicator called PIGEON that exploits query-time information to report to users accurate estimated query progress. In the demonstration, users may interact with PIGEON to gain insights on the query evaluation, which include the following: Users are enabled to (i) monitor query progress; (ii) analyze the causes of long query times; and (iii) abort queries that run abnormally long, which may sometimes contain human errors.},

After discussing the goals and challenges inherent in this problem, we present a set of techniques sufficient for implementing a simple yet useful progress indicator for a large subset of RDBMS queries. We report an initial implementation of these techniques in PostgreSQL.},

	abstract = {Time-oriented progress estimation for parallel queries is a challenging problem that has received only limited attention. In this paper, we present ParaTimer, a new type of time-remaining indicator for parallel queries. Several parallel data processing systems exist. ParaTimer targets environments where declarative queries are translated into ensembles of MapReduce jobs. ParaTimer builds on previous techniques and makes two key contributions. First, it estimates the progress of queries that translate into directed acyclic graphs of MapReduce jobs, where jobs on different paths can execute concurrently (unlike prior work that looked at sequences only). For such queries, we use a new type of critical-path-based progress-estimation approach. Second, ParaTimer handles a variety of real systems challenges such as failures and data skew. To handle unexpected changes in query execution times due to runtime condition changes, ParaTimer provides users with not only one but with a set of time-remaining estimates, each one corresponding to a different carefully selected scenario. We implement our estimator in the Pig system and demonstrate its performance on experiments running on a real, small-scale cluster.},

Although similar in structure to traditional histograms, these histograms infer data distributions not by examining the data or a sample thereof, but by using feedback from the query execution engine about the actual selectivity of range selection operators to progressively refine the histogram. Since the cost of building and maintaining self-tuning histograms is independent of the data size, self-tuning histograms provide a remarkably inexpensive way to construct histograms for large data sets with little up-front costs. Self-tuning histograms are particularly attractive as an alternative to multi-dimensional traditional histograms that capture dependencies between attributes but are prohibitively expensive to build and maintain. In this paper, we describe the techniques for initializing and refining self-tuning histograms. Our experimental results show that self-tuning histograms provide a low-cost alternative to traditional multi-dimensional histograms with little loss of accuracy for data distributions with low to moderate skew.},

This tutorial provides a comprehensive review of such systems and analyzes key data management challenges and techniques. We focus on three complementary lines of work: (1) integrating ML algorithms and languages with existing data systems such as RDBMSs, (2) adapting data management-inspired techniques such as query optimization, partitioning, and compression to new systems that target ML workloads, and (3) combining data management and ML ideas to build systems that improve ML lifecycle-related tasks. Finally, we identify key open data management challenges for future research in this important area.},

We present a system that provides automatic scaling for Internet applications in the cloud environment. We encapsulate each application instance inside a virtual machine (VM) and use virtualization technology to provide fault isolation. We model it as the Class Constrained Bin Packing (CCBP) problem where each server is a bin and each class represents an application. The class constraint reflects the practical limit on the number of applications a server can run simultaneously. We develop an efficient semi-online color set algorithm that achieves good demand satisfaction ratio and saves energy by reducing the number of servers used when the load is low. Experiment results demonstrate that our system can improve the throughput by 180\% over an open source implementation of Amazon EC2 and restore the normal QoS five times as fast during flash crowds. Large scale simulations demonstrate that our algorithm is extremely scalable: the decision time remains under 4 s for a system with 10 000 servers and 10 000 applications. This is an order of magnitude improvement over traditional application placement algorithms in enterprise environments.},

There are degrees of freedom in this process, such as the starting point of the slicing sequence and the thickness of each slice. The choice of these parameters influences the manufacturing process and its result: The number of slices significantly affects the time needed for manufacturing, while their thickness affects the error. Assuming a discrete setting, we measure the error as the number of voxels that are incorrectly assigned due to slicing. We provide an algorithm that generates, for a given set of available slice heights and a shape, a slicing that is provably optimal. By optimal, we mean that the algorithm generates sequences with minimal error for any possible number of slices. The algorithm is fast and flexible, that is, it can accommodate a user driven importance modulation of the error function and allows the interactive exploration of the desired quality/time tradeoff. We demonstrate the practical importance of our optimization on several three-dimensional-printed results.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Massively Parallel Processors (MPPs) have gained ground enabling vast amounts of data processing. In such environments, data is partitioned across multiple compute nodes, which results in dramatic performance improvements during parallel query execution. To evaluate certain relational operators in a query correctly, data sometimes needs to be re-partitioned (i.e., moved) across compute nodes. Since data movement operations are much more expensive than relational operations, it is crucial to design a suitable data partitioning strategy that minimizes the cost of such expensive data transfers. A good partitioning strategy strongly depends on how the parallel system would be used. In this paper we present a partitioning advisor that recommends the best partitioning design for an expected workload. Our tool recommends which tables should be replicated (i.e., copied into every compute node) and which ones should be distributed according to specific column(s) so that the cost of evaluating similar workloads is minimized. In contrast to previous work, our techniques are deeply integrated with the underlying parallel query optimizer, which results in more accurate recommendations in a shorter amount of time. Our experimental evaluation using a real MPP system, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Parallel Data Warehouse, with both real and synthetic workloads shows the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and the importance of deep integration of the partitioning advisor with the underlying query optimizer.},

	abstract = {Workflows have been used to represent a variety of applications involving high processing and storage demands. As a solution to supply this necessity, the cloud computing paradigm has emerged as an on-demand resources provider. While public clouds charge users in a per-use basis, private clouds are owned by users and can be utilized with no charge. When a public cloud and a private cloud are merged, we have what we call a hybrid cloud. In a hybrid cloud, the user has elasticity provided by public cloud resources that can be aggregated to the private resources pool as necessary. One question faced by the users in such systems is: Which are the best resources to request from a public cloud based on the current demand and on resources costs? In this paper we deal with this problem, presenting HCOC: The Hybrid Cloud Optimized Cost scheduling algorithm. HCOC decides which resources should be leased from the public cloud and aggregated to the private cloud to provide sufficient processing power to execute a workflow within a given execution time. We present extensive experimental and simulation results which show that HCOC can reduce costs while achieving the established desired execution time.},

Existing works on workflow scheduling in the context of Clouds are either on deadline or cost optimization, ignoring the necessity for robustness. Robust scheduling that handles performance variations of Cloud resources and failures in the environment is essential in the context of Clouds. In this paper, we present a robust scheduling algorithm with resource allocation policies that schedule workflow tasks on heterogeneous Cloud resources while trying to minimize the total elapsed time (make span) and the cost. Our results show that the proposed resource allocation policies provide robust and fault-tolerant schedule while minimizing make span. The results also show that with the increase in budget, our policies increase the robustness of the schedule.},

In this paper, we address a new and important problem concerning the efficient management of such ensembles under budget and deadline constraints on Infrastructure- as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. We discuss, develop, and assess algorithms based on static and dynamic strategies for both task scheduling and resource provisioning. We perform the evaluation via simulation using a set of scientific workflow ensembles with a broad range of budget and deadline parameters, taking into account uncertainties in task runtime estimations, provisioning delays, and failures. We find that the key factor determining the performance of an algorithm is its ability to decide which workflows in an ensemble to admit or reject for execution. Our results show that an admission procedure based on workflow structure and estimates of task runtimes can significantly improve the quality of solutions.},

	abstract = {Efficient application scheduling is critical for achieving high performance in heterogeneous computing environments. The application scheduling problem has been shown to be NP-complete in general cases as well as in several restricted cases. Because of its key importance, this problem has been extensively studied and various algorithms have been proposed in the literature which are mainly for systems with homogeneous processors. Although there are a few algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous processors, they usually require significantly high scheduling costs and they may not deliver good quality schedules with lower costs. In this paper, we present two novel scheduling algorithms for a bounded number of heterogeneous processors with an objective to simultaneously meet high performance and fast scheduling time, which are called the Heterogeneous Earliest-Finish-Time (HEFT) algorithm and the Critical-Path-on-a-Processor (CPOP) algorithm. The HEFT algorithm selects the task with the highest upward rank value at each step and assigns the selected task to the processor, which minimizes its earliest finish time with an insertion-based approach. On the other hand, the CPOP algorithm uses the summation of upward and downward rank values for prioritizing tasks. Another difference is in the processor selection phase, which schedules the critical tasks onto the processor that minimizes the total execution time of the critical tasks. In order to provide a robust and unbiased comparison with the related work, a parametric graph generator was designed to generate weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. The comparison study, based on both randomly generated graphs and the graphs of some real applications, shows that our scheduling algorithms significantly surpass previous approaches in terms of both quality and cost of schedules, which are mainly presented with schedule length ratio, speedup, frequency of best results, and average scheduling time metrics},

	abstract = {We investigate hypergraph partitioning-based methods for efficient parallelization of communicating tasks. A good partitioning method should divide the load among the processors as evenly as possible and minimize the inter-processor communication overhead. The total communication volume is the most popular communication overhead metric which is reduced by the existing state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioners. However, other metrics such as the total number of messages, the maximum amount of data transferred by a processor, or a combination of them are equally, if not more, important. Existing hypergraph-based solutions use a two phase approach to minimize such metrics where in each phase, they minimize a different metric, sometimes at the expense of others. We propose a one-phase approach where all the communication cost metrics can be effectively minimized in a multi-objective setting and reductions can be achieved for all metrics together. For an accurate modeling of the maximum volume and the number of messages sent and received by a processor, we propose the use of directed hypergraphs. The directions on hyperedges necessitate revisiting the standard partitioning heuristics. We do so and propose a multi-objective, multi-level hypergraph partitioner called UMPa. The partitioner takes various prioritized communication metrics into account, and optimizes all of them together in the same phase. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods which only minimize the total communication volume, we show on a large number of problem instances that UMPa produces better partitions in terms of several communication metrics.},

While the problem is algorithmically very hard, we achieve near-optimality on the job DAGs that appear in production clusters at a large enterprise and in benchmarks such as TPC-DS. A key insight is that carefully handling the long-running tasks and those with tough-to-pack resource needs will produce good-enough schedules. However, which subset of tasks to treat carefully is not clear (and intractable to discover). Hence, we offer a search procedure that evaluates various possibilities and outputs a preferred schedule order over tasks. An online component enforces the schedule orders desired by the various jobs running on the cluster. In addition, it packs tasks, overbooks the fungible resources and guarantees bounded unfairness for a variety of desirable fairness schemes. Relative to the state-of-the art schedulers, we speed up 50\% of the jobs by over 30\% each.},

	abstract = {To reduce the impact of network congestion on big data jobs, cluster management frameworks use various heuristics to schedule compute tasks and/or network flows. Most of these schedulers consider the job input data fixed and greedily schedule the tasks and flows that are ready to run. However, a large fraction of production jobs are recurring with predictable characteristics, which allows us to plan ahead for them. Coordinating the placement of data and tasks of these jobs allows for significantly improving their network locality and freeing up bandwidth, which can be used by other jobs running on the cluster. With this intuition, we develop Corral, a scheduling framework that uses characteristics of future workloads to determine an offline schedule which (i) jointly places data and compute to achieve better data locality, and (ii) isolates jobs both spatially (by scheduling them in different parts of the cluster) and temporally, improving their performance. We implement Corral on Apache Yarn, and evaluate it on a 210 machine cluster using production workloads. Compared to Yarn's capacity scheduler, Corral reduces the makespan of these workloads up to 33\% and the median completion time up to 56\%, with 20-90\% reduction in data transferred across racks.},

	abstract = {For data-intensive applications with many concurrent users, modern distributed main memory database management systems (DBMS) provide the necessary scale-out support beyond what is possible with single-node systems. These DBMSs are optimized for the short-lived transactions that are common in on-line transaction processing (OLTP) workloads. One way that they achieve this is to partition the database into disjoint subsets and use a single-threaded transaction manager per partition that executes transactions one-at-a-time in serial order. This minimizes the overhead of concurrency control mechanisms, but requires careful partitioning to limit distributed transactions that span multiple partitions. Previous methods used off-line analysis to determine how to partition data, but the dynamic nature of these applications means that they are prone to hotspots. In these situations, the DBMS needs to reconfigure how data is partitioned in real-time to maintain performance objectives. Bringing the system off-line to reorganize the database is unacceptable for on-line applications. To overcome this problem, we introduce the Squall technique for supporting live reconfiguration in partitioned, main memory DBMSs. Squall supports fine-grained repartitioning of databases in the presence of distributed transactions, high throughput client workloads, and replicated data. An evaluation of our approach on a distributed DBMS shows that Squall can reconfigure a database with no downtime and minimal overhead on transaction latency.},

Finding the optimum solution forarbitrary directed acyclic task graphs (DAG's) is NP-complete.

It guarantees a performance within a factor of 2 of the optimum forgeneral coarse-grain DAG's. We compare DSC with three higher-complexity generalscheduling algorithms: the ETF by J.J. Hwang, Y.C.

The proposed algorithm, which is called Dynamic Critical Path (DCP) scheduling algorithm, is different from previously reported algorithms in a number of ways. First, it determines the critical path of the task graph and selects the next node to be scheduled in a dynamic fashion. Second, it rearranges the schedule on each processor dynamically in the sense that the positions of the nodes in the partial schedules are not fixed until all nodes have been considered. Third, it uses an intelligent way to select a suitable processor for a node by looking ahead the potential start times of the remaining critical nodes on that processor and by scheduling relatively less important nodes to the processors already in use. Four related scheduling algorithms are also discussed. Although these algorithms are efficient in general, they possess drawbacks which can lead to poor performance. The proposed DCP algorithm overcomes the drawbacks of these algorithms and outperforms them by a considerable margin. Despite having a number of new features, the DCP algorithm is fast, efficient in terms of the number of processors used and is equally suitable for different types of graph structures.},

	title = {Partitioning and {Scheduling} {Parallel} {Programs} for {Execution} on {Multiprocessors}},
	abstract = {There are three fundamental problems to be solved in the execution of a parallel program on a multiprocessor--identifying the parallelism in the program, partitioning the program into tasks and scheduling the tasks on processors. Whereas the problem of identifying parallelism is a programming language issue, the partitioning and scheduling problems are intimately related to parameters of the target multiprocessor, like the number of processors and synchronisation and communication overhead. It is desirable for the partitioning and scheduling to be performed automatically, so that the same parallel program can execute efficiently on different multiprocessors. This dissertation presents two solutions to the partitioning and scheduling problems. The first approach is based on a macro-dataflow model, where the program is partitioned into tasks at compile-time and the tasks are scheduled on processors at run-time. The second approach is based on a compile-time scheduling model, where the partitioning of the program and the scheduling of tasks on processors are both performed at compile-time.Both approaches have been implemented to partition programs written in the single-assignment language, SISAL. The inputs to the partitioning and scheduling algorithms are a graphical representation of the program and a list of parameters describing the target multiprocessor. Execution profile information is used to derive compile-time estimates of execution times and data sizes in the program. Both the macro-dataflow and compile-time scheduling problems are expressed as optimisation problems, which are proved to be NP-complete in the strong sense. This dissertation presents efficient approximation algorithms for these problems. The effectiveness of the partitioning and scheduling algorithms is studied by multiprocessor simulations of various SISAL benchmark programs for different target multiprocessor parameters.},

	abstract = {Static scheduling of a program represented by a directed task graph on a multiprocessor system to minimize the program completion time is a well-known problem in parallel processing. Since finding an optimal schedule is an NP-complete problem in general, researchers have resorted to devising efficient heuristics. A plethora of heuristics have been proposed based on a wide spectrum of techniques, including branch-and-bound, integer-programming, searching, graph-theory, randomization, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary methods. The objective of this survey is to describe various scheduling algorithms and their functionalities in a contrasting fashion as well as examine their relative merits in terms of performance and time-complexity. Since these algorithms are based on diverse   assumptions, they differ in their functionalities, and hence are difficult to describe in a unified context. We propose a taxonomy that classifies these algorithms into different categories. We consider 27 scheduling algorithms, with each algorithm explained through an easy-to-understand description followed by an illustrative example to demonstrate its operation. We also outline some of the novel and promising optimization approaches and current research trends in the area. Finally, we give an overview of the software tools that provide scheduling/mapping functionalities.},

	abstract = {One of the most challenging aspects of managing a very large data warehouse is identifying how queries will behave before they start executing. Yet knowing their performance characteristics - their runtimes and resource usage - can solve two important problems. First, every database vendor struggles with managing unexpectedly long-running queries. When these long-running queries can be identified before they start, they can be rejected or scheduled when they will not cause extreme resource contention for the other queries in the system. Second, deciding whether a system can complete a given workload in a given time period (or a bigger system is necessary) depends on knowing the resource requirements of the queries in that workload. We have developed a system that uses machine learning to accurately predict the performance metrics of database queries whose execution times range from milliseconds to hours. For training and testing our system, we used both real customer queries and queries generated from an extended set of TPC-DS templates. The extensions mimic queries that caused customer problems. We used these queries to compare how accurately different techniques predict metrics such as elapsed time, records used, disk I/Os, and message bytes. The most promising technique was not only the most accurate, but also predicted these metrics simultaneously and using only information available prior to query execution. We validated the accuracy of this machine learning technique on a number of HP Neoview configurations. We were able to predict individual query elapsed time within 20\% of its actual time for 85\% of the test queries. Most importantly, we were able to correctly identify both the short and long-running (up to two hour) queries to inform workload management and capacity planning.},

Working in linear spaces of function has the benefit of facilitating the construction and analysis of learning algorithms while at the same time allowing large classes of functions. The latter include nonlinear functions as well as functions defined on nonvectorial data.

	abstract = {Induction of a concept description given noisy instances is difficult and is further exacerbated when the concepts may change over time. This paper presents a solution which has been guided by psychological and mathematical results. The method is based on a distributed concept description which is composed of a set of weighted, symbolic characterizations. Two learning processes incrementally modify this description. One adjusts the characterization weights and another creates new characterizations. The latter process is described in terms of a search through the space of possibilities and is shown to require linear space with respect to the number of attribute-value pairs in the description language. The method utilizes previously acquired concept definitions in subsequent learning by adding an attribute for each learned concept to instance descriptions. A program called STAGGER fully embodies this method, and this paper reports on a number of empirical analyses of its performance. Since understanding the relationships between a new learning method and existing ones can be difficult, this paper first reviews a framework for discussing machine learning systems and then describes STAGGER in that framework.},

We show how the construction can be used to create kernels from methods that would not normally be viewed as random partitions, such as Random Forest. To demonstrate the potential of this method, we propose two new kernels, the Random Forest Kernel and the Fast Cluster Kernel, and show that these kernels consistently outperform standard kernels on problems involving real-world datasets. Finally, we show how the form of these kernels lend themselves to a natural approximation that is appropriate for certain big data problems, allowing O(N) inference in methods such as Gaussian Processes, Support Vector Machines and Kernel PCA.},

It essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.},

The set-covering problem is to minimize c$^{\textrm{T}}$x subject to Ax ≥ e and x binary. We compare the value of the objective function at a feasible solution found by a simple greedy heuristic to the true optimum. It turns out that the ratio between the two grows at most logarithmically in the largest column sum of A. When all the components of {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$c{\textasciicircum}\{T\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} are the same, our result reduces to a theorem established previously by Johnson and Lovasz.},

The weight matrix is updated by multiplying the current matrix entries by exponential factors, and an iterative procedure is needed to restore double stochasticity. Even though the result of this procedure does not have a closed form, a new analysis approach allows us to prove an optimal (up to small constant factors) bound on the regret of our algorithm. This regret bound is significantly better than that of either Kalai and Vempala's more efficient Follow the Perturbed Leader algorithm or the computationally expensive method of explicitly representing each permutation as an expert.},

	abstract = {Predicting query execution time is useful in many database management issues including admission control, query scheduling, progress monitoring, and system sizing. Recently the research community has been exploring the use of statistical machine learning approaches to build predictive models for this task. An implicit assumption behind this work is that the cost models used by query optimizers are insufficient for query execution time prediction. In this paper we challenge this assumption and show while the simple approach of scaling the optimizer's estimated cost indeed fails, a properly calibrated optimizer cost model is surprisingly effective. However, even a well-tuned optimizer cost model will fail in the presence of errors in cardinality estimates. Accordingly we investigate the novel idea of spending extra resources to refine estimates for the query plan after it has been chosen by the optimizer but before execution. In our experiments we find that a well calibrated query optimizer model along with cardinality estimation refinement provides a low overhead way to provide estimates that are always competitive and often much better than the best reported numbers from the machine learning approaches.},

The only underlying LSTM structure that has been explored so far is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits syntactic properties that would naturally combine words to phrases. We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).},

The truth is that, while the Query Optimizer is indeed the highly-complex result of decades of research, learning how it works its magic is not only possible, but immensely useful to database developers and administrators alike. A better understanding of what the Query Optimizer does behind the scenes can help you to improve the performance of your databases and applications, and this book explains the core concepts behind how the SQL Server Query Optimizer works. With this knowledge, you'll be able to write superior queries, provide the Query Optimizer with all the information it needs to produce efficient execution plans, and troubleshoot the cases when the Query Optimizer is not giving you the best plan possible. With over 15 years of experience in the use of Relational Databases (including SQL Server since version 6.5), Benjamin has watched the SQL Server Relational Engine grow and evolve. His insight will leave you with an excellent foundation in the practicalities of the Query Optimizer, and everything you need to know to start tuning your queries to perfection.},

	abstract = {A major problem in machine learning is that of inductive bias: how to choose a learner's hypothesis space so that it is large enough to contain a solution to the problem being learnt, yet small enough to ensure reliable generalization from reasonably-sized training sets. Typically such bias is supplied by hand through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks, and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit bounds are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an environment of related tasks can potentially give much better generalization than learning a single task.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of improving the accuracy of an hypothesis output by a learning algorithm in the distribution-free (PAC) learning model. A concept class is learnable (or strongly learnable) if, given access to a source of examples of the unknown concept, the learner with high probability is able to output an hypothesis that is correct on all but an arbitrarily small fraction of the instances. The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce an hypothesis that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent.A method is described for converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well. In addition, the construction has some interesting theoretical consequences, including a set of general upper bounds on the complexity of any strong learning algorithm as a function of the allowed error ε.},

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overriding in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

	doi = {10.1109/TASLP.2017.2788182},
	abstract = {Word embeddings that provide continuous low-dimensional vector representations of words have been extensively used for various natural language processing tasks. However, existing context-based word embeddings such as Word2vec and GloVe typically fail to capture sufficient sentiment information, which may result in words with similar vector representations having an opposite sentiment polarity (e.g., good and bad), thus degrading sentiment analysis performance. To tackle this problem, recent studies have suggested learning sentiment embeddings to incorporate the sentiment polarity (positive and negative) information from labeled corpora. This study adopts another strategy to learn sentiment embeddings. Instead of creating a new word embedding from labeled corpora, we propose a word vector refinement model to refine existing pretrained word vectors using real-valued sentiment intensity scores provided by sentiment lexicons. The idea of the refinement model is to improve each word vector such that it can be closer in the lexicon to both semantically and sentimentally similar words (i.e., those with similar intensity scores) and further away from sentimentally dissimilar words (i.e., those with dissimilar intensity scores). An obvious advantage of the proposed method is that it can be applied to any pretrained word embeddings. In addition, the intensity scores can provide more fine-grained (real-valued) sentiment information than binary polarity labels to guide the refinement process. Experimental results show that the proposed refinement model can improve both conventional word embeddings and previously proposed sentiment embeddings for binary, ternary, and fine-grained sentiment classification on the SemEval and Stanford Sentiment Treebank datasets.},

	abstract = {This paper reports several properties of heuristic best-first search strategies whose scoring functions ƒ depend on all the information available from each candidate path, not merely on the current cost g and the estimated completion cost h. It is shown that several known properties of A* retain their form (with the minmax of f playing the role of the optimal cost), which helps establish general tests of admissibility and general conditions for node expansion for these strategies. On the basis of this framework the computational optimality of A*, in the sense of never expanding a node that can be skipped by some other algorithm having access to the same heuristic information that A* uses, is examined. A hierarchy of four optimality types is defined and three classes of algorithms and four domains of problem instances are considered. Computational performances relative to these algorithms and domains are appraised. For each class-domain combination, we then identify the strongest type of optimality that exists and the algorithm for achieving it. The main results of this paper relate to the class of algorithms that, like A*, return optimal solutions (i.e., admissible) when all cost estimates are optimistic (i.e., h ≤ h*). On this class, A* is shown to be not optimal and it is also shown that no optimal algorithm exists, but if the performance tests are confirmed to cases in which the estimates are also consistent, then A* is indeed optimal. Additionally, A* is also shown to be optimal over a subset of the latter class containing all best-first algorithms that are guided by path-dependent evaluation functions.},

	abstract = {Integrating machine learning into the internals of database management systems requires significant feature engineering, a human effort-intensive process to determine the best way to represent the pieces of information that are relevant to a task. In addition to being labor intensive, the process of hand-engineering features must generally be repeated for each data management task, and may make assumptions about the underlying database that are not universally true. We introduce flexible operator embeddings, a deep learning technique for automatically transforming query operators into feature vectors that are useful for a multiple data management tasks and is custom-tailored to the underlying database. Our approach works by taking advantage of an operator's context, resulting in a neural network that quickly transforms sparse representations of query operators into dense, information-rich feature vectors. Experimentally, we show that our flexible operator embeddings perform well across a number of data management tasks, using both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10568},
	abstract = {Estimating the selectivity of a query is a key step in almost any cost-based query optimizer. Most of today's databases rely on histograms or samples that are periodically refreshed by re-scanning the data as the underlying data changes. Since frequent scans are costly, these statistics are often stale and lead to poor selectivity estimates. As an alternative to scans, query-driven histograms have been proposed, which refine the histograms based on the actual selectivities of the observed queries. Unfortunately, these approaches are either too costly to use in practice---i.e., require an exponential number of buckets---or quickly lose their advantage as they observe more queries. For example, the state-of-the-art technique requires 318,936 buckets (and over 8 seconds of refinement overhead per query) after observing only 300 queries. In this paper, we propose a selectivity learning framework, called QuickSel, which falls into the query-driven paradigm but does not use histograms. Instead, it builds an internal model of the underlying data, which can be refined significantly faster (e.g., only 1.9 milliseconds for 300 queries). This fast refinement allows QuickSel to continuously learn from each query and yield increasingly more accurate selectivity estimates over time. Unlike query-driven histograms, QuickSel relies on a mixture model and a new optimization algorithm for training its model. Our extensive experiments on two real-world datasets confirm that, given the same target accuracy, QuickSel is on average 254.6x faster than state-of-the-art query-driven histograms, including ISOMER and STHoles. Further, given the same space budget, QuickSel is on average 57.3\% and 91.1\% more accurate than periodically-updated histograms and samples, respectively.},

But most algebras complicate rule formulation, and rules over these algebras must often resort to calling to externally defined bodies of code. Code makes rules difficult to formulate, prove correct and reason about, and therefore compromises the effectiveness of rule-based systems.In this paper we present KOLA: a combinator-based algebra designed to simplify rule formulation. KOLA is not a user language, and KOLA's variable-free queries are difficult for humans to read. But KOLA is an effective internal algebra because its combinator-style makes queries manipulable and structurally revealing. As a result, rules over KOLA queries are easily expressed without the need for supplemental code. We illustrate this point, first by showing some transformations that despite their simplicity, require head and body routines when expressed over algebras that include variables. We show that these transformations are expressible without supplemental routines in KOLA. We then show complex transformations of a class of nested queries expressed over KOLA. Nested query optimization, while having been studied before, have seriously challenged the rule-based paradigm.},

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised neural networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training.

This may be acceptable for a simulator, but it severely limits the applicability of deep RL to many real-world tasks, where the agent must learn in the real environment. In this paper we study a setting where the agent may access data from previous control of the system. We present an algorithm, Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), that leverages small sets of demonstration data to massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of demonstration data and is able to automatically assess the necessary ratio of demonstration data while learning thanks to a prioritized replay mechanism. DQfD works by combining temporal difference updates with supervised classification of the demonstrator's actions. We show that DQfD has better initial performance than Prioritized Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (PDD DQN) as it starts with better scores on the first million steps on 41 of 42 games and on average it takes PDD DQN 83 million steps to catch up to DQfD's performance. DQfD learns to out-perform the best demonstration given in 14 of 42 games. In addition, DQfD leverages human demonstrations to achieve state-of-the-art results for 11 games. Finally, we show that DQfD performs better than three related algorithms for incorporating demonstration data into DQN.},

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether they harm performance, and whether they can generally be prevented.  In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively.  In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain.  We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation.  We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

	abstract = {The realization of end-to-end quality of service (QoS) guarantees in emerging network-based applications requires mechanisms that support first dynamic discovery and then advance or immediate reservation of resources that will often be heterogeneous in type and implementation and independently controlled and administered. We propose the Globus Architecture for Reservation and Allocation (GARA) to address these four issues. GARA treats both reservations and computational elements such as processes, network flows, and memory blocks as first-class entities, allowing them to be created, monitored, and managed independently and uniformly. It simplifies management of heterogeneous resource types by defining uniform mechanisms for computers, networks, disk, memory, and other resources. Layering on these standard mechanisms, GARA enables the construction of application-level co-reservation and co-allocation libraries that applications can use to dynamically assemble collections of resources, guided by both application QoS requirements and the local administration policy of individual resources. We describe a prototype GARA implementation that supports three different resource type-parallel computers, individual CPU under control of the dynamic soft real-time scheduler, and integrated services networks, and provide performance results that quantify the costs of our techniques},

For example, several computers and network elements may be required in order to achieve real-time reconstruction of experimental data, while a large numerical simulation may require simultaneous access to multiple supercomputers. Motivated by these concerns, we have developed a general resource management architecture for Grid environments, in which resource co-allocation is an integral component. In this paper, we examine the co-allocation problem in detail and present mechanisms that allow an application to guide resource selection during the co-allocation process; these mechanisms address issues relating to the allocation, monitoring, control, and configuration of distributed computations. We describe the implementation of co-allocators based on these mechanisms and present the results of microbenchmark studies and large-scale application experiments that provide insights into the costs and practical utility of our techniques.},

	abstract = {Interactive services often have large-scale parallel implementations. To deliver fast responses, the median and tail latencies of a service's components must be low. In this paper, we explore the hardware, OS, and application-level sources of poor tail latency in high throughput servers executing on multi-core machines. We model these network services as a queuing system in order to establish the best-achievable latency distribution. Using fine-grained measurements of three different servers (a null RPC service, Memcached, and Nginx) on Linux, we then explore why these servers exhibit significantly worse tail latencies than queuing models alone predict. The underlying causes include interference from background processes, request re-ordering caused by poor scheduling or constrained concurrency models, suboptimal interrupt routing, CPU power saving mechanisms, and NUMA effects. We systematically eliminate these factors and show that Memcached can achieve a median latency of 11 μs and a 99.9th percentile latency of 32 μs at 80\% utilization on a four-core system. In comparison, a naïve deployment of Memcached at the same utilization on a single-core system has a median latency of 100 μs and a 99.9th percentile latency of 5 ms. Finally, we demonstrate that tradeoffs exist between throughput, energy, and tail latency.},

In this paper, we explore how the query optimization process can be made more robust, focusing on the important subproblem of cardinality estimation. The robust cardinality estimation technique that we propose allows for a user- or application-specified trade-off between performance and predictability, and it captures multi-dimensional correlations while remaining space- and time-efficient.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has achieved superior performance in complex sequential tasks by using a deep neural network as its function approximator and by learning directly from raw images. A drawback of using raw images is that deep RL must learn the state feature representation from the raw images in addition to learning a policy. As a result, deep RL can require a prohibitively large amount of training time and data to reach reasonable performance, making it difficult to use deep RL in real-world applications, especially when data is expensive. In this work, we speed up training by addressing half of what deep RL is trying to solve --- learning features. Our approach is to learn some of the important features by pre-training deep RL network's hidden layers via supervised learning using a small set of human demonstrations. We empirically evaluate our approach using deep Q-network (DQN) and asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithms on the Atari 2600 games of Pong, Freeway, and Beamrider. Our results show that: 1) pre-training with human demonstrations in a supervised learning manner is better at discovering features relative to pre-training naively in DQN, and 2) initializing a deep RL network with a pre-trained model provides a significant improvement in training time even when pre-training from a small number of human demonstrations.},

They extract initial biases as well as strategies how to approach a learning problem from instructions and/or demonstrations of other humans. For teaming control, this paper investigates how learning from demonstration can be applied in the context of reinforcement learning. We consider priming the Q-function, the value function, the policy, and the model of the task dynamics as possible areas where demonstrations can speed up learning. In general nonlinear learning problems, only model-based reinforcement learning shows significant speed-up after a demonstration, while in the special case of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, all methods profit from the demonstration. In an implementation of pole balancing on a complex anthropomorphic robot arm, we demonstrate that, when facing the complexities of real signal processing, model-based reinforcement learning offers the most robustness for LQR problems. Using the suggested methods, the robot learns pole balancing in just a single trial after a 30 second long demonstration of the human instructor.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Dex, a reinforcement learning environment toolkit specialized for training and evaluation of continual learning methods as well as general reinforcement learning problems. We also present the novel continual learning method of incremental learning, where a challenging environment is solved using optimal weight initialization learned from first solving a similar easier environment. We show that incremental learning can produce vastly superior results than standard methods by providing a strong baseline method across ten Dex environments. We finally develop a saliency method for qualitative analysis of reinforcement learning, which shows the impact incremental learning has on network attention.},

	abstract = {Public cloud providers with Database-as-a-Service offerings must efficiently allocate computing resources to each of their customers. An effective assignment of tenants both reduces the number of physical servers in use and meets customer expectations at a price point that is competitive in the cloud market. For public cloud vendors like Microsoft and Amazon, this means packing millions of users' databases onto hundreds or thousands of servers. This paper studies tenant placement by examining a publicly released dataset of anonymized customer resource usage statistics from Microsoft's Azure SQL Database production system over a three-month period. We implemented the STeP framework to ingest and analyze this large dataset. STeP allowed us to use this production dataset to evaluate several new algorithms for packing database tenants onto servers. These techniques produce highly efficient packings by collocating tenants with compatible resource usage patterns. The evaluation shows that under a production-sourced customer workload, these techniques are robust to variations in the number of nodes, keeping performance objective violations to a minimum even for high-density tenant packings. In comparison to the algorithm used in production at the time of data collection, our algorithms produce up to 90\% fewer performance objective violations and save up to 32\% of total operational costs for the cloud provider.},

	abstract = {Join order selection plays a significant role in query performance. However, modern query optimizers typically employ static join enumeration algorithms that do not receive any feedback about the quality of the resulting plan. Hence, optimizers often repeatedly choose the same bad plan, as they do not have a mechanism for "learning from their mistakes". In this paper, we argue that existing deep reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to address this challenge. These techniques, powered by artificial neural networks, can automatically improve decision making by incorporating feedback from their successes and failures. Towards this goal, we present ReJOIN, a proof-of-concept join enumerator, and present preliminary results indicating that ReJOIN can match or outperform the PostgreSQL optimizer in terms of plan quality and join enumeration efficiency.},

Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep \$Q\$-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

However, uniformity of the sampling process is difficult to establish and only for a restricted class of join queries techniques are known.In this paper, we investigate non-uniform sampling devising a simple yet powerful algorithm that is generally applicable. The key element of the algorithm is a mapping of randomly generated sequences of join predicates to query plans. We take advantage of the bottom-up constructing of query plans by simultaneously computing the costs and discarding partial plans as soon as they exceed the best costs found so far, which implements a highly effective cost-bound pruning component.Sampling does not produce the optimal plan but a near-optimal solution which is fully sufficient as the cost function grows more and more inaccurate with increasing query size. In return, our algorithm establishes a well-balanced trade-off between result quality and time invested in the optimization process.},

New estimation and model selection procedures for semiparametric modeling in longitudinal data analysis. Journal of the American Statistical Association 99, 710–723] which are reminiscent of the well-known pitfalls related to Hodges’ estimator. The oracle property is often a consequence of sparsity of an estimator. We show that any estimator satisfying a sparsity property has maximal risk that converges to the supremum of the loss function; in particular, the maximal risk diverges to infinity whenever the loss function is unbounded. For ease of presentation the result is set in the framework of a linear regression model, but generalizes far beyond that setting. In a Monte Carlo study we also assess the extent of the problem in finite samples for the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) estimator introduced in Fan and Li [2001. Variable selection via nonconcave penalized likelihood and its oracle properties. Journal of the American Statistical Association 96, 1348–1360]. We find that this estimator can perform rather poorly in finite samples and that its worst-case performance relative to maximum likelihood deteriorates with increasing sample size when the estimator is tuned to sparsity.},

In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and detecting code snippets of certain patterns.

In this paper, we propose a new, general cardinality estimation technique that combines random sampling and materialized view technology to produce accurate estimates even in these situations. As a major innovation, we exploit feedback information from query execution and process control techniques to assure that estimates remain statistically valid when the underlying data changes. Experimental results based on a prototype implementation in Microsoft SQL Server demonstrate the practicality of the approach and illustrate the dramatic effects improved cardinality estimates may have.},

	abstract = {Entity matching (EM) finds data instances that refer to the same real-world entity. In this paper we examine applying deep learning (DL) to EM, to understand DL's benefits and limitations. We review many DL solutions that have been developed for related matching tasks in text processing (e.g., entity linking, textual entailment, etc.). We categorize these solutions and define a space of DL solutions for EM, as embodied by four solutions with varying representational power: SIF, RNN, Attention, and Hybrid. Next, we investigate the types of EM problems for which DL can be helpful. We consider three such problem types, which match structured data instances, textual instances, and dirty instances, respectively. We empirically compare the above four DL solutions with Magellan, a state-of-the-art learning-based EM solution. The results show that DL does not outperform current solutions on structured EM, but it can significantly outperform them on textual and dirty EM. For practitioners, this suggests that they should seriously consider using DL for textual and dirty EM problems. Finally, we analyze DL's performance and discuss future research directions.},

	url = {http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2969033.2969197},
	abstract = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom, middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target dataset.},

	abstract = {Indexes are models: a {\textbackslash}btree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term {\textbackslash}em learned indexes. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show that our learned indexes can have significant advantages over traditional indexes. More importantly, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work provides just a glimpse of what might be possible.},

	abstract = {Policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithms are amongst the most popular algorithms in the reinforcement learning framework. Their advantage of being able to search for optimal policies using low-variance gradient estimates has made them useful in several real-life applications, such as robotics, power control, and finance. Although general surveys on reinforcement learning techniques already exist, no survey is specifically dedicated to actor-critic algorithms in particular. This paper, therefore, describes the state of the art of actor-critic algorithms, with a focus on methods that can work in an online setting and use function approximation in order to deal with continuous state and action spaces. After starting with a discussion on the concepts of reinforcement learning and the origins of actor-critic algorithms, this paper describes the workings of the natural gradient, which has made its way into many actor-critic algorithms over the past few years. A review of several standard and natural actor-critic algorithms is given, and the paper concludes with an overview of application areas and a discussion on open issues.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDE53745.2022.00294},
	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is becoming a core component in query optimizers, e.g., to estimate costs or cardinalities. This means large heterogeneous sets of labeled query plans or jobs (i.e., plans with their runtime or cardinality output) are needed. However, collecting such a training dataset is a very tedious and time-consuming task: It requires both developing numerous jobs and executing them to acquire ground-truth labels. We demonstrate Datafarm,a novel framework for efficiently generating and labeling training data for ML-based query optimizers to overcome these issues. Datafarmenables generating training data tailored to users' needs by learning from their existing workload patterns, input data, and computational resources. It uses an active learning approach to determine a subset of jobs to be executed and encloses the human into the loop, resulting in higher quality data. The graphical user interface of Datafarmallows users to get informative details of the generated jobs and guides them through the generation process step-by-step. We show how users can intervene and provide feedback to the system in an iterative fashion. As an output, users can download both the generated jobs to use as a benchmark and the training data (jobs with their labels).},

	abstract = {GenesisDB uses generative AI to synthesize customized operator
implementations for SQL processing. Users customize GenesisDB

by providing natural language instructions, describing desired be-
havior, as well as optional operator code samples. For instance,

this enables lay users to obtain customized output for debugging,
non-standard progress updates during processing, or links to SQL
tutorials related to operators in the current query plan. Advanced
users can generate engines that use customized data structures or
processing methods.

Based on the GPT-3 Codex model, GenesisDB provides a frame-
work that controls code synthesis, optimally schedules test cases,

and automatically detects and fixes bugs by re-synthesizing spe-
cific operators. Its run time component decomposes complex SQL

queries, including all queries of the TPC-H benchmark, into process-
ing steps that are realized by custom operators. The experiments

show that GenesisDB is able to generate custom code for a majority
of operators in a variety of scenarios (while automatically switching
to default implementations for remaining ones).},

	abstract = {In recent years the inverted lists evaluation model along with holistic stack-based algorithms have been established as the most prominent techniques for evaluating XML queries on large persistent XML data. In this framework, we are using materialized views for optimizing XML queries. We consider a novel approach which instead of materializing the answer of a view materializes exactly the inverted sublists that are necessary for computing the answer of the view. This originality allows storing view materializations as compressed bitmaps, a solution that minimizes the materialization space and empowers performing optimization operations as CPU-efficient bitwise operations. To realize the potential of bitmap materialized views in optimizing query performance, we define and address the following problem (view configuration problem): given an XML tree and its schema find a template of tree-pattern views (view configuration) such that: (a) the views of this configuration can answer all the queries that can be issued against the schema, (b) their materialization fits in the space provided, and (c) evaluating the queries using these views minimizes the overall query evaluation cost. We consider an instance of this problem for tree pattern queries. Our intension is to find view configurations whose materializations are small enough to be stored in main memory. We find two candidate solution configurations and we identify cases where views can be excluded from materialization in a configuration without affecting query performance. In order to compare our approach with an approach which also can support the optimization of every query on the schema, we implemented an improvement of a state-of-the-art approach which is based on structural indexes. Our experimental results show that our approach is stable, greatly improves evaluating queries without materialized views, outperforms the structural index approach on all test cases and is very close to the optimal. These results characterize our approach as the best candidate for supporting the optimization of queries in the framework of the inverted lists model.},

	abstract = {Traditional cost-based optimizers are efficient and stable to generate optimal plans for simple SQL queries, but they may not generate high-quality plans for complicated queries. Thus learning-based optimizers have been proposed recently that can learn high-quality plans based on past experiences. However, learning-based optimizers cannot work well for dynamic workloads that have different distributions with training examples. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimizer that adopts the advantages and avoids the shortcomings of these two types of optimizers, which first generates high-quality candidate plans from each type of optimizers and then selects the best plan from the candidates. There are two challenges. (1) How to generate high-quality candidates? We propose a hint-based candidate generation method that leverages the learning-based method to generate highly beneficial hints and then uses a cost-based method to supplement the hints to generate complete plans as candidates. (2) How to evaluate different candidate plans and select the best one? We propose an uncertainty-based optimal plan selection model, which predicts the execution time and the uncertainty for each plan. The uncertainty reflects the confidence of the execution time prediction. We select the plan using the uncertainty model. Experiment results on real datasets showed that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines, and reduced the total latency by 25\% and the tail latency by 65\% compared to PostgreSQL.},

For cost and performance reasons, processing is typically done on large clusters of shared-nothing commodity machines. It is imperative to develop a programming model that hides the complexity of the underlying system but provides flexibility by allowing users to extend functionality to meet a variety of requirements. In this paper, we present a new declarative and extensible scripting language, SCOPE (Structured Computations Optimized for Parallel Execution), targeted for this type of massive data analysis. The language is designed for ease of use with no explicit parallelism, while being amenable to efficient parallel execution on large clusters. SCOPE borrows several features from SQL. Data is modeled as sets of rows composed of typed columns. The select statement is retained with inner joins, outer joins, and aggregation allowed. Users can easily define their own functions and implement their own versions of operators: extractors (parsing and constructing rows from a file), processors (row-wise processing), reducers (group-wise processing), and combiners (combining rows from two inputs). SCOPE supports nesting of expressions but also allows a computation to be specified as a series of steps, in a manner often preferred by programmers. We also describe how scripts are compiled into efficient, parallel execution plans and executed on large clusters.},

	abstract = {Image processing pipelines combine the challenges of stencil computations and stream programs. They are composed of large graphs of different stencil stages, as well as complex reductions, and stages with global or data-dependent access patterns. Because of their complex structure, the performance difference between a naive implementation of a pipeline and an optimized one is often an order of magnitude. Efficient implementations require optimization of both parallelism and locality, but due to the nature of stencils, there is a fundamental tension between parallelism, locality, and introducing redundant recomputation of shared values. We present a systematic model of the tradeoff space fundamental to stencil pipelines, a schedule representation which describes concrete points in this space for each stage in an image processing pipeline, and an optimizing compiler for the Halide image processing language that synthesizes high performance implementations from a Halide algorithm and a schedule. Combining this compiler with stochastic search over the space of schedules enables terse, composable programs to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of real image processing pipelines, and across different hardware architectures, including multicores with SIMD, and heterogeneous CPU+GPU execution. From simple Halide programs written in a few hours, we demonstrate performance up to 5x faster than hand-tuned C, intrinsics, and CUDA implementations optimized by experts over weeks or months, for image processing applications beyond the reach of past automatic compilers.},

Our framework is based on abstract interpretation and can infer synchronization for infinite state programs. Given a program, a specification, and an abstraction, we infer synchronization that avoids all (abstract) interleavings that may violate the specification, but permits as many valid interleavings as possible. Combined with abstraction refinement, our framework can be viewed as a new approach for verification where both the program and the abstraction can be modified on-the-fly during the verification process. The ability to modify the program, and not only the abstraction, allows us to remove program interleavings not only when they are known to be invalid, but also when they cannot be verified using the given abstraction. We implemented a prototype of our approach using numerical abstractions and applied it to verify several interesting programs.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the data warehouse industry has witnessed decreased use of indexing but increased use of compression and clustering of data facilitating efficient data access and data pruning in the query processing area. A classic example of data pruning is the partition pruning, which is used when table data is range or list partitioned. But lately, techniques have been developed to prune data at a lower granularity than a table partition or sub-partition. A good example is the use of data pruning structure called zone map. A zone map prunes zones of data from a table on which it is defined. Data pruning via zone map is very effective when the table data is clustered by the filtering columns. The database industry has offered support to cluster data in tables by its local columns, and to define zone maps on clustering columns of such tables. This has helped improve the performance of queries that contain filter predicates on local columns. However, queries in data warehouses are typically based on star/snowflake schema with filter predicates usually on columns of the dimension tables joined to a fact table. Given this, the performance of data warehouse queries can be significantly improved if the fact table data is clustered by columns of dimension tables together with zone maps that maintain min/max value ranges of these clustering columns over zones of fact table data. In recognition of this opportunity of significantly improving the performance of data warehouse queries, Oracle 12c release 1 has introduced the support for dimension based clustering of fact tables together with data pruning of the fact tables via dimension based zone maps.},

Ryoan provides a distributed sandbox, leveraging hardware enclaves (e.g., Intel’s software guard extensions (SGX) [40]) to protect sandbox instances from potentially malicious computing platforms. The protected sandbox instances confine untrusted data-processing modules to prevent leakage of the user’s input data. Ryoan is designed for a request-oriented data model, where confined modules only process input once and do not persist state about the input.

We describe SCONE, a secure container mechanism for Docker that uses the SGX trusted execution support of Intel CPUs to protect container processes from outside attacks. The design of SCONE leads to (i) a small trusted computing base (TCB) and (ii) a low performance overhead: SCONE offers a secure C standard library interface that transparently encrypts/decrypts I/O data; to reduce the performance impact of thread synchronization and system calls within SGX enclaves, SCONE supports user-level threading and asynchronous system calls. Our evaluation shows that it protects unmodified applications with SGX, achieving 0.6×-1.2× of native throughput.},

	abstract = {Future Internet involves several emerging technologies such as 5G and beyond 5G networks, vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, and Internet of Things (IoTs). Moreover, the future Internet becomes heterogeneous and decentralized with a large number of involved network entities. Each entity may need to make its local decision to improve the network performance under dynamic and uncertain network environments. Standard learning algorithms such as single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been recently used to enable each network entity as an agent to learn an optimal decision-making policy adaptively through interacting with the unknown environments. However, such an algorithm fails to model the cooperations or competitions among network entities, and simply treats other entities as a part of the environment that may result in the non-stationarity issue. Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) allows each network entity to learn its optimal policy by observing not only the environments but also other entities’ policies. As a result, MARL can significantly improve the learning efficiency of the network entities, and it has been recently used to solve various issues in the emerging networks. In this paper, we thus review the applications of MARL in emerging networks. In particular, we provide a tutorial of MARL and a comprehensive survey of applications of MARL in next-generation Internet. In particular, we first introduce single-agent RL and MARL. Then, we review a number of applications of MARL to solve emerging issues in the future Internet. The issues consist of network access, transmit power control, computation offloading, content caching, packet routing, trajectory design for UAV-aided networks, and network security issues. Finally, we discuss the challenges, open issues, and future directions related to the applications of MARL in the future Internet.},

possible for a query optimizer to “learn from its mistakes,” correcting erroneous query plans the next time a plan is produced.
But what if query optimizers could avoid mistakes entirely? This paper presents the idea of learned query superoptimization. A
new generation of query superoptimizers could autonomously experiment to discover optimal plans using exploration-driven
algorithms, iterative Bayesian optimization, and program synthesis. While such superoptimizers will take significantly longer
to optimize a given query, superoptimizers have the potential to massively accelerate a large number of important repetitive
queries being executed on data systems today.},

However, until today it is not clear which paradigm yields faster query execution, as many implementation-speciﬁc choices obstruct a direct comparison of architectures. In this paper, we experimentally compare the two models by implementing both within the same test system. This allows us to use for both models the same query processing algorithms, the same data structures, and the same parallelization framework to ultimately create an apples-to-apples comparison. We ﬁnd that both are efﬁcient, but have different strengths and weaknesses. Vectorization is better at hiding cache miss latency, whereas data-centric compilation requires fewer CPU instructions, which beneﬁts cacheresident workloads. Besides raw, single-threaded performance, we also investigate SIMD as well as multi-core parallelization and different hardware architectures. Finally, we analyze qualitative differences as a guide for system architects.},

Many algorithmic and control techniques in current database technology were devised for diskbased systems where I/O dominated the performance. In this work we take a new look at the well-known sort-merge join which, so far, has not been in the focus of research in scalable massively parallel multi-core data processing as it was deemed inferior to hash joins. We devise a suite of new massively parallel sort-merge (MPSM) join algorithms that are based on partial partition-based sorting. Contrary to classical sort-merge joins, our MPSM algorithms do not rely on a hard to parallelize ﬁnal merge step to create one complete sort order. Rather they work on the independently created runs in parallel. This way our MPSM algorithms are NUMA-aﬃne as all the sorting is carried out on local memory partitions. An extensive experimental evaluation on a modern 32-core machine with one TB of main memory proves the competitive performance of MPSM on large main memory databases with billions of objects. It scales (almost) linearly in the number of employed cores and clearly outperforms competing hash join proposals – in particular it outperforms the “cutting-edge” Vectorwise parallel query engine by a factor of four.},

	abstract = {Worst-case optimal join algorithms are attractive from a theoretical point of view, as they offer asymptotically better runtime than binary joins on certain types of queries. In particular, they avoid enumerating large intermediate results by processing multiple input relations in a single multiway join. However, existing implementations incur a sizable overhead in practice, primarily since they rely on suitable ordered index structures on their input. Systems that support worst-case optimal joins often focus on a specific problem domain, such as read-only graph analytic queries, where extensive precomputation allows them to mask these costs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive implementation approach for worst-case optimal joins that is practical within general-purpose relational database management systems supporting both hybrid transactional and analytical workloads. The key component of our approach is a novel hash-based worst-case optimal join algorithm that relies only on data structures that can be built efficiently during query execution. Furthermore, we implement a hybrid query optimizer that intelligently and transparently combines both binary and multi-way joins within the same query plan. We demonstrate that our approach far outperforms existing systems when worst-case optimal joins are beneficial while sacrificing no performance when they are not.},

In this paper, we introduce Flood, a multi-dimensional in-memory read-optimized index that automatically adapts itself to a particular dataset and workload by jointly optimizing the index structure and data storage layout. Flood achieves up to three orders of magnitude faster performance for range scans with predicates than state-of-theart multi-dimensional indexes or sort orders on real-world datasets and workloads.

Our algorithm uses a model to efficiently get an approximation of the scaled empirical CDF for each record key and map it to the corresponding position in the output array. We then apply a deterministic sorting algorithm that works well on nearly-sorted arrays (e.g., Insertion Sort) to establish a totally sorted order. We compared this algorithm against common sorting approaches and measured its performance for up to 1 billion normally-distributed double-precision keys. The results show that our approach yields an average 3.38x performance improvement over C++ STL sort, which is an optimized Quicksort hybrid, 1.49x improvement over sequential Radix Sort, and 5.54x improvement over a C++ implementation of Timsort, which is the default sorting function for Java and Python.},

Traditional hash functions aim to mimic a function that maps a key to a random value, which can result in collisions, where multiple keys are mapped to the same value. There are many well-known schemes like chaining, probing, and cuckoo hashing to handle collisions. In this work, we aim to study if using learned models instead of traditional hash functions can reduce collisions and whether such a reduction translates to improved performance, particularly for indexing and joins. We show that learned models reduce collisions in some cases, which depend on how the data is distributed. To evaluate the effectiveness of learned models as hash function, we test them with bucket chaining, linear probing, and cuckoo hash tables. We find that learned models can (1) yield a 1.4x lower probe latency, and (2) reduce the non-partitioned hash join runtime with 28\% over the next best baseline for certain datasets. On the other hand, if the data distribution is not suitable, we either do not see gains or see worse performance. In summary, we find that learned models can indeed outperform hash functions, but only for certain data distributions.},

	abstract = {The wavelet tree is a versatile data structure that serves a number of purposes, from string processing to computational geometry. It can be regarded as a device that represents a sequence, a reordering, or a grid of points. In addition, its space adapts to various entropy measures of the data it encodes, enabling compressed representations. New competitive solutions to a number of problems, based on wavelet trees, are appearing every year. In this survey we give an overview of wavelet trees and the surprising number of applications in which we have found them useful: basic and weighted point grids, sets of rectangles, strings, permutations, binary relations, graphs, inverted indexes, document retrieval indexes, full-text indexes, XML indexes, and general numeric sequences.},

When σ is significant compared to n, current wavelet tree representations incur in noticeable space or time overheads. In this article we introduce the wavelet matrix, an alternative representation for large alphabets that retains all the properties of wavelet trees but is significantly faster. We also show how the wavelet matrix can be compressed up to the zero-order entropy of the sequence without sacrificing, and actually improving, its time performance. Our experimental results show that the wavelet matrix outperforms all the wavelet tree variants along the space/time tradeoff map.},

This structure supports the queries access, rank and select, which are fundamental building blocks for many other compressed data structures, in worst-case time O (lg lg σ) and average time O (lg H0(s)). The worst-case complexity matches the best previous results, yet these had been achieved with data structures using nH0(s) + o(n lg σ) bits. On highly compressible sequences the o(n lg σ) bits of the redundancy may be signiﬁcant compared to the the nH0(s) bits that encode the data. Our representation, instead, compresses the redundancy as well. Moreover, our average-case complexity is unprecedented.},

	abstract = {Query optimizers and query execution engines cooperate to deliver high performance on complex analytic queries. Typically, the optimizer searches through the plan space and sends a selected plan to the execution engine. However, optimizers may at times miss the optimal plan, with sometimes disastrous impact on performance. In this paper, we develop the notion of robustness of a query evaluation strategy with respect to a space of query plans. We also propose a novel query execution strategy called Lookahead Information Passing (LIP) that is robust with respect to the space of (fully pipeline-able) left-deep query plan trees for in-memory star schema data warehouses. LIP ensures that execution times for the best and the worst case plans are far closer than without LIP. In fact, under certain assumptions of independent and uniform distributions, any plan in that space is theoretically guaranteed to execute in near-optimal time. LIP ensures that the execution time for every plan in the space is nearly-optimal. In this paper, we also evaluate these claims using workloads that include skew and correlation. With LIP we make an initial foray into a novel way of thinking about robustness from the perspective of query evaluation, where we develop strategies (like LIP) that collapse plan sub-spaces in the overall global plan space.},

	abstract = {Query rewriting is often a prerequisite for effective query optimization, particularly for poorly-written queries. Prior work on query rewriting has relied on a set of "rules" based on syntactic pattern-matching. Whether relying on manual rules or auto-generated ones, rule-based query rewriters are inherently limited in their ability to handle new query patterns. Their success is limited by the quality and quantity of the rules provided to them. To our knowledge, we present the first synthesis-based query rewriting technique, SlabCity, capable of whole-query optimization without relying on any rewrite rules. SlabCity directly searches the space of SQL queries using a novel query synthesis algorithm that leverages a new concept called query dataflows. We evaluate SlabCity on four workloads, including a newly curated benchmark with more than 1000 real-life queries. We show that not only can SlabCity optimize more queries than state-of-the-art query rewriting techniques, but interestingly, it also leads to queries that are significantly faster than those generated by rule-based systems.},

	abstract = {The cloud facilitates the transition to a service-oriented perspective. This affects cloud-native data management in general, and data analytics in particular. Instead of managing a multi-node database cluster on-premise, end users simply send queries to a managed cloud data warehouse and receive results. While this is obviously very attractive for end users, database system architects still have to engineer systems for this new service model. There are currently many competing architectures ranging from self-hosted (Presto, PostgreSQL), over managed (Snowflake, Amazon Redshift) to queryas-a-service (Amazon Athena, Google BigQuery) offerings. Benchmarking these architectural approaches is currently difficult, and it is not even clear what the metrics for a comparison should be. To overcome these challenges, we first analyze a real-world query trace from Snowflake and compare its properties to that of TPC-H and TPC-DS. Doing so, we identify important differences that distinguish traditional benchmarks from real-world cloud data warehouse workloads. Based on this analysis, we propose the Cloud Analytics Benchmark (CAB). By incorporating workload fluctuations and multi-tenancy, CAB allows evaluating different designs in terms of user-centered metrics such as cost and performance.},

Presto is used for low-latency interactive use cases as well as long-running ETL jobs at Meta. It was originally launched at Meta in 2013 and donated to the Linux Foundation in 2019. Over the last ten years, upholding query latency and scalability with the hyper growth of data volume at Meta as well as new SQL analytics requirements have raised impressive challenges for Presto. A top priority has been ensuring query reliability does not regress with the shift towards smaller, more elastic container allocation, which requires queries to run with substantially smaller memory headroom and can be preempted at any time. Additionally, new demands from machine learning, privacy, and graph analytics have driven Presto maintainers to think beyond traditional data analytics. In this paper, we discuss several successful evolutions in recent years that have improved Presto latency as well as scalability by several orders of magnitude in production at Meta. Some of the notable ones are hierarchical caching, native vectorized execution engines, materialized views, and Presto on Spark. With these new capabilities, we have deprecated or are in the process of deprecating various legacy query engines so that Presto becomes the single piece to serve interactive, ad-hoc, ETL, and graph processing workloads for the entire data warehouse.},

	abstract = {MapReduce and its variants have been highly successful in implementing large-scale data-intensive applications on commodity clusters. However, most of these systems are built around an acyclic data flow model that is not suitable for other popular applications. This paper focuses on one such class of applications: those that reuse a working set of data across multiple parallel operations. This includes many iterative machine learning algorithms, as well as interactive data analysis tools. We propose a new framework called Spark that supports these applications while retaining the scalability and fault tolerance of MapReduce. To achieve these goals, Spark introduces an abstraction called resilient distributed datasets (RDDs). An RDD is a read-only collection of objects partitioned across a set of machines that can be rebuilt if a partition is lost. Spark can outperform Hadoop by 10x in iterative machine learning jobs, and can be used to interactively query a 39 GB dataset with sub-second response time.},

	abstract = {Spark SQL is a new module in Apache Spark that integrates relational processing with Spark's functional programming API. Built on our experience with Shark, Spark SQL lets Spark programmers leverage the benefits of relational processing (e.g. declarative queries and optimized storage), and lets SQL users call complex analytics libraries in Spark (e.g. machine learning). Compared to previous systems, Spark SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural Spark code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that makes it easy to add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e.g. schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis. We see Spark SQL as an evolution of both SQL-on-Spark and of Spark itself, offering richer APIs and optimizations while keeping the benefits of the Spark programming model.},

	abstract = {Query optimization based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a hot research topic recently. Despite the achieved promising progress, DRL optimizers still face great challenges of robustly producing efficient plans, due to the vast search space for both join order and operator selection and the highly varying execution latency taken as the feedback signal. In this paper, we propose LOGER, a learned optimizer towards generating efficient and robust plans, aiming at producing both efficient join orders and operators. LOGER first utilizes Graph Transformer to capture relationships between tables and predicates. Then, the search space is reorganized, in which LOGER learns to restrict specific operators instead of directly selecting one for each join, while utilizing DBMS built-in optimizer to select physical operators under the restrictions. Such a strategy exploits expert knowledge to improve the robustness of plan generation while offering sufficient plan search flexibility. Furthermore, LOGER introduces ε-beam search, which keeps multiple search paths that preserve promising plans while performing guided exploration. Finally, LOGER introduces a loss function with reward weighting to further enhance performance robustness by reducing the fluctuation caused by poor operators, and log transformation to compress the range of rewards. We conduct experiments on Join Order Benchmark (JOB), TPC-DS and Stack Overflow, and demonstrate that LOGER can achieve a performance better than existing learned query optimizers, with a 2.07x speedup on JOB compared with PostgreSQL.},

	abstract = {Query optimizers in relational database management systems (RDBMSs) search for execution plans expected to be optimal for a given queries. They use parameter estimates, often inaccurate, and make assumptions that may not hold in practice. Consequently, they may select execution plans that are suboptimal at runtime, when these estimates and assumptions are not valid, which may result in poor query performance. Therefore, query optimizers do not sufficiently support robust query optimization. Recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning (ML) to improve efficiency of data systems and reduce their maintenance overheads, with promising results obtained in the area of query optimization in particular. In this paper, inspired by these advancements, and based on several years of experience of IBM Db2 in this journey, we propose Robust Optimization of Queries, (Roq), a holistic framework that enables robust query optimization based on a risk-aware learning approach. Roq includes a novel formalization of the notion of robustness in the context of query optimization and a principled approach for its quantification and measurement based on approximate probabilistic ML. It also includes novel strategies and algorithms for query plan evaluation and selection. Roq also includes a novel learned cost model that is designed to predict query execution cost and the associated risks and performs query optimization accordingly. We demonstrate experimentally that Roq provides significant improvements to robust query optimization compared to the state-of-the-art.},

	abstract = {Learned databases, or AI4DB techniques, have rapidly developed in the last decade. Deploying machine learning (ML) and AI4DB algorithms into actual databases is the gold standard to examine their performance in practice. However, due to the complexity of database systems, the difference between ML and DB programming paradigms, and the diversity of ML models, the tasks of developing and deploying AI4DB algorithms into databases are prohibitively difficult. Most previous works focus on specific AI4DB algorithms and ML models whose deployment requires close cooperation between ML and DB developers and heavy engineering cost. In this paper, we design and implement PilotScope, an AI4DB middleware with a programming model that largely reduces such difficulties. With a novel abstraction of AI4DB algorithms for, e.g., knob tuning and query optimization, PilotScope consists of two classes of components, AI4DB drivers and DB interactors, with different programming paradigms and roles in AI4DB tasks. ML developers focus on designing and implementing AI4DB drivers, which are algorithmic workflows that collect statistics from databases, train ML models, make decisions and optimize databases using learned models. AI4DB drivers interact with databases via DB interactors (e.g., for collecting data and enforcing actions in databases). DB developers focus on implementing these interactors on one or more database engines, with the interaction details hindered from ML developers. PilotScope supports a variety of AI4DB tasks, and the implementation of an AI4DB algorithm on PilotScope can be deployed in different databases with only minimum modifications. PilotScope is effective in benchmarking these AI4DB algorithms in real-world scenarios. We hope that PilotScope could significantly accelerate iterating AI4DB research and make AI4DB techniques truly applicable in production.},

	abstract = {Efficient query optimization is crucial for database management systems. Recently, machine learning models have been applied in query optimizers to generate better plans, but the unpredictable performance regressions prevent them from being truly applicable. To be more specific, while a learned query optimizer commonly outperforms the traditional query optimizer on average for a workload of queries, its performance regression seems inevitable for some queries due to model under-fitting and difficulty in generalization. In this paper, we propose a system called Eraser to resolve this problem. Eraser aims at eliminating performance regressions while still attaining considerable overall performance improvement. To this end, Eraser applies a two-stage strategy to estimate the model accuracy for each candidate plan, and helps the learned query optimizer select more reliable plans. The first stage serves as a coarse-grained filter that removes all highly risky plans with feature values that are seen for the first time. The second stage clusters plans in a more fine-grained manner and evaluates each cluster according to the prediction quality of learned query optimizers for selecting the final execution plan. Eraser can be deployed as a plugin on top of any learned query optimizer. We implement Eraser and demonstrate its superiority on PostgreSQL and Spark. In our experiments, Eraser eliminates most of the regressions while bringing very little negative impact on the overall performance of learned query optimizers, no matter whether they perform better or worse than the traditional query optimizer. Meanwhile, it is adaptive to dynamic settings and generally applicable to different database systems.},

In this paper, we first introduce an extensive characterization of Microsoft Azure's VM workload, including distributions of the VMs' lifetime, deployment size, and resource consumption. We then show that certain VM behaviors are fairly consistent over multiple lifetimes, i.e. history is an accurate predictor of future behavior. Based on this observation, we next introduce Resource Central (RC), a system that collects VM telemetry, learns these behaviors offline, and provides predictions online to various resource managers via a general client-side library. As an example of RC's online use, we modify Azure's VM scheduler to leverage predictions in oversubscribing servers (with oversubscribable VM types), while retaining high VM performance. Using real VM traces, we then show that the prediction-informed schedules increase utilization and prevent physical resource exhaustion. We conclude that providers can exploit their workloads' characteristics and machine learning to improve resource management substantially.},

As part of the architectural basis for this engineering, we include a discussion of our experience and results adopting Intel’s recent hardware transactional memory (HTM) support to this critical building block. We ﬁnd that naively allowing concurrent access using a coarse-grained lock on existing data structures reduces overall performance with more threads. While HTM mitigates this slowdown somewhat, it does not eliminate it. Algorithmic optimizations that beneﬁt both HTM and designs for ﬁne-grained locking are needed to achieve high performance.},

Many techniques have been developed to answer these queries in a sliding windows manner. However, assuming the user will conduct the query with the presupposed window size is not always practical. In this paper, we introduce a novel data structure called Learned Cuckoo Filter (LCF). It can provide satisfactory results for the approximate membership query on data streams, regardless of the user-defined query windows. LCF operates by adaptively maintaining cuckoo filters with the assistance of a well-trained oracle that learned the frequency feature of the data within the stream. To further enhance memory utilization, we develop a compact version of LCF (denoted by LCF\_C), which selectively removes redundant information to reduce space consumption without compromising query accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough theoretical analysis of query accuracy and provide detailed guidelines for optimal parameter selection (denoted by LCF\_O). Extensive experimental studies on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of both space consumption and accuracy. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, LCF\_O can reduce up to 61\% of space cost at the same error level, and achieve up to 12× improved accuracy with the same space cost.},

As a result, the existing approaches for “plandriven” parallelism run into load balancing and context-switching bottlenecks, and therefore no longer scale. A third problem faced by many-core architectures is the decentralization of memory controllers, which leads to Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA).},

To reduce the risk of selecting highly sub-optimal query plans, we execute multiple plans in parallel. Query processing finishes once the first of these plans finishes execution. Plans are selected to be complementary in terms of the intermediate results they generate. This increases robustness to cardinality estimation errors, making cost prediction hard, that concern a subset of candidate results. We present multiple cost-based approaches to selecting plans for robust execution. The first approach uses a simple cost model, based on diversity of intermediate results. The second approach features a probabilistic model, approximating expected execution overheads, given uncertainty on true intermediate result sizes. We present greedy and exhaustive algorithms to select optimal plans according to those cost models. The experiments demonstrate that executing multiple plans in parallel is preferable over executing single plans that are occasionally sub-optimal, as well as over several baselines.},

	abstract = {Advances in memory technology have made it feasible for database management systems (DBMS) to store their working data set in main memory. This trend shifts the bottleneck for query execution from disk accesses to CPU efficiency. One technique to improve CPU efficiency is batch-oriented processing, or vectorization, as it reduces interpretation overhead. For each vector (batch) of tuples, the DBMS must track the set of valid (visible) tuples that survive all previous processing steps. To that end, existing systems employ one of two data structures, or filter representations: selection vectors or bitmaps. In this work, we analyze each approach's strengths and weaknesses and offer recommendations on how to implement vectorized operations. Through a wide range of micro-benchmarks, we determine that the optimal strategy is a function of many factors: the cost of iterating through tuples, the cost of the operation itself, and how amenable it is to SIMD vectorization. Our analysis shows that bitmaps perform better for operations that can be vectorized using SIMD instructions and that selection vectors perform better on all other operations due to cheaper iteration logic.},

We have observed that customer workloads experience highly repetitive query patterns, i.e., users and systems frequently send the same queries. In order to improve query performance on these queries, most systems rely on techniques like result caches or materialized views.However, these caches are often stale due to inserts, deletes, or updates that occur between query repetitions. We propose a novel secondary index, predicate caching, to improve query latency for repeating scans and joins. Predicate caching stores ranges of qualifying tuples of base table scans. Such an index can be built on the fly, is lightweight, and can be kept online without recomputation.We implemented a prototype of this idea in the cloud data warehouse Amazon Redshift. Our evaluation shows that predicate caching improves query runtimes by up to 10x on selected queries with negligible build overhead.},

Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework achieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which also demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic data and privacy risks in LLM scenarios.},

We argue that the disruptive influence that LLMs will have on data management will come from two angles. (1) A number of hard database problems, namely, entity resolution, schema matching, data discovery, and query synthesis, hit a ceiling of automation because the system does not fully understand the semantics of the underlying data. Based on large training corpora of natural language, structured data, and code, LLMs have an unprecedented ability to ground database tuples, schemas, and queries in real-world concepts. We will provide examples of how LLMs may completely change our approaches to these problems. (2) LLMs blur the line between predictive models and information retrieval systems with their ability to answer questions. We will present examples showing how large databases and information retrieval systems have complementary functionality.},

The engine needs to provide good performance on the raw uncurated datasets that are ubiquitous in data lakes, and excellent performance on structured data stored in popular columnar file formats like Apache Parquet. Toward these goals, we present Photon, a vectorized query engine for Lakehouse environments that we developed at Databricks. Photon can outperform existing warehouses on SQL workloads and also supports the Apache Spark API. We discuss the design choices we made in Photon (e.g., vectorization vs. code generation) and describe its integration with our existing SQL and Apache Spark runtimes, its task model, and its memory manager. Photon has accelerated some customer workloads by over 10x and has recently allowed Databricks to set a new audited performance record for the official 100TB TPC-DS benchmark.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art video database management systems (VDBMSs) often use lightweight proxy models to accelerate object retrieval and aggregate queries. The key assumption underlying these systems is that the proxy model is an order of magnitude faster than the heavyweight oracle model. However, recent advances in computer vision have invalidated this assumption. Inference time of recently proposed oracle models is on par with or even lower than the proxy models used in state-of-the-art (SoTA) VDBMSs. This paper presents Seiden, a VDBMS that leverages this radical shift in the runtime gap between the oracle and proxy models. Instead of relying on a proxy model, Seiden directly applies the oracle model over a subset of frames to build a query-agnostic index, and samples additional frames to answer the query using an exploration-exploitation scheme during query processing. By leveraging the temporal continuity of the video and the output of the oracle model on the sampled frames, Seiden delivers faster query processing and better query accuracy than SoTA VDBMSs. Our empirical evaluation shows that Seiden is on average 6.6 x faster than SoTA VDBMSs across diverse queries and datasets.},

Our interactive demonstration will show audience how this is achieved based on the novel notion of tensoral views (TViews), which are similar to relational views but operate over tensors with linear algebra. With MLog, users can succinctly specify not only simple models such as SVM (in just two lines), but also sophisticated deep learning models that are not supported by existing in-database analytics systems (e.g., MADlib, PAL, and SciDB), as a series of cascaded TViews. Given the declarative nature of MLog, we further demonstrate how query/program optimization techniques can be leveraged to translate MLog programs into native TensorFlow programs. The performance of the automatically generated Tensor-Flow programs is comparable to that of hand-optimized ones.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of machine learning tasks require dealing with large graph datasets, which capture rich and complex relationship among potentially billions of elements. Graph Neural Network (GNN) becomes an effective way to address the graph learning problem by converting the graph data into a low dimensional space while keeping both the structural and property information to the maximum extent and constructing a neural network for training and referencing. However, it is challenging to provide an efficient graph storage and computation capabilities to facilitate GNN training and enable development of new GNN algorithms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive graph neural network system, namely
              AliGraph
              , which consists of distributed graph storage, optimized sampling operators and runtime to efficiently support not only existing popular GNNs but also a series of in-house developed ones for different scenarios. The system is currently deployed at Alibaba to support a variety of business scenarios, including product recommendation and personalized search at Alibaba's E-Commerce platform. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset with 492.90 million vertices, 6.82 billion edges and rich attributes,
              AliGraph
              performs an order of magnitude faster in terms of graph building (5 minutes vs hours reported from the state-of-the-art PowerGraph platform). At training,
              AliGraph
              runs 40\%-50\% faster with the novel caching strategy and demonstrates around 12 times speed up with the improved runtime. In addition, our in-house developed GNN models all showcase their statistically significant superiorities in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., 4.12\%--17.19\% lift by F1 scores).},

	abstract = {Deep learning now offers state-of-the-art accuracy for many prediction tasks. A form of deep learning called deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are especially popular on image, video, and time series data. Due to its high computational cost, CNN inference is often a bottleneck in analytics tasks on such data. Thus, a lot of work in the computer architecture, systems, and compilers communities study how to make CNN inference faster. In this work, we show that by elevating the abstraction level and re-imagining CNN inference as
              queries
              , we can bring to bear database-style query optimization techniques to improve CNN inference efficiency. We focus on tasks that perform CNN inference
              repeatedly
              on inputs that are only
              slightly different
              . We identify two popular CNN tasks with this behavior:
              occlusion-based explanations
              (OBE) and
              object recognition in videos
              (ORV). OBE is a popular method for “explaining” CNN predictions. It outputs a heatmap over the input to show which regions (e.g., image pixels) mattered most for a given prediction. It leads to many re-inference requests on locally modified inputs. ORV uses CNNs to identify and track objects across video frames. It also leads to many re-inference requests. We cast such tasks in a unified manner as a novel instance of the
              incremental view maintenance
              problem and create a comprehensive algebraic framework for incremental CNN inference that reduces computational costs. We produce
              materialized views
              of features produced inside a CNN and connect them with a novel
              multi-query optimization
              scheme for CNN re-inference. Finally, we also devise novel OBE-specific and ORV-specific approximate inference optimizations exploiting their semantics. We prototype our ideas in Python to create a tool called
              Krypton
              that supports both CPUs and GPUs. Experiments with real data and CNNs show that
              Krypton
              reduces runtimes by up to 5× (respectively, 35×) to produce exact (respectively, high-quality approximate) results without raising resource requirements.},

	abstract = {The number of potentially-related data resources available for querying --- databases, data warehouses, virtual integrated schemas --- continues to grow rapidly. Perhaps no area has seen this problem as acutely as the life sciences, where hundreds of large, complex, interlinked data resources are available on fields like proteomics, genomics, disease studies, and pharmacology. The schemas of individual databases are often large on their own, but users also need to pose queries across multiple sources, exploiting foreign keys and schema mappings. Since the users are not experts, they typically rely on the existence of pre-defined Web forms and associated query templates, developed by programmers to meet the particular scientists' needs. Unfortunately, such forms are scarce commodities, often limited to a single database, and mismatched with biologists' information needs that are often context-sensitive and span multiple databases.
            
              We present a system with which a non-expert user can author new query templates and Web forms, to be reused by anyone with related information needs. The user poses keyword queries that are matched against source relations and their attributes; the system uses sequences of associations (e.g., foreign keys, links, schema mappings, synonyms, and taxonomies) to create multiple ranked queries linking the matches to keywords; the set of queries is attached to a Web query form. Now the user and his or her associates may pose specific queries by filling in parameters in the form. Importantly, the answers to this query are ranked and annotated with data provenance, and the user provides
              feedback
              on the utility of the answers, from which the system ultimately learns to assign costs to sources and associations according to the user's specific information need, as a result changing the ranking of the queries used to generate results. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method against "gold standard" costs from domain experts and demonstrate the method's scalability.},

Prior work in adaptive query processing has focused on compensating for delays and adjusting for mis-estimated cardinality or selectivity values. In this paper, we present a generalized architecture for adaptive query processing and introduce a new technique, called adaptive data partitioning (ADP), which is based on the idea of dividing the source data into regions, each executed by different, complementary plans. We show how this model can be applied in novel ways to not only correct for underestimated selectivity and cardinality values, but also to discover and exploit order in the source data, and to detect and exploit source data that can be effectively pre-aggregated. We experimentally compare a number of alternative strategies and show that our approach is effective.},

Scientific fields evolve rapidly and accumulate masses of observational and experimental data that needs to be annotated, revised, interlinked, and made available to other scientists. From the perspective of the user, this can be a major headache as the data they seek may initially be spread across many databases in need of integration. Worse, even if users are given a solution that integrates the current state of the source databases, new data sources appear with new data items of interest to the user. Here we build upon recent ideas for creating integrated views over data sources using keyword search techniques, ranked answers, and user feedback [32] to investigate how to automatically discover when a new data source has content relevant to a user's view - in essence, performing automatic data integration for incoming data sets. The new architecture accommodates a variety of methods to discover related attributes, including label propagation algorithms from the machine learning community [2] and existing schema matchers [11]. The user may provide feedback on the suggested new results, helping the system repair any bad alignments or increase the cost of including a new source that is not useful. We evaluate our approach on actual bioinformatics schemas and data, using state-of-the-art schema matchers as components. We also discuss how our architecture can be adapted to more traditional settings with a mediated schema.},

	abstract = {An important means of allowing non-expert end-users to pose ad hoc queries whether over single databases or data integration systems is through keyword search. Given a set of keywords, the query processor finds matches across different tuples and tables. It computes and executes a set of relational sub-queries whose results are combined to produce the k highest ranking answers. Work on keyword search primarily focuses on single-database, single-query settings: each query is answered in isolation, despite possible overlap between queries posed by different users or at different times; and the number of relevant tables is assumed to be small, meaning that sub-queries can be processed without using cost-based methods to combine work. As we apply keyword search to support ad hoc data integration queries over scientific or other databases on the Web, we must reuse and combine computation. In this paper, we propose an architecture that continuously receives sets of ranked keyword queries, and seeks to reuse work across these queries. We extend multiple query optimization and continuous query techniques, and develop a new query plan scheduling module we call the ATC (based on its analogy to an air traffic controller). The ATC manages the flow of tuples among a multitude of pipelined operators, minimizing the work needed to return the top-k answers for all queries. We also develop techniques to manage the sharing and reuse of state as queries complete and input data streams are exhausted. We show the effectiveness of our techniques in handling queries over real and synthetic data sets.},

Recently, the Transformer model, popular in natural language processing, has been leveraged to learn high quality feature embeddings from timeseries: embeddings are key to the performance of various timeseries analytics tasks such as similarity-based timeseries queries within vector databases. However, quadratic time and space complexities limit Transformers' scalability, especially for long timeseries. To address these issues, we develop a timeseries analytics tool, RITA, which uses a novel attention mechanism, named group attention, to address this scalability issue. Group attention dynamically clusters the objects based on their similarity into a small number of groups and approximately computes the attention at the coarse group granularity. It thus significantly reduces the time and space complexity, yet provides a theoretical guarantee on the quality of the computed attention. The dynamic scheduler of RITA continuously adapts the number of groups and the batch size in the training process, ensuring group attention always uses the fewest groups needed to meet the approximation quality requirement. Extensive experiments on various timeseries datasets and analytics tasks demonstrate that RITA outperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and is significantly faster --- with speedups of up to 63X.},

to be a scaleable and adaptable model for querying a variety of struc-
tured data, with use cases in analytics, transactions, graphs, stream-
ing and more. However, most of the world’s data is unstructured.
Thus, despite their success, the reality is that the vast majority
of the world’s data has remained beyond the reach of relational
systems.
The rise of deep learning and generative AI offers an opportu-
nity to change this. These models provide a stunning capability to
extract semantic understanding from almost any type of document,
including text, images, and video, which can extend the reach of
databases to all the world’s data. In this paper we explore how
these new technologies will transform the way we build database
management software, creating new that systems that can ingest,
store, process, and query all data. Building such systems presents
many opportunities and challenges. In this paper we focus on three:
scalability, correctness, and reliability, and argue that the declara-
tive programming paradigm that has served relational systems so
well offers a path forward in the new world of AI data systems as
well. To illustrate this, we describe several examples of such declar-
ative AI systems we have built in document and video processing,
and provide a set of research challenges and opportunities to guide
research in this exciting area going forward.

Such tools take scientists' work-in-progress data as a search object (table or JSON) and find relevant supplementary data from an organizational data lake, which can be unioned or joined with the current data. Existing data lake search tools find single, relational tables to match or join with a search object. Yet many data science applications revolve around hierarchical data, which can only be matched by creating views that simultaneously join and transform several tables in the data lake. In this paper, we extend the Juneau data lake search system [46] for this broader class of matches at scale. Our contribution is a general framework for efficiently merging ranked results to match hierarchical data, leveraging novel techniques for indexing and sketching, and incorporating existing single-table search techniques and ranking functions. We experimentally validate our methods' benefits and broad applicability using real data from data science computational notebooks. Our results indicate that, with different ranking functions, our approach can return the optimal set of views up to 4.8x faster and 43\% more related compared to heuristics, and increase the data domain coverage by up to 28\%.

cross-sector data provide valuable insights to inform resource allocation, guide program implementation, and evaluate
policies. Data sharing, while routine, is not without risks, and clear legal frameworks for data sharing are essential to
mitigate those risks, protect privacy, and guide responsible data use. In some cases, federal privacy laws offer clear
consent requirements and outline explicit exceptions where consent is not required to share data. In other cases, the
law is unclear or silent regarding whether consent is needed for data sharing. Importantly, consent can present both
ethical and logistical challenges, particularly when integrating cross-sector data. This brief will frame out key concepts
related to consent; explore major federal laws governing the sharing of administrative data, including individually

	abstract = {For decades researchers have studied the duality of hashing and sorting for the implementation of the relational operators, especially for efficient aggregation. Depending on the underlying hardware and software architecture, the specifically implemented algorithms, and the data sets used in the experiments, different authors came to different conclusions about which is the better approach. In this paper we argue that in terms of cache efficiency, the two paradigms are actually the same. We support our claim by showing that the complexity of hashing is the same as the complexity of sorting in the external memory model. Furthermore we make the similarity of the two approaches obvious by designing an algorithmic framework that allows to switch seamlessly between hashing and sorting during execution. The fact that we mix hashing and sorting routines in the same algorithmic framework allows us to leverage the advantages of both approaches and makes their similarity obvious. On a more practical note, we also show how to achieve very low constant factors by tuning both the hashing and the sorting routines to modern hardware. Since we observe a complementary dependency of the constant factors of the two routines to the locality of the input, we exploit our framework to switch to the faster routine where appropriate. The result is a novel relational aggregation algorithm that is cache-efficient---independently and without prior knowledge of input skew and output cardinality---, highly parallelizable on modern multi-core systems, and operating at a speed close to the memory bandwidth, thus outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to 3.7x.},

	abstract = {Concurrent hash tables are one of the most important concurrent data structures, which are used in numerous applications. For some applications, it is common that hash table accesses dominate the execution time. To efficiently solve these problems in parallel, we need implementations that achieve speedups in highly concurrent scenarios. Unfortunately, currently available concurrent hashing libraries are far away from this requirement, in particular, when adaptively sized tables are necessary or contention on some elements occurs.
            Our starting point for better performing data structures is a fast and simple lock-free concurrent hash table based on linear probing that is, however, limited to word-sized key-value types and does not support dynamic size adaptation. We explain how to lift these limitations in a provably scalable way and demonstrate that dynamic growing has a performance overhead comparable to the same generalization in sequential hash tables.
            We perform extensive experiments comparing the performance of our implementations with six of the most widely used concurrent hash tables. Ours are considerably faster than the best algorithms with similar restrictions and an order of magnitude faster than the best more general tables. In some extreme cases, the difference even approaches four orders of magnitude.

Inspired by recent theoretical advances in probabilistic inference, we introduce a series of optimizations which ensure that inference over HoloClean's probabilistic model scales to instances with millions of tuples. We show that HoloClean finds data repairs with an average precision of ∼ 90\% and an average recall of above ∼ 76\% across a diverse array of datasets exhibiting different types of errors. This yields an average F1 improvement of more than 2× against state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Background
The United States continues to experience unprecedented rates of overdose mortality and need to identify effective policies or practices that can be implemented. This study aims to measure the prevalence, frequency, timing, and rate of touchpoints that occurred prior to a fatal overdose where communities might intervene.
Methods
In collaboration with Indiana state government, we conducted record-linkage of statewide administrative datasets to vital records (January 1, 2015, through August 26, 2022) to identify touchpoints (jail booking, prison release, prescription medication dispensation, emergency department visits, and emergency medical services). We examined touchpoints within 12-months prior to a fatal overdose among an adult cohort and explored variation over time and by demographic characteristics.
Results
Over the 92-month study period there were 13,882 overdose deaths (89.3\% accidental poisonings, X40-X44) in our adult cohort that were record-linked to multiple administrative datasets and revealed nearly two-thirds (64.7\%; n=8980) experienced an emergency department visit, the most prevalent touchpoint followed by prescription medication dispensation, emergency medical services responses, jail booking, and prison release. However, with approximately 1 out of every 100 returning citizens dying from drug overdose within 12-months of release, prison release had the highest touchpoint rate followed by emergency medical services responses, jail booking, emergency department visits, and prescription medication dispensation.
Conclusion
Record-linking administrative data from routine practice to vital records from overdose mortality is a viable means of identifying where resources should be situated to reduce fatal overdose, with potential to evaluate the effectiveness of overdose prevention efforts.},

In particular, there seems to be a wide gulf between users' debugging strategies and the functionality implemented in existing DBMSs, as well as proposed in the literature. In response, we propose new design guidelines to help system designers to build features that more closely match users debugging strategies.},

This paper proposes Pond, the first memory pooling system that both meets cloud performance goals and significantly reduces DRAM cost. Pond builds on the Compute Express Link (CXL) standard for load/store access to pool memory and two key insights. First, our analysis of cloud production traces shows that pooling across 8-16 sockets is enough to achieve most of the benefits. This enables a small-pool design with low access latency. Second, it is possible to create machine learning models that can accurately predict how much local and pool memory to allocate to a virtual machine (VM) to resemble same-NUMA-node memory performance. Our evaluation with 158 workloads shows that Pond reduces DRAM costs by 7\% with performance within 1-5\% of same-NUMA-node VM allocations.},

	title = {Generic database cost models for hierarchical memory systems},
	abstract = {Accurate prediction of operator execution time is a prerequisite for database query optimization. Although extensively studied for conventional disk-based DBMSs, cost modeling in main-memory DBMSs is still an open issue. Recent database research has demonstrated that memory access is more and more becoming a significant-- if not the major--cost component of database operations. If used properly, fast but small cache memories--usually organized in cascading hierarchy between CPU and main memory--can help to reduce memory access costs. However, they make the cost estimation problem more complex.In this article, we propose a generic technique to create accurate cost functions for database operations. We identify a few basic memory access patterns and provide cost functions that estimate their access costs for each level of the memory hierarchy. The cost functions are parameterized to accommodate various hardware characteristics appropriately. Combining the basic patterns, we can describe the memory access patterns of database operations. The cost functions of database operations can automatically be derived by combining the basic patterns' cost functions accordingly.To validate our approach, we performed experiments using our DBMS prototype Monet. The results presented here confirm the accuracy of our cost models for different operations.Aside from being useful for query optimization, our models provide insight to tune algorithms not only in a main-memory DBMS, but also in a disk-based DBMS with a large main-memory buffer cache.},

Nonetheless, existing generation-based debug tools are limited to single-table queries and there is a substantial research gap regarding multi-table queries with join operators. In this paper, we propose TQS, a novel testing framework targeted at detecting logic bugs derived by queries involving multi-table joins. Given a target DBMS, TQS achieves the goal with two key components: Data-guided Schema and Query Generation (DSG) and Knowledge-guided Query Space Exploration (KQE). DSG addresses the key challenge of multi-table query debugging: how to generate ground-truth (query, result) pairs for verification. It adopts the database normalization technique to generate a testing schema and maintains a bitmap index for result tracking. To improve debug efficiency, DSG also artificially inserts some noises into the generated data. To avoid repetitive query space search, KQE forms the problem as isomorphic graph set discovery and combines the graph embedding and weighted random walk for query generation. We evaluated TQS on four popular DBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB and PolarDB. Experimental results show that TQS is effective in finding logic bugs of join optimization in database management systems. It successfully detected 115 bugs within 24 hours, including 31 bugs in MySQL, 30 in MariaDB, 31 in TiDB, and 23 in PolarDB respectively.},

We demonstrate that our approach, which relies on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, can rapidly identify sparse subspaces relevant to modeling the unknown objective function, enabling sample-efficient high-dimensional BO. In an extensive suite of experiments comparing to existing methods for high-dimensional BO we demonstrate that our algorithm, Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace BO (SAASBO), achieves excellent performance on several synthetic and real-world problems without the need to set problem-specific hyperparameters.},

	abstract = {Active learning (AL) attempts to maximize a model’s performance gain while annotating the fewest samples possible. Deep learning (DL) is greedy for data and requires a large amount of data supply to optimize a massive number of parameters if the model is to learn how to extract high-quality features. In recent years, due to the rapid development of internet technology, we have entered an era of information abundance characterized by massive amounts of available data. As a result, DL has attracted significant attention from researchers and has been rapidly developed. Compared with DL, however, researchers have a relatively low interest in AL. This is mainly because before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few labeled samples, meaning that early AL is rarely according the value it deserves. Although DL has made breakthroughs in various fields, most of this success is due to a large number of publicly available annotated datasets. However, the acquisition of a large number of high-quality annotated datasets consumes a lot of manpower, making it unfeasible in fields that require high levels of expertise (such as speech recognition, information extraction, medical images, etc.). Therefore, AL is gradually coming to receive the attention it is due.It is therefore natural to investigate whether AL can be used to reduce the cost of sample annotation while retaining the powerful learning capabilities of DL. As a result of such investigations, deep active learning (DeepAL) has emerged. Although research on this topic is quite abundant, there has not yet been a comprehensive survey of DeepAL-related works; accordingly, this article aims to fill this gap. We provide a formal classification method for the existing work, along with a comprehensive and systematic overview. In addition, we also analyze and summarize the development of DeepAL from an application perspective. Finally, we discuss the confusion and problems associated with DeepAL and provide some possible development directions.},

	abstract = {Cost-based query optimizers need to estimate the selectivity of conjunctive predicates when comparing alternative query execution plans. To this end, advanced optimizers use multivariate statistics to improve information about the joint distribution of attribute values in a table. The joint distribution for all columns is almost always too large to store completely, and the resulting use of partial distribution information raises the possibility that multiple, non-equivalent selectivity estimates may be available for a given predicate. Current optimizers use cumbersome ad hoc methods to ensure that selectivities are estimated in a consistent manner. These methods ignore valuable information and tend to bias the optimizer toward query plans for which the least information is available, often yielding poor results. In this paper we present a novel method for consistent selectivity estimation based on the principle of maximum entropy (ME). Our method exploits all available information and avoids the bias problem. In the absence of detailed knowledge, the ME approach reduces to standard uniformity and independence assumptions. Experiments with our prototype implementation in DB2 UDB show that use of the ME approach can improve the optimizer’s cardinality estimates by orders of magnitude, resulting in better plan quality and significantly reduced query execution times. For almost all queries, these improvements are obtained while adding only tens of milliseconds to the overall time required for query optimization.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for efﬁcient optimization of black-box objective functions. High-dimensional BO presents a particular challenge, in part because the curse of dimensionality makes it difﬁcult to deﬁne—as well as do inference over—a suitable class of surrogate models. We argue that Gaussian process surrogate models deﬁned on sparse axis-aligned subspaces offer an attractive compromise between ﬂexibility and parsimony. We demonstrate that our approach, which relies on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, can rapidly identify sparse subspaces relevant to modeling the unknown objective function, enabling sample-efﬁcient high-dimensional BO. In an extensive suite of experiments comparing to existing methods for high-dimensional BO we demonstrate that our algorithm, Sparse AxisAligned Subspace BO (SAASBO), achieves excellent performance on several synthetic and realworld problems without the need to set problemspeciﬁc hyperparameters.},

We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11\% faster and using 11\% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.},

We demonstrate why we believe that a re-optimization mechanism is likely the most cost-effective way to improve end-to-end query performance. We find that even a simple re-optimization scheme can improve the latency of many poorly performing queries.

	abstract = {Data analytics has recently grown to include increasingly sophisticated techniques, such as machine learning and advanced statistics. Users frequently express these complex analytics tasks as workflows of user-defined functions (UDFs) that specify each algorithmic step. However, given typical hardware configurations and dataset sizes, the core challenge of complex analytics is no longer sheer data volume but rather the computation itself, and the next generation of analytics frameworks must focus on optimizing for this computation bottleneck. While query compilation has gained widespread popularity as a way to tackle the computation bottleneck for traditional SQL workloads, relatively little work addresses UDF-centric workflows in the domain of complex analytics.In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for automatically compiling workflows of UDFs. We also propose several optimizations that consider properties of the data, UDFs, and hardware together in order to generate different code on a case-by-case basis. To evaluate our approach, we implemented these techniques in Tupleware, a new high-performance distributed analytics system, and our benchmarks show performance improvements of up to three orders of magnitude compared to alternative systems.},

            However, using these various systems comes at a price. Moving data out of traditional database systems is often slow as it requires exporting and importing data, which is typically performed using the relatively inefficient CSV format. Additionally, database systems usually offer strong ACID guarantees, which are lost when adding new, external systems. This disadvantage can be detrimental to the consistency of the results.
            Most data scientists still prefer not to use classical database systems for data analytics. The main reason why RDBMS are not used is that SQL is difficult to work with due to its declarative and set-oriented nature, and is not easily extensible.
            We present User-Defined Operators (UDOs) as a concept to include custom algorithms into modern query engines. Users can write idiomatic code in the programming language of their choice, which is then directly integrated into existing database systems. We show that our implementation can compete with specialized tools and existing query engines while retaining all beneficial properties of the database system.},

However, such a rapid "game change" in the field of QOP could not pass without consequences - other parts of the ML pipeline, except for predictive model development, have large improvement potential. For instance, different LQOs introduce their own restrictions on training data generation from queries, use an arbitrary train/validation approach, and evaluate on a voluntary split of benchmark queries.In this paper, we attempt to standardize the ML pipeline for evaluating LQOs by introducing a new end-to-end benchmarking framework. Additionally, we guide the reader through each data science stage in the ML pipeline and provide novel insights from the machine learning perspective, considering the specifics of QOP. Finally, we perform a rigorous evaluation of existing LQOs, showing that PostgreSQL outperforms these LQOs in almost all experiments depending on the train/test splits.},

This so-called censoring can be handled most effectively using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome the issue of censoring. In addition, many machine learning algorithms have been adapted to deal with such censored data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the statistical methods typically used and the machine learning techniques developed for survival analysis, along with a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and describe several successful applications in a variety of real-world application domains. We hope that this article will give readers a more comprehensive understanding of recent advances in survival analysis and offer some guidelines for applying these approaches to solve new problems arising in applications involving censored data.},

	abstract = {Pool-based active learning is an important technique that helps reduce labeling efforts within a pool of unlabeled instances. Currently, most pool-based active learning strategies are constructed based on some human-designed philosophy; that is, they reflect what human beings assume to be “good labeling questions.” However, while such human-designed philosophies can be useful on specific data sets, it is often difficult to establish the theoretical connection of those philosophies to the true learning performance of interest. In addition, given that a single human-designed philosophy is unlikely to work on all scenarios, choosing and blending those strategies under different scenarios is an important but challenging practical task. This paper tackles this task by letting the machines adaptively “learn” from the performance of a set of given strategies on a particular data set. More specifically, we design a learning algorithm that connects active learning with the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. Further, we postulate that, given an appropriate choice for the multi-armed bandit learner, it is possible to estimate the performance of different strategies on the fly. Extensive empirical studies of the resulting ALBL algorithm confirm that it performs better than state-of-the-art strategies and a leading blending algorithm for active learning, all of which are based on human-designed philosophy.},

	abstract = {Biased data can lead to unfair machine learning models, highlighting the importance of embedding fairness at the beginning of data analysis, particularly during dataset curation and labeling. In response, we propose Falcon, a scalable fair active learning framework. Falcon adopts a data-centric approach that improves machine learning model fairness via strategic sample selection. Given a user-specified group fairness measure, Falcon identifies samples from "target groups" (e.g., (attribute=female, label=positive)) that are the most informative for improving fairness. However, a challenge arises since these target groups are defined using ground truth labels that are not available during sample selection. To handle this, we propose a novel trial-and-error method, where we postpone using a sample if the predicted label is different from the expected one and falls outside the target group. We also observe the trade-off that selecting more informative samples results in higher likelihood of postponing due to undesired label prediction, and the optimal balance varies per dataset. We capture the trade-off between informativeness and postpone rate as policies and propose to automatically select the best policy using adversarial multi-armed bandit methods, given their computational efficiency and theoretical guarantees. Experiments show that Falcon significantly outperforms existing fair active learning approaches in terms of fairness and accuracy and is more efficient. In particular, only Falcon supports a proper trade-off between accuracy and fairness where its maximum fairness score is 1.8-4.5x higher than the second-best results.},

	abstract = {The discovery of novel materials and functional molecules can help to solve some of society's most urgent challenges, ranging from efficient energy harvesting and storage to uncovering novel pharmaceutical drug candidates. Traditionally matter engineering -- generally denoted as inverse design -- was based massively on human intuition and high-throughput virtual screening. The last few years have seen the emergence of significant interest in computer-inspired designs based on evolutionary or deep learning methods. The major challenge here is that the standard strings molecular representation SMILES shows substantial weaknesses in that task because large fractions of strings do not correspond to valid molecules. Here, we solve this problem at a fundamental level and introduce SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings), a string-based representation of molecules which is 100{\textbackslash}\% robust. Every SELFIES string corresponds to a valid molecule, and SELFIES can represent every molecule. SELFIES can be directly applied in arbitrary machine learning models without the adaptation of the models; each of the generated molecule candidates is valid. In our experiments, the model's internal memory stores two orders of magnitude more diverse molecules than a similar test with SMILES. Furthermore, as all molecules are valid, it allows for explanation and interpretation of the internal working of the generative models.},

In this context, estimators that use machine learning have shown significant promise. Despite their potential, the effectiveness of these learned estimators strongly depends on their ability to learn from small training sets.This paper presents a novel approach for learned cardinality estimation that addresses this issue by enhancing sample efficiency. We propose a neural network architecture informed by geometric deep learning principles that represents queries as join graphs. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative encoding for complex predicates, treating their encoding as a feature selection problem. Additionally, we devise a regularization term that employs equalities of the relational algebra and three-valued logic, augmenting the training process without requiring additional ground truth cardinalities. We rigorously evaluate our model across multiple benchmarks, examining q-errors, runtimes, and the impact of workload distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that our model significantly improves the end-to-end runtimes of PostgreSQL, even with cardinalities gathered from as little as 100 query executions.},

First, the schema does not provide all relevant dependencies. We present a workload-driven dependency discovery approach to find additional dependencies within milliseconds. Second, the throughput improvement of a state-of-the-art DBMS is 13 \% using only SQL rewrites, but 20 \% when we integrate dependency-based optimization into the optimizer and execution engine, e. g., by employing dependency propagation and subquery handling. Using all relevant dependencies, the runtime of four standard benchmarks improves by up to 10 \% compared to using only primary and foreign keys, and up to 22 \% compared to not using dependencies. The dependency discovery overhead amortizes after a single workload execution.},

Building on the resource-based view of the firm, this study aims to investigate top management perceptions of using business analytics for making decisions on firm resources.,This study uses semi-structured interviews to collect perceptions of 12 top managers in large firms on when and why they use business analytics in their decision-making.,Top managers use business analytics output as their main source of information for monitoring ongoing business performance against set targets and taking corrective actions. Concerning future-oriented planning and strategic decision-making involving more complex changes on the firms’ resource base, top managers proactively complement knowledge derived via business analytics with other sources of knowledge, such as stakeholder and expert opinions. Moreover, top managers use of business analytics depends on their own expectations of its value potential and on the expectations of their organization.,This study adds to the extant literature on the business value of business analytics by outlining the purposes and reasons for top management business analytics use. By demonstrating when and why top managers apply business analytics when making decisions on the firm’s current and future resource base, this study contributes to the discussion on the resource-based view and decision-making practices of the firm.},

Still, because of its NP hardness, no generally efficient solution exists and the problem remains an important topic of research. The scope of algorithms to compute join orders ranges from exhaustive enumeration, to combinatorics based on graph properties, to greedy search, to genetic algorithms, to recently investigated machine learning. A few works exist that use heuristic search to compute join orders. However, a theoretical argument why and how heuristic search is applicable to join order optimization is lacking.
            In this work, we investigate join order optimization via heuristic search. In particular, we provide a strong theoretical framework, in which we reduce join order optimization to the shortest path problem. We then thoroughly analyze the properties of this problem and the applicability of heuristic search. We devise crucial optimizations to make heuristic search tractable. We implement join ordering via heuristic search in a real DBMS and conduct an extensive empirical study. Our findings show that for star- and clique-shaped queries, heuristic search finds optimal plans an order of magnitude faster than current state of the art. Our suboptimal solutions further extend the cost/time Pareto frontier.},

Many probabilistic logic programming (PLP) semantics have been proposed; among these, the distribution semantics has recently gained increased attention and has been adopted by many languages such as the Independent Choice Logic, PRISM, Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions, ProbLog, and P-log.This chapter reviews the distribution semantics, beginning with the simplest case with stratified Datalog programs, and showing how the definition is extended to programs that include function symbols and non-stratified negation. The languages that adopt the distribution semantics are also discussed and compared both to one another and to Bayesian networks.We then survey existing approaches for inference in PLP languages that follow the distribution semantics. We concentrate on the PRISM, ProbLog, and PITA systems. The PRISM system was one of the first and can be applied when certain restrictions on the program hold. ProbLog introduced the use of Binary Decision Diagrams that provide a computational basis for removing these restrictions and so performing inference over more general classes of logic programs. PITA speeds up inference by using tabling and answer subsumption. It supports general probabilistic programs, but can easily be optimized for simpler settings and even possibilistic uncertain reasoning. The chapter also discusses the computational complexity of the various approaches together with techniques for limiting it by resorting to approximation.},

	abstract = {Query optimization is a hallmark of database systems. When an SQL query runs more expensively than is viable or warranted, determination of the performance issues is usually performed manually in consultation with experts through the analysis of query's execution plan (QEP). However, this is an excessively time consuming, human error-prone, and costly process. GALO is a novel system that automates this process. The tool automatically learns recurring problem patterns in query plans over workloads in an offline learning phase, to build a knowledge base of plan-rewrite remedies. It then uses the knowledge base online to re-optimize queries often quite drastically.
            
              GALO's knowledge base is built on RDF and SPARQL, W3C graph database standards, which is well suited for manipulating and querying over SQL query plans, which are graphs themselves. GALO acts as a third-tier of re-optimization, after query rewrite and cost-based optimization, as a
              query plan rewrite
              . For generality, the context of knowledge base problem patterns, including table and column names, is abstracted with canonical symbol labels. Since the knowledge base is not tied to the context of supplied QEPs, table and column names are matched automatically during the re-optimization phase. Thus, problem patterns learned over a particular query workload can be applied in other query workloads. GALO's knowledge base is also an invaluable tool for database experts to debug query performance issues by tracking to known issues and solutions as well as refining the optimizer with new tuned techniques by the development team. We demonstrate an experimental study of the effectiveness of our techniques over synthetic TPC-DS and real IBM client query workloads.},

Classical optimizers rely on inaccurate parameter estimates and assumptions that may not hold true in real-world scenarios. Consequently, suboptimal execution plans may be chosen, leading to poor query execution performance. Recent proposals of learned query optimizers that leverage Machine Learning suffer also from the selection of suboptimal plans. In order to fill this gap, we have created Robust Workload Optimization (RobOpt), a prototype tool that facilitates robust execution of a query workload in RDBMSs. It implements a novel technique that takes workload logs as input, generates training samples, and trains a risk-aware learned cost model. It optimizes risk-aware plan selection strategies to achieve a desired level of runtime performance and robustness. In addition, it analyzes a workload according to its training samples and determines an optimal plan selection strategy either at the workload or query level. Ultimately, it enables the robust execution of any workload by determining an optimal plan selection strategy per query. RobOpt can work on top of any RDBMS.},

Examples include discriminative machine learning, hierarchical Bayesian models, multivariate kernel methods, clustering algorithms, and arbitrary probabilistic programs. We demonstrate the integration of CGPMs into BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform that can express data analysis tasks using a modeling definition language and structured query language.

	abstract = {Databases are widespread, yet extracting relevant data can be difficult. Without substantial domain knowledge, multivariate search queries often return sparse or uninformative results. This paper introduces an approach for searching structured data based on probabilistic programming and nonparametric Bayes. Users specify queries in a probabilistic language that combines standard SQL database search operators with an information theoretic ranking function called predictive relevance. Predictive relevance can be calculated by a fast sparse matrix algorithm based on posterior samples from CrossCat, a nonparametric Bayesian model for high-dimensional, heterogeneously-typed data tables. The result is a flexible search technique that applies to a broad class of information retrieval problems, which we integrate into BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform for probabilistic data analysis. This paper demonstrates applications to databases of US colleges, global macroeconomic indicators of public health, and classic cars. We found that human evaluators often prefer the results from probabilistic search to results from a standard baseline.},

This workload-driven approach, however, has two major downsides. First, collecting the training data can be very expensive, since all queries need to be executed on potentially large databases. Second, training data has to be recollected when the workload or the database changes. To overcome these limitations, we take a diﬀerent route and propose a new data-driven approach for learned DBMS components which directly supports changes of the workload and data without the need of retraining. Indeed, one may now expect that this comes at a price of lower accuracy since workload-driven approaches can make use of more information. However, this is not the case. The results of our empirical evaluation demonstrate that our data-driven approach not only provides better accuracy than state-ofthe-art learned components but also generalizes better to unseen queries.},

We study cardinality estimation in a principled framework: given a set of statistical assertions about the number of tuples returned by a fixed set of queries, predict the number of tuples returned by a new query. We model this problem using the probability space, over possible worlds, that satisfies all provided statistical assertions and maximizes entropy.

We further present an algorithm that enables the estimator to calculate cardinality estimates for range join queries efficiently.

Our method, called ASM, harmonizes autoregressive models for per-table statistics estimation, sampling for merging these statistics for join queries, and multi-dimensional statistics merging that extends the sampling for estimating thousands of sub-queries, without assuming independence between join keys. Extensive experiments show that ASM significantly improves query plans under a similar or smaller overhead than the previous learned methods and supports a wider range of queries.},

In this work, we propose an Attention-based LEarned Cardinality Estimator (ALECE for short) for SPJ queries. The core idea is to discover the implicit relationships between queries and underlying dynamic data using attention mechanisms in ALECE's two modules that are built on top of carefully designed featurizations for data and queries. In particular, from all attributes in the database, the data-encoder module obtains organic and learnable aggregations which implicitly represent correlations among the attributes, whereas the query-analyzer module builds a bridge between the query featurizations and the data aggregations to predict the query's cardinality. We experimentally evaluate ALECE on multiple dynamic workloads. The results show that ALECE enables PostgreSQL's optimizer to achieve nearly optimal performance, clearly outperforming its built-in cardinality estimator and other alternatives.},

	abstract = {Autonomous database management systems (DBMSs) aim to optimize themselves automatically without human guidance. They rely on machine learning (ML) models that predict their run-time behavior to evaluate whether a candidate configuration is beneficial without the expensive execution of queries. However, the high cost of collecting the training data to build these models makes them impractical for real-world deployments. Furthermore, these models are instance-specific and thus require retraining whenever the DBMS's environment changes. State-of-the-art methods spend over 93\% of their time running queries for training versus tuning.
            To mitigate this problem, we present the Boot framework for automatically accelerating training data collection in DBMSs. Boot utilizes macro- and micro-acceleration (MMA) techniques that modify query execution semantics with approximate run-time telemetry and skip repetitive parts of the training process. To evaluate Boot, we integrated it into a database gym for PostgreSQL. Our experimental evaluation shows that Boot reduces training collection times by up to 268× with modest degradation in model accuracy. These results also indicate that our MMA-based approach scales with dataset size and workload complexity.},

However, if multiple users submit queries within a short time frame, it can result in potential issues such as redundant computation and query concurrency. Unfortunately, most existing multi-query optimization methods, which aim to enhance query processing efficiency, have not adequately addressed these two problems, especially in the setting where multiple queries are being executed concurrently. To this end, we propose a novel method named Lemo for the multi-query optimization problem. Specifically, we propose a novel value network to predict latencies of concurrent queries as the foundation model for query plan generation. Furthermore, we introduce a shared buffer manager component to cache the intermediate results of sub-queries. The shared buffer manager applies a novel replacement policy to maintain the cached buffer with the objective of maximizing the opportunity for the reuse of the cached sub-queries. Based on the shared buffer, our proposed value network can incorporate the cached results into cost estimation to further guide Lemo in generating query plans, thus avoiding redundant computation. Lemo has been integrated into PostgreSQL and experiments conducted on real datasets with PostgreSQL show that it outperforms all the baselines in efficiency.},

	abstract = {Query optimization has become a research area where classical algorithms are being challenged by machine learning algorithms. At the same time, recent trends in learned query optimizers have shown that it is prudent to take advantage of decades of database research and augment classical query optimizers by shrinking the plan search space through different types of hints (e.g. by specifying the join type, scan type or the order of joins) rather than completely replacing the classical query optimizer with machine learning models. It is especially relevant for cases when classical optimizers cannot fully enumerate all logical and physical plans and, as an alternative, need to rely on less robust approaches like genetic algorithms. However, even symbiotically learned query optimizers are hampered by the need for vast amounts of training data, slow plan generation during inference and unstable results across various workload conditions. In this paper, we present GenJoin - a novel learned query optimizer that considers the query optimization problem as a generative task and is capable of learning from a random set of subplan hints to produce query plans that outperform the classical optimizer. GenJoin is the first learned query optimizer that significantly and consistently outperforms PostgreSQL as well as state-of-the-art methods on two well-known real-world benchmarks across a variety of workloads using rigorous machine learning evaluations.},

Our alternative solution consists of a new inference schema based on an ensemble of context-aware models and a graph storage for reliable hint suggestion and fast inference, and a budget-controlled training procedure with a local search algorithm that solves the issue of exponential search space exploration. In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model demonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with coarse-grained hints.

To train the ML model, a pairwise ranking objective is proposed, which is substantially different from the previous regression objective. To help the optimizer to escape the local minima and avoid failure, a ranking and uncertainty-based exploration strategy is proposed, which discovers the valuable plans to aid the optimizer.

Adaptive techniques require innovation both in terms of the algorithms used to estimate costs, and in terms of the search algorithm that finds the best plan. We investigate how to build a cost-based optimizer that recomputes the optimal plan incrementally given new cost information, much as a stream engine constantly updates its outputs given new data. Our implementation especially shows benefits for stream processing workloads. It lays the foundations upon which a variety of novel adaptive optimization algorithms can be built. We start by leveraging the recently proposed approach of formulating query plan enumeration as a set of recursive datalog queries; we develop a variety of novel optimization approaches to ensure effective pruning in both static and incremental cases. We further show that the lessons learned in the declarative implementation can be equally applied to more traditional optimizer implementations.},

We propose to demonstrate the Rio prototype database system that uses proactive re-optimization to address the problems with traditional optimizers. Rio supports three new techniques:1. Intervals of uncertainty are considered around estimates of statistics during plan enumeration and costing2. These intervals are used to pick execution plans that are robust to deviations of actual values of statistics from estimated values, or to defer the choice of execution plan until the uncertainty in estimates can be resolved3. Statistics of intermediate subexpressions are collected quickly, accurately, and efficiently during query executionThese three features are fully functional in the current Rio prototype which is built using the Predator open-source DBMS [5]. In this proposal, we first describe the novel features of Rio, then we use an example query to illustrate the main aspects of our demonstration.},

	abstract = {Although learning-based database optimization techniques have been studied from academia in recent years, they have not been widely deployed in commercial database systems. In this work, we build an autonomous database framework and integrate our proposed learning-based database techniques into an open-source database system openGauss. We propose effective learning-based models to build learned optimizers (including learned query rewrite, learned cost/cardinality estimation, learned join order selection and physical operator selection) and learned database advisors (including self-monitoring, self-diagnosis, self-configuration, and self-optimization). We devise an effective validation model to validate the effectiveness of learned models. We build effective training data management and model management platforms to easily deploy learned models. We have evaluated our techniques on real-world datasets and the experimental results validated the effectiveness of our techniques. We also provide our learnings of deploying learning-based techniques.},
