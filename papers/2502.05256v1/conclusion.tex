\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we presented \sysname, an \emph{offline} learned query optimizer. \sysname uses modern Bayesian optimization techniques to search for fast query plans for important repeated queries. Experimentally, we show that \sysname was able to optimize nearly every query in a set of common, non-synthetic benchmarks, sometimes achieving multiple orders-of-magnitude improvements.

In the future, we plan to integrate \sysname into a wider variety of database systems. Given the promising results from our LLM experiment, we plan to investigate how we can ``close the loop,'' using the LLM to generate initialization data for future optimization runs. We are also excited to examine how Bayesian optimization can be applied to other databases problems such as automatic index selection, data layout, and benchmark curation.
