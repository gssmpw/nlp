Compression techniques, including quantization and weight pruning, have been explored to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs without substantially affecting their generative capabilities ____. Additionally, investigations into the plasticity of neuron connections have revealed that retraining selected neurons rather than entire network layers can facilitate more targeted adaptation to evolving language patterns ____. However, existing strategies primarily focus on reducing model size rather than restructuring neuron encapsulation for improved information aggregation, leaving a gap in methodologies that emphasize adaptive neuron connectivity ____. 

Efforts to integrate external knowledge sources into LLMs have been widely examined as a means of enhancing factual consistency and reducing the risk of hallucination in generated text ____. The incorporation of structured knowledge graphs into transformer-based architectures has been explored as a method for improving factual consistency by linking token representations to verifiable knowledge sources ____. Additionally, pretraining strategies incorporating domain-specific corpora have demonstrated improvements in contextual relevance for specialized applications ____. However, studies have identified limitations in knowledge retrieval-based methods, particularly when attempting to balance memorization with the ability to generalize across different domains ____. The challenge of continuously updating internal knowledge representations has also been addressed through lifelong learning paradigms that seek to refine LLM parameters incrementally without catastrophic forgetting ____. While these approaches have shown promise in expanding model knowledge, their reliance on external retrieval mechanisms often leads to latency issues and inconsistencies in information integration across different contexts ____. The underlying difficulty lies in ensuring that internalized knowledge representations remain both dynamic and efficiently aggregated without introducing instability in model behavior ____. 

The interaction between neuron activation patterns and information retrieval mechanisms within LLMs remains an open area of research ____. Studies have suggested that the alignment of activation dynamics with external knowledge retrieval can play a crucial role in maintaining response coherence, particularly in scenarios requiring complex reasoning ____. Computational models have been proposed to analyze the interplay between activation distributions and contextual embeddings, revealing that certain neuron clusters are responsible for encoding long-range dependencies in textual data ____. Investigations into the hierarchical structure of transformer layers have indicated that deeper layers contribute more significantly to abstract reasoning, whereas earlier layers tend to encode surface-level syntactic relationships ____. The adaptive tuning of intermediate representations has been explored as a means of enhancing multi-step reasoning capabilities, but existing methods have faced difficulties in ensuring stable convergence across diverse input distributions ____. Without explicit mechanisms for regulating the way information is encapsulated and distributed across neurons, existing models often exhibit inconsistencies in knowledge retention and retrieval, leading to suboptimal generalization performance ____. 

Existing neuron manipulation and information integration methods, while effective in their respective domains, fail to address the need for a comprehensive framework that unifies these approaches within LLM architectures ____. The lack of structured neuron encapsulation mechanisms results in inefficient information aggregation, particularly when models are tasked with processing heterogeneous data sources ____. Current approaches largely focus on static modifications to neuron connectivity or external knowledge retrieval, rather than reconfiguring neuron encapsulation to facilitate a more adaptive and efficient aggregation of linguistic abstractions ____. The approach introduced in this study aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel method for neuron encapsulation that optimizes the internal structure of LLMs for more effective information aggregation, addressing the limitations of both prior neuron manipulation techniques and external knowledge integration strategies ____.
