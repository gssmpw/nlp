\input{abstract}

%we embrace the inherent non-declarative nature of data creation and access in the real-world. 
%We believe (1) the databases can no longer assume the inputs to a database system are mathematically well-defined operations, and that database interface needs to change to account for such non-declarative nature,  become important components of the database interfaces and (2) the database internals need to change to be able to support such non-declarative interfaces. 

%the current approach of using LLMs as ``Transducers''\footnote{This is Shreya's term quoting from Bjorn, but I'm not sure it's well understood or we want to keep/change the term} in a DBMS within the traditional declarative abstractions,
