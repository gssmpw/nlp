\section{Impact Statement}
The CoALM agent demonstrates improved performance across both conversational TOD and agentic tasks, offering a global approach that combines these capabilities. By addressing the question \textit{Can a Single Model Master Both Multi-turn Conversations and Tool Use?}, we tried to establish a new paradigm for developing unified conversational agents. However, we emphasize that our primary goal is neither to top specific leaderboards nor to create a state-of-the-art agent that can be surpassed in the coming months through improved baselines or task-specific optimization with more data. Instead, our aim is to advance the field by identifying critical gaps in both Conversational AI and Language Agent research, highlighting why addressing these gaps is essential for developing reliable conversational systems that contribute to the path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).


%We recognize that any current top-performing model can be surpassed in the coming months through improved baselines or task-specific optimization with additional data.
