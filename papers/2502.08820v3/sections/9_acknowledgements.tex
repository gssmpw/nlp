\section{Acknowledgements}
We would like to acknowledge the Oumi AI team \cite{oumi2025} for their assistance in training and scaling with the larger CoALM models. We would also like to thank Together AI \cite{togetherai} for providing the cluster resources necessary to enable CoALM 405B training. This project also has benefited from the Microsoft Accelerate Foundation
Models Research (AFMR) grant program, through which leading foundation models hosted by Microsoft Azure and access to Azure credits were provided to conduct the research.
