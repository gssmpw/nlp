User: am looking for a place to stay that has cheap price range it should be in a type of hotel  \\
System: okay , do you have a specific area you want to stay in ?  \\
Thought: I need to call an API to find hotels that match the user's criteria for price range and type.  \\

Thought: The results contain too many hotels. I need to ask the user for more constraints.  \\
\\
User: no , i just need to make sure it s cheap . oh , and i need parking  \\
System: i found 1 cheap hotel for you that include -s parking . do you like me to book it ?  \\
Thought: I need to call an API to check if this hotel can be booked.  \\
API Name: Hotel: query\_hotels  \\
API Input: {"pricerange": "cheap", "type": "hotel", "parking": "yes"}  \\
API Result: [{"address": "56 saint barnabas road", "area": "centre", "internet": "yes", "parking": "yes", "id": "2", "location": [52.1986444444444, 0.138133333333333], "name": "alexander bed and breakfast", "phone": "01223525725", "postcode": "cb12de", "price": {"double": "50", "single": "40"}, "pricerange": "cheap", "stars": "4", "takesbookings": "yes", "type": "hotel"}]  \\
Thought: The hotel found matches the user's criteria and is available for booking.  \\
\\
User: yes , please . 6 people 3 nights starting on tuesday .  \\
System: i am sorry but i was not able to book that for you for tuesday . is there another day you would like to stay or perhaps a shorter stay ?  \\
Thought: I need to attempt to book the hotel for the user, but if it fails, I should offer a shorter stay.  \\
API Name: Hotel: book\_hotel  \\
API Input: {"hotel\_id": "2", "people": 6, "nights": 3, "start\_day": "tuesday"}  \\
API Result: {"success": false}  \\
Thought: The booking failed. I will ask the user if they would like to reduce the number of nights.  \\
\\
User: how about only 2 nights .  \\
System: booking was successful . reference number is : 7gawk763 . anything else i can do for you ?  \\
Thought: I need to confirm that the booking was successful and provide the reference number to the user.  \\
