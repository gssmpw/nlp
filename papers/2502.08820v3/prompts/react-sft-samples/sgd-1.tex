\small \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{Instruction:}} \\
You are an advanced Conversational AI Agent responsible for understanding user queries and determining the appropriate action by selecting the correct API function. \\
For each query, you need to: \\
    1. Thought: Analyze the user's request to understand the intention and extract relevant information such as names, entities, and specific actions. \\
    2. Act: Choose the most appropriate API function from the provided set of available functions and determine the correct input parameters based on the user's query. \\ 
\\
\# Task Information: \\
- Given a Conversation History between a user and a system (if available), your objective is to produce the next system response using interleaving Thought, Action, and Observation steps continue the dialogue smoothly and effectively. \\
- Call the right API from \# Available Functions and provide the necessary input arguments to fulfill the user's request. \\
- If you think a function argument is not necessary, you can skip it. Don't provide unnecessary arguments and None values. \\
- Ensure that the API calls are used logically and that the dialogue remains coherent and natural throughout the exchange.  \\
 \\
\# Available Functions: \\
1. FindBus(from\_location, to\_location, leaving\_date)\\
2. ReserveCar(pickup\_location, pickup\_date, pickup\_time, dropoff\_date, type)\\
.\\
.\\
.\\
50. FindProvider(city, type)\\
51. GetRide(destination, number\_of\_riders, shared\_ride) \\
 \\
\# Output Format \\
Output your response in the 'output' field, considering the following guidelines: \\
1. Address the user's current query or request accurately. \\
2. Use relevant information from the conversation history. \\
3. If the user's input requires an API call or external service, provide a clear rationale for this decision in your response. \\
4. If the Observation of an action is provided then just generate response. \\
5. Ensure your response is informative and contextually relevant, guiding the conversation toward successful task completion. \\
 \\
\# Conversation History:\\
User: I'm looking for events happening in New York this weekend.\\
Thought: The user is interested in events, specifically in New York for this weekend. I'll need to call the FindEvents API to get that information. \\
API Name: FindEvents \\
API Input: {'category': 'all', 'city\_of\_event': 'New York'}\\
API Result: {'events': [{'name': 'Jazz Festival', 'date': '2023-10-14', 'location': 'Central Park'}, {'name': 'Art Fair', 'date': '2023-10-15', 'location': 'Chelsea'}]}\\
Thought: I received a list of events happening this weekend in New York. I should summarize this for the user. \\
System: This weekend in New York, you can enjoy the Jazz Festival at Central Park on October 14th, and the Art Fair in Chelsea on October 15th. Would you like more details on any of these events? \\
\\
\small \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{Input:}} \\
User: Yes, can you tell me more about the Jazz Festival? \\
 \\
\small \textcolor{mypurple}{\textbf{Output:}} \\
Thought: The user wants more information about the Jazz Festival. I need to decide if I should look for more details or if it's already sufficient. \\
Action: FindEvents({'category': 'music', 'city\_of\_event': 'New York'})\\
