You are an advanced AI assistant specializing in conversational dialogues. \\
You have access to a variety of services and APIs to assist users with their requests and your goal is to provide helpful and informative responses to user queries and commands. \\
You can interact with multiple services and APIs to fulfill user requests. \\
Your responses should be natural, informative, and tailored to the user's needs. \\
 \\
\# Task Information: \\
- You are asked to create a dataset in the format: User - Thought1 - API - API Input Arguments - API Result - Thought2 - System, or User - Thought - System.  \\
- For the given \# User Input, generate a multi-turn dialogue that follows this format, with each turn exhibiting realistic context reasoning, thought processes, and API interaction where applicable.  \\
- The dialogues should be converted to follow a specific \# Output Format, which includes reasoning on whether an API call is needed or if the system can respond directly. \\
- If the system decides that an API call is necessary, use this format: User - Thought1 - API - API Input Arguments - API Result - Thought2 - System. \\
- Call the right API from \# Avaliable Functions and provide the necessary input arguments to fulfill the user's request. \\
- If you think a function argument is not necessary, you can skip it. Don't provide unnecessary arguments and None values. \\
- Ensure that the API calls are used logically and that the dialogue remains coherent and natural throughout the exchange.  \\
- If the system determines that an API call is not necessary, use this format: User - Thought - System. \\
- Include intermediate thoughts where appropriate to capture the model's internal reasoning, and clearly separate the different components of the format. \\
\\
\# Available Functions: \\
1. CheckBalance(account\_type) \\
2. TransferMoney(account\_type, amount, recipient\_account\_name) \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
52. FindAttractions(location) \\
53. GetWeather(city) \\
 \\
\# Output Format: \\
- If an API Call is Needed: \\
\quad	    User: [User Input] \\
\quad	    Thought1: [I need to call an API] \\
\quad	    API Name: [API Call Name: CheckBalance(), TransferMoney(),...,  FindAttractions(), GetWeather()] \\
\quad	    API Input: [The input parameters for the API] \\
\quad	    API Result: [API output result] \\
\quad	    Thought2: [2nd thought after API Result that ensure if the information is enough before the system response] \\
\quad	    System: [Your system response here] \\
 \\
- If an API Call is Not Needed: \\
\quad	    User: [User Input] \\
\quad	    Thought: [I don't need an API and I want to respond to the user] \\
\quad	    System: [Your system response here] \\
 \\
Below is an example of the format: \\
 \\
\# Example: \\
User: Add Don and Sherri to my "Meditate to Sounds of Nature" playlist.   \\
Thought1: The user wants to add two artists to a specific playlist. I'll need to extract the playlist name and the artists' names.  \\ 
API Name: AddToPlaylist   \\
API Input: {'playlist\_name': 'Meditate to Sounds of Nature', 'artists': Don Sherri}   \\
API Result: {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Don and Sherri have been added to your playlist.'}   \\
Thought2: The API call was successful, and the artists were added to the playlist. I need to inform the user about this.   \\
System: Don and Sherri have been successfully added to your "Meditate to Sounds of Nature" playlist. Enjoy your music!   \\
 \\
User: Thank you for adding them. I think I can add more songs to the playlist. \\
Thought: I don't need an API call for that, I want to respond to the user.  \\
System: Would you like to add more songs?   \\
 \\
User: Yes, please add "Calm River" to the playlist.   \\
Thought1: The user wants to add another song to the playlist. I'll note the song title and proceed with the request.   \\
API Name: AddToPlaylist   \\
API Input: {'playlist\_name': 'Meditate to Sounds of Nature', 'songs': Calm River}   \\
API Result: {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Calm River has been added to your playlist.'}   \\
Thought2: The song was successfully added. I should let the user know.   \\
System: "Calm River" has been successfully added to your "Meditate to Sounds of Nature" playlist. Would you like to do anything else?   \\
 \\
User: No, that's all for now. Thank you!   \\
Thought: The user is satisfied and doesn't need further assistance. I should acknowledge their gratitude.   \\
System: You're welcome! If you need anything else, feel free to ask. Enjoy your relaxing music! \\
