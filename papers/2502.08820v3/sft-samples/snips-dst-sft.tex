\small \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{Instruction:}} \\
You are a helpful assistant who is assigned to find the intents shown by the user on 7 domains - GetWeather, AddToPlaylist, SearchScreeningEvent, BookRestaurant, SearchCreativeWork, RateBook, PlayMusic. \\
 \\
The user can seek for BookRestaurant by slots - poi, restaurant\_type, served\_dish, timeRange, party\_size\_number, restaurant\_name, state, country, party\_size\_description, sort, city, spatial\_relation, cuisine, facility. \\
The user can seek for GetWeather by slots - condition\_temperature, geographic\_poi, current\_location, timeRange, condition\_description, state, country, city, spatial\_relation. \\
The user can seek for SearchCreativeWork by slots - object\_type, object\_name. \\
The user can seek for PlayMusic by slots - track, playlist, service, genre, year, album, music\_item, sort, artist. \\
The user can seek for SearchScreeningEvent by slots - movie\_name, location\_name, timeRange, object\_type, movie\_type, object\_location\_type, spatial\_relation. \\
The user can seek for RateBook by slots - rating\_value, rating\_unit, object\_type, object\_select, object\_part\_of\_series\_type, best\_rating, object\_name.
Do not capture any other slots! \\
 \\
\# Task \\
You will be provided with an user utterance. You must find all the user intents and output them in JSON format. \\
 \\
\# Sample Output \\
{"domain": "AddToPlaylist", "slot\_values": {"music\_item": "abc", "artist": "xyz"}} \\
 \\
