  abstract     = {As the demand for computing continues to grow exponentially and datacenters are already highly optimized, many have suggested leveraging computing workload's spatiotemporal flexibility. However, different workloads may have different degrees of flexibility, including execution deadlines, data protection laws, or latency requirements. These constraints, along with many others, limit the potential benefits of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload shifting; the achievable benefits of these approaches are unclear-an aspect not addressed by prior research. Accurately quantifying the achievable benefits of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload scheduling is critically important, as many in research and industry are already devoting significant time and resources to realize these benefits. To address the problem, we conduct a large-scale longitudinal analysis of carbon-aware spatiotemporal workload shifting to answer the following research question: What are the maximum carbon emission reductions that can be achieved due to temporal and spatial workload shifting for different types of cloud workloads and in different parts of the world?}

  abstract     = {Microgrids represent an emerging paradigm of future electric power systems that can utilize both distributed and centralized generations. Two recent trends in microgrids are the integration of local renewable energy sources (such as wind farms) and the use of co-generation (i.e., to supply both electricity and heat). However, these trends also bring unprecedented challenges to the design of intelligent control strategies for microgrids. Traditional generation scheduling paradigms rely on perfect prediction of future electricity supply and demand. They are no longer applicable to microgrids with unpredictable renewable energy supply and with co-generation (that needs to consider both electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we study online algorithms for the microgrid generation scheduling problem with intermittent renewable energy sources and co-generation, with the goal of maximizing the cost-savings with local generation. Based on the insights from the structure of the offline optimal solution, we propose a class of competitive online algorithms, called CHASE (Competitive Heuristic Algorithm for Scheduling Energy-generation), that track the offline optimal in an online fashion. Under typical settings, we show that CHASE achieves the best competitive ratio among all deterministic online algorithms, and the ratio is no larger than a small constant 3. We also extend our algorithms to intelligently leverage on limited prediction of the future, such as near-term demand or wind forecast. By extensive empirical evaluations using real-world traces, we show that our proposed algorithms can achieve near offline-optimal performance. In a representative scenario, CHASE leads to around 20\% cost reduction with no future look-ahead, and the cost reduction increases with the future look-ahead window.},
