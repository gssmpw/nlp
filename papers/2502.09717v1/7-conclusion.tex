\DANISH demonstrates that an augmented scheduler that directly takes both the carbon cost of computation and precedence constraints (e.g., in the DAG of a data processing job) into consideration can achieve a favorable trade-off between carbon savings and completion time.  Through experiments, we show that \DANISH's configurability enables a scheduling policy that meaningfully reduces the carbon footprint of data processing without prohibitive increases in completion time.  Furthermore, our detailed analytical and experimental study of \CAP provides another avenue towards configurable carbon-aware scheduling that is broadly applicable and easy-to-implement.
