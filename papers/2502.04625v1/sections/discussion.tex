\section{Discussion} \label{discussion}
In \S\ref{related-work}, we mentioned the debate among scholars about whether phonological categories should be prioritized over dialects.
Rather than presenting a definitive answer, our ultimate goal is to provide a framework for such study, facilitating the integration of diverse information sources like sino-xenic pronunciations, additional dialects, and philological documents. Scholars can adjust material weights according to hypotheses, enabling flexible validation. 
This paper is to serve for such ultimate goal by proposing a reliable and effective model for it.

% Taking a step further, scholars can adjust the weights of different materials according to their hypothesis, and freely validate their assumptions. 
% some problems must be solved with more materials
