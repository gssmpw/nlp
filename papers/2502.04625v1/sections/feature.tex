\section{Representing Phonemes} \label{sec:feature-set}
Representing phonemes in a formal way plays an essential role in computational reconstruction.
Following Generative Phonology \cite{chomsky-1968}, we use distinctive features to represent phonemes. 
%We tailor the feature set proposed by 
\citet{hayes2011} proposes a feature set for all human languages.
Any specific language only uses a subset of it to mark phonemic contrasts. 
To compactly represent Chinese and its modern varieties, we propose a Chinese-specific set. 
Reducing the total number of distinctive features can also boost the efficiency in solving the corresponding optimisation problem. %\todo{coherence}

\subsection{Distinctive Features} \label{intro-gp}

Distinctive features provide a systematic way to identify and represent phonemes. 
Each phoneme is represented as and collectively defined by a bundle of binary features \citep[p.71]{hayes2011}. 
The negative ($-$) and the positive ($+$) annotations are used to indicate the absence or presence of a feature. 
Below is an example:
%For example, the name \textit{Pom} (= /p\textipa{A}m/) can be represented as follows:
%\footnote{This example comes from \citet[pp.72]{hayes2011}.} 
\begin{equation*} \label{pom}
\small
\text {Pom:}  \! =  \! \left[ \! \begin{array}{l}
- \text { syllabic} \\
- \text { sonorant} \\
+ \text { stop} \\
- \text { nasal} \\
+ \text { labial} \\
- \text { voice}
\end{array}  \! \! \right]  \! 
\left[  \! \begin{array}{l}
+ \text { syllabic} \\
+ \text { sonorant} \\
- \text { stop} \\
- \text { nasal} \\
+ \text { low} \\
+ \text { back} \\
- \text { round}
\end{array}  \! \! \right]  \! 
\left[ \! \begin{array}{l}
- \text { syllabic} \\
+ \text { sonorant} \\
+ \text { stop} \\
+ \text { nasal} \\
+ \text { labial} \\
+ \text { voice}
\end{array} \! \! \right] \end{equation*}

It is straightforward to formalise the bundle of features as a vector, which can be used to measure the distance between phonemes.

\subsection{Our Feature Set} \label{our-feature-set}

We propose the following modification of \citet{hayes2011} to obtain a feature set for Chinese.

\paragraph{Remove some features} 
Two types of features are not considered: (1) features that can be represented by other features, and (2) `tap' and `trill'\footnote{Taps, flaps and trills are uncommon in modern Chinese dialects \citep{zhuxiaonong-liquid}, and they do not appear in our dataset. 
No scholars have used taps, flaps and trills to reconstruct MC.
Existing research shows their close connection with the affix \'er å„¿~\citep{trill-in-HB-2019}, but there is still no consensus on the timing and process of their formation.}. 
% , which are highly unlikely used by ancient nor modern Chinese
%, e.g. [+strident] phonemes are coronal fricatives and affricates, 

\paragraph{Merge some features}
The features in Generative Phonology are binary. 
By combining comparable and orderable features into multi-valued ones, we can reduce the number of features. 
For example, \citet{hayes2011} use 4 features (syllabic, consonantal, approximant, sonorant) to describe the sonority hierarchy, while we combine them into one feature, `sonority', with 5 graduable values. 
%\todo{The integration of these features is justified because they are comparable?}

Our feature set is summarised in Table \ref{table:feature-set}. 
We have 14 features in total, reduced from 25 in \citet{hayes2011}. 
Accordingly, we use a 14-dimensional vector to represent a phoneme for computation. 

\paragraph{Independent vs dependent features}
In both the \citeauthor{hayes2011}' feature set and ours, some features are meaningful\footnote{The words `meaningful' and `meaningless' used here correspond to the description `not to care' in \citet[p.91]{hayes2011}: `in most languages with plain /p/, the position of the tongue body during the production of this sound is simply whatever is most articulatorily convenient, given the neighboring sounds. $\cdots$ the tongue body does not adopt any particular position during the /p/; $\cdots$ In this sense, the /p/ could be said truly `not to care' about values for dorsal features.'}
only when some other features at higher levels take certain values. 
We refer to features that decide whether other features are meaningful as `I-features' (independent feature), 
  and those determined by I-features as `D-features' (dependent feature).  

\paragraph{Zero value} \citet{hayes2011} uses the digit 0 (zero feature) to represent meaningless D-features. 
Some syllables in Chinese lack initial consonants, and \citet[pp.18--23]{chao1968} suggests to call them `zero initials'. 
Accordingly, we use digit 0 to represent zero initials.
0-valued I-features occur when and only when the corresponding character is initialless, 
  while 0-valued D-variables occur when and only when they are meaningless.
