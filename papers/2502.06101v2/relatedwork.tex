% \subsection{Representation Learning in Recommendation}
% In recommendation, MF learns collaborative representations. Subsequently, a graph structure is employed to model more complex and higher-order collaborative representations. Contrastive learning is integrated into the recommendation process by using contrastive loss to develop more uniform representations.
% More recently, LLMs have been incorporated into representation learning. Concurrent with our work, [XXX] aligns collaborative and textual information. However, these efforts do not specifically target Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model recommendations.
