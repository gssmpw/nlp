\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduces A2-GNN, a novel local graph neighbor aggregation method for direct 2D-3D matching without relying on visual descriptors. 
Our angle-annular convolution method effectively captures more robust local geometric information. 
Compared to the state-of-the-art descriptor-free matcher DGC-GNN~\cite{wang2024dgc}, A2-GNN demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, leading to significantly improved localization performance. 
These advancements help bridge the gap between descriptor-based and descriptor-free methods while addressing the limitations of descriptor-based approaches, such as high storage requirements, maintenance complexity, and privacy concerns. Overall, A2-GNN represents a substantial advancement in the field of direct 2D-3D matching.


\noindent
\textbf{Limitations.} 
While the proposed A2-GNN method demonstrates significant efficiency and accuracy improvements over existing descriptor-free approaches, its performance still lags behind that of traditional descriptor-based algorithms. This shortfall is primarily due to noisy keypoint inputs from query images and the limited information available. Specifically, when image keypoints contain more than 50\% outliers, the performance drops dramatically. Although A2-GNN advances the state of descriptor-free methods, further research is needed to bridge this gap.
