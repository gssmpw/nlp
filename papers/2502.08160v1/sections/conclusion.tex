In this study, we investigate the potential applications of VFL and identify four key properties of real VFL data distributions. Based on these findings, we propose a taxonomy and evaluate how existing VFL algorithms address the challenges encountered in practice. Our analysis reveals significant gaps between current VFL algorithms and the demands of real-world applications. We summarize these critical gaps and suggest future research directions to bridge the divide between existing algorithms and practical VFL.
