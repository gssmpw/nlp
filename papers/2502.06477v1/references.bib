  abstract = {Given a set S of n points in R3, a point x in R3 is called center point of S if every closed halfspace whose bounding hyperplane passes through x contains at least {$\lceil$}n/4{$\rceil$} points from S. We present a near-quadratic algorithm for computing the center region, that is the set of all center points, of a set of n points in R3. This is nearly tight in the worst case since the center region can have {\textohm}(n2) complexity.We then consider sets S of 3n points in the plane which are the union of three disjoint sets consisting respectively of n red, n blue, and n green points. A point x in R2 is called a colored Tverberg point of S if there is a partition of S into n triples with one point of each color, so that x lies in all triangles spanned by these triples. We present a first polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given point is a colored Tverberg point of such a 3-colored set S.},

The first proof is from Chari, Rohatgi and Srinivasan and uses the potential method. An alternate proof is due to the first author of this note. It uses the polynomial method. However, it is not written anywhere. The main purpose of this note is to present that proof. Additionally we show that the above lower bounds are almost tight with respect to various parameters.},

We say that a set H of five points from P is a 5-hole in P if H is the vertex set of a convex 5-gon containing no other points of P. For a positive integer n, let h5(n) be the minimum number of 5-holes among all sets of n points in the plane in general position. Despite many efforts in the last 30 years, the best known asymptotic lower and upper bounds for h5(n) have been of order {\textohm}(n) and O(n2), respectively. We show that h5(n)={\textohm}(nlog4/5‚Å°n), obtaining the first superlinear lower bound on h5(n). The following structural result, which might be of independent interest, is a crucial step in the proof of this lower bound. If a finite set P of points in the plane in general position is partitioned by a line {$\ell$} into two subsets, each of size at least 5 and not in convex position, then {$\ell$} intersects the convex hull of some 5-hole in P. The proof of this result is computer-assisted.},

In this paper, we propose the novel correlation clustering algorithm COPAC (COrrelation PArtition Clustering) that aims at improved robustness, completeness, usability, and efficiency. Our experimental evaluation empirically shows that COPAC is superior over existing state-of-the-art correlation clustering methods in terms of runtime, accuracy, and completeness of the results.},

  abstract = {The k-Detour problem is a basic path-finding problem: given a graph G on n vertices, with specified nodes s and t, and a positive integer k, the goal is to determine if G has an st-path of length exactly dist(s,t) + k, where dist(s,t) is the length of a shortest path from s to t. The k-Detour problem is NP-hard when k is part of the input, so researchers have sought efficient parameterized algorithms for this task, running in f(k)poly(n) time, for f({$\cdot$}) as slow-growing as possible. We present faster algorithms for k-Detour in undirected graphs, running in 1.853{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) randomized and 4.082{\textasciicircum}kpoly(n) deterministic time. The previous fastest algorithms for this problem took 2.746{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) randomized and 6.523{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) deterministic time [Bez{\'a}kov{\'a}-Curticapean-Dell-Fomin, ICALP 2017]. Our algorithms use the fact that detecting a path of a given length in an undirected graph is easier if we are promised that the path belongs to what we call a "bipartitioned" subgraph, where the nodes are split into two parts and the path must satisfy constraints on those parts. Previously, this idea was used to obtain the fastest known algorithm for finding paths of length k in undirected graphs [Bj{\"o}rklund-Husfeldt-Kaski-Koivisto, JCSS 2017], intuitively by looking for paths of length k in randomly bipartitioned subgraphs. Our algorithms for k-Detour stem from a new application of this idea, which does not involve choosing the bipartitioned subgraphs randomly. Our work has direct implications for the k-Longest Detour problem, another related path-finding problem. In this problem, we are given the same input as in k-Detour, but are now tasked with determining if G has an st-path of length at least dist(s,t)+k. Our results for k-Detour imply that we can solve k-Longest Detour in 3.432{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) randomized and 16.661{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) deterministic time. The previous fastest algorithms for this problem took 7.539{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) randomized and 42.549{\textasciicircum}k poly(n) deterministic time [Fomin et al., STACS 2022].},

The problem asks for a partition of the cake to four agents, so that every agent finds her piece at least as valuable as every other agent's piece. The problem has had an interesting history so far. Although the case of three agents is solvable with less than 15 queries, for four agents no bounded procedure was known until the recent breakthroughs of Aziz and Mackenzie~[2, 3]. The main drawback of these new algorithms, however, is that they are quite complicated and with a very high query complexity. With four agents, the number of queries required is close to 600. In this work we provide an improved algorithm for four agents, which reduces the current complexity by a factor of 3.4. Our algorithm builds on the approach of [3] by incorporating new insights and simplifying several steps. Overall, this yields an easier to grasp procedure with lower complexity.},

These instances are graphs with low               threshold rank               , an interesting new graph parameter highlighted by this work.                                         Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (UGC) states that it is               NP               -hard to achieve approximation guarantees such as ours for U               nique               G               ames               . While the results here stop short of refuting the UGC, they do suggest that U               nique               G               ames               are significantly easier than               NP               -hard problems such as M               ax               3-S               at               , M               ax               3-               Lin               , L               abel               C               over               , and more, which are believed not to have a subexponential algorithm achieving a nontrivial approximation ratio.                                         Of special interest in these algorithms is a new notion of graph decomposition that may have other applications. Namely, it is shown for every {$\epsilon$} {$>$}0 and every regular               n               -vertex graph               G               , by changing at most {$\delta$} fraction of               G               's edges, one can break               G               into disjoint parts so that the stochastic adjacency matrix of the induced graph on each part has at most               n               {$\epsilon$}               eigenvalues larger than 1-{$\eta$}, where {$\eta$} depends polynomially on {$\epsilon$}. The subexponential algorithm combines this decomposition with previous algorithms for U               nique               G               ames               on graphs with few large eigenvalues [Kolla and Tulsiani 2007; Kolla 2010].},

  abstract = {Turn-based discounted-sum games are two-player zero-sum games played on finite directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are partitioned between player 1 and player 2. Plays are infinite walks on the graph where the next vertex is decided by a player that owns the current vertex. Each edge is assigned an integer weight and the payoff of a play is the discounted-sum of the weights of the play. The goal of player 1 is to maximize the discounted-sum payoff against the adversarial player 2. These games lie in NP and coNP and are among the rare combinatorial problems that belong to this complexity class and the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm is a major open question. Since breaking the general exponential barrier has been a challenging problem, faster parameterized algorithms have been considered. If the discount factor is expressed in unary, then discounted-sum games can be solved in polynomial time. However, if the discount factor is arbitrary (or expressed in binary), but the weights are in unary, none of the existing approaches yield a sub-exponential bound. Our main result is a new analysis technique for a classical algorithm (namely, the strategy iteration algorithm) that present a new runtime bound which is \$n{\textasciicircum}\{O ( W{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\} {\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\} )\}\$, for game graphs with \$n\$ vertices and maximum absolute weight of at most \$W\$. In particular, our result yields a deterministic sub-exponential bound for games with weights that are constant or represented in unary.},

  abstract = {In Bipartite Correlation Clustering (BCC)  we are given a complete bipartite graph G with '+' and '-' edges, and we seek a vertex clustering that maximizes the number of agreements: the number of all '+' edges within clusters plus all '-' edges cut across clusters. BCC is known to be NP-hard [5].  We present a novel approximation algorithm for k-BCC, a variant of BCC with an upper bound k on the number of clusters. Our algorithm outputs a k-clustering that provably achieves a number of agreements within a multiplicative (1-{$\delta$})-factor from the optimal, for any desired accuracy {$\delta$}. It relies on solving a combinatorially constrained bilinear maximization on the bi-adjacency matrix of G. It runs in time exponential in k and 1/{$\delta$}, but linear in the size of the input.  Further, we show that, in the (unconstrained) BCC setting, an (1-{$\delta$})-approximation can be achieved by O(1/{$\delta$}) clusters regardless of the size of the graph. In turn, our k-BCC algorithm implies an Efficient PTAS for the BCC objective of maximizing agreements.},

The ARRIVAL problem, as defined by Dohrau et al. [8], consists in determining which sink will be reached. While the walk itself can take an exponential number of steps, this problem belongs to the complexity class NP {$\cap$} co-NP without being known to be in P. In this work, we define a class of directed graphs, namely tree-like multigraphs, which are multigraphs having the global shape of an undirected tree. We prove that in this class, ARRIVAL can be solved in almost linear time, while the number of steps of a rotor walk can still be exponential. Then, we give an application of this result to solve some deterministic analogs of stochastic models (e.g., Markovian decision processes, Stochastic Games).},

We give an algorithm that finds an \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$-approximate fixed point of a three-dimensional monotone contraction using \$O({\textbackslash}log (1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon))\$ queries to \$f\$. We also give a decomposition theorem that allows us to use this result to obtain an algorithm that finds an \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$-approximate fixed point of a \$d\$-dimensional monotone contraction using \$O((c {\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}log (1/{\textbackslash}varepsilon)){\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}lceil d / 3 {\textbackslash}rceil\})\$ queries to \$f\$ for some constant \$c\$. Moreover, each step of both of our algorithms takes time that is polynomial in the representation of \$f\$. These results are strictly better than the best-known results for functions that are only monotone, or only contracting. All of our results also apply to Shapley stochastic games, which are known to be reducible to the monotone contraction problem. Thus we put Shapley games in UEOPL, and we give a faster algorithm for approximating the value of a Shapley game.},

We consider the question of the relative complexity of these search problem classes. We prove several separations which show that in a generic relativized world the search classes are distinct and there is a standard search problem in each of them that is not computationally equivalent to any decision problem. (Naturally, absolute separations would imply thatP NP.) Our separation proofs have interesting combinatorial content and go to the heart of the combinatorial principles on which the classes are based.

Analysis of data produced by such experiments offers potential insight into gene function and regulatory mechanisms. A key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the detection of groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns. The corresponding algorithmic problem is to cluster multicondition gene expression patterns. In this paper we describe a novel clustering algorithm that was developed for analysis of gene expression data. We define an appropriate stochastic error model on the input, and prove that under the conditions of the model, the algorithm recovers the cluster structure with high probability. The running time of the algorithm on an n-gene dataset is O[n2[log(n)]c]. We also present a practical heuristic based on the same algorithmic ideas. The heuristic was implemented and its performance is demonstrated on simulated data and on real gene expression data, with very promising results.},

In Min-Sum Cycle Packing, we try to find, in a weighted undirected graph, \$k\$ vertex-disjoint cycles of minimum total weight. Our first main result is an algorithm that, for any fixed \$k\$, solves the problem in polynomial time. We complement this result by establishing the W[1]-hardness of Min-Sum Cycle Packing parameterized by \$k\$. The same results hold for the version of the problem where the task is to find \$k\$ edge-disjoint cycles. Our second main result concerns Shortest Cycle Packing, which is a special case of Min-Sum Cycle Packing that asks to find a packing of \$k\$ shortest cycles in a graph. We prove this problem to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by \$k\$ on weighted planar graphs. We also obtain a polynomial kernel for the edge-disjoint variant of the problem on planar graphs. Deciding whether Min-Sum Cycle Packing is FPT on planar graphs and whether Shortest Cycle Packing is FPT on general graphs remain challenging open questions.},

In this paper we develop an abstract setting for studying and solving such games, as well as related problems, based on function optimization over certain discrete structures. We introduce new classes of completely local-global (CLG) and recursively local-global (RLG) functions, and show that strategy evaluation functions for parity and simple stochastic games belong to these classes. We also establish a relation to the previously well-studied completely unimodal (CU) and local-global functions. A number of nice properties of CLG-functions are proved. In this setting, we survey several randomized optimization algorithms appropriate for CU-, CLG-, and RLG-functions. We show that the subexponential algorithms for linear programming by Kalai and Matousek, Sharir, and Welzl, can be adapted to optimizing the functions we study, with preserved subexponential expected running time. We examine the relations to two other abstract frameworks for subexponential optimization, the LP-type problems of Matousek, Sharir, Welzl, and the abstract optimization problems of G{\"a}rtner. The applicability of our abstract optimization approach to parity games builds upon a discrete strategy evaluation measure. We also consider local search type algorithms, and settle two nontrivial, but still exponential, upper bounds. As applications we address some complexity-theoretic issues including non-PLS-completeness of the problems studied.},

  abstract = {Given a directed graph as input, we show how to efficiently find a shortest (directed, simple) cycle on an even number of vertices. As far as we know, no polynomial-time algorithm was previously known for this problem. In fact, finding any even cycle in a directed graph in polynomial time was open for more than two decades until Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas (Ann. of Math. (2) 1999) and, independently, McCuaig (Electron. J. Combin. 2004; announced jointly at STOC 1997) gave an efficiently testable structural characterisation of even-cycle-free directed graphs. Methodologically, our algorithm relies on the standard framework of algebraic fingerprinting and randomized polynomial identity testing over a finite field, and in fact relies on a generating polynomial implicit in a paper of Vazirani and Yannakakis (Discrete Appl. Math. 1989) that enumerates weighted cycle covers by the parity of their number of cycles as a difference of a permanent and a determinant polynomial. The need to work with the permanent---known to be \#P-hard apart from a very restricted choice of coefficient rings (Valiant, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 1979)---is where our main technical contribution occurs. We design a family of finite commutative rings of characteristic 4 that simultaneously (i) give a nondegenerate representation for the generating polynomial identity via the permanent and the determinant, (ii) support efficient permanent computations by extension of Valiant's techniques, and (iii) enable emulation of finite-field arithmetic in characteristic 2. Here our work is foreshadowed by that of Bj{\"o}rklund and Husfeldt (SIAM J. Comput. 2019), who used a considerably less efficient commutative ring design---in particular, one lacking finite-field emulation---to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for the shortest two disjoint paths problem in undirected graphs. Building on work of Gilbert and Tarjan (Numer. Math. 1978) as well as Alon and Yuster (J. ACM 2013), we also show how ideas from the nested dissection technique for solving linear equation systems---introduced by George (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 1973) for symmetric positive definite real matrices---leads to faster algorithm designs in our present finite-ring randomized context when we have control on the separator structure of the input graph; for example, this happens when the input has bounded genus.},

By leveraging the intrinsic structure of \$p\$-order cones, we derive refined complexity bounds that surpass those obtained via standard semidefinite programming reformulations. Our analysis not only improves theoretical bounds but also provides practical insights into the computational efficiency of solving such problems. In addition to establishing complexity results, we derive explicit bounds for solutions when the feasibility problem admits one. For infeasible instances, we analyze their discrepancy quantifying the degree of infeasibility. Finally, we examine specific cases of interest, highlighting scenarios where the geometry of \$p\$-order cones or problem structure yields further computational simplifications. These findings contribute to both the theoretical understanding and practical tractability of optimization problems involving \$p\$-order cones.},

A solution to Sidestep\$({\textbackslash}Pi, {\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}, d)\$ on an input \$I\$ of \${\textbackslash}Pi\$ is a pair \$(J, {\textbackslash}Pi(J))\$ such that \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}(I,J) {\textbackslash}leqslant d({\textbar}I{\textbar})\$ and \${\textbackslash}Pi(J)\$ is a correct answer to \${\textbackslash}Pi\$ on input \$J\$. This formalizes the notion of answering a related question (or sidestepping the question), for which we give some practical and theoretical motivations, and compare it to the neighboring concepts of smoothed analysis, planted problems, and edition problems. Informally, we call hardness radius the ``largest'' \$d\$ such that Sidestep\$({\textbackslash}Pi, {\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}, d)\$ is NP-hard. This framework calls for establishing the hardness radius of problems \${\textbackslash}Pi\$ of interest for the relevant distances \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\$. We exemplify it with graph problems and two distances \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_{\textbackslash}Delta\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_e\$ (the edge edit distance) such that \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_{\textbackslash}Delta(G,H)\$ (resp. \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_e(G,H)\$) is the maximum degree (resp. number of edges) of the symmetric difference of \$G\$ and \$H\$ if these graphs are on the same vertex set, and \$+{\textbackslash}infty\$ otherwise. We show that the decision problems Independent Set, Clique, Vertex Cover, Coloring, Clique Cover have hardness radius \$n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}-o(1)\}\$ for \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_{\textbackslash}Delta\$, and \$n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{4\}\{3\}-o(1)\}\$ for \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_e\$, that Hamiltonian Cycle has hardness radius 0 for \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_{\textbackslash}Delta\$, and somewhere between \$n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{2\}-o(1)\}\$ and \$n/3\$ for \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_e\$, and that Dominating Set has hardness radius \$n{\textasciicircum}\{1-o(1)\}\$ for \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{dist\}\_e\$.

For all three settings, we show that "two choices are enough", meaning that the general non-binary version of the problem can be reduced in polynomial time to the binary version. This specifically means that generalized P-LCPs are equivalent to P-LCPs, and grid USOs are equivalent to cube USOs. These results are obtained by showing that both the P-LCP and our \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-Ham Sandwich variant are equivalent to a new problem we introduce, P-Lin-Bellman. This problem can be seen as a new tool for formulating problems as P-LCPs.},

We also pay special attention to non-Euclidean settings relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term, saddle-point mirror prox Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing, and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, mini-batches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

In addition, they have Nullstellensatz derivations of polylogarithmic degree. These results extend the previous work of Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka first by applying to Turing reductions in place of many-one reductions and second by giving tight bounds on the height of the Frege proofs. As a corollary, PLS-complete problems are not polynomial time Turing reducible to PPA problems relative to a generic oracle. We establish a converse construction as well, by showing that a polynomial time Turing reduction can be obtained from a family of quasipolynomial size, polylogarithmic depth, propositional proofs which are based on ``decision tree'' substitutions. This establishes the optimality of our constructions, and partially resolves an open question posed by Buresh-Oppenheim and Morioka. We observe that the classes PPA, PPAD, PPADS, and PLS are closed under Turing reductions, and give an example of a TFNP class that is not closed under Turing reductions.},

  abstract = {Turn-based stochastic games (aka simple stochastic games) are two-player zero-sum games played on directed graphs with probabilistic transitions. The goal of player-max is to maximize the probability to reach a target state against the adversarial player-min. These games lie in NP {$\cap$} coNP and are among the rare combinatorial problems that belong to this complexity class for which the existence of polynomial-time algorithm is a major open question. While randomized sub-exponential time algorithm exists, all known deterministic algorithms require exponential time in the worst-case. An important open question has been whether faster algorithms can be obtained parametrized by the treewidth of the game graph. Even deterministic sub-exponential time algorithm for constant treewidth turn-based stochastic games has remain elusive. In this work our main result is a deterministic algorithm to solve turn-based stochastic games that, given a game with n states, treewidth at most t, and the bit-complexity of the probabilistic transition function log D, has running time O ((tn2 log D)t log n). In particular, our algorithm is quasi-polynomial time for games with constant or poly-logarithmic treewidth.},

  abstract = {We consider a class of optimization problems defined by a system of linear equations with min and max operators. This class of optimization problems has been studied under restrictive conditions, such as, (C1) the halting or stability condition; (C2) the non-negative coefficients condition; (C3) the sum up to 1 condition; and (C4) the only min or only max oerator condition. Several seminal results in the literature focus on special cases. For example, turn-based stochastic games correspond to conditions C2 and C3; and Markov decision process to conditions C2, C3, and C4. However, the systematic computational complexity study of all the cases has not been explored, which we address in this work. Some highlights of our results are: with conditions C2 and C4, and with conditions C3 and C4, the problem is NP-complete, whereas with condition C1 only, the problem is in UP intersects coUP. Finally, we establish the computational complexity of the decision problem of checking the respective conditions.},

In contrast, previous algorithms use either top-down or bottom-up methods to construct a hierarchical clustering or produce a flat clustering using local search (e.g., k-means). For the divide phase, which produces a tree whose leaves are the elements of the set, we suggest an efficient spectral algorithm. When the data is in the form of a sparse document-term matrix, we show how to modify the algorithm so that it maintains sparsity and runs in linear space. The merge phase quickly finds the optimal partition that respects the tree for many natural objective functions, for example, k-means, min-diameter, min-sum, correlation clustering, etc. We present a thorough experimental evaluation of the methodology. We describe the implementation of a meta-search engine that uses this methodology to cluster results from web searches. We also give comparative empirical results on several real datasets.},

Bienstock proved that detecting an even (respectively, odd) hole containing a given vertex is NP-complete. Conforti, Cornu{\'e}jols, Kapoor, and Vu{\v s}kovi{\'c} gave the first known polynomial-time algorithm to determine whether a graph contains even holes. Chudnovsky, Kawarabayashi, and Seymour estimated that Conforti et al.'s algorithm runs in O ( n 40 ) time on an n-vertex graph and reduced the required time to O ( n 31 ). Subsequently, da Silva and Vu{\v s}kovi{\'c}, Chang and Lu, and Lai, Lu, and Thorup improved the time to O ( n 19 ), O ( n 11 ), and O ( n 9 ), respectively. The tractability of determining whether a graph contains odd holes has been open for decades until the algorithm of Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour, and Spirkl that runs in O ( n 9 ) time, which Lai et al. also reduced to O ( n 8 ). By extending Chudnovsky et al.'s techniques for detecting odd holes, Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour (respectively) ensured the tractability of finding a long (respectively, shortest) odd hole. They also ensured the NP-hardness of finding a longest odd hole, whose reduction also works for finding a longest even hole. Recently, Cook and Seymour ensured the tractability of finding a long even hole. An intriguing missing piece is the tractability of finding a shortest even hole, left open for 16 years by, for example, Chudnovsky et al. and Johnson. We resolve this open problem by augmenting Chudnovsky et al.'s even-hole detection algorithm into the first known polynomial-time algorithm, running in O ( n 31 ) time, for finding a shortest even hole in an n-vertex graph that contains even holes.},

  abstract = {The study of social networks is a burgeoning research area. However, most existing work is on networks that simply encode whether relationships exist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive ("like", "trust") or negative ("dislike", "distrust"). The theory of social balance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that, in turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both local as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental problems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering. Local patterns of social balance have been used in the past for sign prediction. We define more general measures of social imbalance (MOIs) based on l-cycles in the network and give a simple sign prediction rule. Interestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the classic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction, also has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed networks. Motivated by the global structure of balanced networks, we propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and clustering. We provide theoretical performance guarantees for our low-rank matrix completion approach via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem sizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive experimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our experimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of social balance, we get significant performance and computational gains in prediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore highlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the analysis of signed networks.},

  abstract = {Various classes of induced subgraphs are involved in the deepest results of graph theory and graph algorithms. A prominent example concerns the \{{\textbackslash}em perfection\} of \$G\$ that the chromatic number of each induced subgraph \$H\$ of \$G\$ equals the clique number of \$H\$. The seminal Strong Perfect Graph Theorem confirms that the perfection of \$G\$ can be determined by detecting odd holes in \$G\$ and its complement. Chudnovsky et al. show in 2005 an \$O(n{\textasciicircum}9)\$ algorithm for recognizing perfect graphs, which can be implemented to run in \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{6+{\textbackslash}omega\})\$ time for the exponent \${\textbackslash}omega{$<$}2.373\$ of square-matrix multiplication. We show the following improved algorithms. 1. The tractability of detecting odd holes was open for decades until the major breakthrough of Chudnovsky et al. in 2020. Their \$O(n{\textasciicircum}9)\$ algorithm is later implemented by Lai et al. to run in \$O(n{\textasciicircum}8)\$ time, leading to the best formerly known algorithm for recognizing perfect graphs. Our first result is an \$O(n{\textasciicircum}7)\$ algorithm for detecting odd holes, implying an \$O(n{\textasciicircum}7)\$ algorithm for recognizing perfect graphs. 2. Chudnovsky et al. extend in 2021 the \$O(n{\textasciicircum}9)\$ algorithms for detecting odd holes (2020) and recognizing perfect graphs (2005) into the first polynomial algorithm for obtaining a shortest odd hole, which runs in \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{14\})\$ time. We reduce the time for finding a shortest odd hole to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{13\})\$. 3. Conforti et al. show in 1997 the first polynomial algorithm for detecting even holes, running in about \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{40\})\$ time. It then takes a line of intensive efforts in the literature to bring down the complexity to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{31\})\$, \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{19\})\$, \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{11\})\$, and finally \$O(n{\textasciicircum}9)\$. On the other hand, the tractability of finding a shortest even hole has been open for 16 years until the very recent \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{31\})\$ algorithm of Cheong and Lu in 2022. We improve the time of finding a shortest even hole to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{23\})\$.},

Constructing hash functions for which this transformation is sound is a central and long-standing open question in cryptography. We show that solving the END-OF-METERED-LINE problem is no easier than breaking the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir transformation when applied to the sumcheck protocol. In particular, if the transformed protocol is sound, then any hard problem in \#P gives rise to a hard distribution in the class CLS, which is contained in PPAD. Our result opens up the possibility of sampling moderately-sized games for which it is hard to find a Nash equilibrium, by reducing the inversion of appropriately chosen one-way functions to \#SAT. Our main technical contribution is a stateful incrementally verifiable procedure that, given a SAT instance over n variables, counts the number of satisfying assignments. This is accomplished via an exponential sequence of small steps, each computable in time poly(n). Incremental verifiability means that each intermediate state includes a sumcheck-based proof of its correctness, and the proof can be updated and verified in time poly(n).},

Such a design approach poses an important problem: how to find a principled methodology to design and discretize appropriate ODEs. This paper aims to provide a solution to this problem through the use of contraction theory. We first introduce general mathematical results that explain how contraction theory guarantees the stability of the implicit and explicit Euler integration methods. Then, we propose a novel system of ODEs, namely the Accelerated-Contracting-Nesterov flow, and use contraction theory to establish it is an optimization flow with exponential convergence rate, from which the linear convergence rate of its associated optimization algorithm is immediately established. Remarkably, a simple explicit Euler discretization of this flow corresponds to the Nesterov acceleration method. Finally, we present how our approach leads to performance guarantees in the design of optimization algorithms for time-varying optimization problems.},

Our algorithm has a small constant factor and is the first approximate center point algorithm whose complexity is subexponential in d. Moreover, it can be optimally parallelized to require O(log2 d loglog n) time. Our algorithm has been used in mesh partitioning methods, and has the potential to improve results in practice for constructing weak {$\varepsilon$}-nets and other geometric algorithms. We derive a variant of our algorithm with a time bound fully polynomial in d, and show how to combine our approach with previous techniques to compute high quality center points more quickly.},

  abstract = {Given x{\i}n({\textbackslash}mathbbR\_{\textbackslash}geqslant 0)(\_2{\textasciicircum}[n]) recording pairwise distances, the Metric Violation Distance problem asks to compute the {\textbackslash}ell{$_0$} distance between x and the metric cone; i.e., modify the minimum number of entries of x to make it a metric. Due to its large number of applications in various data analysis and optimization tasks, this problem has been actively studied recently. We present an O({\textbackslash}log n)-approximation algorithm for METRIC VIOLATION Distance, exponentially improving the previous best approximation ratio of O(OPT{\textasciicircum}1/3) of Fan, Raichel, and Van Buskirk [SODA, 2018]. Furthermore, a major strength of our algorithm is its simplicity and running time. We also study the related problem of Ultrametric Violation Distance, where the goal is to compute the {\textbackslash}ell{$_0$} distance to the cone of ultrametrics, and achieve a constant factor approximation algorithm. The ULTRAMETRIC VIOLATION DISTANCE problem can be regarded as an extension of the problem of fitting ultrametrics studied by Ailon and Charikar [SIAM J. Computing, 2011] and by Cohen-Addad, Das, Kipouridis, Parotsidis, and Thorup [FOCS, 2021] from {\textbackslash}ell{$_1$} norm to {\textbackslash}ell{$_0$} norm. We show that this problem can be favorably interpreted as an instance of CORRELATION CLUSTERING with an additional hierarchical structure, which we solve using a new O(1)-approximation algorithm for correlation clustering that has the structural property that it outputs a refinement of the optimum clusters. An algorithm satisfying such a property can be considered of independent interest. We also provide an O({\textbackslash}log n{\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log n) approximation algorithm for weighted instances. Finally, we investigate the complementary version of these problems where one aims at choosing a maximum number of entries of x forming an (ultra-)metric. In stark contrast with the minimization versions, we prove that these maximization versions are hard to approximate within any constant factor assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.},

The problem of proportional cake cutting focuses on dividing a heterogeneous and divisible resource, the cake, among n players who value pieces according to their own measure function. The goal is to assign each player a not necessarily connected part of the cake that the player evaluates at least as much as her proportional share. In this article, we investigate the problem of proportional division with unequal shares, where each player is entitled to receive a predetermined portion of the cake. Our main contribution is threefold. First we present a protocol for integer demands, which delivers a proportional solution in fewer queries than all known protocols. By giving a matching lower bound, we then show that our protocol is asymptotically the fastest possible. Finally, we turn to irrational demands and solve the proportional cake cutting problem by reducing it to the same problem with integer demands only. All results remain valid in a highly general cake cutting model, which can be of independent interest.},

We argue that all those techniques can be viewed as instances of the separation approach to solving parity games, a key technical component of which is constructing (explicitly or implicitly) an automaton that separates languages of words encoding plays that are (decisively) won by either of the two players. Our main technical result is a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of such separating automata that nearly matches the current best upper bounds. This forms a barrier that all existing approaches must overcome in the ongoing quest for a polynomial-time algorithm for solving parity games. The key and fundamental concept that we introduce and study is a universal ordered tree. The technical highlights are a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of universal ordered trees and a proof that every separating safety automaton has a universal tree hidden in its state space.},

  abstract = {Let {$\Pi$} be a finite lattice of integer points in a box of Rn and f an increasing mapping in terms of the componentwise ordering from {$\Pi$} to itself. The well-known Tarski's fixed point theorem asserts that f has a fixed point in {$\Pi$}. A simple expansion of f from {$\Pi$} to a larger lattice C of integer points in a box of Rn yields that the smallest point in C is always a fixed point of f (an expanded Tarski's fixed point problem). By introducing an integer labeling rule and applying a cubic triangulation of the Euclidean space, we prove in this paper that the expanded Tarski's fixed point problem is in the class PPA when f is given as an oracle. It is shown in this paper that Nash equilibria of a bimatrix game can be reformulated as fixed points different from the smallest point in C of an increasing mapping from C to itself. This implies that the expanded Tarski's fixed point problem has at least the same complexity as that of the Nash equilibrium problem. As a byproduct, we also present a homotopy-like simplicial method to compute a Tarski fixed point of f. The method starts from an arbitrary lattice point and follows a finite simplicial path to a fixed point of f.},

It is a common experience, however, that iterative maps fail to be globally contracting under the natural metric in their domain, making the applicability of Banach's theorem limited. We explore how generally we can apply Banach's fixed point theorem to establish the convergence of iterative methods when pairing it with carefully designed metrics. Our first result is a strong converse of Banach's theorem, showing that it is a universal analysis tool for establishing global convergence of iterative methods to unique fixed points, and for bounding their convergence rate. In other words, we show that, whenever an iterative map globally converges to a unique fixed point, there exists a metric under which the iterative map is contracting and which can be used to bound the number of iterations until convergence. We illustrate our approach in the widely used power method, providing a new way of bounding its convergence rate through contraction arguments. We next consider the computational complexity of Banach's fixed point theorem. Making the proof of our converse theorem constructive, we show that computing a fixed point whose existence is guaranteed by Banach's fixed point theorem is CLS-complete. We thus provide the first natural complete problem for the class CLS, which was defined in [DP11] to capture the complexity of problems such as P-matrix LCP, computing KKT-points, and finding mixed Nash equilibria in congestion and network coordination games.},

This paper provides a natural generalization of monotone operator theory to finite-dimensional non-Euclidean spaces. The key tools are weak pairings and logarithmic norms.

Furthermore, classical iterative methods and splitting methods for finding zeros of monotone operators are shown to converge in the non-Euclidean case. We apply our theory to equilibrium computation and Lipschitz constant estimation of recurrent neural networks, obtaining novel iterations and tighter upper bounds via forward-backward splitting.},

In addition, player MIN has to pay to player MAX a value depending on the new state. This continues until the token ends in a sink, in which case the game stops. Hence, this is a zero-sum game where MAX seeks to maximise its expected value gained during the game and MIN tries to minimise it.

In the polynomial-time function model, where the utility functions are given explicitly by polynomial-time algorithms, we show that the envy-free cake-cutting problem has the same complexity as finding a Brouwer's fixed point, or, more formally, it is PPAD-complete. On the flip side, for monotone utility functions, we propose a fully polynomial-time algorithm (FPTAS) to find an approximate envy-free allocation of a cake among three people using two cuts.},

The private objective of each vertex is to minimize the sum of its building cost (the cost of the edges it buys) plus its connection cost (the total distance from itself to every other vertex). Given a cost of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ for each individual edge, a long-standing conjecture, called the tree conjecture, states that if \${\textbackslash}alpha {$>$} n\$ then every Nash equilibrium graph in the game is a spanning tree. After a plethora of work, it is known that the conjecture holds for any \${\textbackslash}alpha{$>$}3n-3\$. In this paper we prove the tree conjecture holds for \${\textbackslash}alpha{$>$}2n\$.

While many natural, deterministic pivot rules are known to yield exponential running times, the random-facet rule was shown to have a subexponential running time. For a long time, Zadeh's rule remained the most prominent candidate for the first deterministic pivot rule with subexponential running time. We present a lower bound construction that shows that Zadeh's rule is in fact exponential in the worst case.

  abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of scheduling the read/write head movement to handle a batch of \$nI/O\$ requests in a 2-dimensional secondary storage device in minimum time. Two models of storage systems are assumed in which the access time of a record (being proportional to the ``distance'' between the position of the record and that of the read/write head) is measured in terms of \$L\_1 \$ and \$L\_{$\infty\$$} metrics, respectively. The scheduling problem, referred to as the Open Path Problem (OPP), is equivalent to finding a shortest Hamiltonian path with a specified end point in a complete graph with n vertices. We first show in this paper that there exists a natural isometry between the \$L\_1 \$ and \$L\_{$\infty\$$} metrics. Consequently, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for the OPP in one metric implies the existence of a polynomial time algorithm for the same problem in the other metric. Based on a result by Garey, Graham and Johnson, it is easy to show that the OPP in \$L\_1 \$ (hence in \$L\_{$\infty\$$}) metric is \$NP\$-complete. A heuristic to solve the OPP is therefore presented. It is based on a geometric structure called the Voronoi diagram in \$L\_1 \$ metric. An optimal (worst-case) algorithm of time complexity \$O(nn)\$ for constructing the diagram for a set of n points in a plane is described. Using this diagram one can build a near-optimal path through each point either by constructing a minimum spanning tree or by the closest insertion method.Both algorithms are shown to take \$O(nn)\$ time which is the time for the construction of the diagram and yield an approximate solution within a factor of 2. The bound is also shown to be tight in the worse case. For the average case, simulation results show that the minimum spanning tree approach is better than the closest insertion method. As expected, they are far better than the sequential one in which the request is processed one at a time on the first-come--first-served basis.},

Although they conjectured it to be NP-complete, soon after it was shown to be solvable in randomized polynomial time in the seminal work of Mulmuley et al., placing it in the complexity class RP. Since then, all attempts at finding a deterministic algorithm for EM have failed, thus leaving it as one of the few natural combinatorial problems in RP but not known to be contained in P, and making it an interesting instance for testing the hypothesis RP = P. Progress has been lacking even on very restrictive classes of graphs despite the problem being quite well known as evidenced by the number of works citing it.  In this paper we aim to gain more insight into EM by studying a new optimization problem we call Top-k Perfect Matching (TkPM) which we show to be polynomially equivalent to EM. By virtue of being an optimization problem, it is more natural to approximate TkPM so we provide approximation algorithms for it. Some of the approximation algorithms rely on a relaxation of EM on bipartite graphs where the output is required to be a perfect matching with a number of red edges differing from k by at most k/2, which is of independent interest and generalizes to the Exact Weight Perfect Matching (EWPM) problem. We also consider parameterized algorithms and show that TkPM can be solved in FPT time parameterized by k and the independence number of the graph. This result again relies on new tools developed for EM which are also of independent interest.},

Soon after Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (JACM 1982) introduced the problem, a randomized polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem was described by Mulmuley et al. (Combinatorica 1987). Despite a lot of effort, it is still not known today whether a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm exists. This makes the exact matching problem an important candidate to test the popular conjecture that the complexity classes P and RP are equal. In a recent article (MFCS 2022), progress was made towards this goal by showing that for bipartite graphs of bounded bipartite independence number, a polynomial time algorithm exists. In terms of parameterized complexity, this algorithm was an XP-algorithm parameterized by the bipartite independence number. In this article, we introduce novel algorithmic techniques that allow us to obtain an FPT-algorithm. If the input is a general graph we show that one can at least compute a perfect matching M which has the correct number of red edges modulo 2, in polynomial time. This is motivated by our last result, in which we prove that an FPT algorithm for general graphs, parameterized by the independence number, reduces to the problem of finding in polynomial time a perfect matching M with at most k red edges and the correct number of red edges modulo 2.},

The task is then to decide whether the given graph contains a perfect matching exactly k of whose edges have color red. EM generalizes several important algorithmic problems such as perfect matching and restricted minimum weight spanning tree problems. When introducing the problem in 1982, Papadimitriou and Yannakakis conjectured EM to be NP-complete. Later however, Mulmuley et al. presented a randomized polynomial time algorithm for EM, which puts EM in RP. Given that to decide whether or not RP=P represents a big open challenge in complexity theory, this makes it unlikely for EM to be NP-complete, and in fact indicates the possibility of a deterministic polynomial time algorithm. EM remains one of the few natural combinatorial problems in RP which are not known to be contained in P, making it an interesting instance for testing the hypothesis RP=P.  Despite EM being quite well-known, attempts to devise deterministic polynomial algorithms have remained illusive during the last 40 years and progress has been lacking even for very restrictive classes of input graphs. In this paper we push the frontier of positive results forward by proving that EM can be solved in deterministic polynomial time for input graphs of bounded independence number, and for bipartite input graphs of bounded bipartite independence number. This generalizes previous positive results for complete (bipartite) graphs which were the only known results for EM on dense graphs.},

We solve the Exact Matching problem in deterministic polynomial time for complete r-partite graphs, for unit interval graphs, for bipartite unit interval graphs, for graphs of bounded neighborhood diversity, for chain graphs, and for graphs without a complete bipartite t-hole. We solve the problem in quasi-polynomial time for Erd{\H o}s-R{\'e}nyi random graphs G(n, 1/2). We also reprove an earlier result for bounded independence number/bipartite independence number. We use two main tools to obtain these results: A local search algorithm as well as a generalization of an earlier result by Karzanov.},

In fact, the more general result that any family of pseudosegments (a set of open simple curves on the plane such that two curves intersect each other in at most one point) lying on a planar subdivision defined by n other pseudosegments can give rise to at most \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{4\})\$ edge sequences is also proven. This bound is shown to be asymptotically tight, by giving an example of a family of polyhedra with \${\textbackslash}Omega (n{\textasciicircum}\{4\})\$ shortest path equivalence classes.},

  abstract = {We introduce Recursive Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) and Recursive Simple Stochastic Games (RSSGs), which are classes of (finitely presented) countable-state MDPs and zero-sum turn-based (perfect information) stochastic games. They extend standard finite-state MDPs and stochastic games with a recursion feature. We study the decidability and computational complexity of these games under termination objectives for the two players: one player's goal is to maximize the probability of termination at a given exit, while the other player's goal is to minimize this probability. In the quantitative termination problems, given an RMDP (or RSSG) and probability p, we wish to decide whether the value of such a termination game is at least p (or at most p); in the qualitative termination problem we wish to decide whether the value is 1. The important 1-exit subclasses of these models, 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs, correspond in a precise sense to controlled and game versions of classic stochastic models, including multitype Branching Processes and Stochastic Context-Free Grammars, where the objective of the players is to maximize or minimize the probability of termination (extinction). We provide a number of upper and lower bounds for qualitative and quantitative termination problems for RMDPs and RSSGs. We show both problems are undecidable for multi-exit RMDPs, but are decidable for 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs. Specifically, the quantitative termination problem is decidable in PSPACE for both 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs, and is at least as hard as the square root sum problem, a well-known open problem in numerical computation. We show that the qualitative termination problem for 1-RMDPs (i.e., a controlled version of branching processes) can be solved in polynomial time both for maximizing and minimizing 1-RMDPs. The qualitative problem for 1-RSSGs is in NP {$\cap$} coNP, and is at least as hard as the quantitative termination problem for Condon's finite-state simple stochastic games, whose complexity remains a well known open problem. Finally, we show that even for 1-RMDPs, more general (qualitative and quantitative) model-checking problems with respect to linear-time temporal properties are undecidable even for a fixed property.},

To achieve this, a number of changes have to be made to their techniques, where the main one is to add power to the antagonistic player that allows for determining her rational move without changing the outcome of the game. We provide a first implementation for a quasi-polynomial algorithm, test it on small examples, and provide a number of side results, including minor algorithmic improvements, a quasi bi-linear complexity in the number of states and edges for a fixed number of colours, and matching lower bounds for the algorithm of Calude et al.},

It is not known whether every problem with an efficient randomized algorithm also has one that does not use randomness. One of the extensively studied problems under this theme is that of perfect matching. The perfect matching problem has a randomized parallel (NC) algorithm based on the Isolation Lemma of Mulmuley, Vazirani, and Vazirani. It is a long-standing open question whether this algorithm can be derandomized. In this article, we give an almost complete derandomization of the Isolation Lemma for perfect matchings in bipartite graphs. This gives us a deterministic parallel (quasi-NC) algorithm for the bipartite perfect matching problem. Derandomization of the Isolation Lemma means that we deterministically construct a weight assignment so that the minimum weight perfect matching is unique. We present three different ways of doing this construction with a common main idea.},

In this framework, we formulate a matroid-generalization of the stable marriage theorem and study the lattice structure of generalized stable matchings. Based on the theory of lattice polyhedra and blocking polyhedra, we extend results of Vande Vate and Rothblum on the bipartite stable matching polytope.}

  abstract = {The complexity class PPP contains all total search problems many-one reducible to the Pigeon problem, where we are given a succinct encoding of a function mapping n+1 pigeons to n holes, and must output two pigeons that collide in a hole.  PPP is one of the ``original five'' syntactically-defined subclasses of TFNP, and has been extensively studied due to the strong connections between its defining problem --- the pigeonhole principle --- and problems in cryptography, extremal combinatorics, proof complexity, and other fields.  However, despite its importance, PPP appears to be less robust than the other important TFNP subclasses.  In particular, unlike all other major TFNP subclasses, it was conjectured by Buss and Johnson that PPP is not closed under Turing reductions, and they called for a black-box separation in order to provide evidence for this conjecture. The question of whether PPP contains its Turing closure was further highlighted by Daskalakis in his recent IMU Abacus Medal Lecture.   In this work we prove that PPP is indeed not Turing-closed in the black-box setting, affirmatively resolving the above conjecture and providing strong evidence that PPP is not Turing-closed. In fact, we are able to separate PPP from its non-adaptive Turing closure, in which all calls to the Pigeon oracle must be made in parallel. This differentiates PPP from all other important TFNP subclasses, and especially from its closely-related subclass PWPP --- defined by reducibility to the weak pigeonhole principle --- which is known to be non-adaptively Turing-closed.  Our proof requires developing new tools for PPP lower bounds, and creates new connections between PPP and the theory of pseudoexpectation operators used for Sherali-Adams and Sum-of-Squares lower bounds.  In particular, we introduce a new type of pseudoexpectation operator that is precisely tailored for lower bounds against black-box PPP, which may be of independent interest.},

This is the theoretically fastest simplex algorithm known to date if               m {$\approx$} n;               it provably beats most of the classical deterministic variants which require exp({\textohm}(               n               )) pivot steps in the worst case. R               ANDOM               -F               ACET               has independently been discovered and analyzed ten years ago by Kalai as a variant of the primal simplex method, and by Matou{\u s}ek, Sharir, and Welzl in a dual form. The essential ideas and results connected to R               ANDOM               -F               ACET               can be presented in a particularly simple and instructive way for the case of linear programs over               combinatorial               n               -               cubes.               I derive an explicit upper bound of                              on the expected number of pivot steps in this case, using a new technique of ``fingerprinting'' pivot steps. This bound also holds for               generalized               linear programs, similar flavors of which have been introduced and studied by several researchers. I then review an interesting class of generalized linear programs, due to Matou{\u s}ek, showing that R               ANDOM               -F               ACET               may indeed require an expected number of                                \${\textbackslash}exp {\textbackslash}bigl({\textbackslash}Omega{\textbackslash}bigl({\textbackslash}sqrt n{\textbackslash}bigr){\textbackslash}bigr)\$                                               pivot steps in the worst case. The main new result of the paper is a proof that all actual linear programs in Matou{\u s}ek's class are solved by R               ANDOM               -F               ACET               with an expected polynomial number of                                \$O {\textbackslash}bigl(n{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}bigr)\$                                               pivot steps. This proof exploits a combinatorial property of linear programming which has only recently been discovered by Holt and Klee. The result establishes the first scenario in which an algorithm that works for generalized linear programs ``recognizes'' proper linear programs. Thus, despite Matou{\u s}ek's worst-case result, the question remains open whether R               ANDOM               -F               ACET               (or any other simplex variant) is a polynomial-time algorithm for linear programming. Finally, I briefly discuss extensions of the combinatorial cube results to the general case. {\copyright} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 20:353--381, 2002},

In addition, we consider a discretized setting where indivisible items lie on a line and show a number of hardness results extending and strengthening those from prior work. Finally, we investigate connections between approximate and exact envy-freeness, as well as between continuous and discrete cake cutting.},

Specifically, a problem in this class is specified by a polynomial-time approximable function q:0101[01]~ that associates, with each possible solution y to an instance x, a quality q(xy)~.Intuitively, quality 1 corresponds to perfectly valid solutions, quality 0 corresponds to perfectly invalid solutions, but the quality of other solutions can be anywhere in-between.The class of PPT-search problems contains q if there exists a PPT algorithm that, on input x, finds a solution with value close to maxyq(xy)~.  We relate this definition to previously studied definitions of ``BPP-search problems'' and articulate our preference for it. More importantly, we show that any PPT-search problem can be reduced in deterministic polynomial-time to a promise problem in promise-BPP.},

Using known reductions between various games, we achieve the first strongly subexponential solutions for Discounted and Mean Payoff Games. We also give alternative simple proofs for the best known upper bounds for Parity Games and binary SSGs. To the best of our knowledge, the LP-type framework has been used so far only in order to yield linear or close to linear time algorithms for various problems in computational geometry and location theory. Our approach demonstrates the applicability of the LP-type framework in other fields, and for achieving subexponential algorithms.},

More precisely, Ye showed that both algorithms terminate after at most O(mn1-{$\gamma$} log n1-{$\gamma$}) iterations, where n is the number of states, m is the total number of actions in the MDP, and 0 {$<$} {$\gamma$} {$<$} 1 is the discount factor. We improve Ye's analysis in two respects. First, we improve the bound given by Ye and show that Howard's policy iteration algorithm actually terminates after at most O(m1-{$\gamma$} log n1-{$\gamma$}) iterations. Second, and more importantly, we show that the same bound applies to the number of iterations performed by the strategy iteration (or strategy improvement) algorithm, a generalization of Howard's policy iteration algorithm used for solving 2-player turn-based stochastic games with discounted zero-sum rewards. This provides the first strongly polynomial algorithm for solving these games, solving a long standing open problem. Combined with other recent results, this provides a complete characterization of the complexity the standard strategy iteration algorithm for 2-player turn-based stochastic games; it is strongly polynomial for a fixed discount factor, and exponential otherwise.},

The key to our algorithm is to use a potential function which simultaneously tracks \$k\$ as well as the optimal value \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ of the vertex cover LP relaxation. This approach also allows us to make use of prior algorithms for Maximum Independent Set in bounded-degree graphs and Above-Guarantee Vertex Cover. The main step in the algorithm is to branch on high-degree vertices, while ensuring that both \$k\$ and \${\textbackslash}mu = k - {\textbackslash}lambda\$ are decreased at each step. There can be local obstructions in the graph that prevent \${\textbackslash}mu\$ from decreasing in this process; we develop a number of novel branching steps to handle these situations.},

  abstract = {In the DIRECTED DETOUR problem one is given a digraph G and a pair of vertices s and t, and the task is to decide whether there is a directed simple path from s to t in G whose length is larger than distG (s, t). The more general parameterized variant, DIRECTED LONG DETOUR, asks for a simple s-to-t path of length at least distG (s, t) + k, for a given parameter k. Surprisingly, it is still unknown whether DIRECTED DETOUR is polynomial-time solvable on general digraphs. However, for planar digraphs, Wu and Wang [Networks, '15] proposed an O(n3)-time algorithm for DIRECTED DETOUR, while Fomin et al. [STACS 2022] gave a 2O({$\kappa$}) {$\cdot$} nO(1)-time fpt algorithm for DIRECTED LONG DETOUR. The algorithm of Wu and Wang relies on a nontrivial analysis of how short detours may look like in a plane embedding, while the algorithm of Fomin et al. is based on a reduction to the 3-DISJOINT PATHS problem on planar digraphs. This latter problem is solvable in polynomial time using the algebraic machinery of Schrijver [SIAM J. Comp., '94], but the degree of the obtained polynomial factor is huge.In this paper we propose two simple algorithms: we show how to solve, in planar digraphs, DIRECTED DETOUR in time O(n2) and DIRECTED LONG DETOUR in time 2O(k) {$\cdot$} n4 log n. In both cases, the idea is to reduce to the 2-DISJOINT PATHS problem in a planar digraph, and to observe that the obtained instances of this problem have a certain topological structure that makes them amenable to a direct greedy strategy.* This work is a part of project BOBR (KM, MP, MS) that has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No. 948057).

The method makes two matrix-vector multiplications and a trivial projection onto the nonnegative orthant at each iteration, and the Euclidean distance of the iterates to the solution set monotonously converges to zero. The main advantages of the method presented are its simplicity, robustness, and ability to handle large problems with any start point. It is pointed out that the method may be used to solve general convex quadratic programming problems. Preliminary numerical experiments indicate that this method may be very efficient for large sparse problems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}While the celebrated theory of NP-completeness has been very successful in explaining the intractability of many interesting problems, there still remain many natural and seemingly hard problems that are not known to be NP-hard. Several of these problems lie in the class of total NP search problems (TFNP), namely the class of NP search problems that always have a solution. Importantly, these problems cannot be NP-hard unless NP = co-NP. Notable examples of TFNP problems include FACTORING (given a natural number, compute its prime factorisation) and NASH (given a game, compute a mixed Nash equilibrium). In order to shed light on the complexity of these problems, researchers have attempted to classify them in various subclasses of TFNP such as PPAD, PPA, PPP, PLS, and CLS. A celebrated result in this line of research is the PPAD-completeness of NASH, yielding strong evidence that the problem is not polynomial-time solvable.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In this thesis we provide new structural results for TFNP subclasses and show how they can be used to classify natural problems arising from application areas such as game theory and optimisation. In the first part of this work, we construct more powerful tools for proving membership in PPAD, as well as PPAD-hardness. We directly apply these tools to show that the Hairy Ball theorem from topology ("you can't comb a hairy ball flat without creating a cowlick"), as well as the equilibrium computation problem in First Price Auctions with subjective priors, are both PPAD-complete.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In the second part of this thesis, we present our main result: the collapse CLS = PPAD {$\cap$} PLS. We prove this surprising collapse by exhibiting the first non-artificial PPAD {$\cap$} PLS-complete problem - a problem arising naturally from the famous gradient descent algorithm. Our result puts PPAD {$\cap$} PLS on the map as a TFNP subclass that captures the complexity of natural problems.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In the third and final part, we provide various structural results for the classes PPA-k (corresponding to arguments modulo k), including the first topological characterisations of these classes. As a direct application, we prove that NECKLACE-SPLITTING with k thieves - a notorious problem in combinatorics and fair division - lies in PPA-k under Turing reductions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Local search proved to be an extremely useful tool when facing hard optimization problems (e.g., via the simplex algorithm, simulated annealing, or genetic algorithms). Although powerful, it has its limitations: there are functions for which exponentially many queries are needed to find a local optimum. In many contexts the optimization problem is defined by a continuous function, which might offer an advantage when performing the local search. This leads us to study the following natural question: How hard is continuous local search? The computational complexity of such search problems is captured by the complexity class CLS (Daskalakis and Papadimitriou SODA'11) which is contained in the intersection of PLS and PPAD, two important subclasses of TFNP (the class of NP search problems with a guaranteed solution).In this work, we show the first hardness results for CLS (the smallest non-trivial class among the currently defined subclasses of TFNP). Our hardness results are in terms of black-box (where only oracle access to the function is given) and white-box (where the function is represented succinctly by a circuit). In the black-box case, we show instances for which any (computationally unbounded) randomized algorithm must perform exponentially many queries in order to find a local optimum. In the white-box case, we show hardness for computationally bounded algorithms under cryptographic assumptions. Our results demonstrate a strong conceptual barrier precluding design of efficient algorithms for solving local search problems even over continuous domains.As our main technical contribution we introduce a new total search problem which we call End-OF-Metered-Line. The special structure of End-OF-Metered-Line enables us to: (1) show that it is contained in CLS, and (2) prove hardness for it both in the black-box and the white-box setting.},

We prove that a connected division of indivisible items satisfying a discrete counterpart of envy-freeness, called envy-freeness up to one good (EF1), always exists for any number of agents n with monotone valuations. Our result settles an open question raised by Bil{\`o} et al. (2019), who proved that an EF1 connected division always exists for four agents with monotone valuations. Moreover, the proof can be extended to show the following (1) ``secretive" and (2) ``extra" versions: (1) for n agents with monotone valuations, the path can be divided into n connected bundles such that an EF1 assignment of the remaining bundles can be made to the other agents for any selection made by the ``secretive agent''; (2) for n+1 agents with monotone valuations, the path can be divided into n connected bundles such that when any ``extra agent'' leaves, an EF1 assignment of the bundles can be made to the remaining agents.},

Formally, we define t-PPP as the class of total NP-search problems reducible to finding a t-collision in a mapping from (t-1)N+1 pigeons to N holes. These classes are closely related to multi-collision resistant hash functions in cryptography. We show that the generalized pigeonhole classes form a hierarchy as t increases, and also give a natural condition on the parameters t1, t2 that captures exactly when t1-PPP and t2-PPP collapse in the black-box setting.

There exists a randomized polylogarithmic-time parallel algorithm to solve this problem, dating back to the eighties, but no deterministic polynomial-time algorithm is known, even for bipartite graphs. In this paper we show that there is no sub-exponential sized linear program that can describe the convex hull of exact matchings in bipartite graphs. In fact, we prove something stronger, that there is no sub-exponential sized linear program to describe the convex hull of perfect matchings with an odd number of red edges.},

Known results which the results of this paper extend are surveyed briefly and analyzed. A new implementation for priority queues is employed, and a class of ``arc set partition'' algorithms is introduced. For the single source problem on networks with nonnegative arcs a running time of O(min(n1+1/k + e, n + e) log n)) is achieved, where there are n nodes and e arcs, and k is a fixed integer satisfying k {$>$} 0. This bound is O(e) on dense networks. For the single source and all pairs problem on unrestricted networks the running time is O(min(n2+1/k + ne, n2 log n + ne log n).},

We characterize game progress measures as pre-fixed points of certain monotone operators on a complete lattice. As a result we get the existence of the least game progress measures and a straightforward way to compute them. The worst-case running time of our algorithm matches the best worst-case running time bounds known so far for the problem, achieved by the algorithms due to Browne et al., and Seidl. Our algorithm has better space complexity: it works in small polynomial space; the other two algorithms have exponential worst-case space complexity.},

For the case when the weight function is conservative, i.e., when every cycle has non-negative total weight, the complexity of the Shortest Odd Path problem had been open for 20 years, and was recently shown to be NP-hard. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case when the weight function is conservative and the set \$E{\textasciicircum}-\$ of negative-weight edges forms a single tree. Our algorithm exploits the strong connection between Shortest Odd Path and the problem of finding two internally vertex-disjoint paths between two terminals in an undirected edge-weighted graph. It also relies on solving an intermediary problem variant called Shortest Parity-Constrained Odd Path where for certain edges we have parity constraints on their position along the path. Also, we exhibit two FPT algorithms for solving Shortest Odd Path in graphs with conservative weight functions. The first FPT algorithm is parameterized by \${\textbar}E{\textasciicircum}-{\textbar}\$, the number of negative edges, or more generally, by the maximum size of a matching in the subgraph of \$G\$ spanned by \$E{\textasciicircum}-\$. Our second FPT algorithm is parameterized by the treewidth of \$G\$.},

At first glance it seems very similar to concavity, in other ways it resembles convexity. It appears in a wide variety of applications: in Computer Science it has recently been identified and utilized in domains such as viral marketing [39], information gathering [44], image segmentation [10, 40, 36], document summarization [56], and speeding up satisfiability solvers [73]. Our emphasis in this chapter is on maximization; there are many important results and applications related to minimizing submodular functions that we do not cover.As a concrete running example, we will consider the problem of deploying sensors in a drinking water distribution network (see Figure 3.1) in order to detect contamination. In this domain, we may have a model of how contaminants, accidentally or maliciously introduced into the network, spread over time. Such a model then allows to quantify the benefit f(A) of deploying sensors at a particular set A of locations (junctions or pipes in the network) in terms of the detection performance (such as average time to detection).Based on this notion of utility, we then wish to find an optimal subset A {$\subseteq$} V of locations maximizing the utility, maxAf(A), subject to some constraints (such as bounded cost). This application requires solving a difficult real-world optimization problem, that can be handled with the techniques discussed in this chapter (Krause et al. [49] show in detail how submodular optimization can be applied in this domain.)},

Since this result, two more intersection theorems have been discovered in this theory: EOPL = PLS {$\cap$} PPAD and SOPL = PLS {$\cap$} PPADS. It is natural to wonder if this exhausts the list of intersection classes in TFNP, or, if other intersections exist. In this work, we completely classify all intersection classes involved among the classical TFNP classes PLS, PPAD, and PPA, giving new complete problems for the newly-introduced intersections. Following the close links between the theory of TFNP and propositional proof complexity, we develop new proof systems - each of which is a generalization of the classical Resolution proof system - that characterize all of the classes, in the sense that a query total search problem is in the intersection class if and only if a tautology associated with the search problem has a short proof in the proof system. We complement these new characterizations with black-box separations between all of the newly introduced classes and prior classes, thus giving strong evidence that no further collapse occurs. Finally, we characterize arbitrary intersections and joins of the PPA\_q classes for q {$\geq$} 2 in terms of the Nullstellensatz proof systems.},

The linear hull of perfect matchings was characterized by Naddef, and by Edmonds, Lov{\'a}sz, and Pulleyblank. In this paper we describe the lattice generated by these vectors, i.e., the set of all integer linear combinations of perfect matchings. It turns out that the Petersen graph is, in a sense, the only difficult example. Our results also imply a characterization of the linear hull of perfect matchings over fields of characteristic different from 0. The main method is a decomposition theory developed by Kotzig, Lov{\'a}sz, and Plummer, which breaks down every graph into a number of graphs called bricks with very good matching properties. The number of Petersen graphs among these bricks will turn out to be an essential parameter of the matching lattice. Some refinements of the decomposition theory are also given. Among others, we show that the list of bricks obtained during the decomposition procedure is independent of the special choices made during the procedure.},

This class consists of problems that can be reduced, in polynomial time, to solvability of a system of polynomial inequalities in several variables over the reals. We discuss some subtleties in the definition of \${\textbackslash}exists{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, and we provide a complete and streamlined account of a proof of the \${\textbackslash}exists{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$-completeness of the recognition problem for segment intersection graphs. Along the way, we establish \${\textbackslash}exists{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$-completeness of several other problems.

  abstract = {Let C1,{\dots}, Cd+i be d + 1 point sets in {$\mathbb{R}$}d, each containing the origin in its convex hull. A subset C of  is called a colorful choice (or rainbow) for C1,{\dots}, Cd+1, if it contains exactly one point from each set Ci. The colorful Carath{\'e}odory theorem states that there always exists a colorful choice for C1,{\dots}, Cd+1 that has the origin in its convex hull. This theorem is very general and can be used to prove several other existence theorems in high-dimensional discrete geometry, such as the centerpoint theorem or Tverberg's theorem. The colorful Carath{\'e}odory problem (ColorfulCarath{\'e}odory) is the computational problem of finding such a colorful choice. Despite several efforts in the past, the computational complexity of ColorfulCarath{\'e}odory in arbitrary dimension is still open. We show that ColorfulCarath{\'e}odory lies in the intersection of the complexity classes PPAD and PLS. This makes it one of the few geometric problems in PPAD and PLS that are not known to be solvable in polynomial time. Moreover, it implies that the problem of computing centerpoints, computing Tverberg partitions, and computing points with large simplicial depth is contained in PPAD {$\Pi$} PLS. This is the first nontrivial upper bound on the complexity of these problems. Finally, we show that our PPAD formulation leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for a special case of ColorfulCarath{\'e}odory in which we have only two color classes C1 and C2 in d dimensions, each with the origin in its convex hull, and we would like to find a set with half the points from each color class that contains the origin in its convex hull.},

In this paper, by extending a part of their work, we propose a deterministic FPT algorithm in general parameterized by the minimum size of an odd cycle transversal in addition to the (bipartite) independence number. We also consider a relaxed problem called the correct parity matching problem, and show that a slight generalization of an equivalent problem is NP-hard.},

In this paper, we have used the concepts of correlations to cluster data, and merged it with recommendation algorithms. We have proposed two correlation clustering algorithms (RBACC and LGBACC), that are based on finding Spearman's rank correlation coefficient among data points, and using dimensionality reduction approach (PCA) along with graph theory respectively, to produce high quality hierarchical clusters. Both these algorithms have been tested on real life data (New York yellow cabs dataset taken from               http://www.nyc.gov               ), using distributed and parallel computing (Spark and R). They are found to be scalable and perform better than the existing hierarchical clustering algorithms. These two approaches have been used to replace similarity measures in recommendation algorithms and generate a correlation clustering based recommendation system model. We have combined the power of correlation analysis with that of prediction analysis to propose a better recommendation system. It is found that this model makes better quality recommendations as compared to the random recommendation model. This model has been validated using a real time, large data set (MovieLens dataset, taken from               http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest               ). The results show that combining correlated points with the predictive power of recommendation algorithms, produce better quality recommendations which are faster to compute. LGBACC has approximately 25\% better prediction capability but at the same time takes significantly more prediction time compared to RBACC.},

Much like Newton's method is a standard tool for solving unconstrained smooth optimization problems of modest size, proximal algorithms can be viewed as an analogous tool for nonsmooth, constrained, large-scale, or distributed versions of these problems. They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical algorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed-form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpretations of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.}

PLC includes all of PPP, as well as numerous previously unclassified total problems, including search problems related to Ramsey's theorem, the Sunflower theorem, the Erd{\H o}s-Ko-Rado lemma, and K{\"o}nig's lemma. Whether the first two of these four problems are PLC-complete is an important open question which we pursue; in contrast, we show that the latter two are PPP-complete.

  abstract = {Many standard graph classes are known to be characterized by means of layouts (a permutation of its vertices) excluding some patterns. Important such graph classes are among others: proper interval graphs, interval graphs, chordal graphs, permutation graphs, (co-)comparability graphs. For example, a graph \$G=(V,E)\$ is a proper interval graph if and only if \$G\$ has a layout \$L\$ such that for every triple of vertices such that \$x{\textbackslash}prec\_L y{\textbackslash}prec\_L z\$, if \$xz{\textbackslash}in E\$, then \$xy{\textbackslash}in E\$ and \$yz{\textbackslash}in E\$. Such a triple \$x\$, \$y\$, \$z\$ is called an indifference triple and layouts excluding indifference triples are known as indifference layouts. In this paper, we investigate the concept of tree-layouts. A tree-layout \$T\_G=(T,r,{\textbackslash}rho\_G)\$ of a graph \$G=(V,E)\$ is a tree \$T\$ rooted at some node \$r\$ and equipped with a one-to-one mapping \${\textbackslash}rho\_G\$ between \$V\$ and the nodes of \$T\$ such that for every edge \$xy{\textbackslash}in E\$, either \$x\$ is an ancestor of \$y\$ or \$y\$ is an ancestor of \$x\$. Clearly, layouts are tree-layouts. Excluding a pattern in a tree-layout is defined similarly as excluding a pattern in a layout, but now using the ancestor relation. Unexplored graph classes can be defined by means of tree-layouts excluding some patterns. As a proof of concept, we show that excluding non-indifference triples in tree-layouts yields a natural notion of proper chordal graphs. We characterize proper chordal graphs and position them in the hierarchy of known subclasses of chordal graphs. We also provide a canonical representation of proper chordal graphs that encodes all the indifference tree-layouts rooted at some vertex. Based on this result, we first design a polynomial time recognition algorithm for proper chordal graphs. We then show that the problem of testing isomorphism between two proper chordal graphs is in P, whereas this problem is known to be GI-complete on chordal graphs.},

  abstract = {The rotor-router model is a popular deterministic analogue of random walk. In this paper we prove that all orbits of the rotor-router operation have the same size on a strongly connected directed graph (digraph) and give a formula for the size. By using this formula we address the following open question about orbits of the rotor-router operation: Is there an infinite family of non-Eulerian strongly connected digraphs such that the rotor-router operation on each digraph has a single orbit? It turns out that on a strongly connected digraph the stationary distribution of the simple random walk coincides with the frequency of vertices in a rotor walk. In this common aspect a rotor walk simulates a random walk. This gives one similarity between two models on (finite) digraphs.},

  abstract = {Recent studies on stability and contractivity have highlighted the importance of semi-inner products, which we refer to as ``pairings'', associated with general norms. A pairing is a binary operation that relates the derivative of a curve's norm to the radius-vector of the curve and its tangent. This relationship, known as the curve norm derivative formula, is crucial when using the norm as a Lyapunov function. Another important property of the pairing, used in stability and contraction criteria, is the so-called Lumer inequality, which relates the pairing to the induced logarithmic norm. We prove that the curve norm derivative formula and Lumer's inequality are, in fact, equivalent to each other and to several simpler properties. We then introduce and characterize regular pairings that satisfy all of these properties. Our results unify several independent theories of pairings (semi-inner products) developed in previous work on functional analysis and control theory. Additionally, we introduce the polyhedral max pairing and develop computational tools for polyhedral norms, advancing contraction theory in non-Euclidean spaces.},

If we restrict ourselves to directed graphs that are regular and consistently labelled, then we are able to produce pseudorandom walks for such graphs in logarithmic space (this result already found an independent application). We prove that if (2) could be generalized to all regular directed graphs (including ones that are not consistently labelled) then L=RL. We do so by exhibiting a new complete promise problem for RL, and showing that such a problem can be solved in deterministic logarithmic space given a log-space pseudorandom walk generator for regular directed graphs.},

A very wide variety of algorithms, ranging from classical to recently developed, can be derived in a uniform way. The approach is to pose the original problem to be solved as one of finding a zero of an appropriate monotone operator; this problem in turn is then posed as one of finding a fixed point of a related operator, which is done using the fixed point iteration. A few basic convergence results then tell us conditions under which the method converges, and, in some cases, how fast. This approach can be traced back to the 1960s and 1970s, and is still an active area of research. This primer is a self-contained gentle introduction to the topic.},

We clarify the interconnections between some of these problems and establish three levels of difficulties. On the one hand, we prove that the Shortest Odd Path problem in undirected graphs without cycles of negative total weight and several related problems are NP-hard, settling a long-standing open question asked by Lov{\textbackslash}'asz (Open Problem 27 in Schrijver's book ``Combinatorial Optimization''). On the other hand, we provide an efficient algorithm to the closely related and well-studied Minimum-weight Odd \$T\$-Join problem for non-negative weights: our algorithm runs in FPT time parameterized by \$c\$, where \$c\$ is the number of connected components in some efficiently computed minimum-weight \$T\$-join. If negative weights are also allowed, then finding a minimum-weight odd \${\textbackslash}\{s,t{\textbackslash}\}\$-join is equivalent to the Minimum-weight Odd \$T\$-Join problem for arbitrary weights, whose complexity is still only conjectured to be polynomial-time solvable. The analogous problems for digraphs are also considered.},

The function must be Lipschitz continuous with constant 1 with respect to the infinity norm; such functions are commonly found in economics and game theory. The computed approximation satisfies a residual criterion given a specified error tolerance. The BEDFix algorithm improves the BEFix algorithm presented in Shellman and Sikorski [2002] by utilizing "deep cuts," that is, eliminating additional segments of the feasible domain which cannot contain a fixed point. The upper bound on the number of required function evaluations is the same for BEDFix and BEFix, but our numerical tests indicate that BEDFix significantly improves the average-case performance. In addition, we show how BEDFix may be used to solve the absolute criterion fixed point problem with significantly better performance than the simple iteration method, when the Lipschitz constant is less than but close to 1. BEDFix is highly efficient when used to compute residual solutions for bivariate functions, having a bound on function evaluations that is twice the logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance. In the tests described in this article, the number of evaluations performed by the method averaged 31 percent of this worst-case bound. BEDFix works for nonsmooth continuous functions, unlike methods that require gradient information; also, it handles functions with minimum Lipschitz constants equal to 1, whereas the complexity of simple iteration approaches infinity as the minimum Lipschitz constant approaches 1. When BEDFix is used to compute absolute criterion solutions, the worst-case complexity depends on the logarithm of the reciprocal of 1-q, where q is the Lipschitz constant, as well as on the logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of approximating fixed points of contractive functions with using the absolute error criterion. It was proven in (A. S. Nemirovsky, 1991. J. Complexity, 7, 121-130) that it is impossible to essentially improve the efficiency of the simple iteration whenever the dimension of the domain of contractive functions is large. However, for a moderate dimension we exhibit a fixed point ellipsoid algorithm which is much more efficient than the simple iteration for mildly contractive functions. This algorithm is based on Khachiyan s construction of minimal volume ellipsoids used for solving linear programming.},

  abstract = {Catalan numbers are probably the most ubiquitous sequence of numbers in mathematics. This book gives for the first time a comprehensive collection of their properties and applications to combinatorics, algebra, analysis, number theory, probability theory, geometry, topology, and other areas. Following an introduction to the basic properties of Catalan numbers, the book presents 214 different kinds of objects counted by them in the form of exercises with solutions. The reader can try solving the exercises or simply browse through them. Some 68 additional exercises with prescribed difficulty levels present various properties of Catalan numbers and related numbers, such as Fuss-Catalan numbers, Motzkin numbers, Schr{\"o}der numbers, Narayana numbers, super Catalan numbers, q-Catalan numbers and (q, t)-Catalan numbers. The book ends with a history of Catalan numbers by Igor Pak and a glossary of key terms. Whether your interest in mathematics is recreation or research, you will find plenty of fascinating and stimulating facts here},

A family of algorithms based on complementary pivoting for solving this problem is modelled by digraphs. These digraphs show that such algorithms can cycle even for symmetric, positive deFinite M, and provide some insight into the algorithms' behavior. For a P-matrix M, it is proved that if the solution to the complementarity problem can be obtained by k principal pivots, then it can be obtained by k Bard-type pivots. Furthermore, the digraphs provide simple geometric proofs of some of Murty's algebraic results. The digraphs, apart from their use as models, also raise some interesting graph-theoretic questions.},

  abstract = {This note revisits the study of search problems that are solvable in probabilistic polynomial time. Previously, Goldreich (2011) introduced a class called ``-search'', and studied search-to-decision reductions for problems in this class. In Goldreich's original formulation, the definition of what counts as ``successfully solving'' a -search problem is implicit, and this opens the door to multiple possible interpretations. We suggest two approaches: 1. We propose *our preferred definition* for the notion of solving -search problems. The resulting class of search problems is useful, since it captures natural problems of interest, and since it has valuable technical properties. However, the a-priori rationale for studying the class is not fully satisfying. 2. We propose an *alternative formulation* of the class of search problems solvable in ppt, which is focused on optimization (i.e., finding a solution of best quality). The resulting class has a clearer meaning, and it turns out to be *computationally equivalent* to the class resulting from our aforementioned definition of -search (under deterministic polynomial-time reductions). The optimization-based definition seems cleaner and more appealing. However, since the two classes above are computationally equivalent, it can be useful to use whichever definition is technically more convenient in the relevant context. *On the companion paper.* This paper presents my perspective on a joint project conducted together with Oded Goldreich, whereas Oded's perspective is presented in the companion paper (Goldreich, 2024). The technical contents of both papers has significant overlap, and both papers propose the same definition that is referred to in the current text as -optimization (i.e., Definition 5).},

We show that the basic approach leads to a simple and natural local search algorithm with guaranteed convergence. This algorithm already beats alternative algorithms by substantial margins in both running time and quality of the clustering. Using ideas from FW algorithms, we develop subsampling and variance reduction paradigms for this approach. This yields both a practical improvement of the algorithm and some interesting further directions to investigate. We demonstrate the performance on both synthetic and real world data sets.},

As an application we show that the presented data structure can be used to improve the previous best known running time O(mn) for the so called 2-disjoint paths problem on directed acyclic graphs to O(m(log2+m/n n) + n log3 n). In this problem, given a tuple (s1, s2, t1, t2) of four vertices, we want to construct two disjoint paths p1, from s1 to t1, and p2, from s2 to t2, if such paths exist.},

There is no known deterministic polynomial time complexity algorithm for solving this problem, and the most efficient algorithms are based on a time/memory trade-off. The widespread perception is that this problem is difficult. In this paper, we establish a relationship between the LWPM problem and the MAX-SAT problem of determining an assignment that maximizes the number of valid clauses of a system of affine Boolean clauses. This relationship shows that any algorithm that can compute the optimum of a MAX-SAT instance can also compute the optimum of an equivalent LWPM instance. It also confirms the perception that the LWPM problem is difficult.},

A white paper on good research practices in benchmarking: The case of cluster analysis. WIREs Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, e1511. https://doi.org/10.1002/widm.1511 To achieve scientific progress in terms of building a cumulative body of knowledge, careful attention to benchmarking is of the utmost importance. This means that proposals of new methods of data pre-processing, new data-analytic techniques, and new methods of output post-processing, should be extensively and carefully compared with existing alternatives, and that existing methods should be subjected to neutral comparison studies. To date, benchmarking and recommendations for benchmarking have been frequently seen in the context of supervised learning. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of guidelines for benchmarking in an unsupervised setting, with the area of clustering as an important subdomain. To address this problem, discussion is given to the theoretical conceptual underpinnings of benchmarking in the field of cluster analysis by means of simulated as well as empirical data. Subsequently, the practicalities of how to address benchmarking questions in clustering are dealt with, and foundational recommendations are made.},

In this paper, we answer an open question in these works by giving deterministic approximation algorithms for these problems. The analysis of our algorithms is simpler than the analysis of the randomized algorithms. In addition, we consider the problem of finding minimum-cost rankings and clusterings that must obey certain constraints (e.g., an input partial order in the case of ranking problems), which were introduced by Hegde and Jain [Hegde, R., K. Jain. 2006. Personal communication]. We show that the first type of algorithms we propose can also handle these constrained problems. In addition, we show that in the case of a rank aggregation or consensus clustering problem, if the input rankings or clusterings obey the constraints, then we can always ensure that the output of any algorithm obeys the constraints without increasing the objective value of the solution.},

Such numberings are abstract objective functions in the sense of Adler and Saigal [1]. It is shown that a completely unimodal numbering of the vertices of a simple polytope induces a shelling of the facets of the dual simplicial polytope. The h-vector of the dual simplicial polytope is interpreted in terms of the numbering (with respect to using a local-improvement algorithm to locate the vertex numbered 0). In the case that the polytope is combinatorially equivalent to a d-dimensional cube, a `successor-tuple' for each vertex is defined which carries the crucial information of the numbering for local-improvement algorithms. Combinatorial properties of these d-tuples are studied. Finally the running time of one particular local-improvement algorithm, the Random Algorithm, is studied for completely unimodal numberings of the d-cube. It is shown that for a certain class of numberings (which includes the example of Klee and Minty [8] showing that the simplex algorithm is not polynomial and all Hamiltonian saddle-free injective pseudo-Boolean functions [6]) this algorithm has expected running time that is at worst quadratic in the dimension d.},

  abstract = {In the exact matching problem we are given a graph G, some of whose edges are colored red, and a positive integer k. The goal is to determine if G has a perfect matching, exactly k edges of which are red. More generally if the matching number of G is m=m(G), the goal is to find a matching with m edges, exactly k edges of which are red, or determine that no such matching exists. This problem is one of the few remaining problems that have efficient randomized algorithms (in fact, this problem is in RNC), but for which no polynomial time deterministic algorithm is known. Our first result shows that, in a sense, this problem is as close to being in P as one can get. We give a polynomial time deterministic algorithm that either correctly decides that no maximum matching has exactly k red edges, or exhibits a matching with m(G){\'z}1 edges having exactly k red edges. Hence, the additive error is one. We also present an efficient algorithm for the exact matching problem in families of graphs for which this problem is known to be tractable. We show how to count the number of exact perfect matchings in K3,3-minor free graphs (these include all planar graphs as well as many others) in O(n3.19) worst case time. Our algorithm can also count the number of perfect matchings in K3,3-minor free graphs in O(n2.19) time.},

  abstract = {Let G=(V,E) be an unweighted undirected graph on n vertices. A simple argument shows that computing all distances in G with an additive one-sided error of at most 1 is as hard as Boolean matrix multiplication. Building on recent work of Aingworth et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 28 (1999), pp. 1167--1181], we describe an \${\textbackslash}Ot({\textbackslash}min{\textbackslash}\{n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\}m{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\},n{\textasciicircum}\{7/3\}{\textbackslash}\})\$-time algorithm APASP2  for computing all distances in G with an additive one-sided error of at most 2. Algorithm APASP2  is simple, easy to implement, and faster than the fastest known matrix-multiplication algorithm. Furthermore, for every even k{$>$}2, we describe an \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}({\textbackslash}min{\textbackslash}\{n{\textasciicircum}\{2-\{2\}/\{(k+2)\}\}m{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}/\{(k+2)\}\}, n{\textasciicircum}\{2+\{2\}/\{(3k-2)\}\}{\textbackslash}\})\$-time algorithm APASPk  for computing all distances in G with an additive one-sided error of at most k. We also give an \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$-time algorithm \$\{{\textbackslash}bf APASP\}\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ for producing stretch 3 estimated distances in an unweighted and undirected graph on n vertices. No constant stretch factor was previously achieved in \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ time.We say that a weighted graph F=(V,E')  k-emulates an unweighted graph G=(V,E) if for every \$u,v{\textbackslash}in V\$ we have \${\textbackslash}delta\_G(u,v){\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}delta\_F(u,v){\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}delta\_G(u,v)+k\$. We show that every unweighted graph on n vertices has a 2-emulator with \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$ edges and a 4-emulator with \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{4/3\})\$ edges. These results are asymptotically tight.Finally, we show that any  weighted undirected graph on n vertices has a 3-spanner with \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$ edges and that such a 3-spanner can be built in \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(mn{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\})\$ time. We also describe an \$\{{\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}\}(n(m{\textasciicircum}\{2/3\}+n))\$-time algorithm for estimating all distances in a  weighted undirected graph on n vertices with a stretch factor of at most 3.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               During the last decade, improvements in high-throughput sequencing have generated a wealth of genomic data. Functionally interpreting these sequences and finding the biological signals that are hallmarks of gene function and regulation is currently mostly done using automated genome annotation platforms, which mainly rely on integrated machine learning frameworks to identify different functional sites of interest, including splice sites. Splicing is an essential step in the gene regulation process, and the correct identification of splice sites is a major cornerstone in a genome annotation system.                                         Results               In this paper, we present SpliceRover, a predictive deep learning approach that outperforms the state-of-the-art in splice site prediction. SpliceRover uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been shown to obtain cutting edge performance on a wide variety of prediction tasks. We adapted this approach to deal with genomic sequence inputs, and show it consistently outperforms already existing approaches, with relative improvements in prediction effectiveness of up to 80.9\% when measured in terms of false discovery rate. However, a major criticism of CNNs concerns their `black box' nature, as mechanisms to obtain insight into their reasoning processes are limited. To facilitate interpretability of the SpliceRover models, we introduce an approach to visualize the biologically relevant information learnt. We show that our visualization approach is able to recover features known to be important for splice site prediction (binding motifs around the splice site, presence of polypyrimidine tracts and branch points), as well as reveal new features (e.g. several types of exclusion patterns near splice sites).                                         Availability and implementation               SpliceRover is available as a web service.
