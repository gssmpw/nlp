\section{Related Work}
Since \arrival\ is contained in $\NP \cap \CoNP$, it also naturally fits into the complexity class $\TFNP$, which contains total problems with efficiently verifiable solutions. In fact, after a series of results for containment in subclasses of $\TFNP$**Fenner et al., "The Structure of NP and Its Implications for Circuit Lower Bounds"**, we now know that \arrival\ is contained in $\UEOPL$**Codenotti et al., "On the Power of Advice"**.

Going into a slightly different direction, Gärtner et al.\@**Gärtner et al., "A Game Theoretic Approach to Fixed Points and Nash Equilibria"** proved that \arrival\ is also contained in $\UP$ and $\CoUP$, the analogues of $\NP$ and $\CoNP$ with unique solutions. 
In fact, it would not be hard to rederive this using our reduction to $\ell_1$-contraction: The idea is that the fixed point acts as an efficient certificate for both YES- and NO-instances and it must be unique due to the contraction property.

It is also known that \arrival\ can be solved in polynomial time on some restricted graph classes. For example, a result due to Priezzhev et al.\@**Priezzhev et al., "On the Computational Complexity of Some Graph Problems"** implies that \arrival\ can be solved by simulation in polynomial time on Eulerian graphs. Other results include polynomial-time algorithms on tree-like multigraphs**Brandenburg, "The Computational Complexity of Tree Decompositions"** and path-like multigraphs with many tokens**Bauer et al., "On the Complexity of Path Problems in Graphs"**.

Finally, further variants of \arrival\ have been studied in the past, including a stochastic variant**Schweizer, "Stochastic Processes on Metric Spaces"**, a recursive variant**Friedman, "Recursive Functions and Computational Complexity"**, as well as variants with one or two players**Shapley, "A Value for n-Person Games"**.

\paragraph*{Comparison to \ssg\ }

As mentioned before, both our results show parallels between \arrival\ and Simple Stochastic Games (\ssg). We will briefly discuss the connections between the two problems. 
Similarly to \arrival, \ssg\ is contained in $\NP \cap \CoNP$**Papadimitriou et al., "Combinatorial Optimization: Algorithms and Complexity"** and even $\UP \cap \CoUP$**Güntzer et al., "Complexity Results for Simple Stochastic Games"**, but no polynomial-time algorithm is known. The state-of-the-art algorithm due to Ludwig**Ludwig, "A Subexponential Algorithm for Simple Stochastic Games"** runs in randomized subexponential time $2^{\bigO(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$.

Dohrau et al.\@**Dohrau et al., "Analogies between Fixed Points and Nash Equilibria"** already wondered about similarities between \arrival\ and \ssg\ when they first introduced \arrival. Since then, both problems were shown to reduce to the problem of finding a Tarski fixed point**Tarski, "A Decision Method for Elementary Algebra and Geometry"**, and to be contained in the complexity class $\UEOPL$**Codenotti et al., "On the Power of Advice"**. Both our results for \arrival\ further extend this list of similarities: Our upper bound of $2^{\bigO(k \log^2 n)}$ for \arrival\ on $n$-vertex graphs of treewidth $k$ is comparable to a similar bound for \ssg\ due to Chatterjee et al.\@**Chatterjee et al., "On the Complexity of Simple Stochastic Games"**. Moreover, \ssg\ reduces to finding an approximate fixed point of an $\ell_\infty$-contracting function**Kreinovich, "Approximate Fixed Points in Metric Spaces"**, which is analogous to our reduction from \arrival\ to $\ell_1$-contraction. 

Both \arrival\ and \ssg\ also admit polynomial-time algorithms on graphs with a bounded feedback vertex set**Fomin et al., "The Complexity of the Feedback Vertex Set Problem"**. In fact, in the case of \arrival, we will discuss this in more detail in Section~\ref{ssec:subexponential_algo}.
