  abstract = {A rotor walk in a directed graph can be thought of as a deterministic version of a Markov Chain, where a pebble moves from vertex to vertex following a simple rule until a terminal vertex, or sink, has been reached. The ARRIVAL problem, as defined by Dohrau et al. [8], consists in determining which sink will be reached. While the walk itself can take an exponential number of steps, this problem belongs to the complexity class NP {$\cap$} co-NP without being known to be in P. In this work, we define a class of directed graphs, namely tree-like multigraphs, which are multigraphs having the global shape of an undirected tree. We prove that in this class, ARRIVAL can be solved in almost linear time, while the number of steps of a rotor walk can still be exponential. Then, we give an application of this result to solve some deterministic analogs of stochastic models (e.g., Markovian decision processes, Stochastic Games).},

  abstract = {Turn-based stochastic games (aka simple stochastic games) are two-player zero-sum games played on directed graphs with probabilistic transitions. The goal of player-max is to maximize the probability to reach a target state against the adversarial player-min. These games lie in NP {$\cap$} coNP and are among the rare combinatorial problems that belong to this complexity class for which the existence of polynomial-time algorithm is a major open question. While randomized sub-exponential time algorithm exists, all known deterministic algorithms require exponential time in the worst-case. An important open question has been whether faster algorithms can be obtained parametrized by the treewidth of the game graph. Even deterministic sub-exponential time algorithm for constant treewidth turn-based stochastic games has remain elusive. In this work our main result is a deterministic algorithm to solve turn-based stochastic games that, given a game with n states, treewidth at most t, and the bit-complexity of the probabilistic transition function log D, has running time O ((tn2 log D)t log n). In particular, our algorithm is quasi-polynomial time for games with constant or poly-logarithmic treewidth.},

For the zero-player case, we also show P-hardness for a succinctly-represented model that maintains the upper bound of NP \${\textbackslash}cap\$ coNP. For the one- and two-player cases, our results hold in both the natural, explicit model and succinctly-represented model. Our results show that the switching variant of a game is harder in complexity-theoretic terms than the corresponding stochastic version.},

On open graphs, the particle eventually leaves the system, and a new particle is then added. The operators corresponding to particle addition generate an Abelian group, same as the group for the Abelian sandpile model on the graph. We determine the critical steady state and some critical exponents exactly, using this equivalence.},
