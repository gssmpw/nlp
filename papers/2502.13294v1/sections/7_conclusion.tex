% This study underscores the critical need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach to responsible AI governance within organizations. By systematically reviewing and categorizing over 230 papers and tools according to stakeholder roles and AI lifecycle stages, we provide a detailed understanding of the current landscape and its imbalances. Our findings highlight a pronounced focus on designers and developers, particularly during data-centric and modeling stages, while other roles such as institutional leadership, end-users, and impacted communities remain underrepresented. Similarly, early and late lifecycle stages, such as value proposition, deployment, and monitoring, receive comparatively little attention.

% The stakeholder-stage matrix presented in this work serves as a valuable tool for identifying these gaps and guiding future research efforts. By mapping tools and frameworks to specific roles and stages, the matrix offers a practical framework for addressing the uneven distribution of resources and responsibilities in responsible AI development. Researchers and practitioners can leverage this matrix to design tools and frameworks that are not only actionable and role-specific but also validated for practical use.

% Interdisciplinary efforts are essential to bridge technical, ethical, and organizational divides, ensuring that AI systems are developed and governed in ways that are both equitable and effective. This includes creating tools for underserved roles and stages, fostering participatory design processes with impacted communities, and advocating for enforceable standards that promote transparency, accountability, and inclusivity across the entire AI lifecycle.

% By advancing these efforts, the FAccT community can play a pivotal role in shaping the future of responsible AI, ensuring that its benefits are realized across diverse stakeholders and contexts.
