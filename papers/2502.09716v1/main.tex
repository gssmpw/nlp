\begin{abstract}
Genetic data collection has become ubiquitous today. The ability to meaningfully interpret genetic data has motivated its widespread use across forensics, clinical practice, and research, providing crucial insights into human health and ancestry while driving important public health initiatives. Easy access to genetic testing has fueled a rapid expansion of direct-to-consumer offerings, many of which are recreational in nature. However, the growth of genetic datasets and their applications has created significant privacy and discrimination risks, particularly as our understanding of the scientific basis for genetic traits continues to evolve. In this paper, we organize the uses of genetic data along four distinct `pillars': clinical practice, research, forensic and government use, and recreational use. Using our scientific understanding of genetics, genetic inference methods and their associated risks, and existing regulatory mechanisms, we build a risk assessment framework that identifies key values that any governance system must preserve. We then analyze case studies from each of the pillars using this framework to assess how well existing legal and regulatory frameworks preserve desired values. Our investigation reveals critical gaps in existing regulatory frameworks and identifies specific threats to privacy and personal liberties, particularly through genetic discrimination. To address these challenges, we call for and propose comprehensive regulatory reforms including: (1) updating the legal definition of genetic data to protect against modern technological capabilities, (2) expanding the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) to cover currently unprotected domains, and (3) establishing a unified regulatory framework under a single governing body to oversee all applications of genetic data. 

We conclude with three open questions about genetic data: the challenges posed by its relational nature, including consent for relatives and minors; the complexities of international data transfer; and its potential integration into large language models.
