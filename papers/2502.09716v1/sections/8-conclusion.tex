In this paper we outline the genetic data ecosystem and today's state of public protections. We identify critical gaps in current regulatory federal and state-level frameworks that prevent the productive, ethical, and safe adoption of genetic data for broad societal applications. To address this, we propose a novel risk assessment framework that offers key public protections and preserve's individuals personal liberties, and finally make three concrete policy recommendations. In summary, our proposed reforms aim to create robust socio-technical policy safeguards that protect individual rights and opportunities while preserving the scientific and social benefits of genetic research.
