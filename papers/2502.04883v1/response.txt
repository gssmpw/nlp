Various approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of low-resource ASR systems. %in the absence of a large amount of labeled data. %One simple, yet effective technique is data augmentation,  which improves the performance by generating new, varied samples from the existing data. Examples of the proposed data augmentation methods for ASR are SpecAugment**Park et al., "SpecAugment: A Simple Framework for Robust and Generalizable Speech Recognition"**, MixSpeech**Zhang et al., "MixSpeech: A Data Augmentation Method for Automatic Speech Recognition"** and TTS-based augmentation techniques**Ye et al., "TTS- Based Data Augmentation for End-to-End ASR"**. These techniques mainly involve warping or combining features of the input speech as well as using text-to-speech to generate new data samples.
One important line of research focuses on the potential of transferring cross-lingual knowledge from high-resource to low-resource languages**Liu et al., "Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer for Low-Resource ASR"**. Recent work has found that multilingual models can be beneficial in improving ASR performance for low-resource languages, as they can learn universal features that are transferable across  languages. Specifically, Liu and colleagues**Liu et al., "Multilingual Hierarchical Softmax Decoding for Low-Resource ASR"**, proposed a method for explicit transfer of cross-lingual knowledge at the decoding stage. Their proposed model (which performs multilingual hierarchical Softmax decoding using a Huffman tree) can capture cross-linguistic similarity among units such as characters and phones. %Their method yielded up to 2.7\% character error rate (CER) improvement for Romance, Slavic and Turkic languages. As another example, Yang and colleagues in**Yang et al., "ASR Pathways: A Sparse Multilingual ASR Model"**, proposed ASR pathways, a sparse multilingual ASR model that activates language-specific sub-networks, such that the parameters for each language are learned explicitly. Consequently, the overlapping sub-networks enable knowledge transfer to low-resource languages. %They applied their method to English, French, Italian and Dutch and reported an average word error rate (WER) improvement of up to 4.5\% as compared to a dense (non-pruned) baseline.   
However, despite being relatively  effective, these types of methods have some limitations**Li et al., "Limitations of Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer for Low-Resource ASR"**.
