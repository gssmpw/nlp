Instructions for extracting sections from the given textbook content: 

1. Transform markdown for equations into LaTeX and remove all other markdown 
   formatting to only keep the raw content.  
2. Split the content into sections of uniform length and number each section.  
3. Skip the learning objectives, key concepts, and summary content.  
4. Ensure that all content, except skipped parts, is covered verbatim in at 
   least one of the resulting sections.  

# EXAMPLE  
## INPUT:  
{{ example_input }}  

## OUTPUT:  
{{ example_output }}  

Produce only valid JSON with the following format:
{
    "section": {
        "1": {
            "content": "Verbatim section 1 content from chapter"
        },
        ...
    }
}
