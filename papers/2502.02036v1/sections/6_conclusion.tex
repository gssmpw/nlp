This paper presents a teleoperation solution for a redundant 7-DOF robot manipulator. We developed and implemented a GRU-based VAE architecture finding a latent representation of the manipulator configuration space. The learned latent distribution space can utilize robot combinatorial joint kinematics that can mimic complex human articulated arm motion. In addition, a fully-connected neural network module mapped human arm gestures into latent distribution space representations, thus mimicking and generating corresponding robot manipulator configuration trajectories via the VAE decoder in real-time. The initial training for mapping human arm gestures to the manipulatorâ€™s latent distribution space showed promising performance for redundant robot manipulator teleoperation and the decoder was able to generate new robot manipulator configurations based on human operator right arm gestures that were never encountered in the training process.
