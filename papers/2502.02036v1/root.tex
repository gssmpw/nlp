\begin{abstract}

This paper presents a teleoperation system for controlling a redundant degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator using human arm gestures. We propose a GRU-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a latent representation of the manipulatorâ€™s configuration space, capturing its complex joint kinematics. A fully-connected neural network maps human arm configurations into this latent space, allowing the system to mimic and generate corresponding manipulator trajectories in real-time through the VAE decoder. The proposed method shows promising results in teleoperating the manipulator, enabling the generation of novel manipulator configurations from human gestures that were not present during training. Experimental evaluation highlights the effectiveness of this approach, although limitations remain concerning training data diversity.
