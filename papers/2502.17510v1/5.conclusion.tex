%In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Knowledge Localization and Fusion ({\ouralg}), a novel framework for continual learning. {\ouralg} integrates an inner learner for rapidly adapting to and identifying task-specific knowledge from new tasks with an outer learner that globally manages the integration of new and historical knowledge through a knowledge fusion mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of {\ouralg} in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enhancing knowledge transfer.

%In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Knowledge Localization and Fusion ({\ouralg}), a novel CL framework that dynamically estimates parameter importance for previous tasks. {\ouralg} iteratively employs an inner learner to localize new knowledge and an outer learner to manage the global fusion of knowledge, enabling real-time and adaptive adjustments to the fusion strategy based on evolving importance distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of {\ouralg} in addressing continual learning challenges.
