\section{Limitations}
Despite the promising results, FetchBot exhibits several limitations that warrant further investigation. First, the reliance on a suction-based grasping mechanism introduces constraints related to object surface characteristics and weight. Specifically, the system may experience suction failure when encountering irregular or uneven surfaces, and gravitational forces may cause detachment when manipulating objects exceeding the suction cup's weight capacity. Second, while the integration of DepthAnything~\cite{yang2024depth} has enhanced the model's generalization capabilities, the system's overall performance remains inherently bounded by the limitations of the DepthAnything framework itself. Third, the current implementation employs a spatial resolution of 0.5 cm per voxel for occupancy prediction, which, while sufficient for many scenarios, proves inadequate in highly complex and highly dynamic changing environments. Although increasing the spatial resolution could potentially address this limitation, such enhancement would necessitate significantly greater computational resources, presenting a critical trade-off between precision and computational efficiency that merits further exploration in future work.
