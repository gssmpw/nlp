\section{Related Work}
VUIs enable users to interact naturally through spoken language and are embedded in a range of consumer technologies, including smart speakers, smartphones, headphones, and even household appliances. Popular examples include Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant, which have become integral to everyday interactions. However, the term VUI is often used interchangeably with other labels, such as Intelligent Personal Assistants, Digital Assistants, Conversational Agents (CAs), Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), and Speech Interfaces **Baylor, "Voice User Interface Design"**__**Kortum, "Designing Multimedia Information Systems"**. While these terms share similarities, they differ in scope. For instance, CAs and CUIs encompass both voice- and text-based systems, including chatbots, whereas VUIs specifically refer to interfaces that rely on voice as the primary input and output modality.

Given this terminological overlap, it is essential to clarify the scope of this research. This article focuses explicitly on disembodied, software-based VUIs—systems that process and generate spoken language without physical embodiments, such as robots or avatars. However, given the broader relevance of CUIs in conversational AI research, we reference CUIs where applicable to contextualize and discuss our findings within the wider discourse on human-AI interaction.

\subsection{Metaphors—A Brief Primer}



Metaphors are more than just literary flourishes; they are fundamental tools for understanding and interpreting the world **Lakoff, "Philosophy in the Flesh"**. In linguistics and cognitive science, metaphors have been shown to shape not only how we communicate but also how we think **Lakoff & Johnson, "Metaphors We Live By"**. According to Lakoff and Johnson's theory of conceptual metaphors, our understanding of abstract concepts is often structured by metaphors derived from concrete experiences **Gibbs, "The Poetics of Mind"**. For example, when we say "time is money," we are using a metaphor to conceptualize time as a valuable resource, which affects how we perceive and manage it **Kovecses, "Metaphor: A Very Short Introduction"**.

Metaphors are powerful because they influence cognition and behavior, often in subtle ways. They help us understand complex ideas by linking them to more familiar concepts **Forceville, "Pictorial Metaphor in Advertising"**. Moreover, metaphors play a crucial role in shaping our perceptions of reality **Conee & Feldman, "Ephemeral Objects and Change in Logic"**.

\subsection{Mitigating Challenges in VUI Design}
As the VUI design space evolves, various approaches have been proposed to address the challenges surrounding VUI persona design. One promising approach involves developing VUIs in non-human roles **Desai & Twidale, "Exploring Metaphor Use in Human-Computer Interaction"**. Desai and Twidale identified how metaphors are used by users, designers, manufacturers, and researchers in relation to VUIs. Based on their analysis, they developed a framework for metaphor contextualization in VUIs, categorizing metaphor use along four dimensions: type (human, non-human, fictional), mentioned by (users, designers, manufacturers, researchers), the knowledge it draws upon, and the motivation behind its use **Jung et al., "Non-Human Metaphors in Conversational Agents"**.

In the broader CUI literature, there have been recent notable advancements in exploring the feasibility of designing conversational agents with non-human roles. Jung et al. used the Great Chain of Being (GCOB) framework to investigate how non-human metaphors (such as God, Animal, Plant, and Book) compared to human metaphors influence user perceptions of chatbots **Jung et al., "Non-Human Metaphors in Conversational Agents"**.

The use of fictional metaphors to inspire VUI design has long been of interest to HCI researchers. One of the most notable examples is drawing from the "Computer" in Star Trek to inform VUI design principles **Axtell & Munteanu, "Comparing the Dialogues of the 'Computer' in Star Trek: The Next Generation with Interactions on Amazon Alexa"**.

Moreover, the issue of misaligned mental models, often described as the gulf between VUI capabilities and user expectations, remains a key topic of ongoing research in the HCI community. One of the most pertinent approaches to studying this gulf is through the "Mutual Theory of Mind" (MToM) Framework **Fischer et al., "Mutual Theory of Mind: A New Framework for Understanding User-Centered Design"**.

In this paper, we take this idea further and propose designing conversational interfaces that adapt their presentational metaphor based on conversational contexts to ensure that the interface is aligned with the users' mental models.
