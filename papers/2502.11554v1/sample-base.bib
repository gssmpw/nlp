%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

Such metaphors, which have been relegated to the back seat in most of the cognitive science research, are the focus of attention in this study, which addresses the creation of similarity within an elaborately laid out interactive framework of cognition. Starting from the constructivist views of Nelson Goodman and Jean Piaget, this framework resolves an apparent paradox in interactionism: how can reality not have a mind-independent ontology and structure, but still manage to constrain the possible worlds a cognitive agent can create in it?  A comprehensive theory of metaphor is proposed in this framework that explains how metaphors can create similarities, and why such metaphors are an invaluable asset to cognition. The framework is then applied to related issues of analogical reasoning, induction, and computational modeling of creative metaphors.}, note={Google-Books-ID: foTrCAAAQBAJ}, publisher={Springer Science \& Business Media}, author={Indurkhya, B.}, year={2013}, month=mar, language={en} }

Metaphor, the authors explain, is a fundamental mechanism of mind, one that allows us to use what we know about our physical and social experience to provide understanding of countless other subjects. Because such metaphors structure our most basic understandings of our experience, they are “metaphors we live by”—metaphors that can shape our perceptions and actions without our ever noticing them.  In this updated edition of Lakoff and Johnson’s influential book, the authors supply an afterword surveying how their theory of metaphor has developed within the cognitive sciences to become central to the contemporary understanding of how we think and how we express our thoughts in language.}, note={Google-Books-ID: r6nOYYtxzUoC}, publisher={University of Chicago Press}, author={Lakoff, George and Johnson, Mark}, year={1980}, language={en} }

By investigating peoples use of metaphors, we can better understand their emotions, attitudes and conceptualisations, as individuals and as participants in social life. This book describes practice in the analysis of metaphor in real-world discourse. When real-world language use is taken as the site of metaphor study, researchers face methodological issues that have only recently begun to be addressed. The contributors to this volume have all had to find ways to deal with methodological issues in their own research and have developed techniques that are brought together here.

In terms of trends, findings included mixed feelings regarding no-code solutions and a desire for a separation of roles. The challenges mentioned included a lack of socio-technical tools and conversational archetypes. Finally, practitioners followed different design processes and did not use the design processes described in the academic literature. These findings were analyzed to establish links between practitioners’ insights and discussions in related literature. The goal of this analysis is to highlight research-practice gaps by synthesising five practitioner needs that are not currently being met.

By investigating a cryptocurrency chatbot (Brokerbot) that distributed information on cryptocurrency news and investments, we explored social tensions of trust between stakeholders, namely the bot’s developers, users, and the bot itself. We found that trust in Brokerbot and in the cryptocurrency ecosystem are two conjoined, but separate challenges that users and developers approached in different ways. We discuss the challenging, dual-role of a Brokerbot as an object of trust as a chatbot while simultaneously being a mediator of trust in cryptocurrency, which exposes the social-technical gap of trust.

Previous research has studied the experiences of frequent IPA users. Using qualitative methods we explore the experience of infrequent users: people who have tried IPAs, but choose not to use them regularly. Unsurprisingly infrequent users share some of the experiences of frequent users, e.g. frustration at limitations on fully hands-free interaction. Significant points of contrast and previously unidentified concerns also emerge. Cultural norms and social embarrassment take on added significance for infrequent users. Humanness of IPAs sparked comparisons with human assistants, juxtaposing their limitations. Most importantly, significant concerns emerged around privacy, monetization, data permanency and transparency. Drawing on these findings we discuss key challenges, including: designing for interruptability; reconsideration of the human metaphor; issues of trust and data ownership. Addressing these challenges may lead to more widespread IPA use.},

In this paper, we study one of the most common tools in the designer’s toolkit: conceptual metaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler, or an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our experience of the AI agent? Sampling a set of metaphors along the dimensions of warmth and competence---defined by psychological theories as the primary axes of variation for human social perception---we perform a study $(N=260)$ where we manipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational agent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their intention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the agent’s usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high competence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that signal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors that signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low competence agents featuring identical, human-level performance and the wizards being blind to condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly as competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess effects of metaphor choices on potential users’ desire to try out the system and find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and warmth. These results suggest that projecting competence may help attract new users, but those users may discard the agent unless it can quickly correct with a lower competence metaphor. We close with a retrospective analysis that finds similar patterns between metaphors and user attitudes towards past conversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.}, number={CSCW2}, journal={Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction}, author={Khadpe, Pranav and Krishna, Ranjay and Fei-Fei, Li and Hancock, Jeffrey T. and Bernstein, Michael S.}, year={2020}, month=oct, pages={1–26}, language={en} }

In this Wizard of Oz experiment, 34 middle-aged (50 to 64 years old) and 24 older adults (65 to 80 years old) participated in a user study at a simulated home, interacting with a VA using either formal or informal language. Older adults with higher agreeableness perceived VA as being more likeable than middle-aged adults. Middle-aged adults showed similar technology acceptance toward the informal and formal VA, and older adults preferred using informal VA, especially those with low agreeableness. Further, while both middle-aged and older adults frequently anthropomorphized VAs by using human metaphors for them, older adults compared formal VA with professionals (e.g., librarians, teachers) and informal VA with their close ones (e.g., spouses, relatives). Overall, the conversational style showed differential effects on the perceptions of middle-aged and older adults, suggesting personalized design implications.}, note={arXiv:2309.11681 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2309.11681}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Chin, Jessie and Desai, Smit and Lin, Sheny and Mejia, Shannon}, year={2023}, month=sep }

While these devices make the reproductive labor of the household legible as labor, we interrogate their quasi-emancipatory promise. We argue that devices such as Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home elide and reproduce the gendered and racialized dimensions of domestic labor, streamline this labor for capture by capital, and heighten the very affective dynamics they promise to ameliorate. Only critical political theories of work can illuminate the unfulfilled transformations and ongoing dominations of gender, race, and affect that saturate labor with domestic AI – expressed, we contend, by re-articulating the framework of the “social factory” to that of the “social server.”}, number={2}, journal={New Political Science}, publisher={Routledge}, author={Schiller, Amy and McMahon, John}, year={2019}, month=apr, pages={173–191} }

We focus less on the well-established idea of metaphors as a way for interface designers to help novice users learn how to interact with novel technology, and more on other ways metaphors can be used. We find that metaphors people use are contextually fluid, can change with the mode of conversation, and can reveal differences in how people perceive VUIs compared to other devices. Not all metaphors are helpful, and some may be offensive. Analyzing this broader class of metaphors can help understand, perhaps even predict problems.

Yet it is unknown how users categorize these devices: are they thought of as just another object, like a toaster? As a social companion? Though past work hints to human-like attributes that are ported onto these devices, the anthropomorphization of voice assistants has not been studied in depth. Through a study deploying Amazon Echo Dot Devices in the homes of older adults, we provide a preliminary assessment of how individuals 1) perceive having social interactions with the voice agent, and 2) ontologically categorize the voice assistants. Our discussion contributes to an understanding of how well-developed theories of anthropomorphism apply to voice assistants, such as how the socioemotional context of the user (e.g., loneliness) drives increased anthropomorphism. We conclude with recommendations for designing voice assistants with the ontological category in mind, as well as implications for the design of technologies for social companionship for older adults.}, number={CSCW}, journal={Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction}, author={Pradhan, Alisha and Findlater, Leah and Lazar, Amanda}, year={2019}, month=nov, pages={1–21}, language={en} }

Since the effectiveness of interactions strongly depends on users’ perception of agents, it is crucial to design agents’ behaviors to provide the intended user perceptions. Research on human-agent and human-human communication suggests that speech specifics are associated with perceptions of communicating parties, but there is a lack of systematic understanding of how speech specifics of agents affect users’ perceptions. To address this gap, we present a framework outlining the relationships between elements of agents’ conversation architecture (dialog strategy, content affectiveness, content style and speech format) and aspects of users’ perception (interaction, ability, sociability and humanness). Synthesized based on literature reviewed from the domains of HCI, NLP and linguistics (n=57), this framework demonstrates both the identified relationships and the areas lacking empirical evidence.

In order to understand the relationship between trust in computerized systems and the use of those systems, we need to be able to effectively measure trust. Although questionnaires regarding trust have been used in prior studies, these questionnaires were theoretically rather than empirically generated and did not distinguish between 3 potentially different types of trust: human–human trust, human–machine trust, and trust in general. A 3-phased experiment, comprising a word elicitation study, a questionnaire study, and a paired comparison study, was performed to better understand similarities and differences in the concepts of trust and distrust, and among the different types of trust. Results indicated that trust and distrust can be considered opposites, rather than different concepts. Components of trust, in terms of words related to trust, were similar across the three types of trust. Results obtained from a cluster analysis were used to identify 12 potential factors of trust between people and automated systems. These 12 factors were then used to develop a proposed scale to measure trust in automation.

Metaphor analysis—as conceptualized in cognitive linguistics—is proposed here as a qualitative method for psychological research for several reasons. Metaphors are culturally and socially defined, yet they also represent a basic cognitive strategy of analogical problem solving. Metaphors are context-sensitive, yet at the same time they are abstract models of reality much in the same way as mental models and schemata in cognitive psychology. The multifaceted properties of metaphors allow for the study of micro-interactions between cognition and culture in open and qualitative research designs. They also enable the bridging of the gap between quantitative-experimental and qualitative approaches in psychology. Because metaphors are of high plausibility in everyday experience, metaphors are a valuable tool for interventions in applied fields of research such as organizational and work psychology.

The doctor–patient relationship in general practice is often viewed by practitioner and patient alike as a long-term ‘personal’ relationship. Little, however, is known about how such relationships are ended in general practice.Methods. This paper uses theoretical insights obtained from the sociology and social psychology of social relationships, together with the authors’ own empirical work on the removal of patients from GPs’ lists, to develop a theoretical model of ending the doctor–patient relationship in general practice.Results. Ending the relationship involves ‘breakdown’ and ‘termination’. ‘Breakdown’ in the relationship occurs when one party decides that the other has acted in such a way as to threaten that party’s identity as a ‘good’ patient or doctor. ‘Termination’ may be patient initiated, doctor initiated or by mutual consent.Conclusions. It is proposed that further research is needed to delineate the rules and rituals governing entry into and maintenance of the doctor–patient relationship in general practice as well as those that govern its ending.}, number={5}, journal={Family Practice}, author={Stokes, Tim and Dixon-Woods, Mary and McKinley, Robert K}, year={2004}, month=oct, pages={507–514} }

Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A–3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers’ unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9). These findings make contributions to the psychology of automation and medical decision making, and suggest interventions to increase consumer acceptance of AI in medicine.}, number={4}, journal={Journal of Consumer Research}, author={Longoni, Chiara and Bonezzi, Andrea and Morewedge, Carey K}, year={2019}, month=dec, pages={629–650} }

Yet, few empirical studies investigate customers’ experience interacting with fully functional Robo-advisors in real-life scenarios. Also, it is still unknown how the design of the automated system can affect customers’ perception and adoption of this new technology. To mitigate these gaps, 24 participants with different levels of experience and understanding of financial investment were asked to use a Robo-advisor from a retail bank and perform the tasks. By conducting observations and retrospective post-test
interviews, we find that participants do not fully perceive the social aspects supposed to be provided by Robo-advisors. The overarching problems are, among others, a lack of transparency and incomprehensible information. This results in distrust of the results
generated by this system, which negatively affects customers’ adoption of the investment advice provided by the Robo-advisor. The potential of interactive data visualization is also detected. This work contributes to the understanding of customers regarding their perception and adoption based on their use of a functional Robo-advisor and proposes design takeaways for transparent and comprehensible automated advisory systems in financial service contexts.}, journal={Data and Information Management}, author={Zhu, Hui and Pysander, Eva-Lotta and Soderberg, Ingalill}, year={2023}, month=apr, pages={100041} }

We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk.

We deployed Google Home devices in the homes of twelve older adults aged 65 and above and studied their use for sixteen weeks. Results show that the benefits our participants perceived have incrementally changed from enjoying simplicity and convenience of operation in the early phase of the study to not worrying about making mistakes and building digital companionship as they got used to using it. Results also show that participants confronted several challenges that evolved from the unfamiliarity with a voice assistant in their first interactions to coping with the functional errors due to limited speech technology as they got used to using it.

Her inquiry ranges from physical and mathematical models to more familiar explanatory metaphors to the dramatic contributions of recent technological developments, especially in imaging, recombinant DNA, and computer modeling and simulations.A history of the diverse and changing nature of biological explanation in a particularly charged field, Making Sense of Life draws our attention to the temporal, disciplinary, and cultural components of what biologists mean, and what they understand, when they propose to explain life.}, publisher={Harvard University Press}, author={Keller, Evelyn Fox}, year={2003}, month=oct, language={English} }

These AI systems, equipped with an equivalent of human’s Theory of Mind (ToM) capability, are currently serving as matchmakers on dating platforms, assisting student learning as teaching assistants, and enhancing productivity as work partners. They mark a new era in human-AI interaction (HAI) that diverges from traditional human-computer interaction (HCI), where computers are commonly seen as tools instead of social actors. Designing and understanding the human perceptions and experiences in this emerging HAI era becomes an urgent and critical issue for AI systems to fulfill human needs and mitigate risks across social contexts. In this paper, we posit the Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) framework, inspired by our capability of ToM in human-human communications, to guide this new generation of HAI research by highlighting the iterative and mutual shaping nature of human-AI communication. We discuss the motivation of the MToM framework and its three key components that iteratively shape the human-AI communication in three stages.

This project aims to explore a user’s continuous interaction with LLM-based VA (LLM-VA) during a complex task. We recruited 12 participants to interact with an LLM-VA during a cooking task, selected for its complexity and the requirement for continuous interaction. We observed that users show both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, though they know that the LLM-VA can not capture those nonverbal signals. Despite the prevalence of nonverbal behavior in human-human communication, there is no established analytical methodology or framework for exploring it in human-VA interactions. After analyzing 3 hours and 39 minutes of video recordings, we developed an analytical framework with three dimensions: 1) behavior characteristics, including both verbal and nonverbal behaviors, 2) interaction stages--exploration, conflict, and integration--that illustrate the progression of user interactions, and 3) stage transition throughout the task. This analytical framework identifies key verbal and nonverbal behaviors that provide a foundation for future research and practical applications in optimizing human and LLM-VA interactions.}, note={arXiv:2408.16465 [cs]}, number={arXiv:2408.16465}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Chan, Szeyi and Fu, Shihan and Li, Jiachen and Yao, Bingsheng and Desai, Smit and Prpa, Mirjana and Wang, Dakuo}, year={2024}, month=sep }

The psychological and psychoanalytic commentary on this relationship is fragmentary and implicit. The present paper offers both clinical and empirical data which lead to the speculation that novel metaphoric language constitutes not only the contents of specific therapeutic insights but also the thematic interface on which psychotherapy procedes. A clinical demonstration is presented to illustrate the co-occurrence of a patient coming to insight while communicating with the therapist in a highly figurative manner. This is followed by an experimental study in which metaphoric language and therapeutic insight, both of which are operationally defined, were investigated. The conclusions of the empirical study validate clinical impressions. Apt novel metaphors concretize troublesome experiences and function heuristically. In doing so the patient comes to experience insight. Insight is achieved by verbalizing implicit experiences in novel figurative expressions and then by working out the implication of such communications over time.

In a recent study, personality prediction was performed using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality traits with a task-oriented human-machine dialogue using an end-to-end (neural-based) system. However, it is still not clear whether such prediction is generally possible for other types of systems and user personality traits. To clarify this, we recruited 378 participants, asked them to fill out four personality questionnaires covering 25 personality traits, and had them perform three rounds of human-machine dialogue with a pipeline task-oriented dialogue system or an end-to-end task-oriented dialogue system. We also had another 186 participants do the same with an open-domain dialogue system. We then constructed BERT-based models to predict the personality traits of the participants from the dialogues. The results showed that prediction accuracy was generally better with open-domain dialogue than with task-oriented dialogue, although Extraversion (one of the Big Five personality traits) could be predicted equally well for both open-domain dialogue and pipeline task-oriented dialogue. We also examined the effect of utilizing different types of dialogue on personality prediction by conducting a cross-comparison of the models trained from the task-oriented and open-domain dialogues. As a result, we clarified that the open-domain dialogue cannot be used to predict personality traits from task-oriented dialogue, and vice versa. We further analyzed the effects of system utterances, task performance, and the round of dialogue with regard to the prediction accuracy.}, number={1}, journal={Scientific Reports}, author={Guo, Ao and Hirai, Ryu and Ohashi, Atsumoto and Chiba, Yuya and Tsunomori, Yuiko and Higashinaka, Ryuichiro}, year={2024}, month=feb, pages={3868}, language={eng} }

Following Stivers and Robinson’s work on progressivity, we find our data shows: how non-answer responses impede progress; how accounts offered for non-answer responses can lead to recovery; how participants work to receive answers; and how, ultimately, moving the interaction forwards does not necessarily involve a fitted answer, but other kinds of responses as well. We discuss the wider potential of applying progressivity to evaluate and understand voice interactions, and consider what designers of voice experiences might do to design for progressivity.

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs’ role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults’ conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers’ efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs’ capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.}, number={2}, journal={Proc. ACM Interact. Mob.

And those who reach 60 years of age can expect to live longer than ever before. When combined with marked falls in fertility rates, these increases in life expectancy are leading to the rapid ageing of populations around the world. These changes are dramatic, and they have profound implications for each of us as individuals, as well as for society more broadly.  Longer lives present many opportunities, and the article by Fried (2016) in this supplement makes a strong case that appropriate social investment can create a “third demographic dividend” for society. Yet, the extent of the opportunities that arise from increased longevity will depend heavily on one key factor: health. If people are experiencing these extra years of life with good physical and mental capacity, and if they live in enabling environments, their ability to do the things they value may have few limits. If these added years are instead dominated by declines in capacity and disabling environments, the implications for older people and for society are much more negative.

This, in turn, means that there are no absolute measures of usability, since, if the usability of an artefact is defined by the context in which that artefact is used, measures of usability must of necessity be defined by that context too. Despite this, there is a need for broad general measures which can be used to compare usability across a range of contexts. In addition, there is a need for “quick and dirty” methods to allow low cost assessments of usability in industrial systems evaluation.

Metaphoric comparisons and interface presentations do more than render static denotative correspondences. They have motivational and affective consequences for users. They interact with and frame users’ problem-solving efforts in learning about the target domain. Metaphors have been employed to increase the initial familiarity of the target domain, but they have an inevitable further role to play.

Measuring task and interaction was common, as was using self-report questionnaires to measure concepts like usability and user attitudes. A thematic analysis of the research found that speech HCI work focuses on nine key topics: system speech production, design insight, modality comparison, experiences with interactive voice response systems, assistive technology and accessibility, user speech production, using speech technology for development, peoples’ experiences with intelligent personal assistants and how user memory affects speech interface interaction. From these insights we identify gaps and challenges in speech research, notably taking into account technological advancements, the need to develop theories of speech interface interaction, grow critical mass in this domain, increase design work and expand research from single to multiple user interaction contexts so as to reflect current use contexts. We also highlight the need to improve measure reliability, validity and consistency, in the wild deployment and reduce barriers to building fully functional speech interfaces for research.Most papers focused on usability/theory-based or wider system experience research with a focus on Wizard of Oz and developed systemsQuestionnaires on usability and user attitudes often used but few were reliable or validatedThematic analysis showed nine primary research topicsChallenges identified in theoretical approaches and design guidelines, engaging with technological advances, multiple user and in the wild contexts, critical research mass and barriers to building speech interfaces}, number={4}, journal={Interacting with Computers}, author={Clark, Leigh and Doyle, Philip and Garaialde, Diego and Gilmartin, Emer and Schlögl, Stephan and Edlund, Jens and Aylett, Matthew and Cabral, João and Munteanu, Cosmin and Edwards, Justin and R Cowan, Benjamin}, year={2019}, month=jun, pages={349–371} }

 @book{Cooper_Saffo_1999, address={USA}, title={The  Inmates Are Running the Asylum}, ISBN={978-0-672-31649-4}, abstractNote={From the Publisher: Why are VCRs impossible to program Why do car alarms make us all crazy at all the wrong times Why do our computers reprimand us when they screw up All of these computerized devices are wildly sophisticated and powerful, and they have proliferated our desks, our cars, our homes and our offices. So why are they still so dauntingly complicated to use The highly renowned Alan Cooper, “The Father of Visual Basic,” tackles this issue head-on with his new book, The Inmates are Running the Asylum, from Sams Publishing. Cooper believes that powerful and pleasurable software-based products can be created by the simple expedient of designing computer-based products first and then building them. Designing interactive software-based products is a specialty that is as demanding as the construction of these same products, Cooper says. Ironically, building computerized products isn’t difficult, they only seem so because our process for making them is out of date. To compound the problem, the costs of badly designed software are incalculable, robbing us of time, customer loyalty, competitive advantage and opportunity. The Inmates are Running the Asylum also addresses the societal dangers of what Cooper calls “software apartheid,” where otherwise normal people are kept from entering the job market and participating in society because they cannot use computers effectively. While social activists are working hard to break down race and class barriers, technologies are hard at work inadvertently erecting new, bigger ones. “By purposefully designing software-based products to be more human and forgiving, we can automatically make them more inclusive, more class- and color-blind,” Cooper writes. Using examples from his own work with companies of all sizes, Cooper offers a provocative, insightful and entertaining explanation for this phenomenon. He believes that in part, the problem lies in the fact that business executives in the high-tech industry have relinquished their control to the engineers and techies. In the rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, responsibility has been abandoned, and “the inmates have been allowed to run the asylum.” The solution, Cooper says, is to harness those talents to create products that will both thrill their users and grow the bottom line. The book is written for two new archetypes emerging in contemporary business: “The technology-savvy businessperson,” who knows that his success depends on the quality of the information available to him and the sophistication with which he uses it; and “the business-savvy technologist,” an entrepreneurial engineer or scientist with a keen business sense and an awareness of the power of information. About the Author: Alan Cooper is the “Father of Visual Basic,” according to Mitch Waite, founder of Waite Group Press. In 1994, Bill Gates gave him the rare and coveted Windows Pioneer Award--recognizing how his part in the invention of VB contributed to the success of Microsoft Windows. Cooper’s influential book, About Face: The Essentials of User Interface Design (IDG Books) has sold over 40,000 since August of 1995. His title continues to sell about 300-400 copies a month. He now leads Cooper Interaction Design, a consulting firm that has created breakthrough interactive product designs for IBM, Sony, Logitech and several Internet/intranet start-ups. For twenty years Alan Cooper designed and developed consumer software products including SuperProject, MicroPhone II for Windows, and Microsoft’s visual programming user interface for Visual Basic. Cooper is a member of the Corporate Design Foundation and American Center for Design. He is a former director of the Association for software Designs Silicon Valley Chapter and a member of the national organization’s Board of Directors.

Unsurprisingly infrequent users share some of the experiences of frequent users, e.g. frustration at limitations on fully hands-free interaction. Significant points of contrast and previously unidentified concerns also emerge. Cultural norms and social embarrassment take on added significance for infrequent users. Humanness of IPAs sparked comparisons with human assistants, juxtaposing their limitations. Most importantly, significant concerns emerged around privacy, monetization, data permanency and transparency. Drawing on these findings we discuss key challenges, including: designing for interruptability; reconsideration of the human metaphor; issues of trust and data ownership.

Successful anthropomorphic agents must have appropriate computer etiquette and nonverbal communication patterns. Because there are differences in etiquette, tone, formality, and colloquialisms across different user populations, it is unlikely that a generic anthropomorphic agent would be universally appealing. Additionally, because anthropomorphic characters are depicted as capable of human reasoning and possessing human motivations, users may ascribe undue trust in these agents. Trust is a complex construct that exerts an important role in a user’s interactions with an interface or system. Feelings and perceptions about an anthropomorphic agent may impact the construction of a mental model about a system, which may lead to inappropriate calibrations of automation trust that is based on an emotional connection with the anthropomorphic agent rather than on actual system performance.}, number={3}, journal={Computers in Human Behavior}, author={Culley, Kimberly E. and Madhavan, Poornima}, year={2013}, month=may, pages={577–579} }

The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual’s behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver’s works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians, the conversational agent gives weighting to user’s adherence, based on prior defined conditions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users.
RESULTS: We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet, and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition, we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social, yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences; (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities; (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals’ daily messaging routine; and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component.
FUTURE WORK: Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users’ interaction data and integrating users’ dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g., machine learning). We will integrate a sentiment analysis capability to gather further data about individuals and report these data to the caregiver.}, number={1}, journal={Methods of Information in Medicine}, author={Fadhil, Ahmed and Wang, Yunlong and Reiterer, Harald}, year={2019}, month=jun, pages={9–23}, language={eng} }

On the basis of stereotypes’ intergroup functions, the stereotype content model hypothesizes that (1) 2 primary dimensions are competence and warmth, (2) frequent mixed clusters combine high warmth with low competence (paternalistic) or high competence with low warmth (envious), and (3) distinct emotions (pity, envy, admiration, contempt) differentiate the 4 competence-warmth combinations. Stereotypically, (4) status predicts high competence, and competition predicts low warmth. Nine varied samples rated gender, ethnicity, race, class, age, and disability out-groups. Contrary to antipathy models, 2 dimensions mattered, and many stereotypes were mixed, either pitying (low competence, high warmth subordinates) or envying (high competence, low warmth competitors). Stereotypically, status predicted competence, and competition predicted low warmth.

We explore the importance of task complexity in our second experiment.

One is that the key question to answer is “What is a concept?” This means understanding how concepts overlap and trigger one another, how their fluid boundaries come about, how they give rise to generalizations and analogies, and so on. The 2nd idea is that mental activity is fundamentally parallel, with many tiny agents independently carrying out small “subcognitive” acts and collectively building up coherent mental structures.  With these intuitions as guides, Hofstadter and the members of the Fluid Analogies Research Group have developed computer models [of these processes].

Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 depressed elderly persons who suffer from physical health problems. A hermeneutic analysis was performed, yielding one main theme, living with stigma, and three themes: longing to be taken seriously, being uncertain about whether the pain is physical or mental, and a sense of living in a war zone. The second theme comprised two subthemes, feeling like a stranger and feeling dizzy, while the third had one subtheme: afraid of being helpless and dependent on others. Stigma deprives individuals of their dignity and reinforces destructive patterns of isolation and hopelessness. Nurses should provide information in a sensitive way and try to avoid diagnostic overshadowing. Effective training programmes and procedures need to be developed with more focus on how to handle depressive ill health and physical problems in older people.}, journal={Nursing Research and Practice}, publisher={Hindawi}, author={Holm, Anne Lise and Lyberg, Anne and Severinsson, Elisabeth}, year={2014}, month=jun, pages={e527920}, language={en} }

Objective evaluation techniques are fairly well established, but previous subjective techniques have been unstructured and unproven. This paper reports on the first stage in the development of a questionnaire measure for the Subjective Assessment of Speech System Interfaces (SASSI). The aim of the research programme is to produce a valid, reliable and sensitive measure of users’ subjective experiences with speech recognition systems. Such a technique could make an important contribution to theory and practice in the design and evaluation of speech recognition systems according to best human factors practice. A prototype questionnaire was designed, based on established measures for evaluating the usability of other kinds of user interface, and on a review of the research literature into speech system design. This consisted of 50 statements with which respondents rated their level of agreement. The questionnaire was given to users of four different speech applications, and Exploratory Factor Analysis of 214 completed questionnaires was conducted. This suggested the presence of six main factors in users’ perceptions of speech systems: System Response Accuracy, Likeability, Cognitive Demand, Annoyance, Habitability and Speed. The six factors have face validity, and a reasonable level of statistical reliability. The findings form a useful theoretical and practical basis for the subjective evaluation of any speech recognition interface. However, further work is recommended, to establish the validity and sensitivity of the approach, before a final tool can be produced which warrants general use.}, number={3–4}, journal={Natural Language Engineering}, author={Hone, Kate S. and Graham, Robert}, year={2000}, month=sep, pages={287–303} }
 @book{Hutchins_1987, title={Metaphors for Interface Design}, url={https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA182248}, abstractNote={Computer system designers and computer users frequently utilize metaphors as organizing structures for dealing with the complexity of behavior of humancomputer interfaces. This paper considers four metaphors concerning the mode of interaction between user and machine the conversation metaphor, the declaration metphor, the model world metaphor and the collaborative manipulation metaphor. It is argued that the key to the functional properties of an interface lie in the reference relations between the expressions in the interface language and the things to which the expressions refer. The ways in which such metaphors are suggested by advances in IO technology and the ways they constrain the possibilities we see in technology are discussed. Each of the metaphors discussed promotes a particular type of reference relation. Furthermore, because the computer is a medium in which types of reference relations that are not possible in ordinary language can be realized, the space of interface metaphors is quite likely much larger than we presently imagine it to be.

 @book{Johnson-Laird_1983, title={Mental models : towards a cognitive science of language, inference, and consciousness}, url={https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00702919}, abstractNote={Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind’s effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird’s theory of consciousness: the mind’s necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram’s classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation.

My reasons for those choices would, furthermore, have been very nearly the same as his, for we share numerous concerns and convictions. But, as I moved away from the starting point that body of literature provides, I would quite early have turned in a direction different from Boyd’s, following a path that would have brought me quickly to a central metaphorlike process in science, one which he passes by. That path I shall have to sketch, if sense is to be made of my reactions to Boyd’s proposals, and my remarks will therefore take the form of an excessively condensed epitome of parts of a position of my own, comments on Boyd’s paper emerging along the way. That format seems all the more essential inasmuch as detailed analysis of individual points presented by Boyd is not likely to make sense to an audience largely ignorant of the causal theory of reference.Boyd begins by accepting Black’s “interaction” view of metaphor.

We studied people’s reasons for and against adopting smart speakers, their privacy perceptions and concerns, and their privacy-seeking behaviors around smart speakers. We conducted a diary study and interviews with seventeen smart speaker users and interviews with seventeen non-users. We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside. Users trade privacy for convenience with different levels of deliberation and privacy resignation. Privacy tensions arise between primary, secondary, and incidental users of smart speakers. Finally, current smart speaker privacy controls are rarely used, as they are not well-aligned with users’ needs.

Consumers are reluctant to utilize healthcare provided by AI in real and hypothetical choices, separate and joint evaluations. Consumers are less likely to utilize healthcare (study 1), exhibit lower reservation prices for healthcare (study 2), are less sensitive to differences in provider performance (studies 3A–3C), and derive negative utility if a provider is automated rather than human (study 4). Uniqueness neglect, a concern that AI providers are less able than human providers to account for consumers’ unique characteristics and circumstances, drives consumer resistance to medical AI. Indeed, resistance to medical AI is stronger for consumers who perceive themselves to be more unique (study 5). Uniqueness neglect mediates resistance to medical AI (study 6), and is eliminated when AI provides care (a) that is framed as personalized (study 7), (b) to consumers other than the self (study 8), or (c) that only supports, rather than replaces, a decision made by a human healthcare provider (study 9).

The first set of studies illustrates how individuals overuse human social categories, applying gender stereotypes to computers and ethnically identifying with computer agents. The second set demonstrates thatpeople exhibit overlearned social behaviors such as politeness and reciprocity toward computers. In the third set of studies, premature cognitive commitments are demonstrated: A specialist television set is perceived as providing better content than a generalist television set. A final series of studies demonstrates the depth of social responses with respect to computer ‘personality.’ Alternative explanations for these findings, such asanthropomorphism and intentional social responses, cannot explain the results.

Yet far from a distant technology of the future, the true power of AI lies in its subtle revolution of ordinary life. From voice assistants like Siri to natural language processors, AI technologies use cultural biases and modern psychology to fit specific characteristics of how users perceive and navigate the external world, thereby projecting the illusion of intelligence. Integrating media studies, science and technology studies, and social psychology, Deceitful Media examines the rise of artificial intelligence throughout history and exposes the very human fallacies behind this technology. Focusing specifically on communicative AIs, Natale argues that what we call “AI” is not a form of intelligence but rather a reflection of the human user. Using the term “banal deception,” he reveals that deception forms the basis of all human-computer interactions rooted in AI technologies, as technologies like voice assistants utilize the dynamics of projection and stereotyping as a means for aligning with our existing habits and social conventions. By exploiting the human instinct to connect, AI reveals our collective vulnerabilities to deception, showing that what machines are primarily changing is not other technology but ourselves as humans.  Deceitful Media illustrates how AI has continued a tradition of technologies that mobilize our liability to deception and shows that only by better understanding our vulnerabilities to deception can we become more sophisticated consumers of interactive media.}, publisher={Oxford University Press}, author={Natale, Simone}, year={2021}, month=mar }

Such a framework is called a user interface metaphor. The extensive use of metaphors has had a dramatic impact on user interface design practices. Metaphors allow the transference or mapping of knowledge from a source domain to a target domain, enabling humans to use specific prior knowledge and experience for understanding and behaving in situations that are novel or unfamiliar. Through this process, one’s knowledge in the target domain is enriched by borrowing existing representations from the source domain. The fact that the associations between the source and target are hidden is the essence of metaphor. The user interface of the computer is the target domain for interface metaphors. Interface metaphors help establish user expectations and encourage predictions about system behavior. A good example is the desktop metaphor. This metaphor portrays the operating system of the computer as similar to objects, tasks, and behaviors found in physical office environments. The desktop metaphor is actually a composite of many metaphors. Most systems have a global metaphor to provide the basis of interaction that is supported by many auxiliary metaphors. This chapter presents a variety of examples that illustrate the use of metaphor. The chapter reviews classifications of interface metaphor types. Mismatches between source and target domains and the circumstances that create them are also described in the chapter. This chapter discusses the role that metaphors have in communicating the designer’s model, structuring users’ models of the interface, and their impact on the human-machine communication process.}, booktitle={Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction (Second Edition)}, publisher={North-Holland}, author={Neale, Dennis C. and Carroll, John M.}, editor={Helander, Marting G. and Landauer, Thomas K. and Prabhu, Prasad V.}, year={1997}, month=jan, pages={441–462}, language={en} }

The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more effective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and verified a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF).

Two readings of Turing’s rules for the test have been given.

The present work offers a study of Turing’s rules for the test in the context of his advocated purpose and his other texts. The conclusion is that there are several independent and mutually reinforcing lines of evidence that support the standard reading, while fitting the literal reading in Turing’s work faces severe interpretative difficulties.

However, this calls for technological solutions that suit their specific needs and capabilities. The Sweet-Home project aims at developing a new user friendly technology for home automation based on voice command. This paper reports a user evaluation assessing the acceptance and fear of this new technology. Eight healthy persons between 71 and 88 years old, 7 relatives (child, grandchild or friend) and 3 professional carers participated in a user evaluation. During about 45 min, the persons were questioned in co-discovery in the Domus smart home alternating between interview and wizard of Oz periods followed by a debriefing. The experience aimed at testing four important aspects of the project: voice command, communication with the outside world, domotics system interrupting a person’s activity, and electronic agenda. Voice interface appeared to have a great potential to ease daily living for elderly and frail persons and would be better accepted than more intrusive solutions. By considering still healthy and independent elderly people in the user evaluation, an interesting finding that came up is their overall acceptance provided the system does not drive them to a lazy lifestyle by taking control of everything. This particular fear must be addressed for the development of smart homes that support daily living by giving them more ability to control rather than putting them away from the daily routine. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.}, number={1}, journal={Personal and Ubiquitous Computing}, author={Portet, F. and Vacher, M. and Golanski, C. and Roux, C. and Meillon, B.}, year={2013}, pages={127–144} }

While some types of usage dropped over the 3-week period (e.g., playing music), we observed consistent usage for finding online information. Given that much of this information was health-related, this finding emphasizes the need to revisit concerns about credibility of information with this new interaction medium. Although features to support memory (e.g., setting timers, reminders) were initially perceived as useful, the actual usage was unexpectedly low due to reliability concerns.

A great deal of research to date has focused on enhancing traits that make CAs more humanlike. However, few studies have examined the influence such traits have on information disclosure. This research builds on self-disclosure, social desirability, and social presence theories to explain how CA anthropomorphism affects disclosure of personally sensitive information. Taken together, these theories suggest that as CAs become more humanlike, the social desirability of user responses will increase. In this study, we use a laboratory experiment to examine the influence of two elements of CA design—conversational relevance and embodiment—on the answers people give in response to sensitive and non-sensitive questions. We compare the responses given to various CAs to those given in a face-to-face interview and an online survey. The results show that for sensitive questions, CAs with better conversational abilities elicit more socially desirable responses from participants, with a less significant effect found for embodiment. These results suggest that for applications where eliciting honest answers to sensitive questions is important, CAs that are “better” in terms of humanlike realism may not be better for eliciting truthful responses to sensitive questions.}, journal={Decision Support Systems}, author={Schuetzler, Ryan M. and Giboney, Justin Scott and Grimes, G.

We begin by delineating the general assumptions of social constructionism. Next we document the importance of reflexivity, second—order constructionism, and discourse to the social constructionist, together with the growing relevance of post—modernist/structuralist arguments that variously advance resistance to discursive closure. Cumulatively, our delineations highlight the need for specific analytic methods capable of addressing the discursive construction of conceptual and theoretical orders. We then argue that with some reconfiguration metaphor analysis can be advanced as one such analytic method. We then reconfigure metaphor analysis to produce SCMA and in the latter half of the article, apply it to a body of organizational socialization texts. Our application demonstrates both the general utility of SCMA as a discourse analytic method as well as specific ways in which organizational socialization has been socio—symbolically constructed.

RESULTS: Ending the relationship involves “breakdown” and “termination”. “Breakdown” in the relationship occurs when one party decides that the other has acted in such a way as to threaten that party’s identity as a “good” patient or doctor. “Termination” may be patient initiated, doctor initiated or by mutual consent.
CONCLUSIONS: It is proposed that further research is needed to delineate the rules and rituals governing entry into and maintenance of the doctor-patient relationship in general practice as well as those that govern its ending.}, number={5}, journal={Family Practice}, author={Stokes, Tim and Dixon-Woods, Mary and McKinley, Robert K.}, year={2004}, month=oct, pages={507–514}, language={eng} }

We draw on the field of sociophonetics - the study of the social factors that influence the production and perception of speech - to highlight how current VUIs are based on a limited and homogenised set of voice outputs. We argue that current systems do not adequately consider the diversity of peoples’ speech, how that diversity represents sociocultural identities, and how voices have the potential to shape user perceptions and experiences. Ultimately, as other technological developments have influenced the ideologies of language, the voice outputs of VUIs will influence the ideologies of speech. Based on our argument, we pose three design strategies for VUI voice output design - individualisation, context awareness, and diversification - to motivate new ways of conceptualising and designing these technologies.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Sutton, Selina Jeanne and Foulkes, Paul and Kirk, David and Lawson, Shaun}, year={2019}, month=may, pages={1–14}, collection={CHI ’19} }

These myths are widespread among computer scientists, engineers and programmers, as well as among the general public and even older individuals themselves. We can define these myths as follows. (1) Just wait and see. Future generations of older people will use computers without problems. This myth differs from those following, as it may lead to a (dangerous) conclusion of avoidance and inactivity by integrating myths 2-6. If the other myths are accepted as being true and one assumes that the problems will eventually solve themselves, it might not seem worthwhile to expend any effort on “universal design” for older people’s use of information and communication technology (ICT). However, we argue that if we do not actively and properly counteract these myths, we will perpetuate them and their grave consequences. (2) Older people are not interested in using computers. They are unaware of computer capabilities. (3) Older people consider computers as useless and unnecessary. (4) Older people lack the physical capabilities to use ICT. (5) Older people simply cannot understand interactive computing technology. (6) You can’t teach an old dog new tricks. The problem of HCI for older people is that they do not learn to use new technologies and interaction techniques. In discussing these myths, we demonstrate that each one contains a grain of truth. However, the myths are improperly overgeneralized and, therefore, often wrong. Such myths are problematic. Designers and engineers often accept them as truths and neglect older users and/or apply information and communication technologies in an age-discriminating manner. Furthermore, the myths are problematic as they lead older people to avoid computer usage (i.e. a self-fulfilling prophecy). We present evidence to support the notion that these myths may often be largely - although not completely - wrong. We then demonstrate how they can be counteracted through user-centered design, training and instruction.}, number={6}, journal={Gerontology}, author={Wandke, Hartmut and Sengpiel, Michael and Sönksen, Malte}, year={2012}, pages={564–570}, language={eng} }

We posit Mutual Theory of Mind as a theoretical framework to design for natural long-term human-AI interactions. From this perspective, we explore a community’s perception of a question-answering conversational agent through self-reported surveys and computational linguistic approach in the context of online education. We first examine long-term temporal changes in students’ perception of Jill Watson (JW), a virtual teaching assistant deployed in an online class discussion forum. We then explore the feasibility of inferring students’ perceptions of JW through linguistic features extracted from student-JW dialogues. We find that students’ perception of JW’s anthropomorphism and intelligence changed significantly over time. Regression analyses reveal that linguistic verbosity, readability, sentiment, diversity, and adaptability reflect student perception of JW. We discuss implications for building adaptive community-facing conversational agents as long-term companions and designing towards Mutual Theory of Mind in human-AI interaction.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Wang, Qiaosi and Saha, Koustuv and Gregori, Eric and Joyner, David and Goel, Ashok}, year={2021}, month=may, pages={1–14}, collection={CHI ’21} }

Most older adults prefer to age in place, and technologies, including Internet of things (IoT), Ambient/Active Assisted Living (AAL) robots and other artificial intelligence (AI), can support independent living. However, a top-down design process creates mismatches between technologies and older adults&rsquo; needs. A user-centered design approach was used to identify older adults&rsquo; perspectives regarding AAL and AI technologies and gauge interest in participating in a co-design process. A survey was used to obtain demographic characteristics and assess privacy perspectives. A convenience sample of 31 retirement community residents participated in one of two 90-min focus group sessions. The semi-structured group interview solicited barriers and facilitators to technology adoption, privacy attitudes, and interest in project co-design participation to inform technology development. Focus group sessions were audiotaped and professionally transcribed. Transcripts were reviewed and coded to identify themes and patterns. Descriptive statistics were applied to the quantitative data. Identified barriers to technology use included low technology literacy, including lack of familiarity with terminology, and physical challenges, which can make adoption difficult. Facilitators included an eagerness to learn, interest in co-design, and a desire to understand and control their data. Most participants identified as privacy pragmatics and fundamentalists, indicating that privacy is important to older adults. At the same time, they also reported a willingness to contribute to the design of technologies that would facilitate aging independently. There is a need to increase technology literacy of older adults along with aging literacy of technologists.}, number={22}, journal={Healthcare}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Wang, Shengzhi and Bolling, Khalisa and Mao, Wenlin and Reichstadt, Jennifer and Jeste, Dilip and Kim, Ho-Cheol and Nebeker, Camille}, year={2019}, month=jun, pages={60}, language={en} }

Since the effectiveness of interactions strongly depends on users’ perception of agents, it is crucial to design agents’ behaviors to provide the intended user perceptions. Research on human-agent and human-human communication suggests that speech specifics are associated with perceptions of communicating parties, but there is a lack of systematic understanding of how speech specifics of agents affect users’ perceptions. To address this gap, we present a framework outlining the relationships between elements of agents’ conversation architecture (dialog strategy, content affectiveness, content style and speech format) and aspects of users’ perception (interaction, ability, sociability and humanness). Synthesized based on literature reviewed from the domains of HCI, NLP and linguistics (n=57), this framework demonstrates both the identified relationships and the areas lacking empirical evidence. We discuss the implications of the framework for conversation design and highlight the inconsistencies with terminology and measurements.

Yet, this approach can sometimes misalign user trust and reinforce societal stereotypes, leading to socio-technical challenges that might impede long-term engagement. This paper explores an alternative approach to navigate these challenges—incorporating non-human metaphors in VUI design. We report on a study with 240 participants examining the effects of human versus non-human metaphors on user perceptions within health and finance domains. Results indicate a preference for the human metaphor (doctor) over the non-human (health encyclopedia) in health contexts for its perceived enjoyability and likeability. In finance, however, user perceptions do not significantly differ between human (financial advisor) and non-human (calculator) metaphors. Importantly, our research reveals that the explicit awareness of a metaphor’s use influences adoption intentions, with a marked preference for non-human metaphors when their metaphorical nature is not disclosed. These findings highlight context-specific conversation design strategies required in integrating non-human metaphors into VUI design, suggesting tradeoffs and design considerations that could enhance user engagement and adoption.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 6th ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Desai, Smit and Dubiel, Mateusz and Leiva, Luis A.}, year={2024}, month=jul, pages={1–15}, collection={CUI ’24} }

Yet, few empirical studies investigate customers’ experience interacting with fully functional Robo-advisors in real-life scenarios. Also, it is still unknown how the design of the automated system can affect customers’ perception and adoption of this new technology. To mitigate these gaps, 24 participants with different levels of experience and understanding of financial investment were asked to use a Robo-advisor from a retail bank and perform the tasks. By conducting observations and retrospective post-test interviews, we find that participants do not fully perceive the social aspects supposed to be provided by Robo-advisors. The overarching problems are, among others, a lack of transparency and incomprehensible information. This results in distrust of the results generated by this system, which negatively affects customers’ adoption of the investment advice provided by the Robo-advisor. The potential of interactive data visualization is also detected. This work contributes to the understanding of customers regarding their perception and adoption based on their use of a functional Robo-advisor and proposes design takeaways for transparent and comprehensible automated advisory systems in financial service contexts.}, number={3}, journal={Data and Information Management}, author={Zhu, Hui and Sallnäs Pysander, Eva-Lotta and Söderberg, Inga-Lill}, year={2023}, month=sep, pages={100041}, collection={Special Issue on Human-AI Interaction} }
