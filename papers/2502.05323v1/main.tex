%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in sub-Saharan Africa face unique barriers to contraceptive access and lack AGYW-centered contraceptive decision-support resources. To empower AGYW to make informed choices and improve reproductive health outcomes, we developed a tablet-based application to provide contraceptive education and decision-making support in the pharmacy setting - a key source of contraceptive services for AGYW - in Kenya. We conducted workshops with AGYW and pharmacy providers in Kenya to gather app feedback and understand how to integrate the intervention into the pharmacy setting. Our analysis highlights how intermediated interactions - a multiuser, cooperative effort to enable technology use and information access - could inform a successful contraceptive intervention in Kenya. The potential strengths of intermediation in our setting inform implications for technological health interventions in intermediated scenarios in \lrem{LMICs}\ladd{low- and middle-income countries}, including challenges and opportunities for extending impact to different populations and integrating technology into resource-constrained healthcare settings.

% If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of

% To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's

% desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
% Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
% instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
% in the printed output of this document.

%     \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}

% Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
% use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
% recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
% more easily.
