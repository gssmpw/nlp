\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have proposed \coolname, a framework that uses MLLMs to enhance ADSs by generating intelligent driving strategy repairs. \coolname identifies critical moments in driving scenarios and generates prompts to ensure MLLMs produce valid suggestions in a DSL, $\mu$Drive, for direct application in an ADS.
Experimental results show that \coolname improves ADS performance in various challenging scenarios, providing efficient and cost-effective driving suggestions. 
This framework represents a step towards bridging the gap between human expertise and automated driving technology, enhancing the adaptability and reliability of AVs.
