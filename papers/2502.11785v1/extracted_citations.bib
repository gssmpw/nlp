This chapter discusses the proof theory, expressivity, and complexity of a number of the well-known hybrid logics and provides a snapshot of the logical territory lying between the basic modal languages and their classical companions. Standard modal logics use modalities for talking about the relations in relational structure. Hybrid logics are extensions of standard modal logics, involving symbols that name individual states in models. Hybrid logic arises when mechanisms for naming and asserting identity of worlds are added; to give an analogy, they are to standard modal systems what first-order languages with equality are to equality-free languages. The chapter provides an overview of the field of hybrid logic and presents a coherent picture of the current state of affairs in the field of hybrid logic. The most important techniques and results in the field, with respect to completeness, expressive power, frame definability, interpolation, and complexity are discussed. The proof systems for hybrid languages such as sequents, natural deduction, or tableaux, and some issues concerning the development of automated provers based on them are also described.}

author = {Jens Ulrik Hansen}, 
abstract = {In this paper the machinery of Hybrid Logic and the logic of public announcements are merged. In order to bring the two logics together properly the underlying hybrid logic has been changed such that nominals only partially denote states. The hybrid logic contains nominals, satisfaction operators, the downarrow binder as well as the global modality. Following this, an axiom system for the Hybrid Public Announcement Logic is presented and using reduction axioms general completeness (in the usual style of Hybrid Logic) is proved. The general completeness allows for an easy way of adding distributed knowledge. Furthermore, it turns out that distributed knowledge is definable using satisfaction operators and the downarrow binder.}

Unlike previous work on alternating temporal epistemic logic, the semantics works with systems whose states explicitly encode the strategy being used by each of the agents. This provides a natural way to express what agents would know were they to be aware of some of the strategies being used by other agents. A number of examples that rely on the ability to express an agent’s knowledge about the strategies being used by other agents are presented to motivate the framework, including reasoning about game-theoretic equilibria, knowledge-based programs, and information-theoretic computer security policies. Relationships to several variants of alternating temporal epistemic logic are discussed. The computational complexity of model checking the logic and several of its fragments are also characterized.}, journal = {ACM Trans. Comput.

 abstract = {We consider the model checking problem for Hybrid Logic. Known algorithms so far are global in the sense that they compute, inductively, in every step the set of all worlds of a Kripke structure that satisfy a subformula of the input. Hence, they always exploit the entire structure. Local model checking tries to avoid this by only traversing necessary parts of the input in order to establish or refute the satisfaction relation between a given world and a formula. We present a framework for local model checking of Hybrid Logic based on games. We show that these games are simple reachability games for ordinary Hybrid Logic and weak Büchi games for Hybrid Logic with operators interpreted over the transitive closure of the accessibility relation of the underlying Kripke frame, and show how to solve these games thus solving the local model checking problem. Since the first-order part of Hybrid Logic is inherently hard to localise in model checking, we give examples, in the end, of how global model checkers can be optimised in certain special cases using well-established techniques like fixpoint approximations and divide-and-conquer algorithms.},
