%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Graph data has become a pivotal modality due to its unique ability to model relational datasets. However, real-world graph data continues to grow exponentially, resulting in a quadratic increase in the complexity of most graph algorithms as graph sizes expand. Although graph condensation (GC) methods have been proposed to address these scalability issues, existing approaches often treat the training set as static, overlooking the evolving nature of real-world graph data. This limitation leads to inefficiencies when condensing growing training sets.
In this paper, we introduce GECC (\underline{G}raph \underline{E}volving \underline{C}lustering \underline{C}ondensation), a scalable graph condensation method designed to handle large-scale and evolving graph data. GECC employs a traceable and efficient approach by performing class-wise clustering on aggregated features. Furthermore, it can inherits previous condensation results as clustering centroids when the condensed graph expands, thereby attaining an evolving capability. This methodology is supported by robust theoretical foundations and demonstrates superior empirical performance. Comprehensive experiments show that GECC achieves better performance than most state-of-the-art graph condensation methods while delivering an around 1,000$\times$ speedup on large datasets.
