\begin{lemma}{\textbf{(Rounding)}}
    \label{rounding_lemma}
For any instance ($G, B$) of the problem on a grid,
there exists a pricing of edges which results in revenue of at least $\frac{1}{\Crounding}$ of the optimal one such that the price of each edge belongs to the set:
$$ \roundedSet = \longset{\frac{b_{max}}{2^t}}{t \in \set{0, 1, \dots, \ceil{\log \bra{ 4 m \cdot \abs{B} }}}} \cup \set{0} $$
where $b_{max} = \max_{(u, v, b) \in B} b$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Consider any price assignment $p$ generating the optimal revenue $\mathrm{OPT}$.
	If a price of any edge is greater than $b_{max}$, it can be lowered to $b_{max}$ without loss of revenue.
	We further round the price of each edge down to the nearest value from $P$.
    Let us consider any edge $e$, its initial price $p_e$ and the rounded price $p'_e$.
    The price of some edges can be rounded down to $0$, but if $p'_e = 0$, then $p_e < \frac{b_{max}}{4 m \cdot \abs{B}}$.
    Otherwise, we are guaranteed $p'_e \geq \frac{1}{2} p_e$.
    Thus: \[p_e \geq p'_e \geq \frac{p_e}{2} - \frac{b_{max}}{4 m \cdot \abs{B}}\]

    Let $d$ and $d'$ be the distances (costs of a cheapest path) between any two vertices in $G$ with respect to the initial and rounded prices, respectively. 
    We have: $d \geq d' \geq \frac{d}{2} - \frac{b_{max}}{4 \cdot \abs{B}}$.
    As the prices only decrease, no driver will be priced-out of the market by the rounding and the same inequality naturally holds for each drivers' contribution to the revenue.
	Summing these inequalities over all drivers results in a lower bound on the revenue of $\frac{\mathrm{OPT}}{2} - \frac{b_{max}}{4}$.
	As, naturally, $\mathrm{OPT} \geq b_{max}$, this concludes the proof.
\end{proof}

In the above proof we chose the constant scaling factor of $2$ for the sake of clarity and ease of exposition.
It can be replaced with $1 + \epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon > 0$.
This, together with adjusting the smallest element in $\roundedSet$, would allow us to prove \cref{rounding_lemma} for any constant $c > 1$ instead of $4$.
