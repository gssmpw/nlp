\section{Decay in rows and columns for variational matrix}


 Assume that we have a solution $x(t)$ for $t \in [0,T]$, contained in self-consistent polynomial bounds $W$ (i.e. all convergence conditions are satisfied) such that
 \begin{equation*}
   |x_k| \leq \frac{\tilde{C}}{|k|^s}
 \end{equation*}
 with $s$ sufficiently large.


Each column evolves separately. Let us fix $j_0$ - this is our column. We look at the variational equation with initial condition $v=e_{j_0}$.


\subsection{Special case}

In case when $N(u,u_x)=(P(u))_x$ (this is true for KS)
 Then the derivative of non-linear part satisfies  
 \begin{equation}
   \left|\frac{\partial N_i}{\partial x_j}(x(t))\right| \leq \frac{D_1 |i|^r}{|i-j|^s}.  \label{eq:estm-DNv}
 \end{equation}
the same is true for Navier-Stokes system \cite{Z}.


We look for the a-priori bound of the form
\begin{equation*}
  |v_i| \leq \frac{C}{|i-j_0|^s}.
\end{equation*}


The part coming from  $\sum_{j} \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial v_j} v_{j}$ is due to Lemma~\ref{lem:estmQ2} estimated as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \left|\sum_{j} \frac{\partial N_i}{\partial v_j} v_{j}  \right| \leq \sum_{j} \frac{D_1 |i|^r}{|i-j|^s} \frac{C}{|j-j_0|^s}  \leq \frac{|i|^rD_1 C C_2(d,s)}{|i-j_0|^s}
\end{eqnarray*}
For the isolation condition it is enough to have
\begin{eqnarray*}
   -\lambda_i \frac{C}{|i-j_0|^s} > \frac{|i|^rD_1 C C_2(d,s)}{|i-j_0|^s}
\end{eqnarray*}
Using (\ref{eq:lambdak},\ref{eq:lambdak2}) we see that it is enough to have
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha_0 |i|^p > |i|^r D_1 C_2(d,s)
\end{equation*}
which holds if 
\begin{equation*}
  |i| > \left(\frac{ D_1 C_2(d,s)}{\alpha_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{p-r}}.
\end{equation*}
Observe that $C$ is not involved in this condition.  We can take $C=1$ to include the initial condition.  Therefore we proved
\begin{lemma}
  Assume that (\ref{eq:estm-DNv}) holds for $t \in [0,T]$ and
  \begin{equation*}
  |i| > K_r=\left(\frac{ D_1 C_2(d,s)}{\alpha_0} \right)^{\frac{1}{p-r}}.
  \end{equation*}
  Then
  \begin{equation*}
      |V_{i,j_0}(t)| \leq \frac{1}{|i-j_0|^s}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
Observe that the above lemma gives us decay in rows with $i > K_r$ of the desired form and also decay in all columns.

What is not controlled is the behavior of first coordinates in each column, with $i \leq K_r$.
