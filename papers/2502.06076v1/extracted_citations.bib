comment = {Using the standard single step improvement bound, shows that for
  smooth objective functions (i.e. Lipschitz derivatives), if the expected
  error in gradient is \sigma^2, then a convergence rate of roughly
  $\epsilon = L \sigma R / \sqrt{N}$ can be achieved (in expectation) to find
  a point with $\norm{\nabla f(x)}^2 \le \epsilon$. Also shows a result
  using two-point gradient estimators in the convex smooth case attaining
  convergence rate (with only function evaluations available) of
  $\sqrt{d} \sigma R / \sqrt{N}$ or so.
