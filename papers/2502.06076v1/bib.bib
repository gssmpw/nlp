  Shows how to obtain lower bounds for stochastic convex optimization. The
  argument proceeds in two phases: (1) they construct a packing set of the
  d-dimensional hypercube {-1, 1}^d, associating the function
  f_\alpha(x) = ||x - \alpha||_1 for each corner \alpha in the packing set.
  The packing set is chosen so that if x minimizes f_\alpha for one \alpha,
  it does badly on others, which allows us to reduce the optimization problem
  to a testing problem of identifying the corner of the hypercube chosen.

  Then (2) they use a coin-flipping based oracle--i.e. random functions
  are based on biased coins flipped according to the corner of the hypercube
  chosen--and use Fano's inequality to give lower bounds on the amount of
  time it takes to estimate the biases of the coins being flipped. This
  corresponds to the testing problem of identifying the corner, giving a
  lower bound. The amount of bias must be carefully chosen to give the right
  rates. They also have the right (optimal) dimension dependence.

That is, if f_u(x) = E[f(x + uZ)], where Z is distributed in the \ell_2 ball
of radius 1, then the quantity (d/u) E[f(x + uZ')Z'], where Z' is uniform
on the surface of the \ell_2 sphere, is an unbiased gradient estimate for
f_u. The insight here is that though the quantity (d/u) f(x + uZ')Z' could
be quite large, the quantity (d/u)(f(x + uZ')Z' - f(x) Z') is bounded and
small whenever f is Lipschitz continuous. Then the standard online convex
optimization guarantees apply straightforwardly, and everyone is happy.
The paper does not provide lower bounds, and also does not *really* consider
distributions other than uniform on the \ell_2 ball (so in particular, no
geometric considerations or high-dimensional problems are considered).

  Studies PAC learning from distributed datasets and attempts to show how
  low communication learning may be possible in certain models.
  Main lower bound result shows that metric entropy (to radius
  \epsilon) bits are required to learn with error \epsilon, while
  \log|hypothesis class| is required for proper learning (otherwise hypotheses
  cannot be distinguished).
  Goes through many PAC learning examples to show how learning is possible.
  Two main examples are boosting and margin-based learners.
  For margin-based learners, uses a cyclic protocol of passing
  a hyperplane/hypothesis vector around that makes similar
  numbers of mistakes to a standard perceptron. When the data is reasonably
  well spread out, this works nicely, since for well-spread data one
  sees most of the statistical juice quickly.
  For boosting, the central algorithm maintains weights over each of its
  workers, performing boosting over them, asking them for samples in
  proportion to their weights.
  Finishes with privacy story (based on statistical query model), which
  increases communication.

  on KWIK (knows what it knows) settings mostly.
  Covers a variety of algorithms for this setting, including the simplest
  "predict if all $h$ agree, otherwise ask". Shows results
  by Avrim Blum and others that show there are natural tradeoffs if
  one is allowed to make mistakes and there is a perfect classifier,
  so you make at most $k$ mistakes and abstain $k |H|^{1/k}$ times.
  (Take $k = \log|H|$ to get both logarithmic.) No notion of confidence,
  but some treatment of models that trade between abstention and risk.
  Evidently the paper of El-Yaniv and Wiener, "Foundations of noise free
  selective classification" and follow-ups "Active Learning via perfect
  selective classification" and "Agnostic selective classification"
  give explicit tradeoffs between abstention and risk.
  Also states a result (ASC paper) that shows how abstentions of an empirical
  minimization-based procedure occur only when a classifier with small
  risk to the optimal $h^*$ exists that disagrees with $h^*$ on a particular
  $x$ (i.e. there is some confusion; see also BeygelzimerHsLaZh10 for the
  active learning analogue of this idea).

  Also show that doing a Fourier transform, then adding noise to Fourier

  tables (though with non-integer counts) gives better bounds in this case.
  Section 1.2.1 gives a nice comparison of differential privacy to other
  definitions of privacy, explaining how differential privacy protects against
  attacks with side information.
  Show that noise error (in terms of \ell_1-norm of a marginal in the table)
  can be taken to
  be of size O(2^k |C| / \epsilon), where k is the number of attributes over
  which marginals are computed in the table, and |C| is the number of

  Shows lower bounds in PAC model for learning with privacy. Has one argument
  (Lemma 3.9) for learning a class that shows learning error must scale as
  $\log|H| / (n \alpha)$, where $H$ is the hypothesis class. The technique
  for proving this is similar to the lower bounds for estimating a particular
  sample. They construct distributions for which samples are likely of the
  form $(x, x, x, x, 0, \ldots, 0)$, for some specified number of $x$
  observations. Then they show any private estimator is likely to output
  a nearby parameter that would be that based on $(x', x', x', 0, \ldots, 0)$.
  By careful scaling of the number of special $x$ and $x'$ observations,
  the right rates are attainable.
  They specifically focus on learning classes like "point" and "interval,"
  which are specially constructed concept classes to show their results.

  Didn't really understand the distributed part. Shows a lower bound on
  computing the sum \sum_{i=1}^n x_i in the local privacy model, when we assume
  that x_i \in \{0, 1\}. The lower bound is of order \sqrt{n} / (\epsilon l)
  for an l-round protocol, where \epsilon is differential privacy level.
  Proof technique is by showing that under local privacy, with high probability
  deviation is of order \sqrt{n}, so the all-0s vector is indistinguishable
  (with constant probability) from a vector with P(x_i = 1) = 1/\sqrt{n}. A
  bit of a weakness in that doesn't really tackle statistical problem
  underlying the setting and doing more rounds reduces lower bound. (Don't

  a series of samples comes from a distribution N(0, I) or
  N(0, I + \theta vv^T), where v is k-sparse and has \ell_2-norm 1. Shows
  that the minimax rate of error for testing (or signal size \theta) scales
  roughly as \sqrt{k \log (p/k) / n}, while no SDP relaxation can have
  identification when the SNR is less than \sqrt{k^2 \log(p/k) / n} so
  long as the planted clique problem is hard. Has elegant simple
  proofs of the success of the SDP-based and enumeration-based tests,
  and lower bound is based on \chi^2 divergences (a la Tsybakov).
  Polynomial separation in this paper appears to apply only to SDP
  relaxation in some strange way.

comment = {
  Studies active learning, where we can query labels according to a particular
  probability, and proves generalization guarantees for finite hypothesis classes.
  In particular, shows that a procedure that, roughly, chooses to *not* query
  an example if choosing hypotheses that differ on its value lead to large
  changes in empirical risk--that is, minimizing empirical risk (ignoring recent
  example $X_k$) to get $h_k$, then choosing some $h_k'$ that disagrees with
  $h_k(X_k)$ does not increase the empirical risk means that we are very
  uncertain about $X_k$ and so should ask for a label; if the risk increases,
  then the set of hypotheses that agree with $h_k(X_k)$ should (roughly) be
  the true minimizers. Shows that the probability of sampling an example
  $i$ is $P_i \ge 1/2$ only when hypotheses $h_n$ disagree with $h^*$. Uses an
  inductive argument with martingales.
  To show that not too many labels are queried requires controlling the
  probablity of data $x$ for which there exist $h$ that are close to $h^*$
  in general but for which $h(x) \neq h^*(x)$. If most data satisfy this,
  then it is hard to find $h^*$ without querying many labels.

Studies learning from a dataset using queries from VC spaces.
The method is to sanitize the database in some way, then release a
perturbed version of the database that is suitable for certain queries.
They show how to do half-space queries in some polynomial of all the
problem parameters while maintaining "usefulness."
Survey by Dwork helps explain some of this. Also shows loose
upper bounds of O(d V / (\epsilon^3 \alpha)), where V is the VC dimension,
d is the dimension, \epsilon is the desired accuracy of queries, and
\alpha is the differential privacy, on the size of a dataset necessary
for learning. Gives a lower bound of 1/\epsilon^2.

  $\vol(B_A) \le \vol(K_A)$ for any $A$. The proof is an

semialgebraic feasible region F. Semidefinite programming is an example.
 If F is compact, then for almost every linear objective there is a
 unique optimal solution, lying on a unique “active” manifold, around
 which F is “partly smooth,” and the second-order sufficient conditions hold.
 Perturbing the objective results in smooth variation of the optimal solution.
 The active manifold consists, locally, of these perturbed optimal solutions; 
it is independent of the representation of F and is eventually identified by a
variety of iterative algorithms such as proximal and projected gradient
 schemes. These results extend to unbounded sets F. }

comment = {Excellent survey of classification with a perspective of Rademacher
  complexity. Starts with simple examples to achieve 1/\sqrt{n} convergence,
  then expands to include some classification calibration. Spends time
  going over "sharp" rates--that depend on localization (and a very simple
  argument in the 0/1-VC case that does not require localization).
  Presentation is nicely high-level with proofs presented enough to be
  easily filled in. Also includes material on PAC-Bayes bounds and
  a nice treatment of model selection.},

comment = {
  Studies oracle complexity of optimization problems using information
  theoretic tools. They construct oracles for optimization that reduce
  to the problem of identifying a random string $S \in \{0, 1\}^M$, for
  appropriate $M$, where querying the oracle for a subgradient is equivalent
  to querying the string by asking ``given a permutation $\sigma$ and string
  $s$, which coordinate $j$ is the first satisfying $s_{\sigma(j)} \neq
  S_{j}$.'' This oracle requires at least $M/2$ queries to solve when
  $S$ is uniform. The optimization oracle that is equivalent
  is given by maxima of particular collections of recursively-defined
  functions, where $f_s(x)$ can be specified by a particular (permuted)
  prefix of the string $s$ until enough queries have occured.

  exist linear estimators that, for any given $\theta$ with

  with pointwise risk, relative to the minimax rate,
  at most $\epsilon$. Also exhibits a Stein-type estimator

  Builds off of the results of Donoho to give a more local analysis of
  minimax estimation of a functional at a point. Defines the quantity
  $R_n(f) = \sup_{g \in \mc{F}} \inf_{\hat{T}} \max\{\E[(\hat{T} - f(0))^2],
  \E[(\hat{T} - g(0))^2]\}$, which is a type of local minimax quantity.
  Shows how estimation of convex functions (among other shape
  constrained functions) is governed by this rate, and gives an adaptive
  estimator that attains the rate $R_n(f)$ uniformly among (most) convex
  functions. (This is possible because the shape constraint
  allows accurate bias estimation.) The quantity is essentially identical
  to a local modulus of continuity. Also shows that though convexity
  allows adaptivity, smoothness rates are same as in the non-convex case.

  Matching lower bound given by looking at spectral decomposition of S,
  then identifying signs of first M eigenvectors (M chosen carefully to
  match the nonparametric rate based on decay of eigenvalues of S) with corners

 Abstract = {It is shown that the steepest-descent and Newton's
                  methods for unconstrained nonconvex optimization
                  under standard assumptions may both require a number
                  of iterations and function evaluations arbitrarily
                  close to $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ to drive the norm of the
                  gradient below $\epsilon$. This shows that the upper
                  bound of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ evaluations known for
                  the steepest descent is tight and that Newton's
                  method may be as slow as the steepest-descent method
                  in the worst case. The improved evaluation
                  complexity bound of $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ evaluations
                  known for cubically regularized Newton's methods is
                  also shown to be tight.  Read More:

  that are differentially private and have data coming from [0, 1] won't

  learning is possible. For (1), they construct a lower bound using thresholds
  on [0, 1], but put most of the probability mass in a very tight window
  around the correct threshold. Then differential privacy of the released
  classifier causes more deviation than this tight window, which makes the
  problem hard. For (2), they show that given a secondary distribution that
  is smooth (something like strongly absolutely continuous, almost in a
  Lipschitzian sense) w.r.t. the data generating distribution, then covering
  the secondary distribution with hypotheses from the hypothesis space,
  and selecting (differentially privately) the best one from that space
  gives sample complexity scaling as 1 / (\alpha \epsilon) + 1 / \epsilon^2,

Uses differential privacy as measure of privacy for SVM (and similar ERM
problems). Studies both output perturbation--adding noise to learned weight
vector--and objective perturbation, which involves adding a random linear
term to ERM objective. Theory and practical results in paper suggest
objective perturbation is better. Analysis follows from usual stability
of ERM, then additional noise to make sure things are appropriately
smooth (and densities exist). The objective perturbation technique requires
showing that (under suitable differentiability conditions) there is a bijection
between the output weight vector and perturbing linear term. Then
one can compute a change of variables and use that to talk about the
density of the final weight vector based on the distribution of the
perturbing linear term. Convergence rates are a bit odd, and
algorithm to do model selection while maintaining privacy destroys rates
of convergence.

comment = {
  Shows that several natural methods of attempting to attain privacy are quite
  broken. In particular, with n items, noise of order \sqrt{n} must be
  added to avoid some seriously broken privacy (in some ways).
  The specific techniques are as follows: a database d is viewed as an n bit
  vector in {0, 1}^n. A query is a vector q \in {0, 1}^n (select a subset
  of indices) and the answer a_q to the query is a_q = d' * q. If an adversary
  is allowed time exponential in n (and queries exponential in n), and
  the amount of perturbation is o(n), then the database can be reconstructed.
  If the adversary is allowed poly(n) time (and queries), then the amount
  of perturbation to a_q must be \Omega(\sqrt{n}), because otherwise
  one can ask a set of n \log^2 n random queries q, solve
  a simple LP to estimate the on and off answers (that is, find c \in [0,1]^n
  a_q - err <= q' * c <= a_q + err
  for each random query q, which is polynomial time, then round the c vectors),
  and a coupon collector argument shows that the right database can be
  reconstructed if the noise--i.e. err--is o(\sqrt{n}).
  This motivated later work on differential privacy.

  (meaning that the points $\theta.^2$ for $\theta \in \Theta$ are
  convex), then rectangular sub-problems are just as hard for \emph{linear}
  estimators as the full problem. Then, since linear estimators and
  nonlinear estimators behave similarly for rectangular $\Theta$, the
  heuristic of "hardest rectangular sub-problem" is a good one.
  But for non-quadratically convex sets, the risks can be arbitrarily
  different (and a non-linear soft-thresholding estimator, for example,
  achieves logarithmic factors of the minimax risk).

This paper, along with Duncan and Lambert 1989, seems to be the proposer
of a way to measure privacy in statistical databases (like releases of census
data) by way of disclosure identification/limitation. They propose a
decision-theoretic way to measure disclosure (in this paper, it is for
tabular data) by measuring identification risk/a user's predictive
distribution over data, and how it changes before and after data release.
(A bit vague for me.)

  Discusses the disclosure limitation framework for microdata, that is, when
  a set of records is released in full (non-tabularized data). This extends
  their earlier work in JASA 86, and measures risk by a decision-theoretic
  loss for when a datum is actually "linked," that is, the intruder (bad
  guy) figures out that some released data item is actually something that
  he owns already. The risk is then measured by a loss weighted by the
  conditional probabilities of such linkage events. Evaluating these
  conditional probabilities is somewhat challening, as it is unclear what
  data an adversary may have, so to be maximally private, one must assume
  that an adversary/intruder has access to lots of data (for example, the
  intruder may know the non-private data of each record being released, and
  may be simply trying to identify which are which).

  Nice survey of differential privacy ideas. Discusses the addition of Laplace
  noise and shows that for queries--i.e. functions computed on a dataset--that
  satisfy a Lipschitz condition with respect to Hamming metric Laplace noise
  is sufficient to guarantee privacy. Points out that the
  statistician (curator of the dataset) \emph{must} be trusted. Goes through
  several examples of differential privacy applications: frequency analysis,
  contingency tables (i.e. marginals), halfspace learning, statistical
  query modeling, and PAC learning. Not clear from survey that Laplace
  noise is necessary or essential to differential privacy, but clear that
  most work has used this.

comment = {
  Uses robust statistics, which are stable to data perturbation, to guarantee
  differential privacy (after a perturbation). Add an additional wrinkle in
  that a database will not release information if it is judged to be
  unstable (i.e. a non-robust estimator). Not clear what rates they can
  attain, as results appear to be asymptotic. They do get something like
  ''with probability at least $1 - n^{-\alpha \epsilon}$, the released
  statistic is within $[n^{-\alpha}, n^\alpha] q$, where $q$ is the
  inter-quartile range of the statistic being evaluated.
  They discretize the space to localize, then apply noise addition, which
  has some similarity to NissimRaSm07. They have issues of discretization
  though, because statistics may hit weird locations and require
  re-discretization. Generalization to higher-d is a bit unclear.

The initial paper that defines differential privacy as a ratio of probabilities
of outputs of statistical procedures on datasets differing in at most
one entry. They show that adding Laplace-distributed noise guarantees
privacy. They also give a few lower bounds (which seem quite loose and
also a bit hard to evaluate) that show that an \epsilon-private mechanism
cannot answer a large number of queries/statistical questions unless
the number of data points is large. The notion of answering queries is
a little cryptographic though. Appendices show the
equivalence of some semantic notions of differential privacy; it seems
that differential privacy means that an adversary knowing most of a dataset
cannot recover information about a single entry in a dataset with a few
queries of the dataset.

  Combines boosting with tools that generate synopses of a dataset to
  release private and (for some set of queries) useful dataset synopses.
  More specifically, starts with a set $Q$ of queries, then proceeds in rounds
  of boosting, where in each round $t$ a synopsis $A_t$ is computed. This
  synopsis should have $A_t(q) \approx q(X)$, where $X$ is the database
  and $A_t(q)$ is synopsis $t$'s approximation to $q(X)$ for the query $q$,
  for sufficiently many queries $q$. Performs boosting on the weights
  where each query $q$ is treated as a training example and the goal is
  to approximate $q(X)$ correctly.
  %
  A few issues: run time is (obviously) large in $|Q|$, but may also be
  large in $|X|$ (or the possible size thereof). It would be reasonable
  to try to understand whether such algorithms were possible for sets of
  infinite size, but with finite metric entropies (or something along those
  lines). What if the queries consist of all queries of the form
  $\sum_{i=1}^n l'(x_i^T \theta) x_i$, where $l$ is some loss. That is, all
  linear models/GLMs?

    problem of minimizing $f(x) = \E[F(x; W)]$ subject to $x \in X$, where
    $X = \{x \mid \psi(x) \le 0\}$ is compact, converges to stationary
    points in a particular sense. Here $F$ is simply generalized
    sub-differentiable (something like Clark). The argument shows that if
    the iterates $x^k$ have a subsequence $k_s$ converging to some $y$ that is
    not stationary, then there is a different subsequence of $l_s > k_s$
    such that $\limsup_s f(x^{l_s}) < f(y)$, because one must make
    progress in the intervening iterates as they are at non-stationary
    points. Thus if $X^*$ denotes stationary points, then this set is
    connected, and the limit points of $f(x^k)$ all belong to the
    interval $f(X^*)$.}

  Looks at more local measures of privacy and proposes a quantity called
  "amplification" that is essentially identical to the differential privacy
  criterion. Specifically, there are N clients, each with data x_i, which
  they don't want to reveal to a central server; instead each client
  releases R(x_i), a randomized version of x_i. The authors measure privacy
  risk in terms of the increase/decrease in P(X_i = x_i | R(x_i)) vs.
  P(X_i = x_i), showing that this can be controlled by bounding the
  "amplification," which is max_{x, x', y} P(R(x) = y) / P(R(x') = y).
  They also suggest measuring privacy-breaches with a worst-case
  KL divergence (i.e. max_y KL(P(X | y), P(X))), because the mutual information
  can lead to privacy breaches for unlikely data x (as it is weighted by x).

  Studies a Fourier-based version of attaining differential privacy for
  contingency (count) tables by adding Laplace noise, originally proposed
  by Barak, Chaudhuri, et al in PODS. They argue that it introduces too much
  noise to be really effective, and yields unbearably high counts in some
  cases when the count data is really not that high. Simulations on
  three data sets exhibit the problems with maintaining privacy, since
  differential privacy appears quite stringent in this case. Though not
  100\% clear that the studied mechanism is the best for attaining differential
  privacy.

  Studies some weaknesses of standard definitions of privacy (like
  $k$-anonymity) by showing that they are easy to break, e.g. by an
  intersection attack (where multiple independent data releases of
  a table are intersected with one another to whittle down the possible
  people). Then gives a more semantically flavored definition of privacy:
  specifically, that the posterior beliefs of an adversary cannot change
  by very much given what is actually observed from the prior beliefs of
  the adversary. Obviously differential privacy satisfies such a guarantee;
  if the difference of posterior beliefs is measured additively (i.e. via
  TV-distance) then $(\epsilon, \delta)$-approximate differential privacy
  also guarantees this type of semantic behavior.

  Shows that for a single query of a statistical database (i.e. dataset)
  there is an essentially unique perturbation (geometric, truncated
  to the range of the function) that maximizes utility subject to a
  privacy constraint. This is in contrast to most other work on privacy,
  where the tradeoff is not so explicit. Uses linear programming to
  characterize the optimality. Only applies to count queries (i.e.
  what fraction of the data obeys a certain predicate) and only one
  query may be issued, and requires that mechanisms are oblivious (i.e.
  cannot look at the entire database, only the result of the counting
  query.) Here, the important thing is that the queries
  are count queries, and the losses suffered $\ell(i, j)$ for answering
  $j$ when the truth is $i$ must be functions of $|i - j|$ and increasing
  in the error $|i - j|$.

Looks at release of functional data estimators, focusing pretty much
exclusively on RKHS's, in a differentially private manner. Shows that
when an algorithm is stable in the RKHS norm, then adding Gaussian process
noise to it (of appropriate variance) with kernel given by the RKHS kernel
yields differential privacy--at least for the sigma-algebra generated by
the cylinder sets of functions. Proof technique roughly uses finite
dimensional privacy argument (with Gaussian noise), then a nice limiting
argument to show that vector-based differential privacy (i.e. differential
privacy of any finite number of released function evaluations) yields
differential privacy for the full sigma-field.
One difficulty of the paper (that is not immediate how to overcome): the
learning algorithm/aggregator must be *queried* for the (perturbed) function
values \tilde{f}(x), since it must add Gaussian process noise to each
function value, and it is not clear how to release the full function without
providing the support points. Also gives an algorithm that iteratively updates
sufficient statistics of the GP to release a countable number of function
values.

  Shows how to answer a number of counting queries on a database while
  maintaining privacy. Technique is to begin with a fake database
  that is uniform on the universe U (of size N, which is presumably *huge*),
  then for each query, compare the answer from the fake and (a perturbed
  answer from the) real database, and if they are close enough return the
  fake answer. Otherwise return the perturbed answer, then do a multiplicative
  update to the fake database to bring it closer to the real histogram.
  Doing a smallish number of updates--as analyzed by the amount of "potential"
  reduced (KL divergence to true database from the fake one)--yields privacy
  and utility. Proofs are pretty CS-theory.
  Long version has a lower bound for answering sufficiently many
  queries (of sufficient dimension, somehow) that says that answering
  lots of queries will yield error rate at least A / \sqrt{n \epsilon},
  where A depends on N, n, and the number of linear queries being issued.

  Give lower bounds on the amount of noise necessary to add for answering
  queries of the form y = Fx, where x is a vector in \R^n and
  F \in [-1, 1]^{d \times n} is a linear mapping. Their main lower bound
  shows that noise of L2-norm roughly d \sqrt{d} / \epsilon * Vol(FB_1)^{1/d}
  must be added, where B_1 is the \ell_1-ball of radius 1. Here \epsilon
  is the differential privacy parameter, and the proof follows from a volume
  (packing) argument. Roughly, differential privacy means that balls around
  all points y in FB_1 must have similar mass, but if the noise is taken
  to be too small, then a large enough packing + differential privacy would
  force more than mass 1 to the resulting distribution.
  For many queries, we get lower bounds that scale as
  d/\epsilon \min\{\sqrt{d}, \sqrt{\log(n/d)}\}

abstract="Deep residual networks have emerged as a family of extremely deep architectures showing compelling accuracy and nice convergence behaviors. In this paper, we analyze the propagation formulations behind the residual building blocks, which suggest that the forward and backward signals can be directly propagated from one block to any other block, when using identity mappings as the skip connections and after-addition activation. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these identity mappings. This motivates us to propose a new residual unit, which makes training easier and improves generalization. We report improved results using a 1001-layer ResNet on CIFAR-10 (4.62 {\%} error) and CIFAR-100, and a 200-layer ResNet on ImageNet. Code is available at: https://github.com/KaimingHe/resnet-1k-layers.",

Studies the statistical query model (SQ), as defined by Kearns in 1998,
and connects it with what they term local algorithms, which put the
privacy barrier between the algorithm and the dataset. The SQ model answers
"queries" of the form (1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n g(z_i), where z_i is the database
(and g is a boolean function), or more generally, the SQ model answers
a number k so that |E[g(Z)] - k| <= \alpha, where Z is drawn from the
correct distribution.
* They show that SQ learnability and locally private algorithms are the same
(with respect to learning from polynomially many samples, in a very
learning-theoretic/CS theoretic sense). This is because each can
simulate the other.
* The intuition is that that adding random noise to each of the
g(z_i) individually preserves "local" privacy (add enough noise and this
is obvious), but in aggregate, with high probability, the SQ query is
answered for some accuracy alpha.
* To simulate local privacy from an SQ algorithm, the authors must define
a rejection sampling strategy that returns estimates from the SQ algorithm
only when they obey certain probabilistic bounds; this guarantees that
SQ algorithms can simulate locally private algorithms. (There might be
some weird issues with adaptive versus non-adaptive algorithms here.)
* Additionally, the authors have the wrong bound for Laplace concentration
(they say it is sub-Gaussian; that is silly).

  Uses random matrix theory to show that if one wishes to release accurately
  all queries on subsets of size k of a database matrix $[U~s]$, where $s$ are
  "sensitive" attributes and $U \in \R^{n \times d}$ are known, then
  there are blatant failures of privacy if the adversary knows $U$ and the
  noise is not large enough. (Here blatant means that a fraction
  $1 - o(1)$ of $s \in \{0, 1\}^n$ can be recovered directly.) Analysis
  is by random $\{0, 1\}$ matrices $U$, but is a sample-based quantity:
  one must be accurate on \emph{all} matrices.

Shows some interesting collapses of differential privacy in the face of
correlated data. Studies deciding whether someone belongs to a database
or not. If an algorithm has utility, shows that there is *some* set of
databases whose privacy can be compromised (the so-called "No Free Lunch"
part), though this compromise is a little silly (relies on databases
being completely arbitrary and being able to output queries in hugely
separate spaces). Shows how a few privacy ideas are broken (social networks
can evolve and show that someone important was in or not; contingency
tables with some pre-released data).

                  conditions as estimating equations. This results in
                  a much less general theory compared to DuchiGlNa16
                  and their proof is a straightforward plug-in from
                  standard empirical likelihood theory with estimating
                  equations. In particular, requires differentiability
                  and cov(grad of obj(opt), obj(opt)) to be positive
                  definite. Only applies to effectively unconstrained
                  problems grad obj(opt) = 0.}

  super-linear convergence using a Quasi-Newton method satisfying
  the Dennis-Mor\'e criterion on accuracy of Hessian approxomations in the

  long as the resulting "gradient" (combination of current gradient

  small. They show that this gives linear or super-linearly to
  the optimal solution, depending on how accurately sub-problems are solved.}

title = {Differentially private {M}-estimators},
year = 2011,
booktitle = nips2011,
comment = { Main idea of the paper: since most data analysis
                  techniques don't a-priori know the problem being
                  solved, it makes sense to release a summary of the
                  dataset that can be used for many tasks, such as
                  M-estimation. To do so, the paper proposes using a
                  private histogram of the data, then running all
                  statistical analyses based on that private
                  histogram. The issue is that for d-dimensional
                  problems, the computational scaling of this
                  procedure is high, and the convergence rates of the
                  resulting estimators decrease to n^{-4 / (2 + d)} in
                  \ell_2^2. So for any d > 2, this is sub-optimal, and
                  quickly becomes very slow. It is not clear that
                  there are better procedures, but there are some
                  based on the statistical query model so long as
                  queries have bounded VC dimension. Also requires all
                  data to live in [0, 1]^d.},

  If the delay in the method is bounded(ish) by $\sqrt{n} / H$, then

  observations come as $\theta + Z_i$, where $Z_i$ are indpendent bounded

  observation $\theta + Z_i$ and $|Z_i| \le U$, then usual minimax lower
  bounds imply that $U^2 / \epsilon^2$ sensors are necessary to estimate
  $\theta$ to within $\epsilon$. Under a restriction of sensors sending only a
  single bit, this paper shows that an asymptotically identical number
  of sensors are sufficient. The scheme is as follows: divide the
  sensors into $K = \log(U / \epsilon)$ sub-groups, where the $k$th
  subgroup has a fraction $2^{-k}$ of the sensors. Within subgroup $k$,
  send a quantized version of the $k$th bit of the observation, then
  re-assemble at the fusion center using the binary expansion of a number.},

comment = {Really nice paper. Abstract:
  This paper derives exponential concentration inequalities and polynomial
  moment inequalities for the spectral norm of a random matrix. The analysis
  requires a matrix extension of the scalar concentration theory developed by
  Sourav Chatterjee using Stein's method of exchangeable pairs. When applied
  to a sum of independent random matrices, this approach yields matrix
  generalizations of the classical inequalities due to Hoeffding, Bernstein,
  Khintchine, and Rosenthal. The same technique delivers bounds for sums of
  dependent random matrices and more general matrix-valued functions of
  dependent random variables. Curious how it applies to self-adjoint
  matrices for different inner products.},

  Long version at

  Studies privacy in a distributed setting where two parties perform
  analysis of joint data while preserving privacy for both datasets.
  Give lower bounds that show \Theta(\sqrt{n}) noise necessary for estimating
  the inner product of two binary vectors. Some questions on independence
  assumptions and results used in proof of this theorem (based on transcripts
  of what is communicated).
  Also shows that communication complexity and differential privacy
  are somewhat related, and gives bounds on some information-theoretic
  quantities as a function of differential privacy. Best bound
  is that if X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n) and Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_n) are private
  from one another in a communication protocol, then mutual information
  between them and a (private) transcript they compute, \Pi(X, Y), is bounded
  by I(X, Y; \Pi(X, Y)) \le \epsilon n. (Here \epsilon is differential
  privacy parameter.)
  This shows that 2-party privacy is strong: there are functions for
  which approximation to within o(n) requires n bits communicated, so
  they will have high error in any differentially private scheme.

  all classes of convex optimization problems with H\"older-continuous
  gradients, meaning $\dnorm{\nabla f(x) - \nabla f(y)} \le L \norm{x - y}^\nu$
  for some $\nu \in [0, 1]$. Using appropriate Bregman divergences, shows
  that with small enough stepsize, it is possible to get $\epsilon$-close to
  guaranteed descent directions with the usual quadratic/Bregman divergence
  model of the local version of the objective function. Also gives a
  line-search method that makes it unnecessary to know either the constant
  L or even the parameter $\nu$. The simple gradient-type method achieves
  convergence rate $(1/\epsilon)^{2 / (1 + \nu)}$, while an accelerated
  method achieves rate $(1/\epsilon)^{2 / (1 + 3\nu)}$, which is universally
  optimal.},

comment = {Describes algorithms that take advantage of local smoothness
  in a function f being released when evaluated on a sample or data set $X$.
  Specifically, if the local modulus of
  continuity (not their words) of $f$ at $x$ is small, then not very much
  noise needs to be added to $f(x)$ to maintain privacy.
  They give a construction of privacy based on smoothing out the local
  modulus of continuity, then adding some type of noise, but the density
  of noise added for differential privacy was a bit strange (required
  sampling from a Cauchy, and it was quite unclear how to do in higher
  dimensions). General strategy, for when sensitivity is unknown, of
  aggregating median of $f(x_U)$ where $U$ is some sub-sampled version
  of the dataset is a neat idea, though.},

  $R_2(f) = E[(f(X) - Y)^2] + \lambda \norm{f}_{\mc{H}}^2$, where $\mc{H}$
  is a Hilbert space, can converge exponentially quickly on the \emph{testing
  error} $R(f) = P(f(X) \neq Y) - P(f^*(X) \neq Y)$ as long as there are
  appropriate low-noise conditions on $Y$ conditional on $X$, e.g.\ that
  $|E[Y \mid X=x]| \ge \delta$ for all $x$, and that the population squared
  error minimizer similarly has the correct sign. This is intuitive for
  bounded kernels, because getting \emph{anywhere} close in $\mc{H}$ norm
  implies closeness in function values. Needs to assume some type of connection
  between $\mc{H}$ and $L^2$, which they do by assuming appropriate
  boundedness of the noise in Hilbert norm.},

comment = {Shows that even though in a stochastic approxmation problem
one can obtain optimal rates of convergence of (x_t - x^*) to zero with
the exact right stepsizes (and some other bells and whistles that may
not be implementable), averaging iterates to get \bar{x}_t yields optimal
rates of convergence for a wider variety of step sizes. Obtains results
in classical style, showing \sqrt{t}(\bar{x}_t - x^*) converges in
distribution to a normal with appropriate limiting variances.
Techniques are to first consider simple quadratic problem with
independent noise (i.e. solve Ax = b with noise), with fixed stepsizes,
then do this with decreasing stepsizes, then show the general problem
is asymptotically equivalent. (The attained limiting variances are
optimal in a Fisher-information/Bahadur efficiency sense.)
A few minor typos in assumptions and proof: Assumption 3.3 should have
dependence on \Delta_{t-1} = x_{t-1} - x^* instead of x_{t-1} in the stochastic
terms (and similarly in proof). Eq. (10) should be \gamma_t^{1 + \lambda/2}.
Proofs are classical statistics-type proofs.},

comment = {
Essentially a survey of statistical techniques for disclosure limitation,
specifically, identification disclosure risks. (This follows the Duncan-Lambert
approach.) The approach is to release a dataset {y_1, ..., y_N},
providing a perturbed version Z = {z_1, ..., z_r}. Each entry
z_i may consist of both perturbed and unperterbed entries. The disclosure
risk is measured by the probability P(J = j | t, Z), where t is some known
characteristics (features) of a sample, Z is the (perturbed) released dataset,
and J is a random variable equaling j when z_j truly corresponds to t (i.e.
the identification is correct). This can be further broken down into known
and unknown parts of t/Z, as well as parts that are and are not perturbed.
The paper as a whole is not that deep, though, and just seems to do what
Duncan and Lambert already did (perhaps somewhat more clearly).
Put succinctly (copying from the paper):
"The utility of the resulting released data is not considered here."
Nothing about maintaining utility or general results on privacy.

  Studies "learning" with integral operators and kernel functions. That is,
  shows some convergence results--building on a Hilbert-space convergence
  result for bounded vectors by Pinelis92--that show that empirical versions
  of the kernel matrix (Gram matrix) converge to the linear (integral) operator
  defined by $\mc{K}f(x) = \int k(x, y) f(y) dP(y)$. They do this via a
  spectral decomposition of $\mc{K}$ and defining the vectors (in Hilbert
  space) $\phi_i(\cdot) = (1/n) \sum_{i=1}^n k(\cdot, x_i) u_{i,j}$, where
  $u_i$ is the $i$th eigenvector of $K_n$, the empirical Gram matrix. Then
  using the "expansion" into the Hilbert space defined by
  $\mc{K}_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{\lambda_i} \<\phi_i(\cdot), f\> \phi_i$
  for all $f$ in the Hilbert space converges to $\mc{K}$. (Or something close
  to this, at least, modulo some corrections in eigenvalues.)

show a tradeoff: there is either privacy or (high probability) utility, but
not both. I don't believe the trade-off is sharp. Includes nice background

comment = {Shows that under Gaussian perturbation, a matrix is unlikely
  to have a bad condition number. In particular, $\kappa(A) \le x$ with
  probability at least $1 - (15 n (1 + \sqrt{log(x) / 9n})) / x \sigma$,
  where $A$ is the Gaussian perturbation of an arbitrary square matrix
  $\bar{A}$ satisfying $\norm{\bar{A}} \le \sqrt{n}$.
  Argument is by showing that $A$ is close to $\bar{A}$ with high
  probability, and then noting that $\norm{A^{-1} v} \le x$ with
  probability decreasing as $x^{-1}$, which follows via an anti-concentration
  of Gaussian inverses argument. Things get much harder with rectangular
  matrices or perturbations that do not touch zeros.},

  a number of convex ordering constraints. In particular, shows that
  $X \le_{\rm lcx} Y$, meaning that $\E[\phi(a^T X)] \le \E[\phi(a^T Y)]$
  for all vectors $a \in \R^d$ (the linear convex ordering), coupled with
  $\E[X_i^2] = \E[Y_i^2]$, implies that $X = Y$ in distribution. The
  proof follows by noting that $\E[X] = \E[Y]$ because of the linear convex
  ordering constraint, then showing there are versions of $X$ and $Y$ (on
  different probability spaces) with $\E[\tilde{Y} \mid \tilde{X}]
  = \tilde{X}$, so that $\var(\tilde{Y} \mid \tilde{X}) = 0$. (This is by
  the conditional expectation decomposition of variance and Strassen's theorem
  on random variables.) In particular, by the fact that the extremal
  $1$-dimensional convex functions are of the form $\max\{x - t, 0\}$, we
  have that $X = Y$ in distribution if and only if
  (1) $\E[\max\{a^T X - b, 0\}] \le \E[\max\{a^T Y - b, 0\}]$ for all
  $a, b$ and $\E[||X||^2] \ge \E[||Y||^2]$.},

comment = {
  Studies the differential privacy of asymptotically normal statistical
  estimators that have small bias by using an aggregating mechanism.
  Roughly, the idea is as follows. If T is an estimator of the population
  quantity $T(P)$, and $E[T_n] - T(P) = O(1/n)$, and additionally
  $\sqrt{n}(T_n - T(P)) \rightarrow N(0, \sigma_P^2)$, then a mechanism
  that blocks estimators into $Z_i = T(x_{ni/k}, \ldots, x_{n(i + 1)/k})$
  (that is, $k$ blocks of size $n/k$) and uses $(1/k) \sum_i Z_i$ as the
  estimator will still have the desired asymptotic normality--because the
  bias is small and the $Z_i$ are independent--so long as $k$ is not
  too large. Then some small amount of perturbation to the $Z_i$ (or $T$)
  can yield differential privacy. (If the $Z_i$ are bounded by $\Lambda$,
  then adding Laplace noise of variance $2\Lambda^2 / (k^2 \epsilon^2)$ yields
  differential privacy.)

  Shows that regularized kernel-based classifiers are consistent on compact

abstract ={As a first step toward understanding how rare variants
contribute to risk for complex diseases, we sequenced 15,585 human
 protein-coding genes to an average median depth of 111× in 2440 individuals
 of European (n = 1351) and African (n = 1088) ancestry. We identified over
 500,000 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), the majority of which were rare
 (86\% with a minor allele frequency less than 0.5\%), previously unknown (82\%),
 and population-specific (82\%). On average, 2.3\% of the 13,595 SNVs each person
 carried were predicted to affect protein function of \~313 genes per genome,
 and \~95.7\% of SNVs predicted to be functionally important were rare. This
 excess of rare functional variants is due to the combined effects of
 explosive, recent accelerated population growth and weak purifying selection.
 Furthermore, we show that large sample sizes will be required to associate
 rare variants with complex traits.},

  is the random gradient and $\E[\theta_n \mid \mc{F}_{n-1}] = \theta_n^+$
  so that it's some kind of stochastically unbiased proximal update.
  I cannot see situations where that would happen.
  Additionally, makes the assumption (Assumption 5) that the noise
  has bounded L2 norm everywhere, which of course is unrealistic unless
  one can prove such a thing. (For example, linear regression
  fails this.) Proves convergence guarantees for final iterates (and
  rates) based on stepsize powers. Also shows asymptotic normality

  defeats the purpose of the results. Claims of ``intuition'' from
  strongly convex case also have false proofs, and assume that random
  functions are (i) all strongly convex and (ii) have the same shared

  Considers complexity (in bits communicated) of finding an \epsilon-optimal
  solution to min. f_1(x) + f_2(x), where f_1 and f_2 are known only to
  distinct processors. Shows simple argument that O(n \log(1/\epsilon))
  or O(n \log(n / \epsilon)) bits are necessary by a volume argument (otherwise
  the number of outputs possible cannot cover the \ell_\infty or \ell_2 ball).
  Upper bounds of n^2 \log^2(1/\epsilon) are given using the center of
  gravity method, and a bisection-based algorithm achieves \log(1/\epsilon)
  for 1-dimensional problems (each computer keeps track of each direction
  of the search). In the strongly convex case, a gradient-based method
  with innacurate gradients, where at each iteration a few bits specifies
  the sign direction the gradient entries should go in, requires
  \log(1/\epsilon) iterations and has O(n) communication per round.

  there non-negative matrices $(W, H) \in \R^{m \times k}$ and
  $\R^{k \times n}$ such that $A = WH$.)
  The proof is by a reduction to a problem called
  Intermediate Simplex, which is given a polyhedron $\{Ax \ge b\}$, where
  $A \in \R^{n \times k-1}$ such that $[A b]$ has rank $k$ and a set
  $S \subset \R^{k - 1}$ of $m$ points contained in $P$ and
  affinely spanning $\R^{k-1}$. Is there a $(k-1)$-simplex $T$ such that
  $S \subset T \subset P$. The proof that this is NP hard is from 3SAT,
  building a gadget that constructs lots of mini-simplexes, each of which
  solves an intermediate simplex problem setting a variable to true/false
  based on the smaller simplex problem.

  Analyzes histogram estimators (over the space [0, 1]^d) under the framework
  of differential privacy. Shows a few techniques for achieving privacy:
  one based on simply adding a lower bound \delta > 0 to all histogram
  bins, another based on adding random exponential noise to the bins
  of the histogram, then resampling points from that distribution. This means
  new data Z can be constructed and released, where the distribution of Z
  is close to X (original data) in different metrics. They consider a few
  other mechanisms, including estimation using orthogonal series, where
  resampling is done by sampling from \sum_{j=1}^m (\beta_j + \nu_j) \phi_j(x),
  where \beta_j are the standard estimates and \nu_j are random noise.
  This achieves minimax rates (other sampling schemes sometimes do and
  sometimes do not).

  a correctly specified model will pointwise dominate (i.e.\ $\theta$ is
  optimal simultaneously for all losses $\E[\ell(f_\theta(x), Y) \mid X = x]$

  So if adversarial perturbations hurt, then you are mis-specified.

  In particular, shows that under appropriate conditions, the normal
  cone $N_S(x)$ to the surface S can be roughly open. If $\nabla F(x^*)$
  is in the relative interior of $N_S(x^*)$, then eventually projected
  gradient steps lie in the interior of the outward normal cone $N_S(x^*)$
  so that projections lie in $S$. (i.e. finite identification)
  Moreover, under appropriate conditions,
  convergence is locally quadratic if the Hessian restricted to the
  tangent $T_S(x^*)$ is strongly convex and we use a Newton-like projected
  gradient method.},

  Gives central limit theorems (and uniform variants) by showing a sequence
  of $g(X_{n-l}, ..., X_n)$ has a Martingale structure. Does not
  show \emph{what} distributions are or formulae for variance, but that
  is non-trivial.},

                  estimators based on the mixing times of different
                  stochastic processes. Hong's addendum: Gives a rate
                  for a functional CLT type theorem with slower than
                  parametric rate for beta-mixing (absolutely regular)
                  sequences under bounds on metric entropy. Shows that
                  there is a deterioration in the rate for slowly
                  mixing sequences.  In particular, this happens for
                  beta_n = n^{-r} with 0 <= r < 1. If r > 1,
                  ArconesYu94 shows a Donsker theorem.}

comment = {Shows that the convergence rate of RKHS-based estimators is
  controlled by the "effective dimensionality" of the problem. This is defined
  by $D_\lambda = \tr((\Sigma + \lambda I)^{-1} \Sigma)$, where
  $\Sigma$ is the expectation of the outer product of the kernel evaluator
  (i.e. if $\xi_x = K(x, \cdot)$, then $\Sigma = \E[\xi_x \otimes \xi_x]$).
  Equivalently, $\Sigma$ can be taken as the matrix of eigenvalues of the
  kernel operator. The bias-variance tradeoff is shown to scale as
  $\lambda + D_\lambda / n$, where $n$ is the number of samples.

  The proof techniques require the loss to basically look like a regression
  loss (strongly convex and smooth), and then argue that the corresponding
  empirical covariance matrices concentrate at rates dependent on
  $D_\lambda$.

Shows how to maintain some privacy (in a different notion than differential)
when solving high-dimensional linear regression problems. Uses a random
matrix to transform data from n to $m \ll n$ examples in the same number
of dimensions; under some constraints this still yields sparsistency and
persistency. Shows that with some sampling matrices, it is possible to
achieve mutual information per-entry (i.e. the average mutual information
normalized by $np$) decreasing as $m/n$. (Their analyses require $m = log(np)$
or $m = log^2(np)$ for sparsistency/persistency, respectively.)
No notion of whether privacy could be made better/more optimal for different
sampling matrices. Does give privacy between data revealed to statistician
and the data itself, though.

  Shows that PCA can be solved even after a perturbation of data of the form
  $X' = \Phi X$, where $\Phi$ is an $m\times n$ matrix of i.i.d.\ normals
  and $m \le n$. Differential privacy can be achieved in this model, but
  not clear if results are sharp. Also somewhat badly written.
  One nice thing is that data only needs to be released one time, so after
  the perturbation, many problems may be solved.

 {With the increase in available data parallel machine learning has become an
   in- creasingly pressing problem. In this paper we present the first
   parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm including a detailed
   analysis and experimental evi- dence. Unlike prior work on parallel
   optimization algorithms 5, 7 our variant comes with parallel acceleration
   guarantees and it poses no overly tight latency constraints, which might
   only be available in the multicore setting. Our analysis introduces a
   novel proof technique contractive mappings to quantify the speed of
   convergence of parameter distributions to their asymptotic limits. As a
   side effect this answers the question of how quickly stochastic gradient
   descent algorithms reach the asymptotically normal regime 1, 8.},
