\label{pepfliteraturereview}
EPF has emerged as a critical research area due to the increasing complexity and volatility of electricity markets. Accurate forecasting is essential for market participants to make informed decisions, mitigate financial risks, and optimise operations. Probabilistic forecasting methods, in particular, address the inherent uncertainties in these markets by providing PIs rather than single-point estimates, allowing stakeholders to assess the range of potential outcomes. Table \ref{TableLR} provides a comprehensive summary of the literature on probabilistic EPF methods, highlighting the evolution from traditional point forecasts to advanced probabilistic techniques, including QR and CP. This section critically examines the role of forecasting in electricity spot markets, foundational concepts of uncertainty in EPF, recent advancements in probabilistic methods, and the growing role of CP as an alternative framework, while evaluating their strengths, limitations, and practical implications.

\subsection{Electricity Spot Markets}
%Day-Ahead Market
The DAM is a cornerstone of electricity trading, where market participants submit bids for electricity trades up to one day in advance, with the bidding process closing in the afternoon to determine market-clearing prices and volumes based on supply, demand, and grid constraints ____. 
While the DAM enhances cross-border electricity trading and grid stability, it faces challenges from forecast uncertainties driven by the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar ____. These challenges necessitate advanced forecasting models capable of managing the variability introduced by weather-dependent renewables, such as privacy-preserving frameworks that enhance accuracy by integrating diverse data sources ____. Initially dominated by traditional statistical methods, forecasting has shifted toward advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, which excel at capturing the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in electricity markets ____. Hybrid approaches combining ML with other techniques have further improved precision, particularly in modelling supply-demand dynamics and adapting to varying market conditions ____.

%Intra-Day Market
The IDM is crucial for real-time electricity trading, bridging the DAM and BM by allowing continuous trading up to a few hours before delivery. This enables participants to adjust their positions in response to unforeseen events, such as plant outages or fluctuations in renewable energy output ____. In contrast to the DAM's hourly settlement intervals, the IDM allows trades in 30-minute blocks, notably in markets like the Irish Single Electricity Market.The IDM's real-time nature necessitates advanced forecasting models capable of accurately predicting short-term price movements. These challenges necessitate advanced forecasting models capable of managing the variability introduced by weather-dependent renewables ____, with explainable frameworks helping ensure adaptability and reliability in dynamic conditions ____. Traditional statistical methods ____ have shown success in processing large datasets and adapting to the market's dynamic conditions. Additionally, in markets with a high penetration of renewable energy, the IDM optimises trading strategies by enabling participants to refine their actions in near real-time, thereby mitigating risks associated with price volatility ____. Although the BM shares several structural similarities with the IDM—particularly in their real-time nature and focus on short-term trading—our work centres primarily on the BM due to its finer granularity and its role in balancing supply and demand in real-time.

%Balancing Market
Despite the importance of the BM in maintaining equilibrium between supply and demand, the literature on BM forecasting is relatively underdeveloped compared to that of the DAM and IDM. The BM plays a key role in balancing supply and demand with finer granularity than the IDM, particularly when responding to the fluctuations associated with renewable energy ____. Accurate BM price forecasts are essential, especially where large-scale energy storage is not viable ____. Studies have compared various forecasting models and their performance in BM settings, typically with limited horizons. Probabilistic forecasting methods for BM prices, such as those proposed by ____, show promise but suggest further enhancements and integration into bidding strategies. Notably, existing research often lacks critical analysis and broader context. Recent studies, including ____ and ____, explore diverse models for BM price forecasting, with simpler models often outperforming the more complex ML and DL models. These studies highlight the need for continued research to address current limitations and explore emerging methodologies, ensuring sharp and reliable BM price predictions. Given the challenges of renewable energy integration and market volatility, European electricity market reforms increasingly prioritise resilient mechanisms ____.
