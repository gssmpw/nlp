\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

A \emph{language} is a set $L\subseteq \bin^*$.
A language $L$ is contained in $\Sigma^p_k$ iff there exists some polynomial-time computable function $V$ (verifier), and $m_1,m_2,\ldots, m_k = \poly(|w|)$ such that for all $w \in \set{0,1}^*$
\[
    w \in L \ \Leftrightarrow \ \exists y_1 \in \set{0,1}^{m_1} \ \forall y_2 \in \set{0,1}^{m_2} \ldots \ Q y_k \in \set{0,1}^{m_k}: V(w,y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_k) = 1,
\]
where $Q = \exists$, if $k$ is odd, and $Q = \forall$, if $k$ even.

An introduction to the polynomial hierarchy and the classes $\Sigma^p_k$ can be found in the book by Papadimitriou \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0072413} or in the article by Jeroslow \cite{DBLP:journals/mp/Jeroslow85}.
An introduction specifically in the context of bilevel optimization can be found in the article of Woeginger \cite{DBLP:journals/4or/Woeginger21}.

A \emph{many-one-reduction} or \emph{Karp-reduction} from a language $L$ to a language $L'$ is a map $f : \bin^* \to \bin^*$ such that $w \in L$ iff $f(w) \in L'$ for all $w \in \bin^*$. 
A language $L$ is $\Sigma^p_k$-hard, if every $L' \in \Sigma^p_k$ can be reduced to $L$ with a polynomial-time many-one reduction. If $L$ is both $\Sigma^p_k$-hard and contained in $\Sigma^p_k$, it is $\Sigma^p_k$-complete.

For some cost function $c : U \to \R$, and some subset $U' \subseteq U$, we define the cost of the subset $U'$ as $c(U') := \sum_{u \in U'} c(u)$. For a map $f : A \to B$ and some subset $A' \subseteq A$, we define the image of the subset $A'$ as $f(A') = \set{f(a) : a \in A'}$.
