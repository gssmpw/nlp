  abstract = {Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) is crucial in various scientific disciplines. While CSP can be addressed by employing currently-prevailing generative models (**e.g.** diffusion models), this task encounters unique challenges owing to the symmetric geometry of crystal structures---the invariance of translation, rotation, and periodicity. To incorporate the above symmetries, this paper proposes DiffCSP, a novel diffusion model to learn the structure distribution from stable crystals. To be specific, DiffCSP jointly generates the lattice and atom coordinates for each crystal by employing a periodic-E(3)-equivariant denoising model, to better model the crystal geometry. Notably, different from related equivariant generative approaches, DiffCSP leverages fractional coordinates other than Cartesian coordinates to represent crystals, remarkably promoting the diffusion and the generation process of atom positions. Extensive experiments verify that our DiffCSP remarkably outperforms existing CSP methods, with a much lower computation cost in contrast to DFT-based methods. Moreover, the superiority of DiffCSP is still observed when it is extended for ab initio crystal generation.},

  abstract = {Crystals are the foundation of numerous scientific and industrial applications. While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for crystal generation, existing methods neglect the spacegroup constraint which is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to many desirable properties. However, considering spacegroup constraint is challenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce the spacegroup constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more tractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we translate the spacegroup constraint into two cases: the basis constraint of the invariant exponential space of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position constraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then propose DiffCSP++, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work DiffCSP by further taking spacegroup constraint into account. Experiments on several popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the spacegroup constraint, and show that our DiffCSP++ achieves the best or comparable performance on crystal structure prediction and ab initio crystal generation.},

  abstract = {Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.},
