    \caption{Selection of a three examples out of \ourmodel generated crystal structures close to or below the convex hull of WBM and Materials Project (MP). Displaying the energy above hull $E_{hull}\ [eV]$ relative to the convex hull of WBM and MP combined. (a) has a formation energy of $E_{form} = -2.610$ the resulting in $E_{hull}$ being negative distinctly below hull. In comparison with the convex hull structure (a) is indeed below the hull, highlighted with the green star in the phase diagram. (b) has a formation energy of $E_{form} = -2.537$, resulting in a negative $E_{hull}$ but insignificantly far from the hull. (c) has a formation energy of $E_{form} = -1.422$ which makes the $E_{hull}$ approximately zero. Comparing (b) and (c) with the convex hull shows that the structures are on the hull, indicated by the smaller stars.}
