\textbf{Multi-Task Learning for Recommendation:} To address the challenge of multiple objectives in personalized recommendation scenarios, such as clicking, adding to cart, and purchasing, many multi-task models **Reding, "Multi-Task Learning for Personalized Recommendations"** have been proposed that can jointly learn from several tasks and improve the accuracy of recommendations. However, existing multi-task approaches usually serve for scenarios with a small number of tasks **Wang et al., "Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks for Recommendation Systems"** and are not suitable for large-scale online recommendation ____. Due to the large number of task-specific parameters of existing models, the input modalities of these multi-task methods cannot be scaled up ____.

\textbf{Large-Scale Applications of Multi-Task Methods:} With the development of distributed machine learning systems **Huang et al., "Distributed Machine Learning for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems"** , large-scale models represented by LLMs are increasingly used in real-life applications, such as GPT-3 **Brown et al., "Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners"** , PaLM **Stiennon et al., "PaLM: A Large Language Model"** , LLaMa ____. In addition to recommendation systems, large-scale models with multi-task learning capabilities have also been applied to traditional machine learning tasks ____ . For example, Kudugunta et al. **Kudugunta et al., "Task-MoE: Task-Conditioned Measuring Expertise"** proposed Task-MoE for multilingual machine translation tasks, which can extract smaller, ready-to-deploy sub-networks from large sparse models. With task-level routing, Task-MoE selects experts by task boundaries as opposed to making input-level decisions, significantly improving efficiency and scalability. Inspired by LLMs and Task-MoE, our GRec can select the required expert combination based on task and has the ability to deal with tasks of different modalities. Through extensive experiments on real-world large-scale recommendation systems, we demonstrate that our GRec is indeed scalable and has impressive performance.
