From our results in \tab{overall_metrics} and \tab{mae-cov}, GHOST dominates performance across the board, in both well accepted OSR and OOD metrics (AUOSCR, FPR95, AUROC) as well as in class-wise fairness.
We present additional OSCR and ROC curves in the supplemental for interested readers to verify the consistency of our results on area-based metrics.

\subsection{Testing the Gaussian Hypothesis}
To empirically test the Gaussian hypothesis, we use the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality with Holm's step-down procedure for family-wise error control \cite{trawinski2012nonparametric}. 
For MAE-H and ConvNeXtV2-H, pretrained networks, only 2.79\% and 3.13\% of per-class distributions rejected the null hypothesis (normality), consistent with expected 95\% confidence. 
Tests on Swin-T and DenseNet-121 rejected normality for 0.56\% and 8.27\% of the distributions, indicating the Gaussian assumption does not hold for every class in every network, but it still generally holds. 
We include the results for these additional networks in the supplemental material.

Additionally, GHOST could be adapted to use full covariance matrices and mahalanobis distance, but we leave this adaptation for future work.
