\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we make the first effort to theoretically explore the explicit user preferences-aware MO-MAB. Motivated by real-world applications, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this problem under unknown preference and hidden preference environments, with tailored algorithms achieving provably near-optimal regrets.
