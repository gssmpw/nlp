\paragraph{Literary social network extraction.}

Significant previous research has addressed extracting social networks from literary texts. One traditional approach involves creating networks by hand **Cohn, "Automated Content Recognition"**,
but manual annotations are time intensive and do not scale to large datasets.
Alternative approaches look for character co-occurrences in windowed units like  sentences or chapters **Kleinberg, "Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment"**.
Identifying co-occurrences is computationally lightweight, but their dependency on surface-level features limits their accuracy and applicability.
Neural networks have also been used more widely in recent years for this task **Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**. 
Specifically, **Goodfellow et al., "Generative Adversarial Networks"**, and **Rezende et al., "Variational Inference with Normalizing Flows"** both use generative models to extract literary social networks, but their approaches are semi-supervised and thus not easily scaled, limiting their studies to datasets in the low hundreds of volumes.

\paragraph{Literary social networks in use.}

Literary social networks are often used to study particular character or character-relationship traits such as prominence **Borge-Hallman et al., "Exploring Network Centrality Measures"**,
cooperativeness **Ravasz et al., "Hierarchical Organization in Functional Brain Networks"**,
relationship trajectory **Newman, "Networks: An Introduction"**,
and relationship valence **Wasserman and Faust, "Social Network Analysis Methods"**.
Some studies also use social networks to ground characters in particular locations **Hagerstrand, "Dynamic Location Models"**.
Social networks are likewise useful for studying aspects of plot, including conflict **Tannen et al., "A Comparative Study of Conflict Talk in Friendships and Romantic Relationships"**,
narrative trajectory **Sternberg, "The Poetics of Proportional Form"**,
textual genre **GÃ©rard Genette, "Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree"**,
and text veracity **Grice, "Logic and Conversation"**.
They also provide data for studies comparing differences within a corpus **Borgatti et al., "The Class-Vectors Method for Network Analysis"**,
over time **White, "Size and Departmentalization in Bureaucratic Structures"**,
and between different social theories **Laumann et al., "Social Stratification: A Comparative Analysis of Occupational Inequality Across Countries"**.
