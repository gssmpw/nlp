\section{Related Work}
Interactive drama driven by computer systems has been proposed for quite a long time \citep{DBLP:journals/sigart/BatesLR91,DBLP:books/daglib/0081917}.
More recently, \citet{DBLP:conf/acl/WuWJL0024} first discuss LLM-based interactive drama, defining its six primary elements. The director-actor architecture is first used in \citet{DBLP:conf/acl/HanCLXY24}, while \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2408-01725} model a single character with an ego and a superego to capture its development. In our work, we employ a director agent to program the plots periodically. \citet{DBLP:conf/acl/WuWJL0024} propose a curriculum learning method to fine-tune the role agents. Our work, in parallel, proposes a comprehensive framework suitable for any LLMs.

\paragraph{AI-Generated Stories}
It has been widely used in recent years to scale the training performance by using AI-generated data \citep{DBLP:conf/acl/WangKMLSKH23,DBLP:conf/emnlp/LeePSWJ23,DBLP:conf/acl/WuWJL0024}.
Our research focuses on the use of LLMs to assist humans in creating high-quality literature, such as poetry \citep{DBLP:conf/emnlp/OrmazabalAASA22,DBLP:conf/emnlp/ChakrabartyP022}, music \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2210-13944,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-12982}, stories \citep{DBLP:conf/naacl/TanYAXH21,DBLP:conf/emnlp/TianHLJSCMP24}. Our method generates a story given a short paragraph. This is more challenging than generating the drama script given a complete story \citep{DBLP:conf/aaai/ZhaoZ0ZL0024}.

\paragraph{Simulating Dramatic Characters with LLM Agents}
Recent years emerges many companion-oriented AI applications such as \texttt{character.ai}, where LLM agents are developed to simulate various characters \citep{DBLP:journals/nature/ShanahanMR23,DBLP:conf/emnlp/ShaoLDQ23,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2407-11484,DBLP:conf/acl/Lu0ZZ24}. A new request arises, players are not satisfied with aimless conversations, but would like to go through a story, an adventure with AI, indicating the very need for our research, which connects NLP with research in psychology \citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2408-01725}, art \citep{DBLP:conf/chi/MirowskiMPE23}, and narratology \citep{todorov1969grammaire}.
Dramatic characters evolve over time, undergoing shifting inner motivations, which greatly distinguishes them from conversational agents.
