\section{Limitations and Future Work}\label{app:limitations}

The major limitation of our work lies in the assumption that $\mathcal{P}\approx 1$. When the coupling is strong, the guidance VF no longer has the correct direction. 
In future works, we plan to address this problem by estimating $\mathcal{P}$, which enables guidance for flow matching models with exact coupling. 
In addition, we plan to improve the specific guidance methods. For example, $g^{\text{MC}}$ suffers from the low sample efficiency on high-dimensional datasets, so more advanced Monte Carlo sampling methods may be adopted. 
Besides, guided VF $v'_t(x_t)$ can be chosen to have different properties, such as the straightness of the VF. In this way, there may be add-on VFs that facilitate the sampling efficiency, which we also leave for future work.
