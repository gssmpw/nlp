\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have proposed the first framework for general flow matching guidance, from which new MC-based guidance $g^{\text{MC}}$, many approximate guidance, and learned guidance $g_\phi$, are derived, all of them verified by experiments. Many classical guidance methods have been covered as special cases, and we provided theoretical derivation for each guidance method. A discussion on the limitation and future work is provided in Appendix \ref{app:limitations}. We believe this work will facilitate the application of flow matching by opening novel design spaces of its guidance methods.
