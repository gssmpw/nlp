This section introduces a new risk measure that provides a tractable alternative to existing risk measures available in the literature. We provide a simpler, yet robust, alternative that allows us later to tackle the constrained existence of equilibria in multiplayer settings.
 %In the general case where the base of the exponent is the Euler's constant $e$, the problem is decidable only subject to Shanuel's conjecture.
%The situation does not improve significantly, with the problem being both $\NP$-hard and $\SQRTSUM$-hard even when the base of the exponent is rational.

%\subsubsection*{Some results for $(P,O)$-equilibria}
% Given a Markov decision process $\MDProc$, a strategy $\sigma$ defines a probability distribution $\prob_\sigma$, and therefore a pessimistic expectation $\pexp(\sigma)$ and an optimistic expectation $\oexp(\sigma)$.



% Since all vertices are stochastic, a Markov chain defines a probability distribution $\prob_\MChain$ on the set of infinite paths in the graph $(V, E)$ starting from $v_0$, as follows: for every path $v_0 v_1 \dots v_n$, we have:
% $$\prob_\MChain\left(v_0 \dots v_{n-1} \Paths_\infty(\MChain_{\|v_n})\right) = \p(v_0v_1) \p(v_1v_2) \dots \p(v_{n-1}v_n).$$
% Note that the probability measure that is thus defined is unique, by TODO\theju{Check what this is? Move to prelims?}



% \begin{definition}[Pessimistic and optimistic optimality, $(P, O)$-equilibrium]
%     The strategy $\sigma$ is \emph{pessimistically optimal} in the MDP $\MDProc_{\|v_0}$ if and only if for every strategy $\sigma'$, we have $\pexp_{\sigma'}[\mu] \leq \pexp_{\sigma}[\mu]$.
%     Similarly, it is \emph{optimistically optimal} if for every alternative strategy $\sigma'$, we have $\oexp_{\sigma'}[\mu] \leq \oexp_{\sigma}[\mu]$.

%     Let us now consider a game $\Game_{\|v_0}$, and a partition $(P, O)$ of $\Pi$, in which the elements of $P$ are called \emph{pessimists}, and the elements of $O$ are called \emph{optimists}.
%     Then, a strategy profile $\bsigma$ is a $(P, O)$-equilibrium if and only if each strategy $\sigma_i$ with $i \in P$ is pessimistically optimal, and each strategy $\sigma_i$ with $i \in O$ is optimistically optimal.
