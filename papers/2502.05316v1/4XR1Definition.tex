Let us consider a random variable $X$ that ranges over $\Rb$. 
%We define the \emph{extreme pessimistic risk-measure} or just \emph{pessimistic risk} below, but first provide an intuition. 
The \emph{pessimistic risk measure} of $X$ is the highest value $x$ such that $X$ almost-surely takes a value above $x$.
When $X$ takes finitely many values, that corresponds to the least value that it takes with positive probability.
In probability theory, that measure is sometimes referred to as \emph{essential infimum}, written $\essinf$.
The definition of \emph{optimistic risk measure} is symmetric.
%the lowest value that a random variable takes with positive probability. To capture this, we use the notion of $\essinf$.

\begin{definition}[Optimistic, pessimistic risk measure]
The pessimistic risk measure of a random variable $X$ is defined by
$\pexp[X] = \essinf(X) = \sup \{x \in X ~|~ \prob(X \geq x) = 1\}$.
Analogously,  the \emph{optimistic risk measure} of $X$ is $\oexp[X] = \esssup(X) =  \inf \{x \in X ~|~ \prob(X \leq x) = 1\}$.    
\end{definition}

%When the set of values that the variable $X$ can take with non-zero probability is finite, those simply correspond, respectively, to the minimum and the maximum of these values.



When we are given a game $\Game_{\|v_0}$, we can assign an risk measure for each player by defining a partition $(P, O)$ of $\Pi$, where the set $P$ represents the set of players that are \emph{pessimists}, whose perceived payoffs are defined by the pessimistic risk measure, while $O$ represents the \emph{optimists}, who intend to maximise their optimistic risk measure.
For convenience, we group both measures under the umbrella term \emph{extreme risk measure (XR)}, and often assume that $(P, O)$ is given; % where extreme risk measure corresponds to either the extreme pessimistic or the extreme optimistic risk measure, depending on player.  
then, we write $\X_i$ for $\pexp$ when $i \in P$, and for $\oexp$ when $i \in O$.
Since each player $i$ is usually interested only in the risk measure of their own payoff, we will also write $\X_i(\bsigma)$ for the quantity $\X_i(\bsigma)[\mu_i]$.
We define \emph{extreme risk-sensitive equilibria}, or XRSEs for short, as $(\X_i)_i$-RSEs.


% For a multi-player stochastic game with players $\Pi$, and a partition $(P,O)$ of the players $\Pi$ then assigns an extreme risk-measure for each player: the pessimistic risk measure for players $i\in P$ and the optimistic risk measure otherwise. 
%Therefore, any partition  $(P,O)$ of the players $\Pi$ gives rise to a risk measures for each player and therefore also a notion of risk sensitive equilibria. We call a strategy profile a $(P,O)$-Risk sensitive equilibrium or a $(P,O)$-RSE for a partition of the players $(P,O)$.
