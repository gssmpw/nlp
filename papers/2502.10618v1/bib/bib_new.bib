Large language models (LLMs) have emerged recently and show great promise for providing on-demand help at a large scale, but there are concerns that students may over-rely on the outputs produced by these models. In this paper, we introduce CodeHelp, a novel LLM-powered tool designed with guardrails to provide on-demand assistance to programming students without directly revealing solutions. We detail the design of the tool, which incorporates a number of useful features for instructors, and elaborate on the pipeline of prompting strategies we use to ensure generated outputs are suitable for students. To evaluate CodeHelp, we deployed it in a first-year computer and data science course with 52 students and collected student interactions over a 12-week period. We examine students' usage patterns and perceptions of the tool, and we report reflections from the course instructor and a series of recommendations for classroom use. Our findings suggest that CodeHelp is well-received by students who especially value its availability and help with resolving errors, and that for instructors it is easy to deploy and complements, rather than replaces, the support that they provide to students.},

Worked-examples research is a cognitive-experimental program that has relevance to classroom instruction and the broader educational research community. A frame- work for organizing the findings of this research is proposed, leading to instructional design principles. For instance, one instructional design principle suggests that effective examples have highly integrated components. They employ multiple modalities in presentation and emphasize conceptual structure by labeling or segmenting. At the lesson level, effective instruction employs multiple examples for each conceptual problem type, varies example formats within problem type, and employs surface features to signal deep structure. Also, examples should be presented in close proximity to matched practice problems. More- over, learners can be encouraged through direct training or by the structure of the worked example to actively self:explain examples. Worked examples are associated with early stages of skill development, but the design principles are relevant to constructivist research and teaching. }

abstract="This paper explores the fields of interest of the computer science education (CSE) community during the 12 years between 2006--2018 as reflected in the professional content of SIGCSE conferences. For this purpose, we investigated four SIGCSE conferences---2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018---and identified main topics and themes addressed in the following three presentation formats: papers, panels, and special sessions. We defined five content categories derived from the different presentation content: teaching methods, curricula, CSE research, recruitment and retention, and educators. The paper compares the four conferences according to two main classifications (1) content categorization, according to the above content categories we defined; and (2) the most frequent keywords used by the authors to describe their work. These keywords were divided into three themes: CS curricula, CS topics, and pedagogy. Our analysis reveals that: (1) according to the content categorization, teaching methods received the most attention from the SIGCSE community, with curricula coming in second, at a substantial distance; (2) according to keywords categorization: (a) the most frequently used CS curricula keywords relate to CS1, followed by, at a significant gap, CS0 and K-12, following by computational thinking and interdisciplinary studies; (b) it is difficult to identify the most frequently used CS topics keywords (c) in relation to the pedagogy characteristic, the most frequently used keywords are: assessment, active learning, and team collaboration. In future work, we intend to check the consistency of the current findings with other journals and conferences in which the CSE community publishes its work.",

abstract = {Most programming problems have multiple viable solutions that organize the underlying problem's tasks in fundamentally different ways. Which organizations (a.k.a. plans) students implement and prefer depends on solutions they have seen before as well as features of their programming language. How much exposure to planning do students need before they can appreciate and produce different plans? We report on a study in which students in introductory courses at two universities were given a single lecture on planning between assessments. In the post-assessment, many students produced multiple high-level plans (including ones first introduced in the lecture) and richly discussed tradeoffs between plans. This suggests that planning can be taught with fairly low overhead once students have a decent foundation in programming.},

abstract = {With more and more web scripting languages on offer, programmers have access to increasing language support for web scraping tasks. However, in our experiences collaborating with data scientists, we learned that two issues still plague long-running scraping scripts: i) When a network or website goes down mid-scrape, recovery sometimes requires restarting from the beginning, which users find frustratingly slow. ii) Websites do not offer atomic snapshots of their databases; they update their content so frequently that output data is cluttered with slight variations of the same information — e.g., a tweet from profile 1 that is retweeted on profile 2 and scraped from both profiles, once with 52 responses then later with 53 responses. We introduce the skip block, a language construct that addresses both of these disparate problems. Programmers write lightweight annotations to indicate when the current object can be considered equivalent to a previously scraped object and direct the program to skip over the scraping actions in the block. The construct is hierarchical, so programs can skip over long or short script segments, allowing adaptive reuse of prior work. After network and server failures, skip blocks accelerate failure recovery by 7.9x on average. Even scripts that do not encounter failures benefit; because sites display redundant objects, skipping over them accelerates scraping by up to 2.1x. For longitudinal scraping tasks that aim to fetch only new objects, the second run exhibits an average speedup of 5.2x. Our small user study reveals that programmers can quickly produce skip block annotations.},

However, in formative interviews with social scientists, we learned that current PBD tools are insufficient for many real-world web scraping tasks. The missing piece is the capability to collect hierarchically-structured data from across many different webpages. We present Rousillon, a programming system for writing complex web automation scripts by demonstration. Users demonstrate how to collect the first row of a 'universal table' view of a hierarchical dataset to teach Rousillon how to collect all rows. To offer this new demonstration model, we developed novel relation selection and generalization algorithms. In a within-subject user study on 15 computer scientists, users can write hierarchical web scrapers 8 times more quickly with Rousillon than with traditional programming.},

An alternative is to write scripts that pull data through APIs. This provides a cleaner way to access data than scraping; however, APIs are effortful for programmers and nigh-impossible for non-programmers to use. In this work, we empower users to access APIs without programming. We evolve a schema for declaratively specifying how to interact with a data API. We then develop ScrAPIr: a standard query GUI that enables users to fetch data through any API for which a specification exists, and a second GUI that lets users author and share the specification for a given API. From a lab evaluation, we find that even non-programmers can access APIs using ScrAPIr, while programmers can access APIs 3.8 times faster on average using ScrAPIr than using programming.},

This paper presents an empirical study on the prevalence and severity of API misuse on Stack Overflow. To reduce manual assessment effort, we design ExampleCheck, an API usage mining framework that extracts patterns from over 380K Java repositories on GitHub and subsequently reports potential API usage violations in Stack Overflow posts. We analyze 217,818 Stack Overflow posts using ExampleCheck and find that 31\% may have potential API usage violations that could produce unexpected behavior such as program crashes and resource leaks. Such API misuse is caused by three main reasons---missing control constructs, missing or incorrect order of API calls, and incorrect guard conditions. Even the posts that are accepted as correct answers or upvoted by other programmers are not necessarily more reliable than other posts in terms of API misuse. This study result calls for a new approach to augment Stack Overflow with alternative API usage details that are not typically shown in curated examples.},

In software engineering, however, developers rarely share strategic knowledge for approaching programming problems, in contrast to other artifacts and despite its importance to productivity and success. To understand barriers to sharing, we simulated a programming strategy knowledge-sharing platform, asking experienced developers to articulate a programming strategy and others to use these strategies while providing feedback. Throughout, we asked strategy authors and users to reflect on the challenges they faced. Our analysis revealed that developers could share strategic knowledge. However, they struggled in choosing a level of detail and understanding the diversity of the potential audience. While authors required substantial feedback, users struggled to give it and authors to interpret it. Our results suggest that sharing strategic knowledge differs from sharing code and raises challenging questions about how knowledge-sharing platforms should support search and feedback.},

We review the four central claims of situated learning with respect to education: (1) action is grounded in the concrete situation in which it occurs; (2) knowledge does not transfer between tasks; (3) training by abstraction is of little use; and (4) instruction must be done in complex, social environments. In each case, we cite empirical literature to show that the claims are overstated and that some of the educational implications that have been taken from these claims are misguided. }

Specifically, we studied the instructor solutions to homework and exams from 12 introductory CS courses from nine universities, identifying the presence of 15 patterns throughout the semester. We present results about the relative frequency of the patterns and the order in which the patterns tend to be introduced.},

To investigate the existence of such a population of conversational programmers in practice, we surveyed professionals at a large multinational technology company who were not in software development roles. Based on 3151 survey responses from professionals who never or rarely wrote code, we found that a significant number of them (42.6\%) had invested in learning programming on the job. While many of these respondents wanted to perform traditional end-user programming tasks (e.g., data analysis), we discovered that two top motivations for learning programming were to improve the efficacy of technical conversations and to acquire marketable skillsets. The main contribution of this work is in empirically establishing the existence and characteristics of conversational programmers in a large software development context.},

We present an in-depth case study of first-year management engineering students enrolled in a required introductory programming course at a large North American university. Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.}

In this paper, we explore a novel approach for explaining technical concepts to non-technical users through the design of JargonLite, an interactive dictionary that shows how technical concepts can be used in everyday conversations. We evaluated curated conversation-driven explanations with 12 users who had little or no technical training and wanted to learn about big data concepts. We found that users perceived conversation-driven explanations to be easy to understand and these explanations helped them to maintain focus. We discuss the potential of using conversation-driven explanations as a learning tool for non-technical users and reflect on the advantages and disadvantages of this approach.}

We carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. Among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. However, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. Our findings point to design opportunities in HCI to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.},

Of particular focus is the lived experiences of non-CS (computer science) students who attended the introductory coding courses offered at the university. The research questions of this study are as follows: (1) How do non-CS students describe their learning experience and challenges in self-efficacy beliefs development with respect to their participation in introductory coding education? (2) How are faculty integrating introductory coding education into academic programs for non-CS students? Data collection included semi-structured interviews, document review of course syllabi, review of course projects, as well as review of assignments. Participants for the interviews included six non-CS students who attended introductory coding courses, and three faculty members who have taught introductory coding courses or worked in academic programs that included introductory education at the research site. Data was analyzed using descriptive coding and revealed the presence of an informal student hierarchy in the introductory coding courses. Unhelpful feedback from teaching assistants and instructors have failed to help some of the students develop coding self-efficacy, while learning from online resources through self-help and working with non-CS peers helped rebuild their self-efficacy. The students also reported successful transfer of learning to other courses or attempted to study advanced topics in coding outside the regular university curriculum. Interestingly, students who failed to gain coding self-efficacy were not afraid to transfer their learning to other courses.}

However, existing instructional materials don’t meet the needs of conversational programmers because they prioritize syntax and semantics over concepts and applications. This mismatch results in feelings of failure and low self-efficacy. To motivate conversational programmers, we propose purpose-first programming, a new approach that focuses on learning a handful of domain-specific code patterns and assembling them to create authentic and useful programs. We report on the development of a purpose-first programming prototype that teaches five patterns in the domain of web scraping. We show that learning with purpose-first programming is motivating for conversational programmers because it engenders a feeling of success and aligns with these learners’ goals. Purpose-first programming learning enabled novice conversational programmers to complete scaffolded code writing, debugging, and explaining activities after only 30 minutes of instruction.},

The proposed teaching method utilizes the story aligned with the history of AI, visual feedback, and agile practices to overcome the challenges the non-technical adults face. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed teaching method by the open coding method and by the paired t-test over the responses to the questions based on the expectancy-value theory before and after the lecture. We found that this teaching method effectively supported the learners to understand the core technical concepts of AI using authentic tools within a day. We also confirmed that the non-technical adult learners had significantly changed their attitude from initially negative to positive in terms of expected success and value in understanding AI, which is one of the essential outcomes for the learners as they predict the learner’s performance on understanding AI in the future.},

To investigate the motivations, hurdles, and desires of these software developers, we deployed a survey to the website of the TensorFlow.js ML framework. We found via 645 responses that many wanted to learn ML for aspirational reasons rather than for immediate job needs. Critically, developers faced hurdles due to a perceived lack of mathematical and theoretical background. They desired frameworks to provide more basic ML conceptual support, such as a curated corpus of best practices, conceptual tutorials, and a de-mystification of mathematical jargon into practical tips. These findings inform the design of ML frameworks and informal learning resources to broaden the base of people acquiring this increasingly important skill set.},

We seek to improve curricula by enriching it with authentic, real-world contexts and powerful scaffolds that can guide learners to success using automated tools, thereby reducing the strain on limited human instructional resources. To address these issues, we have created the BlockPy programming environment, a web-based, open-access, open-source platform for introductory computing students (https://www.blockpy.com). BlockPy has an embedded data science context that allows learners to connect the educational content with real-world scenarios through meaningful problems. The environment is block-based and gives guiding feedback to learners as they complete problems, but also mediates transfer to more sophisticated programming environments by supporting bidirectional, seamless transitions between block and text programming. Although it can be used as a stand-alone application, the environment has first-class support for the latest Learning Tools Interoperability standards, so that instructors can embed the environment directly within their Learning Management System. In this paper, we describe interesting design issues that we encountered during the development of BlockPy, an evaluation of the environment from fine-grained logs, and our future plans for the environment.},

We compared Poirot to Chrome DevTools in a lab study with 16 design professionals. We observed common problems designers experience when using Chrome DevTools and found that when using Poirot, designers were more successful in accomplishing typical design tasks (97\% to 63\%). In addition, we found that Poirot had a significantly lower perceived cognitive load and was overwhelmingly preferred by the designers in our study.},

As the number of non-technical business professionals who want to improve their participation in technical discussions is increasing, it becomes important to find effective teaching methods for non-technical adults who need to understand core technical concepts in which they are involved reasonably. The proposed teaching method utilizes the active use of visual feedback and agile practices to overcome the challenges the adult learners face. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed teaching method by the open coding method to analyze the free-form responses and by the paired t-test over the responses to the questions asked to the participants before and after the lecture. We found that this teaching method effectively supported the learners to understand the basic technical concepts of AI within one or two-day time frame. We also confirmed the non-technical adult learners had significantly changed their attitude toward understanding AI from initially negative to positive with a good expectation of success in understanding AI, which is one of the important outcomes for the learners as the expectancy-value theory predicts their future performance on understanding AI.},

	Abstract = {Originally intended as a replication study, this study discusses differences in problem solving performance among different domains caused by the same instructional intervention. The learning sciences acknowledges similarities in the learners' cognitive architecture that allow interventions to apply across domains, but it also argues that each domain has characteristics that might affect how interventions impact learning. The present study uses an instructional design technique that had previously improved learners' problem solving performance in programming: subgoal labeled expository text and subgoal labeled worked examples. It intended to replicate this effect for solving problems in statistics and chemistry. However, each of the experiments in the three domains had a different pattern of results for problem solving performance. While the subgoal labeled worked example consistently improved performance, the subgoal labeled expository text, which interacted with subgoal labeled worked examples in programming, had an additive effect with subgoal labeled worked examples in chemistry and no effect in statistics. Differences in patterns of results are believed to be due to complexity of the content to be learned, especially in terms of mapping problem solving procedures to solving problems, and the familiarity of tools used to solve problems in the domain. Subgoal labeled expository text was effective only when students learned more complex content and used unfamiliar problem solving tools.},

Although decades of research have focused on the advantages and disadvantages of concrete and abstract materials considered independently, we argue for an approach that moves beyond this dichotomy and combines their advantages. Specifically, we recommend beginning with concrete materials and then explicitly and gradually fading to the more abstract. Theoretical benefits of this ``concreteness fading'' technique for mathematics and science instruction include (1) helping learners interpret ambiguous or opaque abstract symbols in terms of well-understood concrete objects, (2) providing embodied perceptual and physical experiences that can ground abstract thinking, (3) enabling learners to build up a store of memorable images that can be used when abstract symbols lose meaning, and (4) guiding learners to strip away extraneous concrete properties and distill the generic, generalizable properties. In these ways, concreteness fading provides advantages that go beyond the sum of the benefits of concrete and abstract materials.},

@article{PETKO20121351,
	Abstract = {The `will, skill, tool' model is a well-established theoretical framework that elucidates the conditions under which teachers are most likely to employ information and communication technologies (ICT) in the classroom. Past studies have shown that these three factors explain a very high degree of variance in the frequency of classroom ICT use. The present study replicates past findings using a different set of measures and hones in on possible subfactors. Furthermore, the study examines teacher affiliation for constructivist-style teaching, which is often considered to facilitate the pedagogical use of digital media. The study's survey of 357 Swiss secondary school teachers reveals significant positive correlations between will, skill, and tool variables and the combined frequency and diversity of technology use in teaching. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify relevant subfactors. Five factors account for a total of 60\% of the explained variance in the intensity of classroom ICT use. Computer and Internet applications are more often used by teachers in the classroom when: (1) teachers consider themselves to be more competent in using ICT for teaching; (2) more computers are readily available; (3) the teacher is a form teacher and responsible for the class; (4) the teacher is more convinced that computers improve student learning; and (5) the teacher more often employs constructivist forms of teaching and learning. The impact of constructivist teaching was small, however.},

@article{ap-math-and-STEM,
	Abstract = { Increasing the number of students choosing a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) career is a national educational priority. One way thought to increase interest in STEM is with advanced STEM courses in high school, especially Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Using data from 15,847 college undergraduates, we investigated the relationship between participation in AP mathematics courses (AP Calculus and AP Statistics) and student career interest in STEM. After controlling for covariates, the strongest effect (d = 0.13) showed that students who took AP Calculus had a modestly higher career interest in engineering and mathematics/computer science. However, the relationship between most AP mathematics courses and most STEM career outcomes was negligible. Most differences in outcomes between AP and non-AP students are likely due to preexisting differences between the two groups. },

@article{pre-calc-to-calc,
	Abstract = {This study addresses a longstanding question among high school mathematics teachers and college mathematics professors: Which is the best preparation for college calculus--- (a) a high level of mastery of mathematics considered preparatory for calculus (algebra, geometry, precalculus) or (b) taking calculus itself in high school? We used a data set of 6,207 students of 216 professors at 133 randomly selected U.S. colleges and universities, and hierarchical models controlled for differences in demography and background. Mastery of the mathematics considered preparatory for calculus was found to have more than double the impact of taking a high school calculus course on students' later performance in college calculus, on average. However, students with weaker mathematics preparation gained the most from taking high school calculus.

However, there is no simple answer to whether access to high school calculus should be withheld in favor of more preparation in lower mathematics or should be championed and expanded. This study found that both calculus in high school and a solid mastery of prerequisite mathematics predict later success in introduc- tory college calculus. Either approach helps those planning to take calculus in college. Mastery of algebra, geometry, and precalculus, on average, has more than twice the impact of a high school course in calculus. Yet, taking high school calculus does not appear to handicap students at all but, rather, provides students with an opportunity to strengthen prerequisite knowledge and skills while introducing some of the content of college calculus. We found evidence that the mathematically weaker students who take high school calculus gain more from it, in terms of their college calculus grades, than do their classmates with stronger preparatory backgrounds.},

Bootstrap:Algebra is a curricular module designed to integrate in- troductory computing into an algebra class; the module aims to help students improve on various essential learning outcomes from state and national algebra standards. In prior work, we published initial  ndings about student performance gains on algebra problems after taking Bootstrap. While the results were promising, the dataset was not large, and had students working on algebra problems that had been sca olded with Bootstrap's pedagogy. This paper reports on a more detailed study with (a) data from more than three times as many students, (b) analysis of performance changes in incorrect answers, (c) some problems in which the Bootstrap sca olds have been removed, and (d) an IRT analysis across the elements of Boot- strap's program-design pedagogy. Our results con rm that students improve on algebraic word problems after completing the module, even on unsca olded problems. The nature of incorrect answers to symbolic-form questions also appears to improve after Bootstrap.},

@article{Sleeman:1986ca,
	Abstract = {Programming has been described by many authors as the new Latin of the school syllabus, a kind of mental whetstone for developing minds. As such, it was assumed that students would develop their general problem-solving skills through learning programming. However, reports from teachers of programming and results from some empirical studies now suggest that the teaching of programming has created significant difficulties for high-school and university students, and has failed to catalyze the development of higher order thinking skills. What has gone wrong? Before reviewing the major points of the three articles that follow, I would like to highlight some of the challenges of both teaching and learning programming. The programmer's objective, for novice and expert alike, is first to specify a detailed plan that can be carried out. That is, the programmer has to decompose the initial task. This is not trivial: Many people are quite unable to say how they perform certain tasks. For instance, many students in introductory programming classes are unable to explain how they are able to select the smallest of a series of integers. Next, the programmer must map this plan into the constructs of the target programming language. There are two points to be made about this mapping process. First, for the process to be "clean," the programmer needs to have a very clear idea of the abstract plan and of the constructs available in the programming language. One study of novice programmers showed that many novices had very fuzzy notions about a programming language---substantial misunderstandings had occurred with regard to virtually every construct in the language. Second, task decomposition and program coding are not as neatly decoupled as we might think. A simple example: If arrays are not available in the target programming language, then a plan that assumes this capability would be badly flawed. A thorough knowledge of the facilities provided by the programming language is needed even at the stage of formulating the task plan. Debugging a program is similarly complex and demands a variety of skills, including an ability to coordinate information derived from sources such as error messages, the program plan, the program specification, and the actual code. The three articles in this special section address different aspects of the challenge of programming. John Anderson and Edward Skwarecki's "The Automated Tutoring of Introductory Computer Programming" demonstrates that intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) technology can be a more effective way of teaching introductory programming courses---for certain populations. Specifically, the authors discuss the pedagogical effectiveness of a Lisp tutor developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. Elliot Soloway's "Learning to Program = Learning to Construct Mechanisms and Explanations" challenges conventional wisdom by taking a fresh look at assumptions about the art of programming. Soloway advocates a more explicit approach to the teaching of problem-solving skills, which is based on the actual skills experienced programmers use in addressing real tasks. Recent experiments have suggested that the domain knowledge of experienced programmers is organized in a radically different way from the domain knowledge of novices; analogous results have also been reported for chess and music. In all cases, experts use larger chunks of knowledge. An important instructional question is how to bring novices up to the expert's level of domain knowledge. Aside from teaching details of the syntax and semantics of a particular programming language, Soloway argues, it is necessary to explicitly and concurrently explain why and how programs work, the goal of any given program, what plan segments are, strategies for decomposing tasks, rules that well-formed programs adhere to, and design strategies. If followed, this approach would produce several radically different types of programming courses. "Boxer: A Reconstructible Computational Medium," by Andrea A. diSessa and Harold Abelson, proposes a radically new kind of computational medium---one that would be highly tailorable, and able to accommodate a wide range of users, from a seven-year-old to an experienced nonprofessional. The authors suggest that students' difficulties may have more to do with the nature of programming than with teaching per se. They describe their current project, Boxer, which is an attempt to provide an environment for a wide spectrum of human activities. The central notion of Boxer is the metaphor of nested "boxes" organized in a hierarchy that gives novices access to explicit and detailed information about the computer environment, but allows proficient programmers to work at the highly abstract and implicit level that is natural to them. All three articles emphasize the need for sensitive experimentation for determining the effectiveness of innovative approaches to the teaching of programming. In the absence of strong and pervasive cognitive theories, it is important to carry out extensive evaluations of all such innovative approaches. We must find out from experience whether well-structured ICAI can be as useful and important as Anderson and Skwarecki suggest; or how we might be able to teach Soloway's high-level problem-solving skills effectively through programming; or how well seven-year-olds will be able to get along with the Boxer system, and for what range of tasks. Any mismatches between observations and expectations will hopefully suggest the next round of new languages and environments, and in turn motivate the next set of observations.},

	Abstract = {Most research in primary and secondary computing education has focused on understanding learners within formal classroom communities, leaving aside the growing number of promising informal online programming communities where young users contribute, comment, and collaborate on programs to facilitate learning. In this article, we examined trends in computational participation in Scratch, an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers. Drawing on a random sample of 5,004 youth programmers and their activities over 3 months in early 2012, we examined programming concepts used in projects in relation to level of participation, gender, and length of membership of Scratch programmers. Latent class analysis results identified the same four groups of programmers in each month based on the usage of different programming concepts and showed how membership in these groups shifted in different ways across time. Strikingly, the largest group of project creators (named Loops) used the simplest and fewest programming concepts. Further, this group was the most stable in membership and was disproportionately female. In contrast, the more complex programming groups (named Variables, Low Booleans, and High Booleans) showed much movement across time. Further, the Low Booleans and High Booleans groups, the only groups to use ``and,'' ``or,'' and ``not'' statements in their programs, were disproportionately male. In the discussion, we address the challenges of analyzing young learners' programming in informal online communities and opportunities for designing more equitable computational participation.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the findings from an OECD International Network on Financial Education pilot
study undertaken in 14 countries. The analysis focuses on variations in financial knowledge, behaviour and
attitude across countries and within countries by socio-demographics.
The results highlight a lack of financial knowledge amongst a sizeable proportion of the population in
each of the countries surveyed. Furthermore, there is considerable room for improvement in terms of
financial behaviour. Attitudes are shown to vary widely.
These results will enable countries to identify needs and gaps in financial education provision and
develop national policies or strategies. They also provide a sound evidence base for developing OECD
recommendations and principles.},

	Abstract = {A domain specific language (DSL) allows one to
develop software for a particular application domain
quickly and effectively, yielding programs that are
easy to understand, reason about, and maintain. On
the other hand, there may be a significant overhead
in creating the infrastructure needed to support a
DSL. To solve this problem, a methodology is described
for building domain specific embedded languages
(DSELs), in which a DSL is designed within
an existing, higher-order and typed, programming language
such as Haskell or ML. In addition, techniques
are described for building modular interpreters and
tools for DSELs. The resulting methodology facilitates
reuse of syntax, semantics, implementation code, software
tools, as well as look-and-feel.
Keywords: software reuse, modularity, abstraction,
domain specific lang},

These mechanisms have been significantly improved in the latest versions of UML. Unfortunately, there is currently a dearth of published material on how to best exploit these capabilities and, consequently, many UML profiles are either invalid or of poor quality. In this paper, we first provide an overview of the new extensibility mechanisms of UML 2.1 and then describe a method for defining profiles that greatly increases the likelihood of producing technically correct quality UML profiles},

@article{van2002domain,
	Abstract = {A domain-specific language DSL
provides a notation
tailored towards an application domain and is based on
the relevant concepts and features of that domain. As
such, a DSL is a means to describe and generate members
of a family of programs in the domain.
A prerequisite for the design of a DSL is a detailed analysis
and structuring of the application domain. Graphical
feature diagrams have been proposed to organize the dependencies
between such features, and to indicate which
ones are common to all family members and which ones
vary.
In this paper, we study feature diagrams in more details,
as well as their relationship to domain-specific languages.
We propose the Feature Description Language
FDL,
a textual language to describe features. We
explore automated manipulation of feature descriptions
such as normalization, expansion to disjunctive normal
form, variability computation and constraint satisfaction.
Feature descriptions can be directly mapped to UML
diagrams which in their turn can be used for Java code
generation. The value of FDL is assessed via a case study
in the use and expressiveness of feature descriptions for
the area of documentation generators.},

	Abstract = {The field of computer science (CS) is currently experiencing a surge in undergraduate degree production and course enrollments, which is straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern among faculty and administrators about how best to respond to the rapidly growing demand. There is also significant interest about what this growth will mean for the future of CS programs, the role of computer science in academic institutions, the field as a whole, and U.S. society more broadly.\n\nAssessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments seeks to provide a better understanding of the current trends in computing enrollments in the context of past trends. It examines drivers of the current enrollment surge, relationships between the surge and current and potential gains in diversity in the field, and the potential impacts of responses to the increased demand for computing in higher education, and it considers the likely effects of those responses on students, faculty, and institutions. This report provides recommendations for what institutions of higher education, government agencies, and the private sector can do to respond to the surge and plan for a strong and sustainable future for the field of CS in general, the health of the institutions of higher education, and the prosperity of the nation.},

classroom that can help us organize the research problems in this area and the articles in this issue. The
framework connects concepts such as: expert consensus model, target model, intermediate models,
preconceptions, learning processes, and natural reasoning skills. By connecting and elaborating on
these major areas, the articles in this issue have succeeded in moving us another step toward having
a theory of conceptual change that can provide guidance to teachers in the form of instructional prin- ciples. Taken together, the articles remind us that individual cognition, while not the only factor in
learning, is a central determining feature of learning. However, we must work to further develop the
present partial theory of conceptual change to fill in the missing cognitive core of the present shell.},

	Abstract = {This book describes new, model based teaching methods in science instruction and presents research results on their characteristics and effectiveness. It includes discussions of teaching methods based on evidence from a very diverse group of settings: middle school biology, high school physics, and college chemistry classrooms. Mental models in these areas such as understanding the structure of the lungs or cells, molecular structures and reaction mechanisms in chemistry, or causes of current flow in electricity are notoriously difficult for many students to learn. Yet these lie at the core of conceptual understanding in these areas. Each of the classrooms studied by the authors used recently developed curricula that fostered unusually active learning processes. The curricula were designed to produce flexible mental models in students as a key source of understanding. The studies focus on a variety of teaching strategies such as discrepant questioning, analogies, animations, model competition, and hands on activities. Extensive examples and descriptions of the strategies are included.

A pressing need is to address the problem that many of today's teachers feel pulled in two different directions: on the one hand they are urged to teach content in a broader and deeper way as measured by standardized tests; on the other hand they are urged to adopt student centered inquiry methods. Teachers often feel that these goals are incompatible (Cobb, 1988). The strategies being studied here are midway between pure discovery and lecture approaches and provide models for teachers facing this dilemma. The book reports on research on new instructional strategies for attaining deeper levels of conceptual understanding in science and uses some new diagrammatic representation systems for describing them. Six different levels of organization for teaching strategies are described, from those operating over months (design of the sequence of units in a curriculum) to those operating over minutes ( teaching tactics for guiding discussion minute by minute). Many of the levels have a diagrammatic representation to give a holistic picture of the strategy. Combined with concrete examples of the strategies drawn from real curriculum and classroom teaching exchanges this provides a way to understand each strategy and the combined approach.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: One hundred years after its conception, the scientific method continues
to reinforce a kind of cultural lore about what it means to participate in inquiry. As
commonly implemented in venues ranging from middle school classrooms to undergraduate
laboratories, it emphasizes the testing of predictions rather than ideas, focuses learners on
material activity at the expense of deep subject matter understanding, and lacks epistemic
framing relevant to the discipline. While critiques of the scientific method are not new, its
cumulative effects on learners' conceptions of science have not been clearly articulated.
We discuss these effects using findings from a series of five studies with degree-holding
graduates of our educational system who were preparing to enter the teaching profession
and apprentice their own young learners into unproblematic images of how science is done.
We then offer an alternative vision for investigative science---model-based inquiry (MBI)---
as a system of activity and discourse that engages learners more deeply with content and
embodies five epistemic characteristics of scientific knowledge: that ideas represented in
the form of models are testable, revisable, explanatory, conjectural, and generative. We
represent MBI as an interconnected set of classroom conversations and provide examples
of its implementation and its limitations. C 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 1 -- 27, 2008},

@article{sherin2012some,
	Abstract = {Abstract: This article is concerned with commonsense science knowledge, the informally gained
knowledge of the natural world that students possess prior to formal instruction in a scientific discipline.
Although commonsense science has been the focus of substantial study for more than two decades, there are
still profound disagreements about its nature and origin, and its role in science learning. What is the reason
that it has been so difficult to reach consensus? We believe that the problems run deep; there are difficulties
both with how the field has framed questions and the way that it has gone about seeking answers. In order to
make progress, we believe it will be helpful to focus on one type of research instrument---the clinical
interview---that is employed in the study of commonsense science. More specifically, we argue that we
should seek to understand and model, on a moment-by-moment basis, student reasoning as it occurs in the
interviews employed to study commonsense science. To illustrate and support this claim, we draw on a
corpus of interviews with middle school students in which the students were asked questions pertaining to
the seasons and climate phenomena. Our analysis of this corpus is based on what we call the mode-node
framework. In this framework, student reasoning is seen as drawing on a set of knowledge elements we call
nodes, and this set produces temporary explanatory structures we call dynamic mental constructs.
Furthermore, the analysis of our corpus seeks to highlight certain patterns of student reasoning that occur
during interviews, patterns in what we call conceptual dynamics. These include patterns in which students
can be seen to search through available knowledge (nodes), in which they assemble nodes into an
explanation, and in which they converge on and shift among alternative explanations.  2011 Wiley

	Abstract = {A large body of research in the learning sciences has focused on students' commonsense science knowledge-the everyday knowledge of the natural world that is gained outside of formal instruction. Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, 1-on-1 clinical interviews have played a unique role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts and coded by human analysts. In this article, I explore the application of computational techniques to the analysis of this familiar type of data. I describe the success I have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics-methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this article are primarily methodological in nature: I attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews in a manner that may provide convergent support for the work of human analysts. As a test bed, I draw on transcripts of a corpus of interviews in which 54 middle school students were asked to explain the seasons.},

interviews as windows into student knowledge and thinking. Despite our familiarity with the
interviews, there has been very limited research addressing the ways that students understand
these interactions. In this work we examine students' behaviors and speech patterns in a set of
clinical interviews about chemistry for evidence of their tacit understandings and underlying
expectations about the activity in which they are engaged. We draw on the construct of framing
from anthropology and sociolinguistics and identify clusters of behaviors that indicate that
students may alternatively frame the interview as Inquiry, an Oral Examination, or an Expert
Interview. We present two examples of students shifting between frames during the course of
individual interviews. By examining the surrounding interaction we identify both conceptual and
epistemological interviewer cues that facilitate and constrain frame shifts. We discuss the
implications of dynamic student framing, that is identifiable in student behaviors and discourse,
for researchers who use clinical interviews to map student's intuitive science knowledge.},

Described here is a software-based intervention designed to facilitate students' metalevel and performance-level inquiry skills by enhancing their understanding of multivariable causality. Relative to an exploration-only group, sixth graders who practiced predicting an outcome (earthquake risk) based on multiple factors demonstrated increased attention to evidence, improved metalevel appreciation of effective strategies, and a trend toward consistent use of a controlled comparison strategy. Sixth graders who also received explicit instruction in making predictions based on multiple factors showed additional improvement in their ability to compare multiple instances as a basis for inferences and constructed the most accurate knowledge of the system. Gains were maintained in transfer tasks. The cognitive skills and metalevel understanding examined here are essential to inquiry learning. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	Abstract = {How Computer Science Skills Spread in the Job Market
Even in jobs that aren't traditional computing jobs, employers are seeking computer science skills from applicants. In this report prepared for Oracle Academy, we examine how computer science skills are in demand for jobs where a Computer Science degree is not a requirement.

This report focuses on the following five job areas where computer science skills are in strong or growing demand.

Data Analysis
Engineering and Manufacturing
Design
Marketing
Programming and Information Technology
Two-thirds of the fastest-growing and highest-paying skills in these fields are computer science skills
The overwhelming majority of the highest-paying and fastest-growing skills in these job categories are computer science related. Overall, 65\% of the fastest-growing and 62\% of the highest-paying skills in these fields are computer science related. Clearly, the pathway to the best opportunities is through the development of computer science skills.

Only 18\% of these jobs specifically request a computer science degree
While many employers are looking for workers with strong computer science skills, they are not necessarily looking only at job seekers with computer science degrees. Only 18\% of jobs in the categories listed above specifically request a computer science degree. (Most postings do request a bachelor's degree generally or a degree in another major.) Programming and data analysis jobs are the only categories that have significant demand for computer science degrees. For all other categories, fewer than 5\% of postings request a computer science degree.[1] This means that students in a broad range of education programs can enhance their job market value by including computer science in their education pathways.},

@article{lehrer-model-based,
	Abstract = {It is essential to base instruction on a foundation of understanding of children's thinking,
but it is equally important to adopt the longer-term view that is needed to stretch these
early competencies into forms of thinking that are complex, multifaceted, and subject to
development over years, rather than weeks or months. We pursue this topic through our
studies of model-based reasoning. We have identified four forms of models and related
modeling practices that show promise for developing model-based reasoning. Models have
the fortuitous feature of making forms of student reasoning public and inspectable---not
only among the community of modelers, but also to teachers. Modeling provides feedback
about student thinking that can guide teaching decisions, an important dividend for improving
professional practice.
We study the early emergence and subsequent development of model-based reasoning
in mathematics and science.},

	Abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3--4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

diversification. Financial literacy was strongly related to sociodemographic characteristics
and family financial sophistication. Specifically, a college-educated male whose parents had
stocks and retirement savings was about 45 percentage points more likely to know about risk
diversification than a female with less than a high school education whose parents were not
wealthy. These findings have implications for consumer policy. },

Background
Prior efforts have built a knowledge base of effective undergraduate STEM pedagogies, yet rates of implementation remain low. Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature.

Purpose
This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers.

Scope/Method
This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research.

Conclusions
Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.

@article{student-response-PI,
	Abstract = {Engineering instructors' adoption of active learning has been slow, despite significant evidence supporting its
efficacy. A common instructor concern is that students will respond negatively. This study measures the
relationship between student response to instruction and 1) students' expectations for types of instruction, 2)
students' experiences of different types of instruction, and 3) instructor strategies for using in-class activities.
Student Response to Instructional Practices (StRIP) survey data from 179 students at three U.S. institutions were
analyzed using hierarchical linear regression modeling. Significant predictors in the final models of student
response were student expectations of active learning lecture and passive lecture, experiences of group based
activities, and instructor strategies for explaining and facilitating active learning. These empirical results support
recommendations in prior literature about best practices for reducing student resistance and demonstrate that
instructors have great power to influence student reactions to active learning and ultimately reduce student
resistance. There was no evidence in this data set to support the common concern that instructor or course
evaluations are negatively affected by adopting active learning strategies.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes some features in the changing landscape of activities intended to improve both quality and access in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) undergraduate education. Observations are offered from the viewpoint afforded by my work---broadly over the last 10 years---both as a researcher, and as an evaluator for projects related to the improvement of undergraduate SMET education. Over that period, I have watched the landscape change---some issues, at first prominent, have diminished in importance; some are emergent; and yet others lie on the horizon. I have also observed that actions in pursuit of various reform goals reflect a variety of theories about how change can be accomplished that are not necessarily complementary. This short history of shifts in the focus of our efforts, and in our beliefs about how they may be achieved, is offered as a framework for discussion of these nationwide endeavors and as an aid in considering next steps. {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Twenty-five students, 19 male and 6 female, with a mean age of 14.6 years participated in this study. Thirteen were students with learning disabilities and 12 were remedial students. Findings from the study indicate that hypertext (text-only) support provides adequate reinforcement to move remedial students and students with learning disabilities toward continued, unprompted use of a hypermedia study guide, and that short-term and long-term retention of information can be expected from text-only information support. Students who had access to the hypermedia study guides exhibited better information retention than students who did not use the hypermedia study guides.},

In this paper, we will describe the design and implementation of this problet.

We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the effectiveness of using the problet. Results indicate that using the problet improved learning by 18%. We will describe our experiment and present its results.},

	Abstract = {The advent of second-generation intelligent computer tutors raises an important instructional design question: when should tutorial advice be presented in problem solving? This paper examines four feedback conditions in the ACT Programming Tutor. Three versions offer the student different levels of control over error feedback and correction: (a) immediate feedback and immediate error correction; (b) immediate error flagging and student control of error correction; (c) feedback on demand and student control of error correction. A fourth, No-tutor condition offers no stepby-step problem solving support. The immediate feedback group with greatest tutor control of problem solving yielded the most efficient learning. These students completed the tutor problems fastest, and the three tutor-supported groups performed equivalently on tests. Questionnaires revealed little student preference among the four conditions. These results suggest that students will need explicit guidance to benefit from learning opportunities that arise when they have greater control over tutorial assistance.},

@article{Kleinman:2002wo,
	Abstract = {This paper contrasts in-class and online teaching from both the student and instructor perspective based on two sections of Introduction to Computer Science, one taught in the traditional format and the other taught online. Analysis of student data supports existing findings that there are no significant differences between the two groups in learning outcomes, although there were differences in other areas. The online students were older than their in-class counterparts, and the almost universal reason for taking the course online was for flexibility in scheduling. The technology hurdle was responsible for a large drop in enrollment within the first few weeks of the semester for the online students, whereas for the in-class students, the attrition was lower and more gradual. Those distance students who did complete the course were equally satisfied with their grades, were more positive about the value of the course, and more willing to recommend it to others. From the instructor's perspective, some of the issues involved in online teaching included the administrative overhead involved in collecting and returning work, the challenges of communication without the benefit of face-to-face interaction, and the critical need for readily available support mechanisms to help online students overcome difficulties with the technology.},

@article{Wiedenbeck:1989fu,
	Abstract = {Recursion is basic to computer science, whether it is conceived of abstractly as a mathematical concept or concretely as a programming technique. Three experiments were carried out on learning iteration and recursion. The first involved learning to compute mathematical functions, such as the factorial, from worked out examples. The results suggest the subjects are quite able to induce a computational procedure for both iterative and recursive functions. Furthermore, prior work with iterative examples does not seem to facilitate subsequent learning of recursive procedures, nor does prior work with recursive examples facilitate subsequent learning of iterative procedures. The second experiment studied the extent to which people trained only with recursive examples are able to transfer their knowledge to compute other similar recursive mathematical functions stated in an abstract form. It turned out that subjects who transferred to abstractly stated problems performed somewhat worse than they had performed previously when given examples. However, they did far better than a control group trained only with an abstract description of recursion. The third experiment involved comprehension of iterative and recursive Pascal programs. Comprehension of the iterative program was not affected by prior experience with the recursive version of the same program. Comprehension of the recursive version was only weakly affected by prior experience with the iterative version.},

@article{Aleven-example-tracing,
	Abstract = {The Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) support creation of a novel type of tutors called example-tracing tutors. Unlike other types of ITSs (e.g., model-tracing tutors, constraint-based tutors), exampletracing tutors evaluate student behavior by flexibly comparing it against generalized examples of problem-solving behavior. Example-tracing tutors are capable of sophisticated tutoring behaviors; they provide step-by-step guidance on complex problems while recognizing multiple student strategies and (where needed) maintaining multiple interpretations of student behavior. They therefore go well beyond VanLehn's (2006) minimum criterion for ITS status, namely, that the system has an inner loop (i.e., provides within-problem guidance, not just end-of-problem feedback).

Using CTAT, example-tracing tutors can be created without programming. An author creates a tutor interface through drag-and-drop techniques, and then demonstrates the problem-solving behaviors to be tutored. These behaviors are recorded in a "behavior graph," which can be easily edited and generalized. Compared to other approaches to programming by demonstration for ITS development, CTAT implements a simpler method (no machine learning is used) that is currently more pragmatic and proven for widespread, real-world use by non-programmers.

Development time estimates from a large number of real-world ITS projects that have used CTAT suggest that example-tracing tutors reduce development cost by a factor of 4 to 8, compared to "historical" estimates of ITS development time and cost. The main contributions of the work are a novel ITS technology, based on the use of generalized behavioral examples to guide students in problem-solving exercises, as well as a suite of mature and robust tools for efficiently building real-world ITSs without programming.},

	Abstract = {Many individual instructors -- and, in some cases, entire universities -- are gravitating towards the use of comprehensive learning management systems (LMSs), such as Blackboard and Moodle, for managing courses and enhancing student learning. As useful as LMSs are, they are short on features that meet certain needs specific to computer science education. On the other hand, computer science educators have developed--and continue to develop-computer-based software tools that aid in management, teaching, and/or learning in computer science courses. In this report we provide an overview of current CS specific on-line learning resources and guidance on how one might best go about extending an LMS to include such tools and resources. We refer to an LMS that is extended specifically for computer science education as a Computing Augmented Learning Management System, or CALMS. We also discuss sound pedagogical practices and some practical and technical principles for building a CALMS. However, we do not go into details of creating a plug-in for some specific LMS. Further, the report does not favor one LMS over another as the foundation for a CALMS.},

@article{Sleeman:1986ca,
	Abstract = {Programming has been described by many authors as the new Latin of the school syllabus, a kind of mental whetstone for developing minds. As such, it was assumed that students would develop their general problem-solving skills through learning programming. However, reports from teachers of programming and results from some empirical studies now suggest that the teaching of programming has created significant difficulties for high-school and university students, and has failed to catalyze the development of higher order thinking skills. What has gone wrong? Before reviewing the major points of the three articles that follow, I would like to highlight some of the challenges of both teaching and learning programming. The programmer's objective, for novice and expert alike, is first to specify a detailed plan that can be carried out. That is, the programmer has to decompose the initial task. This is not trivial: Many people are quite unable to say how they perform certain tasks. For instance, many students in introductory programming classes are unable to explain how they are able to select the smallest of a series of integers. Next, the programmer must map this plan into the constructs of the target programming language. There are two points to be made about this mapping process. First, for the process to be "clean," the programmer needs to have a very clear idea of the abstract plan and of the constructs available in the programming language. One study of novice programmers showed that many novices had very fuzzy notions about a programming language---substantial misunderstandings had occurred with regard to virtually every construct in the language. Second, task decomposition and program coding are not as neatly decoupled as we might think. A simple example: If arrays are not available in the target programming language, then a plan that assumes this capability would be badly flawed. A thorough knowledge of the facilities provided by the programming language is needed even at the stage of formulating the task plan. Debugging a program is similarly complex and demands a variety of skills, including an ability to coordinate information derived from sources such as error messages, the program plan, the program specification, and the actual code. The three articles in this special section address different aspects of the challenge of programming. John Anderson and Edward Skwarecki's "The Automated Tutoring of Introductory Computer Programming" demonstrates that intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) technology can be a more effective way of teaching introductory programming courses---for certain populations. Specifically, the authors discuss the pedagogical effectiveness of a Lisp tutor developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. Elliot Soloway's "Learning to Program = Learning to Construct Mechanisms and Explanations" challenges conventional wisdom by taking a fresh look at assumptions about the art of programming. Soloway advocates a more explicit approach to the teaching of problem-solving skills, which is based on the actual skills experienced programmers use in addressing real tasks. Recent experiments have suggested that the domain knowledge of experienced programmers is organized in a radically different way from the domain knowledge of novices; analogous results have also been reported for chess and music. In all cases, experts use larger chunks of knowledge. An important instructional question is how to bring novices up to the expert's level of domain knowledge. Aside from teaching details of the syntax and semantics of a particular programming language, Soloway argues, it is necessary to explicitly and concurrently explain why and how programs work, the goal of any given program, what plan segments are, strategies for decomposing tasks, rules that well-formed programs adhere to, and design strategies. If followed, this approach would produce several radically different types of programming courses. "Boxer: A Reconstructible Computational Medium," by Andrea A. diSessa and Harold Abelson, proposes a radically new kind of computational medium---one that would be highly tailorable, and able to accommodate a wide range of users, from a seven-year-old to an experienced nonprofessional. The authors suggest that students' difficulties may have more to do with the nature of programming than with teaching per se. They describe their current project, Boxer, which is an attempt to provide an environment for a wide spectrum of human activities. The central notion of Boxer is the metaphor of nested "boxes" organized in a hierarchy that gives novices access to explicit and detailed information about the computer environment, but allows proficient programmers to work at the highly abstract and implicit level that is natural to them. All three articles emphasize the need for sensitive experimentation for determining the effectiveness of innovative approaches to the teaching of programming. In the absence of strong and pervasive cognitive theories, it is important to carry out extensive evaluations of all such innovative approaches. We must find out from experience whether well-structured ICAI can be as useful and important as Anderson and Skwarecki suggest; or how we might be able to teach Soloway's high-level problem-solving skills effectively through programming; or how well seven-year-olds will be able to get along with the Boxer system, and for what range of tasks. Any mismatches between observations and expectations will hopefully suggest the next round of new languages and environments, and in turn motivate the next set of observations.},

The cognitive models are implemented as production systems in which programming skill is characterized as the decomposition of programming goals into subgoals and elementary actions via the application of programming plans. Two sets of learning mechanisms are used in the cognitive models. Analogical problem-solving mechanisms use declarative knowledge of example program solutions to overcome problem-solving impasses. Knowledge compilation mechanisms summarize problem solutions into efficient problem-solving skill. Analyses and simulations of novice and expert programming were used to develop ideal models of the programming knowledge to confer upon students and bugs that characterize common misconceptions. The LISP Tutor uses the ideal models and bugs to guide its interactions with students. Experimental evaluations of the LISP Tutor indicate that it is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction.},

	Abstract = {We report two studies involving an intelligent tutoring system for Lisp (the Camegie
Mellon University Lisp Tutor). In Experiment 1, we developed a model, based on
production system theories of transfer and analogical problem solving, that accounts
for effects of instructional examples, the transfer of cognitive skills across
programming problems, and practice effects. In Experiment 2, we analyzed
protocols collected from subjects as they processed instructional texts and examples
before working with the Lisp Tutor and protocols collected after subjects solved
each programming problem. The results suggest that the acquisition of cognitive
skills is facilitated by high degrees of metacognition, which includes higher degrees
of monitoring states of knowledge, more self-generated explanation goals and
strategies, and greater attention to the instructional structure. Improvement in skill
acquisition is also strongly related to the generation of explanations connecting the
example material to the abstract terms introduced in the text, the generation of
explanations that focus on the novel concepts, and spending more time in planning
solutions to novel task components. We also found that self-explanation has
diminishing returns. Finally, reflection on problem solutions that focus on
understanding the abstractions underlying programs or that focus on understanding
how programs work seems to be related to improved learning.},

We show that the incorporation of algorithmic patterns through POI may enhance the construction of algorithmic problem-solving knowledge.

Specifically, they were more competent in problem decomposition and solution construction.},

	abstract = {Testing and test-writing are key skills for software engineers. Yet most CS curricula spend insufficient time on testing, and some studies have even found that graduating CS students enter developer jobs without these skills. We argue that test writing is a programming pattern that, at least when going beyond simple input/output test cases, is new and unfamiliar to most students, so that teaching test-writing requires not only teaching the strategic concepts of thinking about testing, but also how to instantiate the "arrange–act–assert" pattern of which all tests consist. Teaching how to recognize and instantiate this pattern is complicated by having to learn how to use testing frameworks and libraries—essentially a syntactic obstacle. Faded Parsons Problems (FPPs) have been shown to be a novel and effective type of exercise for exposing students to programming patterns by varying the amount of scaffolding provided. FPPs give similar learning gains to code-writing exercises but are preferred by students, and can be designed to "scaffold away” some syntactic obstacles that can impede students' ability to become fluent in test-writing. To our knowledge, neither FPPs nor the original Parsons Problems have previously been proposed to teach advanced programming patterns to advanced students. We present our design of a system for creating variably-scaffolded test-writing exercises in the form of FPPs, including autograding tests using existing autograding solutions augmented with techniques from mutation testing.},

               and plan knowledge at many different levels of detail. We
               provide several examples of how the scheme permits us to focus
               on bugs in a way that facilitates generating plausible accounts
               of why the bugs may have arisen. In particular, our approach has
               led us to one explanation of why some novice programs are
               buggier than others. A basic part of this explanation is the

In this paper, we interviewed eleven members of the introductory programming education research community about their thoughts on EipE questions as a whole and how individual borderline student answers should be graded. Through inductive coding of the interview transcripts, we identify: (1) themes relating to how EipE questions should be used in class, (2) the importance of training students to complete EipE questions, (3) standards for the selection and presentation of code in EipE questions, (4) the theoretical and practical considerations relating to grading EipE questions, and (5) English as a second language (ESL) concerns. In addition, we attempt to extrapolate from our observations what the underlying grading process is that faculty are using to grade EipE questions.},

abstract = {We present the first method for automatically mining code idioms from a corpus of previously written, idiomatic software projects. We take the view that a code idiom is a syntactic fragment that recurs across projects and has a single semantic purpose. Idioms may have metavariables, such as the body of a for loop. Modern IDEs commonly provide facilities for manually defining idioms and inserting them on demand, but this does not help programmers to write idiomatic code in languages or using libraries with which they are unfamiliar. We present Haggis, a system for mining code idioms that builds on recent advanced techniques from statistical natural language processing, namely, nonparametric Bayesian probabilistic tree substitution grammars. We apply Haggis to several of the most popular open source projects from GitHub. We present a wide range of evidence that the resulting idioms are semantically meaningful, demonstrating that they do indeed recur across software projects and that they occur more frequently in illustrative code examples collected from a Q&A site. Manual examination of the most common idioms indicate that they describe important program concepts, including object creation, exception handling, and resource management.},

abstract = {Existing code repositories contain numerous instances of code patterns that are idiomatic ways of accomplishing a particular programming task. Sometimes, the programming language in use supports specific operators or APIs that can express the same idiomatic imperative code much more succinctly. However, those code patterns linger in repositories because the developers may be unaware of the new APIs or have not gotten around to them. Detection of idiomatic code can also point to the need for new APIs.We share our experiences in mining imperative idiomatic patterns from the Hack repo at Facebook. We found that existing techniques either cannot identify meaningful patterns from syntax trees or require test-suite-based dynamic analysis to incorporate semantic properties to mine useful patterns. The key insight of the approach proposed in this paper --- Jezero --- is that semantic idioms from a large codebase can be learned from canonicalized dataflow trees. We propose a scalable, lightweight static analysis-based approach to construct such a tree that is well suited to mine semantic idioms using nonparametric Bayesian methods.Our experiments with Jezero on Hack code show a clear advantage of adding canonicalized dataflow information to ASTs: Jezero was significantly more effective in finding new refactoring opportunities from unannotated legacy code than a baseline that did not have the dataflow augmentation.},

Knowledge of these sequences --programming plans -- has been shown to be a factor that differentiates novice programmers from experts. Although the information on the development of programming plans would be beneficial to both teachers and students, explicitly following their development over a longer time period is scarce. In this article, we describe an easy-to-apply methodology for monitoring the development of programming plans. The development of programming plans is evaluated with time-constrained code recall tasks, where students are shown snippets of code for a short period of time, after which they write the snippets they saw. To determine the existence of programming plans, the short duration is designed so that reading the shown code is not feasible in the given time period. We demonstrate the methodology through an experiment in which we studied the development of programming plans in students in a beginner web programming course.},

As an alternative, we explore how a novel user interface for practicing coding — Faded Parsons Problems — can support introductory Computer Science students in learning to apply programming patterns. We ran a classroom-based study with 237 students which found that Faded Parsons Problems, or rearranging and completing partially blank lines of code into a valid program, are an effective exercise interface for teaching programming patterns, significantly surpassing the performance of the more standard approaches of code writing and code tracing exercises. Faded Parsons Problems also improve overall code writing ability at a comparable level to code writing exercises, but are preferred by students.},

abstract = {Most programs today are written not by professional software developers, but by people with expertise in other domains working towards goals for which they need computational support. For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

Based on an inductive analysis of one-on-one interviews, surveys, and weekly observations, we provide insights into students' motivations, career goals, perceptions of programming, and reactions to the Java and Processing languages. One of our key findings is that between the traditional classification of non-programmers vs. programmers, there exists a category of conversational programmers who do not necessarily want to be professional programmers or even end-user programmers, but want to learn programming so that they can speak in the “programmer's language” and improve their perceived job marketability in the software industry.},

abstract = {As the number of conversational programmers grows, computing educators are increasingly tasked with a paradox: to teach programming to people who want to communicate effectively about the internals of software, but not write code themselves. Designing instruction for conversational programmers is particularly challenging because their learning goals are not well understood, and few strategies exist for teaching to their needs. To address these gaps, we analyze the research on programming learning goals of conversational programmers from survey and interview studies of this population. We identify a major theme from these learners' goals: they often involve making connections between code's real-world purpose and various internal elements of software. To better understand the knowledge and skills conversational programmers require, we apply the Structure Behavior Function framework to compare their learning goals to those of aspiring professional developers. Finally, we argue that instructional strategies for conversational programmers require a focus on high-level program behavior that is not typically supported in introductory programming courses.},

abstract = {Conversational programmers want to learn about code primarily to communicate with technical co-workers, not to develop software. However, existing instructional materials don’t meet the needs of conversational programmers because they prioritize syntax and semantics over concepts and applications. This mismatch results in feelings of failure and low self-efficacy. To motivate conversational programmers, we propose purpose-first programming, a new approach that focuses on learning a handful of domain-specific code patterns and assembling them to create authentic and useful programs. We report on the development of a purpose-first programming prototype that teaches five patterns in the domain of web scraping. We show that learning with purpose-first programming is motivating for conversational programmers because it engenders a feeling of success and aligns with these learners’ goals. Purpose-first programming learning enabled novice conversational programmers to complete scaffolded code writing, debugging, and explaining activities after only 30 minutes of instruction.},

abstract = {How can we teach students to use more readable code structures? How common is it for students to choose less readable (but still functional) alternatives? We explore these questions for a specific anti-pattern: using sequential if statements when conditions are exclusive (rather than using else-if or else). We created and validated an automated detector to identify this anti-pattern in student's code. Running the detector on 1,764 homework submissions (from 270 students in a CS2 class on data structures and algorithms) showed that this anti-pattern was common and varied by assignment: across 12 assignments, 3\% to 50\% of submissions used sequential ifs for exclusive cases. However, using this anti-pattern did not preclude using else-ifs: across assignments, up to 34\% of the submissions used both forms. Further, students used sequential if statements in surprising ways, such as checking a condition and then the negation of that condition, indicating a more novice level of understanding than expected for an intermediate course. Hand-inspection of the detector-flagged cases suggests that sequential ifs for exclusive cases may be a code smell that can indicate larger problems with logic and abstraction.},

	abstract = {This Research Full Paper presents a study of programming strategies to manipulate data series presented in a range of CS1 courses. We collected and analyzed programs from multiple institutions in different countries, covering a range of programming languages (Python, Java, Go, and C). We started from a list of core strategies (that is, strategies that process the series as a whole, e.g., goals/plans for counting, linear search, etc.) drawn from the literature. We then expanded and refined the list, based on the analysis of the collected programs. We used a mixed method: we first analyzed the programs qualitatively to identify the recurring goals; then we conducted a quantitative analysis of the frequencies of goals. The result of the qualitative analysis is a data-driven list of basic goals that are required in order to cover the input, storage, and processing of data series, independently of the chosen programming language. The list has 13 well-separated goals (no goal in the list is a sub-goal of another one) that share a similar structure and the same level of abstraction. The quantitative analysis shows that the category of core goals is, not surprisingly, the most frequent one; around half of the programs contain a core goal, with total, count, and linear search being the most recurrent ones. Besides them, goals related to input and storage play a significant role as well: taken together, they occur with a frequency similar to that of core goals. The list of goals, if used to select or design practical exercises and teaching materials, can be a valid reference for CS1 instructors who want to foster the acquisition of strategic knowledge by their students. Implication for teaching and learning are discussed.},

  abstract = "This article is a survey of program visualization systems
              intended for teaching beginners about the run- time behavior of
              computer programs. Our focus is on generic systems that are
              capable of illustrating many kinds of programs and behaviors. We
              inclusively describe such systems from the last three decades and
              review findings from their empirical evaluations. A comparable
              review on the topic does not previously ex- ist; ours is intended
              to serve as a reference for the creators, evaluators, and users
              of educational program visualization systems. Moreover, we
              revisit the issue of learner engagement which has been identified
              as a potentially key factor in the success of educational
              software visualization and summarize what little is known about
              engagement in the context of the generic program visualization
              systems for beginners that we have reviewed; a proposed
              refinement of the frameworks previously used by computing
              education re- searchers to rank types of learner engagement is a
              side product of this effort. Overall, our review illustrates that
              program visualization systems for beginners are often short-lived
              research prototypes that support the user-controlled viewing of
              program animations; a recent trend is to support more engaging
              modes of user interaction. The results of evaluations largely
              support the use of program visualization in introductory pro-
              gramming education, but research to date is insufficient for
              drawing more nuanced conclusions with respect to learner
              engagement. On the basis of our review, we identify interesting
              questions to answer for future research in relation to themes

              implied by the language they are learning. To help them learn
              these properties, the notional machine should be simple. That is,
              it should consist of a small number of parts that interact in
              ways that can be easily understood, possibly by analogy to other
              mechanisms with which the novice is more familiar. A notional

  abstract  = "This PhD project studied the genetic epistemology of novice
               programmers, and provides empirical evidence that the
               development of programming skills can be described using the
               neo-Piagetian cognitive development framework. The thesis
               identifies the manifestations of each of the early neo-Piagetian
               stages of development in the programming domain -- that is:
               sensorimotor, preoperational and concrete operational. This
               research informs not only tertiary pedagogy, but teaching and
               learning of computer programming in any setting. It will enable
               educators to (a) identify the developmental stage of their
               students, (b) provide stage-appropriate learning resources and
               (c) assist students in transitioning to the next more mature
               stage of reasoning.",

               relationships in a class of domains, but unlike domain concepts,
               they also enable new strategies for solving a class of problems.
               Generic teleological mechanisms (GTMs) are a class of strategic
               concepts especially useful in adaptive design. GTMs, such as
               cascading, feedback, and feedforward, are abstract functional
               and causal patterns that lead to adaptation strategies for
               innovative design. We adopt a task-directed approach to learning
               and describe a model-based method for learning GTMs from design
               examples. Given a design that contains a pattern previously
               unknown to the designer and a similar and related design that
               does not, the method abstracts, indexes, and stores the partern
               for potential reuse. Pattern abstraction is enabled by
               structure-behavior-function models that represent functional,
               causal, topological, and compositional knowledge of device

              use of mechanistic analogies and points out some of the pitfalls.
              The article goes on to examine certain errors based on the
              misapplication of analogies as well as certain interaction
              errors. The main emphasis is on the notional machine both at the
              general level of understanding (and misunderstanding) the
              relationship of the terminal to the computer as such, as well as
              at the more specific level of understanding assignment. Notation
              and mistakes that poorly-designed languages can induce novices to

  abstract  = "An investigation into why so few African American and Latino
               high school students are studying computer science reveals the
               dynamics of inequality in American schools.The number of African
               Americans and Latino/as receiving undergraduate and advanced
               degrees in computer science is disproportionately low, according
               to recent surveys. And relatively few African American and
               Latino/a high school students receive the kind of institutional
               encouragement, educational opportunities, and preparation needed
               for them to choose computer science as a field of study and
               profession. In Stuck in the Shallow End, Jane Margolis looks at
               the daily experiences of students and teachers in three Los
               Angeles public high schools: an overcrowded urban high school, a
               math and science magnet school, and a well-funded school in an
               affluent neighborhood. She finds an insidious ``virtual
               segregation'' that maintains inequality. Two of the three
               schools studied offer only low-level, how-to (keyboarding,
               cutting and pasting) introductory computing classes. The third
               and wealthiest school offers advanced courses, but very few
               students of color enroll in them. The race gap in computer
               science, Margolis finds, is one example of the way students of
               color are denied a wide range of occupational and educational
               futures. Margolis traces the interplay of school structures
               (such factors as course offerings and student-to-counselor
               ratios) and belief systems---including teachers' assumptions
               about their students and students' assumptions about themselves.
               Stuck in the Shallow End is a story of how inequality is
               reproduced in America---and how students and teachers, given the
               necessary tools, can change the system.",

               explore options for assessing students, the working group

               assessments. Several universities participated in our trial

               introductory courses. For a combined sample of 216 students from

  abstract  = "A study by a ITiCSE 2001 working group (``the McCracken Group'')
               established that many students do not know how to program at the
               conclusion of their introductory courses. A popular explanation
               for this incapacity is that the students lack the ability to
               problem-solve. That is, they lack the ability to take a problem
               description, decompose it into sub-problems and implement them,
               then assemble the pieces into a complete solution. An
               alternative explanation is that many students have a fragile
               grasp of both basic programming principles and the ability to
               systematically carry out routine programming tasks, such as
               tracing (or ``desk checking'') through code. This ITiCSE 2004
               working group studied the alternative explanation, by testing
               students from seven countries, in two ways. First, students were
               tested on their ability to predict the outcome of executing a
               short piece of code. Second, students were tested on their
               ability, when given the desired function of short piece of
               near-complete code, to select the correct completion of the code
               from a small set of possibilities. Many students were weak at
               these tasks, especially the latter task, suggesting that such
               students have a fragile grasp of skills that are a prerequisite
               for problem-solving.",

              approaches this task by proposing that theories -- when viewed as
              conceptual tools formaking sense of a domain -- have four
              important attributes: descriptivepower; rhetorical power;
              inferential power; and application power.It observes that AT and

              the social and cultural context of cognition;both share a
              commitment to ethnographically collected data. Startingwith a
              description of the distributed cognition approach, it uses
              anexample of a DCOG analysis to ground a discussion of the
              strengths andweaknesses of AT and DCOG as an approach to issues
              in CSCW. Finally,the essay considers what theoretical work is
              being done by theattributes of the respective theories, and
              whether AT, DCOG, or anytheory developed outside the context of

  abstract  = "Educational Psychology Series: Evaluating the Quality of
               Learning: The SOLO Taxonomy (Structure of the Observed Learning
               Outcome) focuses on the approaches, methodologies, and
               techniques employed in the valuation of the quality of
               learning.The publication first offers information on the quality
               and quantity of learning and origin and description of the
               Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy.
               Discussions focus on general intellectual development and the
               growth of quality; some assumptions and applications of stage
               theory; from developmental stage to levels of learning quality;
               and general intellectual development and the growth of quality.
               The text then examines the teaching of history, elementary
               mathematics, English, and geography. Topics include interpreting
               a map and drawing conclusions, explaining a natural phenomenon,
               appreciation of poetry, implications for the teaching of
               history, English, and mathematics, numbers and operations, and
               general application of SOLO to history. The manuscript takes a
               look at modern languages, place of the taxonomy in instructional
               design, and some methodological considerations. Concerns include
               alternative formats for obtaining SOLO responses, instructional
               processes, curriculum analysis, remediation, and teacher
               intentions. The publication is a vital source of data for
               educators interested in the SOLO taxonomy.",

               how we learn and think. Andrea diSessa's career as a scholar,
               technologist, and teacher has been driven by one important
               question: can education--in particular, science education--be
               transformed by the computer so that children can learn more,
               learn more easily at an earlier age, and learn with pleasure and
               commitment? This book is diSessa's informed and passionate
               affirmative answer to that question. While written at a level
               that anyone with a good acquaintance with high school science
               can understand, the book reflects the depth and breadth of the
               issues surrounding technology in education. Rejecting the
               simplistic notion that the computer is merely a tool for more
               efficient instruction, diSessa shows how computers can be the
               basis for a new literacy that will change how people think and
               learn. He discusses the learning theory that explains why
               computers can be such powerful catalysts for change in
               education, in particular, how intuitive knowledge is the
               platform on which students build scientific understanding. He
               also discusses the material and social reasons for the
               computer's potential and argues for ``two-way literacies,''
               where everyone is a creator as well as consumer of dynamic and
               interactive expressive forms. DiSessa gives many examples from
               his work using the Boxer computer environment, an integrated
               software system designed to investigate computational
               literacies.",

               book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes
               their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers.
               Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a
               unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a
               pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a
               little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary
               without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The
               first edition became a widely used text in universities
               worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals.
               The second edition featured new chapters on the role of
               algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms,
               and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and

               van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial
               additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called

After a total of 85 hours of on-the-job observation, we report on the common abilities evidenced by new software developers including how to program, how to write design specifications, and evidence of persistence strategies for problem-solving. We also classify some of the common ways new software developers were observed getting stuck: communication, collaboration, technical, cognition, and orientation. We report on some common misconceptions of new developers which often frustrate them and hinder them in their jobs, and conclude with recommendations to align Computer Science curricula with the observed needs of new professional developers.},

Central to this theory is the cognitively plausible knowledge - goals and plans - that underlies programming. The bug categorization scheme makes explicit problem-dependent goal and plan knowledge at many different levels of detail. We provide several examples of how the scheme permits us to focus on bugs in a way that facilitates generating plausible accounts of why the bugs may have arisen. In particular, our approach has led us to one explanation of why some novice programs are buggier than others. A basic part of this explanation is the notion of merged goals and merged plans in which a single integrated plan is used to achieve multiple goals.},

Natural language processing, in particular, has been transformed by machine learning models such as OpenAI's GPT-3 which generates human-like text so realistic that its developers have warned of the dangers of its misuse. In recent months OpenAI released Codex, a new deep learning model trained on Python code from more than 50 million GitHub repositories. Provided with a natural language description of a programming problem as input, Codex generates solution code as output. It can also explain (in English) input code, translate code between programming languages, and more. In this work, we explore how Codex performs on typical introductory programming problems. We report its performance on real questions taken from introductory programming exams and compare it to results from students who took these same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We then explore how Codex handles subtle variations in problem wording using several published variants of the well-known ``Rainfall Problem'' along with one unpublished variant we have used in our teaching. We find the model passes many test cases for all variants. We also explore how much variation there is in the Codex generated solutions, observing that an identical input prompt frequently leads to very different solutions in terms of algorithmic approach and code length. Finally, we discuss the implications that such technology will have for computing education as it continues to evolve, including both challenges and opportunities.},

Codex is also the underlying model for GitHub Copilot, a plugin which makes AI-generated code accessible to students through auto-completion in popular code editors. Research in this area, particularly on the educational implications, is nascent and has focused almost exclusively on introductory programming (or CS1) questions. Very recent work has shown that Codex performs considerably better on typical CS1 exam questions than most students. It is not clear, however, what Codex's limits are with regard to more complex programming assignments and exams. In this paper, we present results detailing how Codex performs on more advanced CS2 (data structures and algorithms) exam questions taken from past exams. We compare these results to those of students who took the same exams under normal conditions, demonstrating that Codex outscores most students. We consider the implications of such tools for the future of undergraduate computing education.},

  abstract = {This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.},

  abstract = {Worked examples, which illustrate the process for solving a problem step-by-step, are a well-established pedagogical technique that has been widely studied in computing classrooms. However, creating high-quality worked examples is very time-intensive for educators, and thus learners tend not to have access to a broad range of such examples. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs), which appear capable of generating high-quality humanlike content, may offer a solution. Separate strands of recent work have shown that LLMs can accurately generate code suitable for a novice audience, and that they can generate high-quality explanations of code. Therefore, LLMs may be well suited to creating a broad range of worked examples, overcoming the bottleneck of manual effort that is currently required. In this work, we present a novel tool, `WorkedGen', which uses an LLM to generate interactive worked examples. We evaluate this tool with both an expert assessment of the content, and a user study involving students in a first-year Python programming course (n = {\textasciitilde}400). We find that prompt chaining and one-shot learning are useful strategies for optimising the output of an LLM when producing worked examples. Our expert analysis suggests that LLMs generate clear explanations, and our classroom deployment revealed that students find the LLM-generated worked examples useful for their learning. We propose several avenues for future work, including investigating WorkedGen's value in a range of programming languages, and with more complex questions suitable for more advanced courses.},

  abstract = {Reading, understanding and explaining code have traditionally been important skills for novices learning programming. As large language models (LLMs) become prevalent, these foundational skills are more important than ever given the increasing need to understand and evaluate model-generated code. Brand new skills are also needed, such as the ability to formulate clear prompts that can elicit intended code from an LLM. Thus, there is great interest in integrating pedagogical approaches for the development of both traditional coding competencies and the novel skills required to interact with LLMs. One effective way to develop and assess code comprehension ability is with ``Explain in plain English'' (EiPE) questions, where students succinctly explain the purpose of a fragment of code. However, grading EiPE questions has always been difficult given the subjective nature of evaluating written explanations and this has stifled their uptake. In this paper, we explore a natural synergy between EiPE questions and code-generating LLMs to overcome this limitation. We propose using an LLM to generate code based on students' responses to EiPE questions -- not only enabling EiPE responses to be assessed automatically, but helping students develop essential code comprehension and prompt crafting skills in parallel. We investigate this idea in an introductory programming course and report student success in creating effective prompts for solving EiPE questions. We also examine student perceptions of this activity and how it influences their views on the use of LLMs for aiding and assessing learning.},

Since the majority of the exercises in these tools' training dataset are written in English, it is also unclear how well they function with exercises published in other languages. In this paper, we report our experience using GPT-3 to solve 6 real-world tasks used in an Object Oriented Programming course at a Portuguese University and written in Portuguese. Our observations, based on an objective evaluation of the code, performed by an open-source Automatic Assessment Tool, show that GPT-3 is able to interpret and handle direct functional requirements, however it tends not to give the best solution in terms of object oriented design. We perform a qualitative analysis of GPT-3's output, and gather a set of recommendations for computer science educators, since we expect students to use and abuse this tool in their academic work.},

Especially when very large point sets are compared using the HD, for example when evaluating magnetic resonance volume segmentations, or when the underlying applications are based on time critical tasks, like motion detection, then the computational complexity of HD algorithms becomes an important issue. In this paper we propose a novel efficient algorithm for computing the exact Hausdorff distance. In a runtime analysis, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to have nearly-linear complexity. Furthermore, it has efficient performance for large point set sizes as well as for large grid size; performs equally for sparse and dense point sets; and finally it is general without restrictions on the characteristics of the point set. The proposed algorithm is tested against the HD algorithm of the widely used national library of medicine insight segmentation and registration toolkit (ITK) using magnetic resonance volumes with extremely large size. The proposed algorithm outperforms the ITK HD algorithm both in speed and memory required. In an experiment using trajectories from a road network, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms an HD algorithm based on R-Trees.},

The literature is old and rich, with a wide variety of statistics having being intelligently designed and analyzed, both for the unidimensional and the multivariate setting. Our contribution is to tie together many of these tests, drawing connections between seemingly very different statistics. In this work, our central object is the Wasserstein distance, as we form a chain of connections from univariate methods like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, PP/QQ plots and ROC/ODC curves, to multivariate tests involving energy statistics and kernel based maximum mean discrepancy. Some connections proceed through the construction of a {\textbackslash}textit\{smoothed\} Wasserstein distance, and others through the pursuit of a "distribution-free" Wasserstein test. Some observations in this chain are implicit in the literature, while others seem to have not been noticed thus far. Given nonparametric two sample testing's classical and continued importance, we aim to provide useful connections for theorists and practitioners familiar with one subset of methods but not others.},
