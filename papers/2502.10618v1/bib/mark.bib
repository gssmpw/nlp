	Abstract = {Originally intended as a replication study, this study discusses differences in problem solving performance among different domains caused by the same instructional intervention. The learning sciences acknowledges similarities in the learners' cognitive architecture that allow interventions to apply across domains, but it also argues that each domain has characteristics that might affect how interventions impact learning. The present study uses an instructional design technique that had previously improved learners' problem solving performance in programming: subgoal labeled expository text and subgoal labeled worked examples. It intended to replicate this effect for solving problems in statistics and chemistry. However, each of the experiments in the three domains had a different pattern of results for problem solving performance. While the subgoal labeled worked example consistently improved performance, the subgoal labeled expository text, which interacted with subgoal labeled worked examples in programming, had an additive effect with subgoal labeled worked examples in chemistry and no effect in statistics. Differences in patterns of results are believed to be due to complexity of the content to be learned, especially in terms of mapping problem solving procedures to solving problems, and the familiarity of tools used to solve problems in the domain. Subgoal labeled expository text was effective only when students learned more complex content and used unfamiliar problem solving tools.},

	Abstract = {A longstanding debate concerns the use of concrete versus abstract instructional materials, particularly in domains such as mathematics and science. Although decades of research have focused on the advantages and disadvantages of concrete and abstract materials considered independently, we argue for an approach that moves beyond this dichotomy and combines their advantages. Specifically, we recommend beginning with concrete materials and then explicitly and gradually fading to the more abstract. Theoretical benefits of this ``concreteness fading'' technique for mathematics and science instruction include (1) helping learners interpret ambiguous or opaque abstract symbols in terms of well-understood concrete objects, (2) providing embodied perceptual and physical experiences that can ground abstract thinking, (3) enabling learners to build up a store of memorable images that can be used when abstract symbols lose meaning, and (4) guiding learners to strip away extraneous concrete properties and distill the generic, generalizable properties. In these ways, concreteness fading provides advantages that go beyond the sum of the benefits of concrete and abstract materials.},

@article{PETKO20121351,
	Abstract = {The `will, skill, tool' model is a well-established theoretical framework that elucidates the conditions under which teachers are most likely to employ information and communication technologies (ICT) in the classroom. Past studies have shown that these three factors explain a very high degree of variance in the frequency of classroom ICT use. The present study replicates past findings using a different set of measures and hones in on possible subfactors. Furthermore, the study examines teacher affiliation for constructivist-style teaching, which is often considered to facilitate the pedagogical use of digital media. The study's survey of 357 Swiss secondary school teachers reveals significant positive correlations between will, skill, and tool variables and the combined frequency and diversity of technology use in teaching. A multiple linear regression model was used to identify relevant subfactors. Five factors account for a total of 60\% of the explained variance in the intensity of classroom ICT use. Computer and Internet applications are more often used by teachers in the classroom when: (1) teachers consider themselves to be more competent in using ICT for teaching; (2) more computers are readily available; (3) the teacher is a form teacher and responsible for the class; (4) the teacher is more convinced that computers improve student learning; and (5) the teacher more often employs constructivist forms of teaching and learning. The impact of constructivist teaching was small, however.},

	Abstract = { Increasing the number of students choosing a STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) career is a national educational priority. One way thought to increase interest in STEM is with advanced STEM courses in high school, especially Advanced Placement (AP) courses. Using data from 15,847 college undergraduates, we investigated the relationship between participation in AP mathematics courses (AP Calculus and AP Statistics) and student career interest in STEM. After controlling for covariates, the strongest effect (d = 0.13) showed that students who took AP Calculus had a modestly higher career interest in engineering and mathematics/computer science. However, the relationship between most AP mathematics courses and most STEM career outcomes was negligible. Most differences in outcomes between AP and non-AP students are likely due to preexisting differences between the two groups. },

@article{pre-calc-to-calc,
	Abstract = {This study addresses a longstanding question among high school mathematics teachers and college mathematics professors: Which is the best preparation for college calculus--- (a) a high level of mastery of mathematics considered preparatory for calculus (algebra, geometry, precalculus) or (b) taking calculus itself in high school? We used a data set of 6,207 students of 216 professors at 133 randomly selected U.S. colleges and universities, and hierarchical models controlled for differences in demography and background. Mastery of the mathematics considered preparatory for calculus was found to have more than double the impact of taking a high school calculus course on students' later performance in college calculus, on average. However, students with weaker mathematics preparation gained the most from taking high school calculus.

However, there is no simple answer to whether access to high school calculus should be withheld in favor of more preparation in lower mathematics or should be championed and expanded. This study found that both calculus in high school and a solid mastery of prerequisite mathematics predict later success in introduc- tory college calculus. Either approach helps those planning to take calculus in college. Mastery of algebra, geometry, and precalculus, on average, has more than twice the impact of a high school course in calculus. Yet, taking high school calculus does not appear to handicap students at all but, rather, provides students with an opportunity to strengthen prerequisite knowledge and skills while introducing some of the content of college calculus.

Bootstrap:Algebra is a curricular module designed to integrate in- troductory computing into an algebra class; the module aims to help students improve on various essential learning outcomes from state and national algebra standards. In prior work, we published initial  ndings about student performance gains on algebra problems after taking Bootstrap. While the results were promising, the dataset was not large, and had students working on algebra problems that had been sca olded with Bootstrap's pedagogy. This paper reports on a more detailed study with (a) data from more than three times as many students, (b) analysis of performance changes in incorrect answers, (c) some problems in which the Bootstrap sca olds have been removed, and (d) an IRT analysis across the elements of Boot- strap's program-design pedagogy. Our results con rm that students improve on algebraic word problems after completing the module, even on unsca olded problems. The nature of incorrect answers to symbolic-form questions also appears to improve after Bootstrap.},

@article{Sleeman:1986ca,
	Abstract = {Programming has been described by many authors as the new Latin of the school syllabus, a kind of mental whetstone for developing minds. As such, it was assumed that students would develop their general problem-solving skills through learning programming. However, reports from teachers of programming and results from some empirical studies now suggest that the teaching of programming has created significant difficulties for high-school and university students, and has failed to catalyze the development of higher order thinking skills. What has gone wrong? Before reviewing the major points of the three articles that follow, I would like to highlight some of the challenges of both teaching and learning programming. The programmer's objective, for novice and expert alike, is first to specify a detailed plan that can be carried out. That is, the programmer has to decompose the initial task. This is not trivial: Many people are quite unable to say how they perform certain tasks. For instance, many students in introductory programming classes are unable to explain how they are able to select the smallest of a series of integers. Next, the programmer must map this plan into the constructs of the target programming language. There are two points to be made about this mapping process. First, for the process to be "clean," the programmer needs to have a very clear idea of the abstract plan and of the constructs available in the programming language. One study of novice programmers showed that many novices had very fuzzy notions about a programming language---substantial misunderstandings had occurred with regard to virtually every construct in the language. Second, task decomposition and program coding are not as neatly decoupled as we might think. A simple example: If arrays are not available in the target programming language, then a plan that assumes this capability would be badly flawed. A thorough knowledge of the facilities provided by the programming language is needed even at the stage of formulating the task plan. Debugging a program is similarly complex and demands a variety of skills, including an ability to coordinate information derived from sources such as error messages, the program plan, the program specification, and the actual code. The three articles in this special section address different aspects of the challenge of programming. John Anderson and Edward Skwarecki's "The Automated Tutoring of Introductory Computer Programming" demonstrates that intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) technology can be a more effective way of teaching introductory programming courses---for certain populations. Specifically, the authors discuss the pedagogical effectiveness of a Lisp tutor developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. Elliot Soloway's "Learning to Program = Learning to Construct Mechanisms and Explanations" challenges conventional wisdom by taking a fresh look at assumptions about the art of programming. Soloway advocates a more explicit approach to the teaching of problem-solving skills, which is based on the actual skills experienced programmers use in addressing real tasks. Recent experiments have suggested that the domain knowledge of experienced programmers is organized in a radically different way from the domain knowledge of novices; analogous results have also been reported for chess and music. In all cases, experts use larger chunks of knowledge. An important instructional question is how to bring novices up to the expert's level of domain knowledge. Aside from teaching details of the syntax and semantics of a particular programming language, Soloway argues, it is necessary to explicitly and concurrently explain why and how programs work, the goal of any given program, what plan segments are, strategies for decomposing tasks, rules that well-formed programs adhere to, and design strategies. If followed, this approach would produce several radically different types of programming courses. "Boxer: A Reconstructible Computational Medium," by Andrea A. diSessa and Harold Abelson, proposes a radically new kind of computational medium---one that would be highly tailorable, and able to accommodate a wide range of users, from a seven-year-old to an experienced nonprofessional. The authors suggest that students' difficulties may have more to do with the nature of programming than with teaching per se. They describe their current project, Boxer, which is an attempt to provide an environment for a wide spectrum of human activities. The central notion of Boxer is the metaphor of nested "boxes" organized in a hierarchy that gives novices access to explicit and detailed information about the computer environment, but allows proficient programmers to work at the highly abstract and implicit level that is natural to them. All three articles emphasize the need for sensitive experimentation for determining the effectiveness of innovative approaches to the teaching of programming. In the absence of strong and pervasive cognitive theories, it is important to carry out extensive evaluations of all such innovative approaches. We must find out from experience whether well-structured ICAI can be as useful and important as Anderson and Skwarecki suggest; or how we might be able to teach Soloway's high-level problem-solving skills effectively through programming; or how well seven-year-olds will be able to get along with the Boxer system, and for what range of tasks. Any mismatches between observations and expectations will hopefully suggest the next round of new languages and environments, and in turn motivate the next set of observations.},

	Abstract = {Most research in primary and secondary computing education has focused on understanding learners within formal classroom communities, leaving aside the growing number of promising informal online programming communities where young users contribute, comment, and collaborate on programs to facilitate learning. In this article, we examined trends in computational participation in Scratch, an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers. Drawing on a random sample of 5,004 youth programmers and their activities over 3 months in early 2012, we examined programming concepts used in projects in relation to level of participation, gender, and length of membership of Scratch programmers. Latent class analysis results identified the same four groups of programmers in each month based on the usage of different programming concepts and showed how membership in these groups shifted in different ways across time. Strikingly, the largest group of project creators (named Loops) used the simplest and fewest programming concepts. Further, this group was the most stable in membership and was disproportionately female. In contrast, the more complex programming groups (named Variables, Low Booleans, and High Booleans) showed much movement across time. Further, the Low Booleans and High Booleans groups, the only groups to use ``and,'' ``or,'' and ``not'' statements in their programs, were disproportionately male. In the discussion, we address the challenges of analyzing young learners' programming in informal online communities and opportunities for designing more equitable computational participation.},

the relevant concepts and features of that domain. As
such, a DSL is a means to describe and generate members

A prerequisite for the design of a DSL is a detailed analysis

feature diagrams have been proposed to organize the dependencies
between such features, and to indicate which
ones are common to all family members and which ones
vary.
In this paper, we study feature diagrams in more details,

We propose the Feature Description Language
FDL,
a textual language to describe features. We
explore automated manipulation of feature descriptions
such as normalization, expansion to disjunctive normal
form, variability computation and constraint satisfaction.
Feature descriptions can be directly mapped to UML
diagrams which in their turn can be used for Java code
generation. The value of FDL is assessed via a case study

	Abstract = {The field of computer science (CS) is currently experiencing a surge in undergraduate degree production and course enrollments, which is straining program resources at many institutions and causing concern among faculty and administrators about how best to respond to the rapidly growing demand. There is also significant interest about what this growth will mean for the future of CS programs, the role of computer science in academic institutions, the field as a whole, and U.S. society more broadly.\n\nAssessing and Responding to the Growth of Computer Science Undergraduate Enrollments seeks to provide a better understanding of the current trends in computing enrollments in the context of past trends. It examines drivers of the current enrollment surge, relationships between the surge and current and potential gains in diversity in the field, and the potential impacts of responses to the increased demand for computing in higher education, and it considers the likely effects of those responses on students, faculty, and institutions. This report provides recommendations for what institutions of higher education, government agencies, and the private sector can do to respond to the surge and plan for a strong and sustainable future for the field of CS in general, the health of the institutions of higher education, and the prosperity of the nation.},

framework connects concepts such as: expert consensus model, target model, intermediate models,

these major areas, the articles in this issue have succeeded in moving us another step toward having
a theory of conceptual change that can provide guidance to teachers in the form of instructional prin- ciples. Taken together, the articles remind us that individual cognition, while not the only factor in
learning, is a central determining feature of learning. However, we must work to further develop the
present partial theory of conceptual change to fill in the missing cognitive core of the present shell.},

	Abstract = {This book describes new, model based teaching methods in science instruction and presents research results on their characteristics and effectiveness. It includes discussions of teaching methods based on evidence from a very diverse group of settings: middle school biology, high school physics, and college chemistry classrooms. Mental models in these areas such as understanding the structure of the lungs or cells, molecular structures and reaction mechanisms in chemistry, or causes of current flow in electricity are notoriously difficult for many students to learn. Yet these lie at the core of conceptual understanding in these areas. Each of the classrooms studied by the authors used recently developed curricula that fostered unusually active learning processes. The curricula were designed to produce flexible mental models in students as a key source of understanding. The studies focus on a variety of teaching strategies such as discrepant questioning, analogies, animations, model competition, and hands on activities. Extensive examples and descriptions of the strategies are included.

A pressing need is to address the problem that many of today's teachers feel pulled in two different directions: on the one hand they are urged to teach content in a broader and deeper way as measured by standardized tests; on the other hand they are urged to adopt student centered inquiry methods. Teachers often feel that these goals are incompatible (Cobb, 1988). The strategies being studied here are midway between pure discovery and lecture approaches and provide models for teachers facing this dilemma. The book reports on research on new instructional strategies for attaining deeper levels of conceptual understanding in science and uses some new diagrammatic representation systems for describing them. Six different levels of organization for teaching strategies are described, from those operating over months (design of the sequence of units in a curriculum) to those operating over minutes ( teaching tactics for guiding discussion minute by minute). Many of the levels have a diagrammatic representation to give a holistic picture of the strategy. Combined with concrete examples of the strategies drawn from real curriculum and classroom teaching exchanges this provides a way to understand each strategy and the combined approach.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: One hundred years after its conception, the scientific method continues
to reinforce a kind of cultural lore about what it means to participate in inquiry. As
commonly implemented in venues ranging from middle school classrooms to undergraduate
laboratories, it emphasizes the testing of predictions rather than ideas, focuses learners on
material activity at the expense of deep subject matter understanding, and lacks epistemic
framing relevant to the discipline. While critiques of the scientific method are not new, its
cumulative effects on learners' conceptions of science have not been clearly articulated.
We discuss these effects using findings from a series of five studies with degree-holding
graduates of our educational system who were preparing to enter the teaching profession
and apprentice their own young learners into unproblematic images of how science is done.
We then offer an alternative vision for investigative science---model-based inquiry (MBI)---
as a system of activity and discourse that engages learners more deeply with content and
embodies five epistemic characteristics of scientific knowledge: that ideas represented in
the form of models are testable, revisable, explanatory, conjectural, and generative. We
represent MBI as an interconnected set of classroom conversations and provide examples
of its implementation and its limitations. C 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Sci Ed 1 -- 27, 2008},

@article{sherin2012some,
	Abstract = {Abstract: This article is concerned with commonsense science knowledge, the informally gained
knowledge of the natural world that students possess prior to formal instruction in a scientific discipline.
Although commonsense science has been the focus of substantial study for more than two decades, there are
still profound disagreements about its nature and origin, and its role in science learning. What is the reason
that it has been so difficult to reach consensus? We believe that the problems run deep; there are difficulties
both with how the field has framed questions and the way that it has gone about seeking answers. In order to
make progress, we believe it will be helpful to focus on one type of research instrument---the clinical
interview---that is employed in the study of commonsense science. More specifically, we argue that we
should seek to understand and model, on a moment-by-moment basis, student reasoning as it occurs in the
interviews employed to study commonsense science. To illustrate and support this claim, we draw on a
corpus of interviews with middle school students in which the students were asked questions pertaining to
the seasons and climate phenomena. Our analysis of this corpus is based on what we call the mode-node
framework. In this framework, student reasoning is seen as drawing on a set of knowledge elements we call
nodes, and this set produces temporary explanatory structures we call dynamic mental constructs.
Furthermore, the analysis of our corpus seeks to highlight certain patterns of student reasoning that occur
during interviews, patterns in what we call conceptual dynamics. These include patterns in which students
can be seen to search through available knowledge (nodes), in which they assemble nodes into an
explanation, and in which they converge on and shift among alternative explanations.  2011 Wiley

Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, 1-on-1 clinical interviews have played a unique role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts and coded by human analysts. In this article, I explore the application of computational techniques to the analysis of this familiar type of data. I describe the success I have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics-methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this article are primarily methodological in nature: I attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews in a manner that may provide convergent support for the work of human analysts. As a test bed, I draw on transcripts of a corpus of interviews in which 54 middle school students were asked to explain the seasons.},

interviews as windows into student knowledge and thinking. Despite our familiarity with the
interviews, there has been very limited research addressing the ways that students understand

clinical interviews about chemistry for evidence of their tacit understandings and underlying
expectations about the activity in which they are engaged. We draw on the construct of framing
from anthropology and sociolinguistics and identify clusters of behaviors that indicate that
students may alternatively frame the interview as Inquiry, an Oral Examination, or an Expert
Interview. We present two examples of students shifting between frames during the course of
individual interviews. By examining the surrounding interaction we identify both conceptual and
epistemological interviewer cues that facilitate and constrain frame shifts. We discuss the
implications of dynamic student framing, that is identifiable in student behaviors and discourse,
for researchers who use clinical interviews to map student's intuitive science knowledge.},

Sixth graders who also received explicit instruction in making predictions based on multiple factors showed additional improvement in their ability to compare multiple instances as a basis for inferences and constructed the most accurate knowledge of the system.

Even in jobs that aren't traditional computing jobs, employers are seeking computer science skills from applicants. In this report prepared for Oracle Academy, we examine how computer science skills are in demand for jobs where a Computer Science degree is not a requirement.

This report focuses on the following five job areas where computer science skills are in strong or growing demand.

Data Analysis
Engineering and Manufacturing
Design
Marketing
Programming and Information Technology
Two-thirds of the fastest-growing and highest-paying skills in these fields are computer science skills
The overwhelming majority of the highest-paying and fastest-growing skills in these job categories are computer science related. Overall, 65\% of the fastest-growing and 62\% of the highest-paying skills in these fields are computer science related. Clearly, the pathway to the best opportunities is through the development of computer science skills.

Only 18\% of these jobs specifically request a computer science degree
While many employers are looking for workers with strong computer science skills, they are not necessarily looking only at job seekers with computer science degrees. Only 18\% of jobs in the categories listed above specifically request a computer science degree. (Most postings do request a bachelor's degree generally or a degree in another major.) Programming and data analysis jobs are the only categories that have significant demand for computer science degrees. For all other categories, fewer than 5\% of postings request a computer science degree.[1] This means that students in a broad range of education programs can enhance their job market value by including computer science in their education pathways.},

studies of model-based reasoning. We have identified four forms of models and related
modeling practices that show promise for developing model-based reasoning. Models have
the fortuitous feature of making forms of student reasoning public and inspectable---not
only among the community of modelers, but also to teachers. Modeling provides feedback
about student thinking that can guide teaching decisions, an important dividend for improving
professional practice.

	Abstract = {In an increasingly risky and globalized marketplace, people must be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is widespread when financial markets are well developed as in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older population believes itself well informed, even though it is actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns are also evident: women are less financially literate than men and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy. There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences: city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover, the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial question correctly is associated with a 3--4 percentage point higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is critical to retirement security.},

National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We showed that financial literacy is low; fewer than
one-third of young adults possess basic knowledge of interest rates, inflation, and risk
diversification. Financial literacy was strongly related to sociodemographic characteristics
and family financial sophistication. Specifically, a college-educated male whose parents had
stocks and retirement savings was about 45 percentage points more likely to know about risk
diversification than a female with less than a high school education whose parents were not
wealthy. These findings have implications for consumer policy. },

ranks, under age 30, and with little work experience have lower levels of knowledge.
Less knowledgeable students tend to hoM wrong opinions and make incorrect decisions.

The contents of the games have to do with prison reform, car purchase, conservation, the roles of the sexes, government spending, and genetics and the family of the future. The materials include photographs, graphs, cartoons, and drawings that encourage realistic visualization of the situation. Each game consists of four segments: role choice, strategy round, negotiation round, and decision making. Each game takes from 35 to 55 minutes and little teacher supervision is necessary. (TS)},

Selected studies are systematically analysed in relation to the particular dimension of transfer examined and evidence generated to support a case for curriculum planning to be grounded upon transfer. On the basis of findings to date, it is argued that curriculum planning in PE should foreground the principle of transfer. Recommendations are made in relation to further research in this field.},

	Abstract = {
Background
Prior efforts have built a knowledge base of effective undergraduate STEM pedagogies, yet rates of implementation remain low. Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature.

Purpose
This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers.

Scope/Method
This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research.

Conclusions
Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.

@article{student-response-PI,
	Abstract = {Engineering instructors' adoption of active learning has been slow, despite significant evidence supporting its
efficacy. A common instructor concern is that students will respond negatively. This study measures the
relationship between student response to instruction and 1) students' expectations for types of instruction, 2)
students' experiences of different types of instruction, and 3) instructor strategies for using in-class activities.
Student Response to Instructional Practices (StRIP) survey data from 179 students at three U.S. institutions were
analyzed using hierarchical linear regression modeling. Significant predictors in the final models of student
response were student expectations of active learning lecture and passive lecture, experiences of group based
activities, and instructor strategies for explaining and facilitating active learning. These empirical results support
recommendations in prior literature about best practices for reducing student resistance and demonstrate that
instructors have great power to influence student reactions to active learning and ultimately reduce student
resistance. There was no evidence in this data set to support the common concern that instructor or course
evaluations are negatively affected by adopting active learning strategies.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes some features in the changing landscape of activities intended to improve both quality and access in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) undergraduate education. Observations are offered from the viewpoint afforded by my work---broadly over the last 10 years---both as a researcher, and as an evaluator for projects related to the improvement of undergraduate SMET education. Over that period, I have watched the landscape change---some issues, at first prominent, have diminished in importance; some are emergent; and yet others lie on the horizon. I have also observed that actions in pursuit of various reform goals reflect a variety of theories about how change can be accomplished that are not necessarily complementary. This short history of shifts in the focus of our efforts, and in our beliefs about how they may be achieved, is offered as a framework for discussion of these nationwide endeavors and as an aid in considering next steps. {\copyright} 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	Abstract = {Student use of pop-up text windows that support or extend information found in a high school social studies text provides a detailed look into the instructional effectiveness of a set of hypermedia study guides. Twenty-five students, 19 male and 6 female, with a mean age of 14.6 years participated in this study. Thirteen were students with learning disabilities and 12 were remedial students. Findings from the study indicate that hypertext (text-only) support provides adequate reinforcement to move remedial students and students with learning disabilities toward continued, unprompted use of a hypermedia study guide, and that short-term and long-term retention of information can be expected from text-only information support. Students who had access to the hypermedia study guides exhibited better information retention than students who did not use the hypermedia study guides.},

In order to help them learn these concepts by solving problems, we have developed an applet that generates problems (henceforth called problet) and corrects the learner's answers. In this paper, we will describe the design and implementation of this problet.

We conducted a controlled experiment to assess the effectiveness of using the problet. Results indicate that using the problet improved learning by 18%. We will describe our experiment and present its results.},

	Abstract = {The advent of second-generation intelligent computer tutors raises an important instructional design question: when should tutorial advice be presented in problem solving? This paper examines four feedback conditions in the ACT Programming Tutor. Three versions offer the student different levels of control over error feedback and correction: (a) immediate feedback and immediate error correction; (b) immediate error flagging and student control of error correction; (c) feedback on demand and student control of error correction. A fourth, No-tutor condition offers no stepby-step problem solving support. The immediate feedback group with greatest tutor control of problem solving yielded the most efficient learning. These students completed the tutor problems fastest, and the three tutor-supported groups performed equivalently on tests. Questionnaires revealed little student preference among the four conditions. These results suggest that students will need explicit guidance to benefit from learning opportunities that arise when they have greater control over tutorial assistance.},

	Abstract = {This paper contrasts in-class and online teaching from both the student and instructor perspective based on two sections of Introduction to Computer Science, one taught in the traditional format and the other taught online. Analysis of student data supports existing findings that there are no significant differences between the two groups in learning outcomes, although there were differences in other areas. The online students were older than their in-class counterparts, and the almost universal reason for taking the course online was for flexibility in scheduling. The technology hurdle was responsible for a large drop in enrollment within the first few weeks of the semester for the online students, whereas for the in-class students, the attrition was lower and more gradual. Those distance students who did complete the course were equally satisfied with their grades, were more positive about the value of the course, and more willing to recommend it to others. From the instructor's perspective, some of the issues involved in online teaching included the administrative overhead involved in collecting and returning work, the challenges of communication without the benefit of face-to-face interaction, and the critical need for readily available support mechanisms to help online students overcome difficulties with the technology.},

	Abstract = {Recursion is basic to computer science, whether it is conceived of abstractly as a mathematical concept or concretely as a programming technique. Three experiments were carried out on learning iteration and recursion. The first involved learning to compute mathematical functions, such as the factorial, from worked out examples. The results suggest the subjects are quite able to induce a computational procedure for both iterative and recursive functions. Furthermore, prior work with iterative examples does not seem to facilitate subsequent learning of recursive procedures, nor does prior work with recursive examples facilitate subsequent learning of iterative procedures. The second experiment studied the extent to which people trained only with recursive examples are able to transfer their knowledge to compute other similar recursive mathematical functions stated in an abstract form. It turned out that subjects who transferred to abstractly stated problems performed somewhat worse than they had performed previously when given examples. However, they did far better than a control group trained only with an abstract description of recursion. The third experiment involved comprehension of iterative and recursive Pascal programs. Comprehension of the iterative program was not affected by prior experience with the recursive version of the same program. Comprehension of the recursive version was only weakly affected by prior experience with the iterative version.},

@article{Aleven-example-tracing,
	Abstract = {The Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) support creation of a novel type of tutors called example-tracing tutors. Unlike other types of ITSs (e.g., model-tracing tutors, constraint-based tutors), exampletracing tutors evaluate student behavior by flexibly comparing it against generalized examples of problem-solving behavior. Example-tracing tutors are capable of sophisticated tutoring behaviors; they provide step-by-step guidance on complex problems while recognizing multiple student strategies and (where needed) maintaining multiple interpretations of student behavior. They therefore go well beyond VanLehn's (2006) minimum criterion for ITS status, namely, that the system has an inner loop (i.e., provides within-problem guidance, not just end-of-problem feedback).

Using CTAT, example-tracing tutors can be created without programming. An author creates a tutor interface through drag-and-drop techniques, and then demonstrates the problem-solving behaviors to be tutored. These behaviors are recorded in a "behavior graph," which can be easily edited and generalized. Compared to other approaches to programming by demonstration for ITS development, CTAT implements a simpler method (no machine learning is used) that is currently more pragmatic and proven for widespread, real-world use by non-programmers.

Development time estimates from a large number of real-world ITS projects that have used CTAT suggest that example-tracing tutors reduce development cost by a factor of 4 to 8, compared to "historical" estimates of ITS development time and cost. The main contributions of the work are a novel ITS technology, based on the use of generalized behavioral examples to guide students in problem-solving exercises, as well as a suite of mature and robust tools for efficiently building real-world ITSs without programming.},

@article{Roessling-lms,
	Abstract = {Many individual instructors -- and, in some cases, entire universities -- are gravitating towards the use of comprehensive learning management systems (LMSs), such as Blackboard and Moodle, for managing courses and enhancing student learning. As useful as LMSs are, they are short on features that meet certain needs specific to computer science education. On the other hand, computer science educators have developed--and continue to develop-computer-based software tools that aid in management, teaching, and/or learning in computer science courses. In this report we provide an overview of current CS specific on-line learning resources and guidance on how one might best go about extending an LMS to include such tools and resources. We refer to an LMS that is extended specifically for computer science education as a Computing Augmented Learning Management System, or CALMS. We also discuss sound pedagogical practices and some practical and technical principles for building a CALMS. However, we do not go into details of creating a plug-in for some specific LMS. Further, the report does not favor one LMS over another as the foundation for a CALMS.},

@article{Sleeman:1986ca,
	Abstract = {Programming has been described by many authors as the new Latin of the school syllabus, a kind of mental whetstone for developing minds. As such, it was assumed that students would develop their general problem-solving skills through learning programming. However, reports from teachers of programming and results from some empirical studies now suggest that the teaching of programming has created significant difficulties for high-school and university students, and has failed to catalyze the development of higher order thinking skills. What has gone wrong? Before reviewing the major points of the three articles that follow, I would like to highlight some of the challenges of both teaching and learning programming. The programmer's objective, for novice and expert alike, is first to specify a detailed plan that can be carried out. That is, the programmer has to decompose the initial task. This is not trivial: Many people are quite unable to say how they perform certain tasks. For instance, many students in introductory programming classes are unable to explain how they are able to select the smallest of a series of integers. Next, the programmer must map this plan into the constructs of the target programming language. There are two points to be made about this mapping process. First, for the process to be "clean," the programmer needs to have a very clear idea of the abstract plan and of the constructs available in the programming language. One study of novice programmers showed that many novices had very fuzzy notions about a programming language---substantial misunderstandings had occurred with regard to virtually every construct in the language. Second, task decomposition and program coding are not as neatly decoupled as we might think. A simple example: If arrays are not available in the target programming language, then a plan that assumes this capability would be badly flawed. A thorough knowledge of the facilities provided by the programming language is needed even at the stage of formulating the task plan. Debugging a program is similarly complex and demands a variety of skills, including an ability to coordinate information derived from sources such as error messages, the program plan, the program specification, and the actual code. The three articles in this special section address different aspects of the challenge of programming. John Anderson and Edward Skwarecki's "The Automated Tutoring of Introductory Computer Programming" demonstrates that intelligent computer-assisted instruction (ICAI) technology can be a more effective way of teaching introductory programming courses---for certain populations. Specifically, the authors discuss the pedagogical effectiveness of a Lisp tutor developed at Carnegie-Mellon University. Elliot Soloway's "Learning to Program = Learning to Construct Mechanisms and Explanations" challenges conventional wisdom by taking a fresh look at assumptions about the art of programming. Soloway advocates a more explicit approach to the teaching of problem-solving skills, which is based on the actual skills experienced programmers use in addressing real tasks. Recent experiments have suggested that the domain knowledge of experienced programmers is organized in a radically different way from the domain knowledge of novices; analogous results have also been reported for chess and music. In all cases, experts use larger chunks of knowledge. An important instructional question is how to bring novices up to the expert's level of domain knowledge. Aside from teaching details of the syntax and semantics of a particular programming language, Soloway argues, it is necessary to explicitly and concurrently explain why and how programs work, the goal of any given program, what plan segments are, strategies for decomposing tasks, rules that well-formed programs adhere to, and design strategies. If followed, this approach would produce several radically different types of programming courses. "Boxer: A Reconstructible Computational Medium," by Andrea A. diSessa and Harold Abelson, proposes a radically new kind of computational medium---one that would be highly tailorable, and able to accommodate a wide range of users, from a seven-year-old to an experienced nonprofessional. The authors suggest that students' difficulties may have more to do with the nature of programming than with teaching per se. They describe their current project, Boxer, which is an attempt to provide an environment for a wide spectrum of human activities. The central notion of Boxer is the metaphor of nested "boxes" organized in a hierarchy that gives novices access to explicit and detailed information about the computer environment, but allows proficient programmers to work at the highly abstract and implicit level that is natural to them. All three articles emphasize the need for sensitive experimentation for determining the effectiveness of innovative approaches to the teaching of programming. In the absence of strong and pervasive cognitive theories, it is important to carry out extensive evaluations of all such innovative approaches. We must find out from experience whether well-structured ICAI can be as useful and important as Anderson and Skwarecki suggest; or how we might be able to teach Soloway's high-level problem-solving skills effectively through programming; or how well seven-year-olds will be able to get along with the Boxer system, and for what range of tasks. Any mismatches between observations and expectations will hopefully suggest the next round of new languages and environments, and in turn motivate the next set of observations.},

The cognitive models are implemented as production systems in which programming skill is characterized as the decomposition of programming goals into subgoals and elementary actions via the application of programming plans. Two sets of learning mechanisms are used in the cognitive models. Analogical problem-solving mechanisms use declarative knowledge of example program solutions to overcome problem-solving impasses. Knowledge compilation mechanisms summarize problem solutions into efficient problem-solving skill. Analyses and simulations of novice and expert programming were used to develop ideal models of the programming knowledge to confer upon students and bugs that characterize common misconceptions. The LISP Tutor uses the ideal models and bugs to guide its interactions with students. Experimental evaluations of the LISP Tutor indicate that it is more efficient and effective than classroom instruction.},

	Abstract = {We report two studies involving an intelligent tutoring system for Lisp (the Camegie
Mellon University Lisp Tutor). In Experiment 1, we developed a model, based on
production system theories of transfer and analogical problem solving, that accounts
for effects of instructional examples, the transfer of cognitive skills across
programming problems, and practice effects. In Experiment 2, we analyzed
protocols collected from subjects as they processed instructional texts and examples
before working with the Lisp Tutor and protocols collected after subjects solved
each programming problem. The results suggest that the acquisition of cognitive
skills is facilitated by high degrees of metacognition, which includes higher degrees
of monitoring states of knowledge, more self-generated explanation goals and
strategies, and greater attention to the instructional structure. Improvement in skill
acquisition is also strongly related to the generation of explanations connecting the
example material to the abstract terms introduced in the text, the generation of
explanations that focus on the novel concepts, and spending more time in planning
solutions to novel task components. We also found that self-explanation has
diminishing returns. Finally, reflection on problem solutions that focus on
understanding the abstractions underlying programs or that focus on understanding
how programs work seems to be related to improved learning.},
