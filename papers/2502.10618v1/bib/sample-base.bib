abstract = {Most programs today are written not by professional software developers, but by people with expertise in other domains working towards goals for which they need computational support. For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

abstract = {This paper presents findings of an exploratory, qualitative study of professional web and graphic designers who regularly write computer programs. These participants have a wide variety of educational backgrounds, including some who had a few classes in computer science. Our participants report having found a career in which they enjoy being both creative and technical. They want to learn more about computing, but do not find computing curricula as meeting their needs. We discuss their perceptions of the computing discipline, motivational aspects of their jobs, and their interest in learning more about computing. We also consider implications for computing curricula if we were to try to meet the needs of these professionals who are unlikely to appear in our current classes.},

abstract = {As the number of conversational programmers grows, computing educators are increasingly tasked with a paradox: to teach programming to people who want to communicate effectively about the internals of software, but not write code themselves. Designing instruction for conversational programmers is particularly challenging because their learning goals are not well understood, and few strategies exist for teaching to their needs. To address these gaps, we analyze the research on programming learning goals of conversational programmers from survey and interview studies of this population. We identify a major theme from these learners' goals: they often involve making connections between code's real-world purpose and various internal elements of software. To better understand the knowledge and skills conversational programmers require, we apply the Structure Behavior Function framework to compare their learning goals to those of aspiring professional developers. Finally, we argue that instructional strategies for conversational programmers require a focus on high-level program behavior that is not typically supported in introductory programming courses.},

abstract = {How can we teach students to use more readable code structures? How common is it for students to choose less readable (but still functional) alternatives? We explore these questions for a specific anti-pattern: using sequential if statements when conditions are exclusive (rather than using else-if or else). We created and validated an automated detector to identify this anti-pattern in student's code. Running the detector on 1,764 homework submissions (from 270 students in a CS2 class on data structures and algorithms) showed that this anti-pattern was common and varied by assignment: across 12 assignments, 3\% to 50\% of submissions used sequential ifs for exclusive cases. However, using this anti-pattern did not preclude using else-ifs: across assignments, up to 34\% of the submissions used both forms. Further, students used sequential if statements in surprising ways, such as checking a condition and then the negation of that condition, indicating a more novice level of understanding than expected for an intermediate course. Hand-inspection of the detector-flagged cases suggests that sequential ifs for exclusive cases may be a code smell that can indicate larger problems with logic and abstraction.},
