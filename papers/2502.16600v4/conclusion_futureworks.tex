\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we answered the question \textit{can current learning paradigms enable LLMs to acquire moral reasoning?} 
Based on distributional semantics and the pragmatic nature of morality, we demonstrate that 
(1) the pragmatic dilemma of LLMs make them inefficient in moral reasoning acquisition tasks; 
(2) the improved performance still stems from the realm of distributional semantics;
(3) the current learning paradigm for moral reasoning acquisition impairs LLMsâ€™ language modeling capability more than semantics-level tasks.
We conclude that the pragmatic dilemma is the primary bottleneck for moral reasoning acquisition.
