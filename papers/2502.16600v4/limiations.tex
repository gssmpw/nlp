\section*{Limitations}
In this draft, we focus only on moral situations with a single underlying moral foundation. However, in real-world scenarios, moral situations often involve multiple moral foundations, which we leave for future research.
Additionally, while the tasks considered in this paper reflect fundamental aspects of moral reasoning, a deeper analysis of how the pragmatic dilemma manifests in recently proposed social sandbox systems would be a valuable direction for future study.
