%In this paper we emphasize the importance of AI technologies that reflect linguistic diversity and are inclusive, particularly of minority populations such as Black Americans in the United States. Specifically, we explore if large language model-based generative AI technologies support the unique needs of Black Americans with respect to communications in AAE. In doing so,
We recruited Black American study participants to provide their opinions about the generation of AAE in AI technologies, such as AI assistants, and make judgments about how effectively these systems produce AAE. We do not believe our study participants were exposed to any meaningful risks through this process, and we ensured that their remuneration was fair and above average (two and a half times the U.S. federal minimum wage) for their time. Any minor risks that our participants might have been exposed to were delineated in our application to the Institutional Review Board of \emph{redacted}, which was approved with a status of ``Exempt'' on \emph{redacted}. All study participants provided informed consent for their participation. All data utilized by the large language models in this study was anonymized; specifically, we used publicly available transcriptions of interviews with Black Americans from the CORAAL corpus, which was anonymous when we retrieved it online. Finally, we utilized AI code-writing assistance to develop our code used to prepare our data sets.
