%I would restructure this section.

%1. I think it's weird that this one is in the reverse order (first data annotation then survey) than all the others. Put it in the same order. (ADDRESSED)
%3. Remind me at the beginning of this section what the goals are (what are the RQs) and then have two subsections, one for the survey and one for the data annotation.

%2. I don't think we need nearly as many details about CORAAL. We can move most of this to the appendix; they just need to know that it's transcribed AAE speech from interviews in the USA. Can mention that we lightly processed tihs data and put those details in the appendix too.

%4. You don't need to introduce the dataset before you talk about the data annotation

We investigate two primary research questions: 1) whether Black Americans want Generative AI technologies to communicate and understand African American English and in which contexts, and 2) how effective LLMs are at generating AAE when prompted to do so. Our Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved\footnote{Our IRB restricts us from reporting on our survey participant and annotator demographics other than at the aggregate level. Most other IRB details redacted for anonymity.} online study gathers participant feedback on these questions, via a survey on participants' desires (\autoref{subsec:survey}), and data annotation to understand the effectiveness of current LLMs (\autoref{subsec:data_annotations}). 

For both, we recruit participants through Prolific (\url{prolific.co}), who were required to be Black American over 18 years old, familiar with AAE, and reside in the U.S. 
% \hal{who reside in the U.S. ???}. 
In total, of our $n=104$ \textit{survey} participants, $61$ identified as female, $37$ as male, $3$ as non-binary, $1$ as other (with $2$ undisclosed). Participants ranged from $25$ to $64$ years old ($\mu=34$), with the majority (81 participants) 
% (\hal{insert number from Fig 4 for SC+AD+BD+GD+PD+Doc}) 
having attended at least some college.
The participants come from all four major geographic areas in the U.S. ($53$ from the South, $21$ Northeast, $17$ West, and $17$ Midwest) (see \autoref{sec:annotators}). For the \textit{data annotation} tasks, we recruited %/$n=247$
$n=228$ 
Black American annotators with similar demographics.
