The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly propelled solutions in digital geometric design and manufacturing~\cite{abdelaal2024ai}. 
AI applications in additive manufacturing~\cite{wang2020smart, zhang2024machine} and subtractive manufacturing~\cite{manikanta2024machine, soori2023machine} have been extensively reviewed.
Cutting-edge research similarly advances computer graphics, encompassing assembly planning~\cite{jones2021automate}, LLM-centric design and manufacturing~\cite{makatura2024can1,makatura2024can2}, 3D printing path optimization~\cite{huang2024learning, liu2024neural}, and feedback-based 3D printing control~\cite{piovarci2022closed}.

These advancements underscore a significant trend towards AI-based automation and optimization in design and manufacturing processes.
This paper primarily examines the \manuAna using a learning method, specifically focusing on the \accessAna for subtractive manufacturing~\cite{gupta1997automated, hoefer2017automated}, which is also the main content of this section.

%Traditional \manuAna for subtractive manufacturing predominantly relies on geometric and analytical techniques, which can be broadly categorized into two main approaches. The first is the feature-based method, which involves extracting machining features as a prerequisite for manufacturability analysis~\cite{han2000manufacturing}. Key challenges in this approach center around feature recognition, addressed through various techniques, such as graph-based methods for machining part analysis~\cite{joshi1988graph}, volumetric decomposition methods that partition the input into convex hull volumes as machining features~\cite{kailash2001volume,kim1990convex}, and hint-based approaches~\cite{regli1995geometric}. The second category comprises feature-less methods, which focus on analyzing the surface representation of the model to determine manufacturability, making them well-suited for arbitrary geometries without requiring feature recognition. This approach tackles challenges in surface representation using techniques like slicing-based methods to map machinable ranges~\cite{li2006machinability} and octree decomposition~\cite{kerbrat2011new}.

Manufacturability of subtractive manufacturing is defined as four characteristics: visibility, reachability, accessibility, and setup complexity \cite{gupta1997automated, hoefer2017automated}.

Feature-less methods, on the other hand, analyze surface representations to assess manufacturability, employing techniques such as slicing for machinable range mapping~\cite{li2006machinability} and octree decomposition~\cite{kerbrat2011new}.


%\hs{why learning???}

Aligned with these conventional studies, where accessibility is the main evaluation metric for both feature-rich and feature-agnostic methods~\cite{zhang2020manufacturability}, this paper primarily focuses on assessing accessibility.
Unlike traditional approaches, we investigate the use of neural networks for \accessAna. 


\paragraph{Learning based Manufacturability Analysis}

Early efforts to integrate machine learning into \manuAna have demonstrated potential in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. Examples include heuristic rule-based scoring~\cite{kerbrat2011new,joshi2017geometric} and process planning for Quasi-rotational components~\cite{chen2020manufacturability}. Recent advancements leverage deep learning, such as autoencoder-based generative models for feature matching~\cite{yan2023automated}, 3D-CNNs with orthogonal distance fields (ODF) for manufacturability prediction~\cite{balu2020orthogonal}, and enhanced B-rep structures with surface normal data for feature recognition~\cite{ghadai2018learning}. Hierarchical graph neural networks have also been applied to analyze B-rep topology and UV network geometry for multi-level learning~\cite{huang5065158hierarchical}.


A significant limitation of the above studies lies in the challenge of applying learning methods to more intricate aspects, such as predicting cutter accessibility for freeform shapes.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has introduced a learning-based \accessAna method applicable to freeform and complex geometries. Our work bridges this gap by enabling real-time prediction of non-reachable and occlusion areas while supporting general cutting tools.

% Early research on accessibility in multi-axis CNC machining explored various geometric and computational methods.

More advanced methods include Gaussian spherical mapping~\cite{liu2020sequence} and ray-tracing metrics for assessing five-axis milling manufacturability~\cite{chen2021design}.




These approaches reflect the progression from basic visibility analysis to more efficient and precise accessibility evaluations in complex machining scenarios. However, when applied to intricate or high-resolution 3D models, they often face scalability challenges and significant computational overhead due to the time-intensive nature of strictly geometric methods~\cite{dai2018support}. Therefore, developing fast and scalable methods capable of handling complex geometries and diverse cutter parameters is highly meaningful.


\paragraph{Spatial Analysis Learning}

Early works extended deep learning methods to 3D voxels~\cite{Maturana2015,Wu2015} for spatial analysis.
However, voxel-based approaches are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, making them unsuitable for high-resolution 3D data.
To address these limitations, sparse voxel-based CNNs leverage octrees~\cite{Wang2017} or hash tables~\cite{Graham2018,Choy2019} to confine computation to sparsely occupied voxels, significantly improving efficiency.
Point-based neural networks~\cite{Qi2017a,Qi2017,Li2018} eliminate the need for voxelization by directly processing point clouds, offering an alternative solution.
Recently, transformers have also been applied to 3D data, demonstrating promising results~\cite{Guo2021,Zhao2021,Wang2023}.
In this work, we adopt O-CNN~\cite{Wang2017} for \accessAna due to its efficiency and strong performance across a range of 3D tasks.

\paragraph{Visibility Analysis}

In manufacturing, accessibility refers to whether a tool (or machine) can reach certain areas of a workpiece for tasks such as machining, cutting, or assembly.
It involves determining if the tool can physically interact with or reach specific parts of the workpiece without collisions, interference, or excessive tool movement.
Accessibility is related to visibility in the geometry domain~\cite{zhang2020manufacturability}, which  refers to the ability to see a part of a 3D object from a specific viewpoint or a set of viewpoints. This concept is primarily concerned with whether a point on the surface of an object is visible from a given position, considering obstacles, occlusions, and geometric configurations.

Visibility-based methods captured tool-accessible ranges in 3D Cartesian space~\cite{balasubramaniam2003collision}, while highly precise algorithms exploited the axial symmetry of rotational tools to detect collisions~\cite{ilushin2005precise}. 
Fast algorithms updated accessible regions along smooth tool paths~\cite{wang2007automatic}, and plane-based methods simplified accessible region calculations for blisk machining by projecting them onto 2D reference planes~\cite{chen2015collision}. 
Boundary-based methods further streamlined range construction by simplifying obstacle surfaces into boundary curves~\cite{liang2016accessible}, and dynamic obstacle-growing environments were tackled using optimized machinability algorithms~\cite{chen2018optimized}. 
Recent approaches evaluate tool accessibility using Gaussian spherical mapping~\cite{liu2020sequence} and projection-based strategies~\cite{liu2020sequence}.
