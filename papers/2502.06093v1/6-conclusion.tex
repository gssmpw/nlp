\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper introduces DeepMill, a deep learning framework that improves cutter accessibility and manufacturability analysis for complex designs. Utilizing octree-based convolutional neural network (O-CNN), DeepMill efficiently predicts inaccessible regions and occlusions across various cutter sizes, overcoming the scalability and computational limitations of traditional methods. Its real-time predictions enable faster design iterations and enhance production efficiency. Additionally, the new dataset introduced supports further research and development of robust manufacturability analysis cutters, making DeepMill a significant advancement in the field. 
Extensive testing and comparisons have demonstrated DeepMill's powerful cutter-aware prediction ability.
