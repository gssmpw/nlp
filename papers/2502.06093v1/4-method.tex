\section{Geometric method for dataset generation}
\label{sec:Overview}
In this section, we introduce a rapid geometric approach to generate datasets with labels for inaccessible and occlusion regions.

\subsection{Voronoi-based accessibility analysis}
\label{sec:acc}
We use the subtractive collision detection method from \cite{zhong2023vasco} to gather accessibility training data, as it's efficient. 
We introduced a slight modification to their method by incorporating a detection box for pre-detection, enabling faster calculation.
Details of the method are outlined below.

\paragraph{Voronoi-based sampling.} The inset figure demonstrates the use of \input{figures/fig-voronoi} Lloyd's Voronoi relaxation for uniform sampling on the surface of $M$, with each Voronoi cell represented by its site $s_i\in S$, where $S = \{ s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n \}$. The surface of $M$ can be simplified as $M = \cup_{i=1}^n s_i$.

\paragraph{Ball-end cutter} 
In finishing machining of CNC, a ball-end cutter is commonly employed to finish the surface, modeled as a hemisphere combined with two differently sized cylinders.
\autoref{fig:collision-detection}(a) illustrates the cross-section of the cutter, which can be characterized using four parameters: two radii ($CR$ and $FR$) and two heights ($CH$ and $FH$). To ensure successful manufacturing, it is essential to guarantee the cutter $\mathcal{C}$ does not collide with $M$ in any direction $d_k$:
\begin{equation} 
\forall s_i \in S, \forall d_k \in D, s_i \cap \mathcal{C}(d_k) = \varnothing
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Inaccessible points.} 
For each $s_i \in S$, collision detection is performed with other sites, $\forall s_j\in S$ $(j \neq i)$, using the method from \cite{zhong2023vasco}. We first uniformly sample cutter directions $D = \{d_1, d_2, \dots, d_m\}$ using the Fibonacci Sphere sampling method~\cite{vorobiev2002fibonacci} on the upper Gaussian hemisphere and then rotate $M$ contrarily along each direction. To accelerate computation, a cylinder with a radius of $FR + \sigma$ is added as a detecting box before collision detection, allowing only points within the cylinder to undergo finer detection, as shown in \autoref{fig:collision-detection}(b).
Next, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:collision-detection}(c), each $s_j$ is rapidly evaluated for collision by calculating its horizontal distance from the center of $\mathcal{C}$. If the Z-coordinate of $s_j$ exceeds $CR + CH + FH$, it is immediately classified as colliding with the infinitely large shaft space (called global collision). 
After the traversal, if $s_i$ collides with at least one $s_j$ in all cutter directions, it is classified as an inaccessible point:
\begin{equation} 
s_i \leftarrow l_I \iff \forall d_k \in D, |S \cap \mathcal{C}(d_k)| > 0
\end{equation}
Compared to the triangle-facet-based approach~\cite{dhaliwal2003algorithms}, which involves collision detection between the cutterâ€™s cylindrical surface and the triangular mesh, the proposed method is based on discrete sampling points (sites of Voronoi cells), significantly improving computational efficiency.
Even so, this method still has a worst-case complexity of $O(mn^2)$. Besides, it is crucial to ensure that the shortest edge length of the smallest Voronoi cell is greater than $2*CR$ to prevent the cutter from passing through the cell without detection, as illustrated in \autoref{fig:collision-detection}(d).

\subsection{Occlusion analysis}
To further assist designers in modifying the "culprit" causing inaccessible points, we compute the "occlusion factor" $\beta_i$ for each $s_i \in S$ to quantify the severity of its occlusion for the inaccessible points:
\begin{equation} 
\beta_i = \sum_{s_j \in S}\sum_{d_k \in D} \left(
\begin{cases} 
1  \text{, if } s_j \text{ is inaccessible and } s_i \text{ occludes } \text{$s_j$ in} \; d_k \\
0  \text{, otherwise}
\end{cases} \right)
\end{equation}
The top 10$\%$ of $s_i$ with the highest $\beta_i$ values are defined as "occlusion points" ($s_i \leftarrow l_O$). As shown in \autoref{fig:Occlusion-analyze}, the points in the upper region of the 2D shape are marked as "occlusion points."
