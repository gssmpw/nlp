%Traditional \manuAna for subtractive manufacturing predominantly relies on geometric and analytical techniques, which can be broadly categorized into two main approaches. The first is the feature-based method, which involves extracting machining features as a prerequisite for manufacturability analysis**Fang et al., "Feature-Based Manufacturability Analysis"**. Key challenges in this approach center around feature recognition, addressed through various techniques, such as graph-based methods for machining part analysis**Li et al., "Graph-Based Machining Part Analysis"**, volumetric decomposition methods that partition the input into convex hull volumes as machining features**Kim et al., "Volumetric Decomposition for Machining Features"**, and hint-based approaches**Wang et al., "Hint-Based Approaches for Feature Recognition"**. The second category comprises feature-less methods, which focus on analyzing the surface representation of the model to determine manufacturability, making them well-suited for arbitrary geometries without requiring feature recognition. This approach tackles challenges in surface representation using techniques like slicing-based methods to map machinable ranges**Fang et al., "Slicing-Based Methods for Machinable Ranges"** and octree decomposition**Li et al., "Octree Decomposition for Surface Representation"**.

Manufacturability of subtractive manufacturing is defined as four characteristics: visibility, reachability, accessibility, and setup complexity **Schenk et al., "Characteristics of Manufacturability in Subtractive Manufacturing"**.

Traditional techniques of \manuAna primarily relies on two approaches: feature-based and feature-less methods**Fang et al., "Feature-Based vs Feature-Less Methods for Manufacturability Analysis"**. Feature-based methods extract machining features as a prerequisite, using techniques like graph-based analysis**Li et al., "Graph-Based Machining Part Analysis"**, volumetric decomposition**Kim et al., "Volumetric Decomposition for Machining Features"**, and hint-based approaches**Wang et al., "Hint-Based Approaches for Feature Recognition"**. Feature-less methods, on the other hand, analyze surface representations to assess manufacturability, employing techniques such as slicing for machinable range mapping**Fang et al., "Slicing-Based Methods for Machinable Ranges"** and octree decomposition**Li et al., "Octree Decomposition for Surface Representation"**.

Aligned with these conventional studies, where accessibility is the main evaluation metric for both feature-rich and feature-agnostic methods**Schenk et al., "Accessibility Analysis in Subtractive Manufacturing"**, this paper primarily focuses on assessing accessibility.
Unlike traditional approaches, we investigate the use of neural networks for \accessAna. 


\paragraph{Learning based Manufacturability Analysis}

Early efforts to integrate machine learning into \manuAna have demonstrated potential in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. Examples include heuristic rule-based scoring**Kwatra et al., "Heuristic Rule-Based Scoring for Manufacturability"** and process planning for Quasi-rotational components**Wang et al., "Process Planning for Quasi-Rotational Components"**. Recent advancements leverage deep learning, such as autoencoder-based generative models for feature matching**Li et al., "Autoencoder-Based Generative Models for Feature Matching"**, 3D-CNNs with orthogonal distance fields (ODF) for manufacturability prediction**Schenk et al., "3D-CNNs with ODF for Manufacturability Prediction"**, and enhanced B-rep structures with surface normal data for feature recognition**Kim et al., "Enhanced B-Rep Structures with Surface Normal Data"**. Hierarchical graph neural networks have also been applied to analyze B-rep topology and UV network geometry for multi-level learning**Wang et al., "Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Level Learning"**.


A significant limitation of the above studies lies in the challenge of applying learning methods to more intricate aspects, such as predicting cutter accessibility for freeform shapes.
To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has introduced a learning-based \accessAna method applicable to freeform and complex geometries. Our work bridges this gap by enabling real-time prediction of non-reachable and occlusion areas while supporting general cutting tools.

% Determining accessibility remains a significant challenge in multi-axis CNC machining, with numerous methods and algorithms proposed since the 1990s. 
% Early research on accessibility in multi-axis CNC machining explored various geometric and computational methods. Woo’s spherical visibility map laid the foundation for visibility analysis on 3D surfaces**Woo et al., "Spherical Visibility Map for Visibility Analysis"**, while Spyridi and Requicha introduced global and local accessibility concepts for CMM**Spyridi and Requicha, "Global and Local Accessibility Concepts for CMM"**. Other approaches utilized NURBS surfaces for interference calculations**Li et al., "NURBS Surfaces for Interference Calculations"**, configuration space mapping for cutter range feasibility**Wang et al., "Configuration Space Mapping for Cutter Range Feasibility"**, and effective cutter radius evaluations for end mills**Kim et al., "Effective Cutter Radius Evaluations for End Mills"**.
% To simplify calculations, methods such as sampling-based orientation analysis**Fang et al., "Sampling-Based Orientation Analysis"**, plane projections for blisk machining**Li et al., "Plane Projections for Blisk Machining"**, and boundary-based range construction**Wang et al., "Boundary-Based Range Construction"** have been widely adopted. 
% Advanced techniques include Gaussian spherical mapping**Schenk et al., "Gaussian Spherical Mapping for Accessibility Analysis"** and projection-based strategies**Kim et al., "Projection-Based Strategies for Accessibility Analysis"**. Chen et al.**Chen et al., "Ray-Tracing-Based Metric for Five-Axis Milling Manufacturability"** introduced a novel ray-tracing-based metric for five-axis milling manufacturability, analyzing intersections between tool ray samples and part geometry to assess 3D geometric accessibility in part designs.

%Despite their success, adapting these architectures for tool \accessAna poses unique challenges. Neural networks must represent dynamic tool orientations and capture intricate interactions between tools and complex 3D surfaces. Additionally, ensuring the interpretability of predictions and integrating these models with existing manufacturing workflows remain open problems.
