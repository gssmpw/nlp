\caption{DeepMill's network architecture. The input mesh is converted into a point cloud with normals, with each point corresponding to a Voronoi cell's site. Features are progressively extracted through the encoder, and the decoder, embedded with a cutter module (CM), restores spatial resolution. Both encoder and decoder are stacked with several Octree-based residual blocks. Finally, each site is subjected to dual-task binary segmentation through two header layers. Red and green represent the inaccessible and occlusion regions, respectively.}
