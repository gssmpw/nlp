\caption{Comparisons with GraphSAGE. $M$ is converted into a graph, with nodes representing mesh vertices and edges representing topological connections of them. Similar to O-CNN, initial node features include vertex coordinates and normals. Node features are propagated and updated through successive convolutions on neighboring nodes. }
