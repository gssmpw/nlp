\caption{We propose an octree-based neural network for cutter accessibility and severe occlusion detection on arbitrary meshes. Compared to traditional geometric methods, our network significantly reduces computation time, enabling real-time prediction during shape editing. Across various CAD and freeform model datasets with different mesh resolutions, the accuracy for inaccessible regions and occlusion regions reach 94.7$\%$ and 88.7$\%$, respectively. 
The cutter sizes for each shape in the figure are randomly generated. We display the cutter shapes used for two shapes. On the left, the red and green areas represent inaccessible and severely occlusion regions predicted by the network. Dark red (green) and light red (green) areas indicate under- and over-predictions, respectively, compared to the traditional geometric method. On the right, the results of applying our network for volume accessibility analysis are shown. }
