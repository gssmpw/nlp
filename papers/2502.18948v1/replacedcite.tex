\section{Literature review}
Active diagnosis techniques rely on the inclusion of additional moduli to control systems
% inclusion within the control system of additional moduli 
to alter the behavior of the system compared to information known by the attacker. 
For instance, the concept of additive watermarking was introduced in ____, where noise signals of known mean and variance are added at the plant and compensated for it at the controller. 
This compensation, however, is not exact, causing some performance degradation. Thus, trade-offs between performance and detectability  are necessary ____.
% A later work ____ designs the watermark signal by trading performance for detection. Thus, although additive watermarking serves as a good detection scheme, they endure performance losses even in the nominal case. 

In encrypted control ____, the sensor data is encrypted, sent to the controller, and then operated on directly. Encrypted input signals are sent back to the plant for decryption. Although encryption is widespread in IT security, in control systems it presents some concerns, such as the introduction of time delays ____, while it may present inherent weaknesses ____.
% they are not preferred as they introduce time delays ____ which can cause instability, and some encryption schemes can be very weak  ____. 

In moving target defense ____, the plant is augmented with fictitious dynamics, known to the controller. The plant output is transmitted to the controller along with the fictitious states over a network under attack. 
The additional measurements then aide in the detection of attacks. 
This comes at the cost of higher communication bandwidth needs, which increases rapidly with the dimension of the augmented systems.
% Since the dynamics of the fictitious dynamics are exactly known to the controller, the attack is detected easily. However, when the scale of the system increases, the communication bandwidth used by moving the target defense approach increases rapidly. 

Other recently proposed works include two-way coding ____, a weak encryuption technique, and dynamic masking ____, which enhances privacy as well as security, have been shown to be effective against zero-dynamics attacks.
% Two-way coding ____ and dynamic masking ____ are other recently proposed approaches. Two-way coding is another form of weak encryption technique whilst dynamic masking proposes an architecture that enhances both privacy and security. These schemes are shown to be effective against zero dynamics attacks but remain to be studied for other classes of attacks. 
% Recent extensions include ____.
% Some other works which are related are ____, an extension of ____. The work ____ is an extension of moving target defense for multi-agent systems. 
Furthermore, filtering techniques for attack detection are proposed by ____, while not focusing on stealthy attacks.
% The works ____ develop filtering techniques to guarantee safety, without being focused on stealthy covert attacks.

Multiplicative watermarking (mWM) has been proposed by the authors as a diagnosis technique ____. mWM consists of a pair of filters on each communication channel between the plant and its controller; the scheme is affine to weak encryption, whereby ``encoding'' and ``decoding'' are done by changing signals' dynamic characteristics through inverse pairs of filters. This enables original signals to be recovered exactly, and thus does not lead to performance degradation.
% A multiplicative watermark is an affine to a weak encryption technique, through which the signal is ``encoded'' by a filter, changing its dynamic behavior. The use of inverse pairs means that the original signal can be recovered, through ``decoding'' via an inverse filter. As such, differently to techniques based on additive watermarking, no performance is lost due to the injection of noise, and there are no bandwidth limitations.
