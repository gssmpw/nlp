\section{Literature review}
Active diagnosis techniques rely on the inclusion of additional moduli to control systems
% inclusion within the control system of additional moduli 
to alter the behavior of the system compared to information known by the attacker. 
For instance, the concept of additive watermarking was introduced in Chen, "Design and Analysis of Additive Watermarking for Control Systems"**, where noise signals of known mean and variance are added at the plant and compensated for it at the controller. 
This compensation, however, is not exact, causing some performance degradation. Thus, trade-offs between performance and detectability  are necessary Yang et al., "Watermarking for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Survey"**.
% A later work Wang et al., "Multiplicative Watermarking for Control Systems: A Novel Approach"** designs the watermark signal by trading performance for detection. Thus, although additive watermarking serves as a good detection scheme, they endure performance losses even in the nominal case. 

In encrypted control Lee et al., "Encrypted Control for Cyber-Physical Systems"**, the sensor data is encrypted, sent to the controller, and then operated on directly. Encrypted input signals are sent back to the plant for decryption. Although encryption is widespread in IT security, in control systems it presents some concerns, such as the introduction of time delays Li et al., "Time-Delay Analysis of Encrypted Control Systems"**, while it may present inherent weaknesses Zhang et al., "Weaknesses of Encryption Schemes in Control Systems"**.
% they are not preferred as they introduce time delays ** which can cause instability, and some encryption schemes can be very weak  **. 

In moving target defense Kim et al., "Moving Target Defense for Cyber-Physical Systems"**, the plant is augmented with fictitious dynamics, known to the controller. The plant output is transmitted to the controller along with the fictitious states over a network under attack. 
The additional measurements then aide in the detection of attacks. 
This comes at the cost of higher communication bandwidth needs, which increases rapidly with the dimension of the augmented systems.
% Since the dynamics of the fictitious dynamics are exactly known to the controller, the attack is detected easily. However, when the scale of the system increases, the communication bandwidth used by moving the target defense approach increases rapidly. 

Other recently proposed works include two-way coding Patel et al., "Two-Way Coding for Secure Communication in Cyber-Physical Systems"**, a weak encryuption technique, and dynamic masking Hassan et al., "Dynamic Masking for Enhanced Privacy and Security in CPS"**, which enhances privacy as well as security, have been shown to be effective against zero-dynamics attacks.
% Two-way coding ** and dynamic masking ** are other recently proposed approaches. Two-way coding is another form of weak encryption technique whilst dynamic masking proposes an architecture that enhances both privacy and security. These schemes are shown to be effective against zero dynamics attacks but remain to be studied for other classes of attacks. 
% Recent extensions include Liu et al., "Extensions of Moving Target Defense"**.
% Some other works which are related are Tanaka et al., "Extension of Moving Target Defense for Multi-Agent Systems"**, an extension of **. The work ** is an extension of moving target defense for multi-agent systems. 
Furthermore, filtering techniques for attack detection are proposed by Kwon et al., "Filtering Techniques for Attack Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems"**, while not focusing on stealthy attacks.
% The works Lee et al., "Filtering Techniques for Safety and Security"** develop filtering techniques to guarantee safety, without being focused on stealthy covert attacks.

Multiplicative watermarking (mWM) has been proposed by the authors as a diagnosis technique Chen et al., "Multiplicative Watermarking: A Novel Diagnosis Technique for Cyber-Physical Systems"**. mWM consists of a pair of filters on each communication channel between the plant and its controller; the scheme is affine to weak encryption, whereby ``encoding'' and ``decoding'' are done by changing signals' dynamic characteristics through inverse pairs of filters. This enables original signals to be recovered exactly, and thus does not lead to performance degradation.
% A multiplicative watermark is an affine to a weak encryption technique, through which the signal is ``encoded'' by a filter, changing its dynamic behavior. The use of inverse pairs means that the original signal can be recovered, through ``decoding'' via an inverse filter. As such, differently to techniques based on additive watermarking, no performance is lost due to the injection of noise, and there are no bandwidth limitations.
