\textit{Active techniques} have been introduced to give better detectability performance for cyber-attack diagnosis in cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, switching multiplicative watermarking is considered, %where time-varying filters are defined to alter the dynamics of information transmitted over a communication channel between a plant and a controller in a CPS. 
% In this context, the objective of this paper is to 
whereby we propose an optimal design strategy to define switching filter parameters. 
Optimality is evaluated exploiting the so-called output-to-output gain of the closed loop system, including some supposed attack dynamics. 
A worst-case scenario of a matched covert attack is assumed, presuming that an attacker with full knowledge of the closed-loop system injects a stealthy attack of bounded energy. 
Our algorithm, given watermark filter parameters at some time instant, provides optimal next-step parameters.
Analysis of the algorithm is given, demonstrating its features, and demonstrating that through initialization of certain parameters outside of the algorithm, the parameters of the multiplicative watermarking can be randomized.
Simulation shows how, by adopting our method for parameter design, the attacker's impact on performance diminishes.

\section{Conclusion and future works }\label{sec:Con}
An optimal design technique for the design of the parameters of switching multiplicative watermarking filters is presented. 
The problem is formalized by supposing the closed-loop system is subject to a covert attack with matching parameters. 
We propose an optimal control problem based on a formulation of the attack energy constrained output-to-output gain. 
We show through a numerical example that this design improves detectability by increasing the energy of the residual output before and after a switching event. 
Future works includes developing algorithms for optimal design and optimal switching times ensuring that mWM does not destabilize the closed-loop system under switching with mismatched parameters, and studying non-linear systems.
