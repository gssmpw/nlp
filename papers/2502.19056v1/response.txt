%\subsection{Modeling Human Kinematics and Dynamics using Deep learning}
 
In the motion synthesis area, researchers and developers in the graphics, animation, and gaming industries, dive deeply into both deterministic and probabilistic Deep Learning (DL) motion generation
techniques. These data-driven approaches leverage human motion capture and movement history data (e.g., previous frames or motion states like joint angles) to produce or predict the pose and/or joint trajectories of a 3D humanoid character **Lee et al., "Motion Synthesis with Deep Neural Networks"**. Especially for deterministic motion synthesis, where the synthesized motion sequence converges to a deterministic pose sequence that regresses towards the mean pose of ground-truth, recurrent architectures like LSTM models **Hernandez-Garcia and Kjellstrom, "Goal-Driven Motion Synthesis with Recurrent Neural Networks"** for typical motion imitation and RNNs enhanced with phase-functioned networks **Wang et al., "Phase-Functioned Networks for Scene-Aware Interactions"** for scene-aware interactions, are favored. The work in **Lee et al., "The Neural State Machine: A Framework for Goal-Driven Real-Time Motion Synthesis"**, introduces the Neural State Machine (NSM), a framework for goal-driven real-time synthesis of 3D character movements and scene interactions. The NSM consists of a gating network and an RNN motion prediction network, where the first accounts for automatic action state transition based on the global phase of the motion signal and the user input (i.e. desired goal). In the subsequent works of the same authors **Lee et al., "The Neural State Machine: A Framework for Goal-Driven Real-Time Motion Synthesis"**, an architecture similar to NSM is employed and enhanced with: i) a local phase feature that exploits the local motion phases of each skeletal segment to dynamically produce their asynchronous motion in character-character, character-object, and character-scene interactions in **Kwon et al., "Local Phase Feature-Based Neural State Machine for Asynchronous Motion Synthesis"**, and ii) a control scheme in **Kim et al., "Control Scheme for Animation Layering Using Recurrent Neural Networks"** for animation layering to produce sophisticated (e.g. martial arts movements) and novel motions based on reference motions, physics-based simulations, input controls, etc.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also been employed for synthesizing human motion sequences **Sundermeyer et al., "Natural Temporal Convolutional Networks for Human Motion Synthesis"**.

On the contrary, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) **Goodfellow et al., "Generative Adversarial Networks"**, Variational Autoencoders **Kingma and Welling, "Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes"**, Transformers **Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**, and the state-of-the-art diffusion models for motion generation conditioned on multiple sources (e.g. natural language descriptions and audio) **Ho et al., "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models"**, are exploited for probabilistic motion synthesis meaning the construction of all plausible pose sequences of a virtual character based on historical poses and/or control inputs. Probabilistic DL models have the ability to inject stochasticity in the training process, i.e. by fitting a latent distribution to the distribution of the next pose in each invocation, and, hence, increasing the learning capacity of the model.

Motion synthesis works can be used alongside musculoskeletal dynamics estimation approaches (described in Section \ref{sec:Musculoskeletal}) to reflect the human internal state on a 3D humanoid character, thus, providing physics-based solutions. Consequently, works in the physics-based motion synthesis area develop holistic approaches, usually relying on Reinforcement Learning (RL) **Mnih et al., "Human-Level Control through Deep Reinforcement Learning"**, which account for the data-driven imitation of physically realistic motion sequences conditioned on physical parameters such as joint velocities, forces, torques, etc. It is worth mentioning the most recent work in **Kim et al., "Auto-Regressive Neural Networks for Physics-Based Motion Synthesis"**, where an auto-regressive neural network resembling previous work **Lee et al., "The Neural State Machine: A Framework for Goal-Driven Real-Time Motion Synthesis"**, which incorporates knowledge from the physical attributes of exerted human force and perceived resistance, was applied to model variations in human movements while interacting with objects and, thus, enhancing realism.

\subsection{Data-Driven Musculoskeletal Dynamics and Kinematics Estimation}
\label{sec:Musculoskeletal}

Estimating musculoskeletal human biomechanics has been the focus of research for many years, with results affecting multiple research fields such as biomechanics, the gaming industry, robotics, and the animation industry. Biomechanics engineers use powerful open-source tools like OpenSim **Delp et al., "OpenSim: A High-Performance Software System for Simulating and Analyzing Human Movement"**, to simulate with great precision human kinematics and compute the kinetics and dynamics of a motion (e.g. joint contact forces, joint torques, muscle forces, etc.), while state-of-the-art methods focus in data-driven approaches (ML/DL), such as the ones in **Sundermeyer et al., "Natural Temporal Convolutional Networks for Human Motion Synthesis"** to obtain more automated, faster as well as real-time, solutions while estimating biomechanical variables traditionally calculated through musculoskeletal modeling. Such works rely on raw motion marker data, joint kinematics data (i.e. joint angles), Electromyography (EMG) data, and Ground Reaction Forces (GRFs) to infer predictions. 

In **Sundermeyer et al., "Natural Temporal Convolutional Networks for Human Motion Synthesis"**, different feed-forward neural network configurations obtained through hyperparameter space exploration were trained and applied to estimate both joint biomechanical parameters (angles, reactions forces, torques) as well as muscle forces and activations in upper extremities. The authors concluded that more complex neural architectures with optimal parameters obtained through hyperparameter space search, lead to more accurate estimations. Furthermore, RNN models pose as the most common approaches in human biomechanics estimation **Hernandez-Garcia and Kjellstrom, "Goal-Driven Motion Synthesis with Recurrent Neural Networks"**. %combined with sophisticated transfer learning techniques were developed for the estimation of knee contact forces (KCFs). 
In particular, in **Kim et al., "Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network for Domain Alignment"**, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM), augmented with unsupervised domain adaptation layers, was proposed to perform domain alignment between experimental data from various movements, with the goal to simultaneously generalize across multiple actions and align real-to-synthetic data. 
%In the more recent work **Lee et al., "Auto-Regressive Neural Networks for Physics-Based Motion Synthesis"**, a Multisource Fusion Long Short-Term Memory (MF-LSTM) network, (i.e. a model able to extract temporal dependencies in motion data and fuse multiple data sources, such as EMGs and GRFs) and an enhanced version of MF-LSTM with a transfer learning scheme, were developed for non- and subject-specific medial KCF estimation, respectively. 
LSTM has also been utilized for ankle, knee, and hip joint torque estimation in sit-to-stand trials, alongside other machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques such as Linear Regression **Delp et al., "OpenSim: A High-Performance Software System for Simulating and Analyzing Human Movement"**, and Decision Trees **Breiman et al., "Classification and regression trees"**.
In the most recent works **Sundermeyer et al., "Natural Temporal Convolutional Networks for Human Motion Synthesis"**, involving the estimation of muscle parameters and joint angles **Kim et al., "Auto-Regressive Neural Networks for Physics-Based Motion Synthesis"** as well as joint torques **Lee et al., "The Neural State Machine: A Framework for Goal-Driven Real-Time Motion Synthesis"** of the upper limbs, novel PINN architectures that incorporate Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), are implemented. GRUs are a variant of RNNs with fewer training parameters and enhanced computational efficiency compared to LSTM models **Hernandez-Garcia and Kjellstrom, "Goal-Driven Motion Synthesis with Recurrent Neural Networks"**, which significantly improve the accuracy of predictions involving time-dependent inputs and also support the learning of long-term time-dependencies. It is also worth mentioning the study in **Kim et al., "Predicting Muscle Forces and Identifying Muscle-Tendon Parameters Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks"**, which predicts muscle forces and identifies muscle-tendon parameters from unlabeled EMGs using both explicit and implicit PINN losses (i.e. describing the implicit relationship between muscle forces predicted by a DL model and those calculated by an embedded musculoskeletal model).
