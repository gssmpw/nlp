In the motion synthesis area, researchers and developers in the graphics, animation, and gaming industries, dive deeply into both deterministic and probabilistic Deep Learning (DL) motion generation
techniques. These data-driven approaches leverage human motion capture and movement history data (e.g., previous frames or motion states like joint angles) to produce or predict the pose and/or joint trajectories of a 3D humanoid character ____. Especially for deterministic motion synthesis, where the synthesized motion sequence converges to a deterministic pose sequence that regresses towards the mean pose of ground-truth, recurrent architectures like LSTM models ____ for typical motion imitation and RNNs enhanced with phase-functioned networks ____ for scene-aware interactions, are favored. The work in ____, introduces the Neural State Machine (NSM), a framework for goal-driven real-time synthesis of 3D character movements and scene interactions. The NSM consists of a gating network and an RNN motion prediction network, where the first accounts for automatic action state transition based on the global phase of the motion signal and the user input (i.e. desired goal). In the subsequent works of the same authors ____, an architecture similar to NSM is employed and enhanced with: i) a local phase feature that exploits the local motion phases of each skeletal segment to dynamically produce their asynchronous motion in character-character, character-object, and character-scene interactions in ____, and ii) a control scheme in ____ for animation layering to produce sophisticated (e.g. martial arts movements) and novel motions based on reference motions, physics-based simulations, input controls, etc.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also been employed for synthesizing human motion sequences ____.

On the contrary, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) ____, Variational Autoencoders ____, Transformers ____, and the state-of-the-art diffusion models for motion generation conditioned on multiple sources (e.g. natural language descriptions and audio) ____, are exploited for probabilistic motion synthesis meaning the construction of all plausible pose sequences of a virtual character based on historical poses and/or control inputs. Probabilistic DL models have the ability to inject stochasticity in the training process, i.e. by fitting a latent distribution to the distribution of the next pose in each invocation, and, hence, increasing the learning capacity of the model.

Motion synthesis works can be used alongside musculoskeletal dynamics estimation approaches (described in Section \ref{sec:Musculoskeletal}) to reflect the human internal state on a 3D humanoid character, thus, providing physics-based solutions. Consequently, works in the physics-based motion synthesis area develop holistic approaches, usually relying on Reinforcement Learning (RL) ____, which account for the data-driven imitation of physically realistic motion sequences conditioned on physical parameters such as joint velocities, forces, torques, etc. It is worth mentioning the most recent work in ____, where an auto-regressive neural network resembling previous work ____, which incorporates knowledge from the physical attributes of exerted human force and perceived resistance, was applied to model variations in human movements while interacting with objects and, thus, enhancing realism.

Nevertheless, even though great steps are made towards more realistic computer graphics character animation, all the aforementioned methods and the ones referenced in Section \ref{sec:Musculoskeletal}, focus on modeling the active state of human motion. Fatigued motion using DL has received little to no attention in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, only one work, the one in ____, attempts fatigue-driven animation, using RL methods for controlled motion imitation, and the Three-Compartment Controller (3CC) state machine to model torque-based fatigue.
