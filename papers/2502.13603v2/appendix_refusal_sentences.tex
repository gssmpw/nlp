\section{Keyword Matching for Refusal Analysis}\label{app:refusal_sentences}

Keyword matching, while a practical tool for assessing refusal behaviors in large-scale language models, has inherent limitations. One major issue is its sensitivity to specific phrasing, which can result in misleading conclusions about a model's refusal tendencies. For instance, a model frequently starting its responses with "I'm sorry" may be categorized as overly refusing, even if its actual behavior demonstrates an ability to address safe prompts appropriately.

    \caption{Refusal Keywords Count in OR-Bench-Hard}
    \label{fig:keywords-hard}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:keywords-80k} and \ref{fig:keywords-hard} illustrate these points by displaying the frequency of selected refusal keywords in responses from the OR-Bench-80K and OR-Bench-Hard datasets. It's displayed the main 20 keywords of the biggest aligned Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct in a logarithmic scale for a better visualization. The variability and volatility in keyword usage across models suggests that keyword matching alone cannot fully capture the nuances of refusal behavior.
