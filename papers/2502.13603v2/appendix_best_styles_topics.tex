\section{Generalization to Specific Attack Styles and Harmful Topics}\label{app:harder_topics_all_models}

Section \S\ref{subsec:results_styles_topics} contains a study on which jailbreaking styles and harmful topics are easier to generalize to. This Appendix contains results for all tested models, which shows a significant variance for attack styles. \ie The most challenging styles differ among models, regardless of size and family.
