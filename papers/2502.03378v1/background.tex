\section{RPKI Overview} \label{sec:background}

%{\bf BGP announcements.} 
Routers use BGP packets to exchange reachability information with their neighbors. A BGP announcement includes an IP prefix and the AS path to that prefix, with the source AS always located at the end of the path, typically denoted as a tuple of (AS, prefix, path). %External BGP routers receive announcements from their neighbors, such as providers, customers, or peers. 
After processing a BGP announcement, the router prepends its AS number to the AS path and forwards it to the next hop.
%Generally, routers prefer the longest prefix and the shortest path in their routing tables.
%We denote a BGP announcement/route as a (AS, prefix, AS\_path) tuple.

{\bf Prefix/BGP hijacks.} Prefix/BGP hijacks occur when an AS announces routes for a prefix it does not legitimately own. The attacker can launch a subprefix hijack by announcing a more specific prefix of the victim's, or a prefix hijack by announcing the same prefix as the victim's.
When routers accept the bogus announcements, they redirect traffic through the hijacking network, enabling the attacker to eavesdrop on communication, blackhole hijacked traffic, or engage in other hostile activities like spamming \cite{ballani2007study,vervier2015mind,vervier2013spamtracer}.
A single prefix hijack refers to the announcement of a specific prefix by an individual hijacking AS, while a hijacking event typically involves a series of hijacks launched by the perpetrator AS.

{\bf RPKI.} The goal of RPKI is to provide authenticated information on prefix ownership on the Internet, which routers can use for making routing decisions in BGP. %According to RFC6481 \cite{rfc6481}, RPKI contains repositories hosted on hierarchically organized publication points. The publication points are operated either in a hosted mode, e.g., by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) AfriNIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC, and RIPE, or in a delegated mode by an owner AS. 
A publication point keeps a finite set of signed authorizations, called ROAs \cite{rfc6480}. % and also contains signed certificates (which point to children publication points), certificate revocation lists (CRLs), and manifests. The signatures are generated using RSA PKCS\#1 v1.5 with SHA-256, as defined in RFC4055 \cite{rfc4055}. 
Each ROA binds IP address blocks to owner ASes via cryptographic signatures and is signed by the secret signing key of the owner of the publication point. %The signatures are precomputed ahead of time and are stored in the repository at the publication point. The publication point can be operated by entirely different organizations than the owner of ROAs for its prefix; for instance, in the hosted RPKI mode the operator is the RIR. Each RIR owns its own root certificate and publication points. 
RPKI facilitates many mechanisms, including the filtering of bogus announcements with Route Origin Validation (ROV) or path validation mechanisms, such as \cite{aspa,rsc,rfc8205}.

{\bf Route Origin Validation (ROV).}\label{sc:rov:validation}
RPKI-based route origin validation, that is ROV, defined in RFC6483 \cite{huston2012validation}, allows BGP routers to verify whether an incoming BGP announcement conforms to ROAs. 
To perform ROV, an AS requires a relying party software installed on a local cache machine to periodically fetch resource certificates and ROA objects from RPKI repositories and validate ROAs. The validated ROAs are cached, and are retrieved by the routers over an RTR protocol for making routing decisions in BGP. 
Given a BGP announcement, the validation proceeds by checking if (1) the IP prefix in the ROA covers the prefix in the BGP announcement, (2) the AS number in the ROA is the same as the origin AS in the BGP announcement, and (3) the prefix length in the BGP announcement is smaller or equivalent to the MaxLength parameter in the ROA. A border router that receives a BGP announcement ($p$, $l$, A) for prefix $p$ with prefix length $l$ from AS A, checks if it has a ROA ($p*$, $l*$, A*) for prefix $p*$ from AS A*, such that: $p*$ covers $p$, A* and A are equivalent, and max length $l* \geq l$. If so, the result of ROV for ($p$, $l$, A) is valid. Otherwise, invalid.
%If these three conditions hold, the BGP announcement is valid, and otherwise is invalid.
If no matching ROA can be found, the status of the BGP announcement is then set as unknown.
