\title{Efficient Randomized Experiments Using Foundation Models}

\begin{abstract}
Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with substantial uncertainty. On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the \emph{standard} estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20\% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone\footnote{See our GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/jaabmar/HAIPW}.}.

\section{Conclusion}
We introduce \ours, a novel estimator that improves the efficiency of randomized experiments by integrating predictions from multiple foundation models. Our empirical results demonstrate that $\ours$ improves precision, especially in sample-constrained settings, without compromising validity of the inference. This approach holds significant promise in fields such as medicine, where leveraging well-curated foundation models could substantially lower the costs of clinical trials. However, a key limitation of $\ours$ is its reliance on the  underlying foundation models: achieving meaningful gains in precision requires these models to be accurate and well-aligned with the experimental domain of interest.
