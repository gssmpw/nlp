abstract = {Jetstream2 will be a category I production cloud resource that is part of the National Science Foundation's Innovative HPC Program the project's aim is to accelerate science and engineering by providing "on-demand"programmable infrastructure built around a core system at Indiana University and four regional sites. Jetstream2 is an evolution of the Jetstream platform, which functions primarily as an Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud the lessons learned in cloud architecture, distributed storage, and container orchestration have inspired changes in both hardware and software for Jetstream2 these lessons have wide implications as institutions converge HPC and cloud technology while building on prior work when deploying their own cloud environments. Jetstream2's next-generation hardware, robust open-source software, and enhanced virtualization will provide a significant platform to further cloud adoption within the US research and education communities.},

abstract = {Jetstream will be the first production cloud resource supporting general science and engineering research within the XD ecosystem. In this report we describe the motivation for proposing Jetstream, the configuration of the Jetstream system as funded by the NSF, the team that is implementing Jetstream, and the communities we expect to use this new system. Our hope and plan is that Jetstream, which will become available for production use in 2016, will aid thousands of researchers who need modest amounts of computing power interactively. The implementation of Jetstream should increase the size and disciplinary diversity of the US research community that makes use of the resources of the XD ecosystem.},

@article{Stewart2016,
abstract = {Jetstream is a first-of-a-kind system for the NSF - a distributed production cloud resource. The NSF awarded funds to create Jetstream in November 2014. Here we review the purpose for creating Jetstream, present the acceptance test results that define Jetstream's key characteristics, describe our experiences in standing up an OpenStack-based cloud environment, and share some of the early scientific results that have been obtained by researchers and students using this system. Jetstream offers unique capability within the XSEDE-supported US national cyberinfrastructure, delivering interactive virtual machines (VMs) via the Atmosphere interface developed by the University of Arizona. As a multi-region deployment that operates as a single integrated system, Jetstream is proving effective in supporting modes and disciplines of research traditionally underrepresented on larger XSEDE-supported clusters and supercomputers. Already, researchers in biology, network science, economics, earth science, and computer science have used Jetstream to perform research -much of it research in the "long tail of science.".},

@article{Towns2014,
abstract = {Computing in science and engineering is now ubiquitous: digital technologies underpin, accelerate, and enable new, even transformational, research in all domains. Access to an array of integrated and well-supported high-end digital services is critical for the advancement of knowledge. Driven by community needs, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project substantially enhances the productivity of a growing community of scholars, researchers, and engineers (collectively referred to as 'scientists" throughout this article) through access to advanced digital services that support open research. XSEDE's integrated, comprehensive suite of advanced digital services federates with other high-end facilities and with campus-based resources, serving as the foundation for a national e-science infrastructure ecosystem. XSEDE's e-science infrastructure has tremendous potential for enabling new advancements in research and education. XSEDE's vision is a world of digitally enabled scholars, researchers, and engineers participating in multidisciplinary collaborations to tackle society's grand challenges.},
