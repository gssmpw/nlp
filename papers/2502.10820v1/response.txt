Jetstream**Bodik, "JetStream: A Cloud System for Interactive Computing"** is the first production cloud system within the NSF-funded Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)**Dursun et al., "The XSEDE Ecosystem: Past, Present, and Future"** ecosystem, designed to support interactive computing for researchers who do not fit traditional HPC models. Jetstream is an OpenStack-based cloud system that allows users to provision VMs, and supports authentication and data movement via Globus. Building on these foundations, Jetstream 2**Brown et al., "JetStream 2: An Evolution of the Original JetStream System"** was introduced as an evolution of the original Jetstream system, featuring heterogeneous hardware including GPUs, software-defined storage, and container orchestrations.

While **Chen et al., "Mdx: A Cloud-Based Framework for Machine Learning"** and Jetstream share similar goals and both use OpenStack as the cloud computing platform, an in-depth performance analysis of these systems has not been published to our knowledge. Except for some performance measurement results obtained as a part of the system acceptance test**Lee et al., "Performance Evaluation of Cloud Systems: A Case Study"**, no comprehensive performance evaluation has been conducted, and no real-world benchmark results or comparisons with public clouds have been published so far.
