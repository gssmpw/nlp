\section{Related Work}
Jetstream~\cite{Stewart2015} is the first production cloud system within the NSF-funded Extreme
Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)~\cite{Towns2014} ecosystem, designed to
support interactive computing for researchers who do not fit traditional HPC models. Jetstream is an
OpenStack-based cloud system that allows users to provision VMs, and supports authentication and
data movement via Globus. Building on these foundations, Jetstream 2~\cite{Hancock2021} was
introduced as an evolution of the original Jetstream system, featuring heterogeneous hardware
including GPUs, software-defined storage, and container orchestrations.

While \mdx{} and Jetstream share similar goals and both use OpenStack as the cloud computing
platform, an in-depth performance analysis of these systems has not been published to our knowledge.
Except for some performance measurement results obtained as a part of the system acceptance
test~\cite{Stewart2016}, no comprehensive performance evaluation has been conducted, and no
real-world benchmark results or comparisons with public clouds have been published so far.
