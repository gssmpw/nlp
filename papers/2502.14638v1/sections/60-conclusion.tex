\section{Conclusion}

We introduce a reasoning dataset \dataname and a novel framework \modelname with detailed visual reasoning and knowledge retrieval for image \geoloc. Evaluated with relatively small backbone models, \modelname is highly accurate by using the reasoning chains of human experts, providing interpretable, verifiable evidence that a downstream user can use to validate its predictions. Future work could include detailed annotations to images more than street views, expanding more tools to improve finer-grained predictions, and using interpretable reasoning to assist \geoloc applications.
