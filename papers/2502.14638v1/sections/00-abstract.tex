Image \geoloc is the task of predicting the specific location of an image and requires complex reasoning across visual, geographical, and cultural contexts. While prior Vision Language Models (\textsc{vlm}s) have the best accuracy at this task, there is a dearth of high-quality datasets and models for analytical reasoning.  We first create \dataname, a high-quality dataset derived from GeoGuessr, a popular geography game, to supply examples of expert reasoning from language. Using this dataset, we present \modelname, a comprehensive image \geoloc framework integrating global and fine-grained image information. By reasoning with language, \modelname reduces the average distance error by 14\% compared to previous state-of-the-art models while requiring fewer than $1000$ training samples. Our dataset and code will be available at \url{https://github.com/SparrowZheyuan18/Navig/}.
