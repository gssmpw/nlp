The study of food pairing has evolved beyond subjective expertise with the advent of machine learning. This paper presents FlavorDiffusion, a novel framework leveraging diffusion models to predict food-chemical interactions and ingredient pairings without relying on chromatography. By integrating graph-based embeddings \cite{Perozzi2014}, diffusion processes \cite{Ho2020, Song2021, Sun2023}, and chemical property encoding \cite{Azambuja2023}, FlavorDiffusion addresses data imbalances and enhances clustering quality. Using a heterogeneous graph derived from datasets like Recipe1M \cite{Marin2019} and FlavorDB, our model demonstrates superior performance in reconstructing ingredient-ingredient relationships. The addition of a Chemical Structure Prediction (CSP) layer further refines the embedding space, achieving state-of-the-art NMI scores and enabling meaningful discovery of novel ingredient combinations. The proposed framework represents a significant step forward in computational gastronomy, offering scalable, interpretable, and chemically informed solutions for food science.
