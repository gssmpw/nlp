\section{Conclusion}
This study introduced FlavorDiffusion, a diffusion model-based framework for predicting ingredient pairings and chemical interactions. The model’s capability to integrate chemical fingerprints and optimize graph embeddings resulted in improved clustering quality and predictive accuracy. Experiments revealed that the inclusion of the CSP layer significantly enhanced the representation of food-chemical relationships, achieving the highest NMI scores across various configurations. The progressive nature of the diffusion process further demonstrated the model’s ability to generalize, enabling the inference of novel ingredient combinations. By aligning culinary and chemical properties, FlavorDiffusion offers a robust tool for advancing food pairing discovery, with applications in flavor design and computational gastronomy. Future work will aim to expand dataset coverage, integrate multi-modal data, and explore new graph-sampling techniques to further enrich food science research.
