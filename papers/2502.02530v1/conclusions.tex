\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sec:conclusions}
This paper initiated the study on the asymmetric generalization of the Max-Min
Diversification problem, denoted as AMMD, which does not appear to have been
studied before. We provided an approximation algorithm with an approximation
factor of $\frac{1}{6k}$ and running time equivalent to matrix multiplication
with logarithmic factors. In practice, \algbacb{} outperformed all the baselines, returning optimal result in most of the cases,
while having pratical running times, and having theoretical guarantees.

Regarding the hardness of approximation, we leave it
as an open question whether one can improve the $\frac{1}{2}+\epsilon$
inapproximability result that follows from MMD, which is the restriction of
AMMD to symmetric distances. There is a large gap between our approximation
ratio and the inapproximability bound, and it would be interesting for future
work to narrow down the gap.
For example, by designing a constant-factor approximation algorithm for AMMD or showing that no such algorithm exists under reasonable assumptions.
