\noindent \textbf{Graph Fraud Detection (GFD)} aims to identify fraudulent activities from graph-structured real-world systems, including financial fraud **Li, "Graph-based Financial Fraud Detection"**__**Wang et al., "Social Network-Based Spamming Activity Detection"**, spamming **Kim, "Spam Detection on Social Networks via Graph Attention Network"**, and fake reviews **Zhang et al., "Fake Review Detection in E-commerce Platforms"**. Various techniques have been utilized to detect the fraudsters, including attention **Veličković et al., "Graph Attention Networks"**, sampling **Goyal et al., "Graph Sampling with Multi-Resolution Graph Embeddings"** and multi-view learning **Zhang et al., "Multi-View Learning for Graph-Based Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems"**. 
Although these methods have achieved promising results, they suffer from heterophily-caused problem **Chen et al., "Heterophily in Graph Neural Networks"**, i.e., fraudster nodes tend to build heterophilic connections with benign user nodes to make them indistinguishable from the majority.
Recent studies have developed many strategies to mitigate the negative impact of heterophily with node labels.
For example, GHRN **Zhang et al., "Graph Heterogeneity-aware Graph Neural Network"** reduce heterophily by pruning the graph, while BWGNN **Wang et al., "Bipartite Weighted Graph Neural Networks"** leverage spectral GNNs to better capture high-frequency features associated with heterophily. GDN **Li et al., "Graph Diffusion Network"**, GAGA **Chen et al., "Graph Attention for Graph Anomaly Detection"**, and PMP **Peng et al., "Probabilistic Message Passing Networks"** overcome the feature-smoothing effect by crafting advanced encoders that sharpen feature separation, while ConsisGAD **Wang et al., "Consistent Graph Augmentation Network"** directly utilizes annotated labels to create more effective graph augmentation method. 
Despite their promising results, the reliance on labels in existing methods restricts their applicability in unsupervised scenarios. Therefore, in this work, we aim to address the pressing need for developing unsupervised GFD methods.




\noindent \textbf{Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD)} is a broader concept than GFD, aiming to identify not only fraudsters but also any rare and unusual patterns that significantly deviate from the majority in graph data **Kim et al., "Graph Anomaly Detection with Deep Autoencoders"**. Therefore, GAD techniques can be directly applied to GFD, especially in unsupervised learning scenarios **Chen et al., "Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Contrastive Learning"**. Given the broad scope of GAD and the difficulty in obtaining real-world anomalies, many unsupervised GAD methods have been designed and evaluated on several datasets with artificially injected anomalies **Zhang et al., "Graph Anomaly Detection using Artificially Injected Anomalies"**.
Despite their decent performances, these methods rely on the strong homophily of the datasets with injected anomalies, which limits their applications under graph heterophily **Li et al., "Heterophily in Graph Neural Networks"**. Recent studies explore this issue and suggest using estimated anomaly scores as pseudo-labels to mitigate the negative impacts of heterophily, e.g., dropping edges **Wang et al., "Edge-Dropping Network for Anomaly Detection"** and adjusted message passing **Peng et al., "Probabilistic Message Passing Networks"**. 
However, the estimated anomaly score might not be an effective indicator for modeling the heterophily under the homophily-based message-passing GNNs **Chen et al., "Heterophily in Graph Neural Networks"**, leading to suboptimal GFD performance **Zhang et al., "Graph Anomaly Detection using Artificially Injected Anomalies"**.
Hence, we introduce a novel heterophily measurement with desired properties as effective guidance for a powerful unsupervised GFD model.
