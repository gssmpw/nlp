An important BA extension is Chen's COOL ____, which he recently refined in ____. COOL extends a binary BA protocol that optimally ____ tolerates $t < \frac{n}{3}$ failures with $\Theta(nt)$ bits of communication (e.g.\ ____) into a BA protocol for $\ell$-bit inputs that tolerates $t < \frac{n}{3}$ failures with $\Theta(\ell n + nt)$ bits of communication. Note that $\Theta(\ell n + nt)$ here is also optimal due to the Dolev-Reischuk bound ____.

An ``ideal'' asynchronous BA extension would match COOL. Such an extension would \begin{itemize}
    \item extend an underlying binary BA protocol by running it only once, 
    \item have a constant round overhead and a $\BO(\ell n + nt)$ communication overhead,
    \item tolerate $t < \frac{n}{3}$ failures with perfect security.
\end{itemize}

Like all prior works, we do not reach this ideal. However, we progress towards it by designing an ``incomplete'' extension $\ext$ for asynchronous BA. This extension is based on asynchronous data dissemination (ADD) ____ and on weak agreement, which is a weakening of BA where the parties agree on their common input if they have one, and otherwise for some bitstring $v$ each output either $v$ or $\bot$. Against $t < \frac{n}{3}$ byzantine failures, $\ext$ reduces BA on $\ell$-bit inputs to one instance of binary BA, one instance of WA on $\ell$-bit inputs, a constant number of additional rounds and $\Theta(\ell n + n^2)$ bits of additional communication. Thus, $\ext$ effectively reduces extending BA to achieving multivalued WA, usefully so in this paper, and perhaps also in future work towards the ideal.

We follow $\ext$ with two new efficient information-theoretic WA protocols named $\wa_1$ and $\wa_2$. The former achieves statistical security against $t < \frac{n}{3}$ failures except with probability $2^{-\lambda}$ with $\Theta(n^2(\lambda + \log n + \log \ell))$ bits of communication, and for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$ the latter achieves perfect security against $t \leq \frac{n}{3 + \varepsilon}$ failures with $\Theta(\ell n + n^2)$ bits of communication. These WA protocols are why we call our extensions $\ext + \wa_1$ and $\ext + \wa_2$ in Table \ref{comparisons}: These extensions are $\ext$ respectively instantiated with $\wa_1$ and $\wa_2$. By combining $\ext$ with our WA protocols, which to our knowledge are not \nolinebreak matched in the literature, we extend a binary BA protocol into a multivalued one by running it only once, with a constant round overhead and a quadratic-in-$n$ communication \nolinebreak overhead.

Among perfectly secure asynchronous BA extensions, our $\ext + \wa_2$ improves upon A-COOL (asynchronous COOL) by Li and Chen ____. While A-COOL achieves the communication complexity $\Theta(\ell n + \mathcal{A}(1) + nt)$ against $t < \frac{n}{5}$ failures, our $\ext + \wa_2$ achieves the communication complexity $\Theta(\ell n + \mathcal{A}(1) + n^2)$ against $t \leq \frac{n}{3 + \varepsilon}$ failures for any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, advancing the state of the art \nolinebreak for \nolinebreak $t \geq \frac{n}{5}$. 

Meanwhile, our $\ext + \wa_1$ is the most efficient information-theoretic asynchronous BA extension we know for $t \approx \frac{n}{3}$. Against $t < \frac{n}{3}$ failures, it achieves statistical security except with probability $2^{-\lambda}$ with $\BO(\ell n + n^2(\lambda + \log n))$ bits of overhead communication, matching in terms of communication complexity the cryptographic extension by Nayak, Ren, Shi, Vaidya and Xiang ____.

Another extension worth noting is the one Chen published very recently ____, which matches the ideal except for its communication complexity $\Theta(\ell n + n^3\log n)$. Compared to our $\ext + \wa_2$, this extension is less efficient if $t \leq \frac{n}{3 + \varepsilon}$ for any constant $\varepsilon > 0$, though it is more efficient if $n - 3t = \BO(1)$. Before it, the most efficient perfectly secure extension for $t < \frac{n}{3}$ failures required $\Theta(\ell n + n^4\log n)$ bits of overhead communication, and involved $2n$ executions of a binary BA protocol ____.

Some binary BA protocols that pair well with our extensions are the one in ____, which achieves statistical security against $t \leq \frac{n}{3 + \varepsilon}$  static corruptions (that occur before protocol execution) with $\widetilde{\Theta}(n^2)$ communication, and the one in ____, which given an ideal coin (which lets the parties obtain common random bits) achieves perfect security against $t < \frac{n}{3}$ adaptive corruptions with $\Theta(n^2)$ expected communication and $\Theta(1)$ expected rounds. Notably, $\ext + \wa_2$ extends the former into a multivalued BA protocol with $\Theta(\ell n + n^2\mathsf{polylog}(n))$ communication without any loss of security.
