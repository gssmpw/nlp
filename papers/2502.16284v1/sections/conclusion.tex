\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we explore pre-training molecular 3D representations beyond classical mechanics. By leveraging the correlation between molecular energy level structures and molecular spectra in quantum mechanics, we introduce molecular spectra for pre-training molecular 3D representations (\themodel). 
% We propose a multi-spectrum encoder, SpecFormer, trained under a masked patch reconstruction objective. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive objective to align 3D representations with spectral information, enhancing the informativeness of the resulting 3D representations. 
By aligning the 3D encoder trained with a denoising objective and the spectrum encoder trained with a masked patch reconstruction objective, we enhance the informativeness and transferability of the resulting 3D representations.
% Through extensive experiments on downstream datasets, we validate the effectiveness of \themodel and its key components.
