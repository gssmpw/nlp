FSOD methods____ are designed to identify and classify novel objects with limited data. With two learning strategies: Meta-learning-based FSOD methods, ____ and ____ generating distinct features by adjusting the weights of query and support features. ____ enhance feature representation through various techniques, including max-margin optimization, data augmentation; Transfer learning-based FSOD approaches____ focus on efficiently leveraging foundational knowledge. TFA____ freezes most network layers during the fine-tuning phase, DeFRCN____ introduces gates to modulate gradients across modules. ____ utilizes hierarchical information by employing augmentation strategies through language models for feature enhancement.
 

With limited data samples in computer vision tasks, a branch of approaches tends to synthesize additional data by utilizing generative models. Some approaches ____ have demonstrated the ability to generate images with a provided prior structure via bounding boxes, masks, etc. Power-Paint ____, with its context-aware image inpainting, enables the regeneration of new objects while maintaining context and background in the identified region via a bounding box. ____ utilize the power of synthesis data by diffusion model and adapter module for FSOD problems. ____ combine a copy-paste pipeline and Stable Diffusion ____ in the data generation process. The new novel instances were selected and pasted in the random backgrounds from the base class sets. ____ integrate ControlNet to generate visual priors and CLIP Rank for filtering synthetic samples. However, these methods do not comprehensively exploit aspects of data augmentation. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to thoroughly explore the primary aspects of data synthesis.
