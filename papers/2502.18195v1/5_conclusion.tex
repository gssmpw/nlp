\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a novel multi-perspective data augmentation framework that enhances few-shot object detection by addressing the challenges of sample diversity and representativeness. Our approach effectively leverages \blue{in-context learning} for object synthesis and incorporates a harmonic prompt aggregation scheduler to create challenging novel samples, while also improving the representation of foreground-background relationships through our Background Proposal method. Extensive experiments on several FSOD benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC, demonstrate the significant advantages of our framework over state-of-the-art methods. 

% In the future, we plan to integrate advanced generative models to improve the variety and realism of synthetic samples, particularly in more complex environments. Additionally, we aim to refine the background proposal method to include dynamic backgrounds, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to varying contexts. Finally, we envision extending our framework to other areas of computer vision, such as instance segmentation and video object detection, to assess its versatility and impact across a broader range of tasks.
