We introduce \textbf{FreeBlend}, a novel, training-free approach that effectively blends concepts to generate new objects through feedback interpolation and auxiliary inference. Unlike previous methods such as TEXTUAL~\citep{melzi2023does}, which often suffer from category-specific bias, or Composable Diffusion~\citep{liu2022compositional}, which tends to generate outputs with co-occurring subjects, FreeBlend provides a more robust solution. Additionally, methods like MagicMix~\citep{liew2022magicmix} rely on the structural similarity between the reference and blending concepts, often resulting in unstable blending outcomes. In contrast, FreeBlend consistently produces visually coherent and harmonious blends, setting a new benchmark for state-of-the-art blending techniques.
