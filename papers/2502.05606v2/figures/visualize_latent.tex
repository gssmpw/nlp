\caption{Visualization of our staged denoising process. From the image, we can observe the effects of the three stages. From the start to \( t_s \), the image establishes the basic layout of the blending. During the blending stage, both the blending latent and the auxiliary latents are iteratively updated. Finally, in the refinement stage, the quality of the blended image is significantly improved. }
