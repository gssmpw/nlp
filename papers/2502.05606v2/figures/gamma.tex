\caption{Ablation study on the impact of \( \gamma \). The results show that, in the first row, better blending is achieved on the left side, while the right side appears more spliced. In the second row, both sides exhibit a more visually appealing effect. The blending process, however, is inherently subjective, and users can adjust the parameter \( \gamma \) to tailor the output according to their preferences. By modulating \( \gamma \), users control the contribution of each concept, optimizing performance and addressing associated biases.}
