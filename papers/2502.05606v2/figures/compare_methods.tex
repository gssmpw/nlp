 The visualized results highlight the superiority of our approach over other methods. We provide a qualitative comparison of our method with three typical concept blending techniques: TEXTUAL~\citep{melzi2023does}, Composable Diffusion~\citep{liu2022compositional} and MagicMix~\citep{liew2022magicmix}. For each method and pair, three images are presented. Compared to other methods, which suffer from rigid splicing, discordant compositions, or bias towards one concept, our method excels at seamlessly integrating the features of different concepts into a cohesive new object.
