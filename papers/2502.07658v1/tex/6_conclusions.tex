\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we introduce a new paradigm of interest unit-based recommendation algorithms, IU4Rec, aimed at optimizing recommendation performance on C2C platforms and better capturing user-product interactions. 
We construct interest units based on product attributes and user needs, and redefine the product interaction interface to let the interaction remain on the interest unit and product at the same time. Furthermore, we implement the IU-Boosted Network to improve CTR prediction, IU4Rec effectively addresses the challenge of utilizing behavior data from sold-out products and tackles the limited-stock issue inherent to our C2C platform.
The proposed IU4Rec has been proven effective through experiments and online A/B testing and is now fully deployed on the Xianyu Platform, enhancing the experience for millions of users daily.

Although this study primarily focuses on the C2C platform, the above practice can be easily extended to other platforms. Consequently, we hope that the proposed IU4Rec paradigm can offer valuable insights to researchers and practitioners in the field of recommendation systems.
