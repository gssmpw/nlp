abstract = {Semantic segmentation in low-contrast images is a challenging problem due to the ambiguous boundary of the segmented target and indistinguishable noise. Current models generally segment the target with local features, which leads to the lack of structural information, which reduces the performance. And they directly fuse multi-scale features to keep details, while it may integrate noise into the fused features. These problems reduce the performance of segmentation in the low-contrast image. To solve the above issues, we propose an image semantic segmentation model called Low-Contrast Segmentation Net (LCSeg-Net). The model enhances the structural information with the global context and reduces the noise of the fused features through the adaptive fusion way. Meanwhile, to improve the robustness of LCSeg-Net, we augment the low-frequency spectrum of the fused feature in the training phase. Extensive experiments are conducted on the five public datasets. Results show the proposed model achieves the best comprehensive performance in the low-contrast image.}

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",
