\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose \method{}, a global-regional nested weather forecasting framework leveraging multi-scale graph neural networks. By integrating dynamical systems principles with multi-grid structures, our approach refines target regions for improved capture of high-frequency features and extreme events. The adaptive information propagation mechanism, featuring dynamic gating units, mitigates over-smoothing and enhances node-edge feature representation. Additionally, the proposed neural nested grid method preserves global information for regional forecasts, effectively relieves the loss of boundary information, which improves the regional forecast performance. Empirical results show that the proposed \method{} achieves higher prediction accuracy at global and regional scales, especially for long-term and extreme event predictions, marking a step towards more robust data-driven weather forecasting.
