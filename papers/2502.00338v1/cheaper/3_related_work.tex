\section{Related Work}
\subsection{Deep Learning based Weather Forecasting}
\textbf{Global Weather Forecasting.} Global weather forecasting has seen significant progress with deep learning models. FourCastNet, based on Fourier neural operators, provides global forecasts comparable to traditional numerical methods like IFS, but at much higher speeds~\cite{pathak2022fourcastnet}. Pangu, utilizing the Swin Transformer, exceeds NWP methods, incorporating earth-specific location embeddings for better performance~\cite{bi2023accurate}. The Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) extends Fourier methods using spherical harmonics, offering more stable long-term predictions~\cite{bonev2023spherical}. FuXi focuses on long-term forecasting, achieving a 15-day forecasts comparable to ECMWF~\cite{chen2023fuxi}. GraphCast leverages message-passing networks to improve efficiency and forecasting accuracy~\cite{lam2023learning}, and GenCast builds on this to enhance ensemble forecasting~\cite{price2023gencast}. Further, diffusion models like those in~\cite{li2024generative} generate probabilistic ensembles by sampling, while NeuralGCM~\cite{kochkov2024neural} focuses on atmospheric circulation with a dynamic core, offering climate simulation capabilities but at higher training and inference costs. 

\textbf{Regional Weather Forecasting.} The goal of regional weather forecasting is to enhance local prediction accuracy with high-resolution models. CorrDiff~\cite{mardani2023generative} combines U-Net and diffusion models to improve local forecasts. MetaWeather~\cite{kim2024metaweather} adapts global forecasts to regional contexts using meta-learning. GNNs are also widely applied in regional forecasting, with Graphcast~\cite{lam2023learning} enhancing accuracy by modeling complex spatial dependencies. MetNet-3~\cite{espeholt2022deep} offers high-accuracy forecasts for weather variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and wind speed, at 2-minute intervals and 1â€“4 km resolution, outperforming traditional models like HRRR. NowcastNet~\cite{zhang2023skilful} and DGMR~\cite{ravuri2021skilful} excel in short-term extreme precipitation forecasts using deep generative models and radar data. In spatiotemporal prediction, NMO~\cite{wu2024neural} models the evolution of physical dynamics, providing new insights for local weather forecasting. Similarly, SimVP~\cite{gao2022simvp} and PastNet~\cite{wu2024pastnet} achieve good results in forecasting local precipitation evolution using spatiotemporal convolution methods.
    
% Despite these advances, none of these methods effectively address the challenge of balancing global and regional high-resolution forecasts or capturing the fine-grained, dynamic interactions important for extreme event prediction.
    
\subsection{Numerical analysis methods}
Multigrid methods~\cite{mccormick1987multigrid,wesseling1995introduction,hackbusch2013multi,bramble2019multigrid,hiptmair1998multigrid,brandt1983multigrid,borzi2009multigrid} and nested grid strategies~\cite{miyakoda1977one,zhang2012nested,sullivan1996grid} are widely used to solve PDEs and handle multi-scale problems~\cite{debreu2008two,xue2000advanced}. Multigrid methods use grids of different resolutions to transfer information and accelerate iterations. They efficiently solve large-scale problems and improve computational accuracy. By eliminating low-frequency errors on coarse grids and high-frequency errors on fine grids, multigrid methods effectively handle error convergence at different scales~\cite{he2019mgnet,he2023mgno,shao2022fast}. Nested grid strategies embed higher-resolution fine grids into regions of interest based on a global coarse grid to capture local complex physical phenomena in detail. In weather forecasting, this method provides large-scale background fields on a global scale while refining the grid for target regions to accurately simulate the evolution of local weather systems and the occurrence of extreme events~\cite{bacon2000dynamically}. 

% Our proposed neural nested grid method helps address challenges like boundary information loss in regional forecasting and multi-scale feature capture.
