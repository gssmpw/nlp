\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we firstly propose a new M-VAE task and a constructed instruction dataset, making a significant contribution to future research on abnormal events. Secondly, we propose a Global-local Spatial-sensitive LLM named Sherlock to assist in localizing and extracting abnormal event quadruples. This model includes a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE module and Spatial Imbalance Regular to model and balance spatial information. In the end, our experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of Sherlock. In future work, we hope to consider the relationships between events and enrich our tasks with event inference to improve the performance of extraction. In addition, we also hope to improve the interpretability of our model by providing explanations for each abnormal event.
